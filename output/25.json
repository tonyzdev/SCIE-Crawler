    "abstract": "This whitepaper proposes OpenFlow: a way for researchers to run experimental protocols in the networks they use every day. OpenFlow is based on an Ethernet switch, with an internal flow-table, and a standardized interface to add and remove flow entries. Our goal is to encourage networking vendors to add OpenFlow to their switch products for deployment in college campus backbones and wiring closets. We believe that OpenFlow is a pragmatic compromise: on one hand, it allows researchers to run experiments on heterogeneous switches in a uniform way at line-rate and with high port-density; while on the other hand, vendors do not need to expose the internal workings of their switches. In addition to allowing researchers to evaluate their ideas in real-world traffic settings, OpenFlow could serve as a useful campus component in proposed large-scale testbeds like GENI. Two buildings at Stanford University will soon run OpenFlow networks, using commercial Ethernet switches and routers. We will work to encourage deployment at other schools; and We encourage you to consider deploying OpenFlow in your university network too",

    "abstract": "An ad-hoc network is the cooperative engagement of a collection of Mobile Hosts without the required intervention of any centralized Access Point. In this paper we present an innovative design for the operation of such ad-hoc networks. The basic idea of the design is to operate each Mobile Host as a specialized router, which periodically advertises its view of the interconnection topology with other Mobile Hosts within the network. This amounts to a new sort of routing protocol. We have investigated modifications to the basic Bellman-Ford routing mechanisms, as specified by RIP [5], to make it suitable for a dynamic and self-starting network mechanism as is required by users wishing to utilize ad hoc networks. Our modifications address some of the previous objections to the use of Bellman-Ford, related to the poor looping properties of such algorithms in the face of broken links and the resulting time dependent nature of the interconnection topology describing the links between the Mobile Hosts. Finally, we describe the ways in which the basic network-layer routing can be modified to provide MAC-layer support for ad-hoc networks.",

    "abstract": "Today's data centers may contain tens of thousands of computers with significant aggregate bandwidth requirements. The network architecture typically consists of a tree of routing and switching elements with progressively more specialized and expensive equipment moving up the network hierarchy. Unfortunately, even when deploying the highest-end IP switches/routers, resulting topologies may only support 50% of the aggregate bandwidth available at the edge of the network, while still incurring tremendous cost. Non-uniform bandwidth among data center nodes complicates application design and limits overall system performance. In this paper, we show how to leverage largely commodity Ethernet switches to support the full aggregate bandwidth of clusters consisting of tens of thousands of elements. Similar to how clusters of commodity computers have largely replaced more specialized SMPs and MPPs, we argue that appropriately architected and interconnected commodity switches may deliver more performance at less cost than available from today's higher-end solutions. Our approach requires no modifications to the end host network interface, operating system, or applications; critically, it is fully backward compatible with Ethernet, IP, and TCP.",

We show that our power-laws fit the real data very well resulting in correlation coefficients of 96% or higher.Our observations provide a novel perspective of the structure of the Internet. The power-laws describe concisely skewed distributions of graph properties such as the node outdegree. In addition, these power-laws can be used to estimate important parameters such as the average neighborhood size, and facilitate the design and the performance analysis of protocols. Furthermore, we can use them to generate and select realistic topologies for simulation purposes.",

In its current form, OpenFlow explicitly specifies protocol headers on which it operates. This set has grown from 12 to 41 fields in a few years, increasing the complexity of the specification while still not providing the flexibility to add new headers. In this paper we propose P4 as a strawman proposal for how OpenFlow should evolve in the future. We have three goals: (1) Reconfigurability in the field: Programmers should be able to change the way switches process packets once they are deployed. (2) Protocol independence: Switches should not be tied to any specific network protocols. (3) Target independence: Programmers should be able to describe packet-processing functionality independently of the specifics of the underlying hardware. As an example, we describe how to use P4 to configure a switch to add a new hierarchical label.",

    "abstract": "In October of '86, the Internet had the first of what became a series of 'congestion collapses'. During this period, the data throughput from LBL to UC Berkeley (sites separated by 400 yards and three IMP hops) dropped from 32 Kbps to 40 bps. Mike Karels 1 and I were fascinated by this sudden factor-of-thousand drop in bandwidth and embarked on an investigation of why things had gotten so bad. We wondered, in particular, if the 4.3BSD (Berkeley UNIX) TCP was mis-behaving or if it could be tuned to work better under abysmal network conditions. The answer to both of these questions was “yes”. Since that time, we have put seven new algorithms into the 4BSD TCP: round-trip-time variance estimation exponential retransmit timer backoff slow-start more aggressive receiver ack policy dynamic window sizing on congestion Karn's clamped retransmit backoff fast retransmit Our measurements and the reports of beta testers suggest that the final product is fairly good at dealing with congested conditions on the Internet. This paper is a brief description of ( i ) - ( v ) and the rationale behind them. ( vi ) is an algorithm recently developed by Phil Karn of Bell Communications Research, described in [KP87]. ( viii ) is described in a soon-to-be-published RFC. Algorithms ( i ) - ( v ) spring from one observation: The flow on a TCP connection (or ISO TP-4 or Xerox NS SPP connection) should obey a 'conservation of packets' principle. And, if this principle were obeyed, congestion collapse would become the exception rather than the rule. Thus congestion control involves finding places that violate conservation and fixing them. By 'conservation of packets' I mean that for a connection 'in equilibrium', i.e., running stably with a full window of data in transit, the packet flow is what a physicist would call 'conservative': A new packet isn't put into the network until an old packet leaves. The physics of flow predicts that systems with this property should be robust in the face of congestion. Observation of the Internet suggests that it was not particularly robust. Why the discrepancy? There are only three ways for packet conservation to fail: The connection doesn't get to equilibrium, or A sender injects a new packet before an old packet has exited, or The equilibrium can't be reached because of resource limits along the path. In the following sections, we treat each of these in turn.",

Using packet-level simulations, we examine various performance and design issues in such protocols. Our analysis leads to a new protocol, MACAW, which uses an RTS-CTS-DS-DATA-ACK message exchange and includes a significantly different backoff algorithm.",

This paper presents Chord , a distributed lookup protocol that addresses this problem. Chord provides support for just one operation: given a key, it maps the key onto a node. Data location can be easily implemented on top of Chord by associating a key with each data item, and storing the key/data item pair at the node to which the key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and leave the system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously changing. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments show that Chord is scalable, with communication cost and the state maintained by each node scaling logarithmically with the number of Chord nodes.",

Accordingly, we first examine the costs of cloud service data centers today. The cost breakdown reveals the importance of optimizing work completed per dollar invested. Unfortunately, the resources inside the data centers often operate at low utilization due to resource stranding and fragmentation. To attack this first problem, we propose (1) increasing network agility, and (2) providing appropriate incentives to shape resource consumption. Second, we note that cloud service providers are building out geo-distributed networks of data centers. Geo-diversity lowers latency to users and increases reliability in the presence of an outage taking out an entire site. However, without appropriate design and management, these geo-diverse data center networks can raise the cost of providing service. Moreover, leveraging geo-diversity requires services be designed to benefit from it. To attack this problem, we propose (1) joint optimization of network and data center resources, and (2) new systems and mechanisms for geo-distributing state.",

The model predicts the bandwidth of a sustained TCP connection subjected to light to moderate packet losses, such as loss caused by network congestion. It assumes that TCP avoids retransmission timeouts and always has sufficient receiver window and sender data. The model predicts the Congestion Avoidance performance of nearly all TCP implementations under restricted conditions and of TCP with Selective Acknowledgements over a much wider range of Internet conditions.We verify the model through both simulation and live Internet measurements. The simulations test several TCP implementations under a range of loss conditions and in environments with both drop-tail and RED queuing. The model is also compared to live Internet measurements using the TReno diagnostic and real TCP implementations.We also present several applications of the model to problems of bandwidth allocation in the Internet. We use the model to analyze networks with multiple congested gateways; this analysis shows strong agreement with prior work in this area. Finally, we present several important implications about the behavior of the Internet in the presence of high load from diverse user communities.",

Most best-effort traffic in the current Internet is well-served by the dominant transport protocol, TCP. However, traffic such as best-effort unicast streaming multimedia could find use for a TCP-friendly congestion control mechanism that refrains from reducing the sending rate in half in response to a single packet drop. With our mechanism, the sender explicitly adjusts its sending rate as a function of the measured rate of loss events, where a loss event consists of one or more packets dropped within a single round-trip time.

ALOHA packet systems were originally described by Abramson (\"The ALOHA System--Another Alternative for Computer Communication,\" Proceedings of the AFIPS Fall Joint Computer Conference, Vol. 37, 1970, pp. 281--285). In an ALOHA a single broadcast channel is shared by a number of communicating devices. In the version originally described by Abramson, every device transmits its packets independent of any other device or any specific time. That is, the device transmits the whole packet at a random point in time; the device then times out for receiving an acknowledgment. If an acknowledgment is not received, it is assumed that a collision occured with a packet transmitted by some other device and the packet is retransmitted after a random additional waiting time (to avoid repeated collisions). Under a certain set of assumptions, Abramson showed that the effective capacity of such a channel is 1/(2e). Roberts in the present paper investigates methods of increasing the effective channel capacity of such a channel. One method he proposes to gain in capacity is to consider the channel to be slotted into segments of time whose duration is equal to the packet transmission time, and to require the devices to begin a packet transmission at the beginning of a time slot. Another method Roberts proposes to gain in capacity is to take advantage of the fact that even though packets from two devices collide in the channel (i.e., they are transmitted so they pass through the channel at overlapping times), it may be possible for the receiver(s) to \"capture\" the signal of one of the transmitters, and thus correctly receive one of the conflicting packets, if one of the transmitters has a sufficiently greater signal than the other. Roberts considers the cases of both satellite and ground radio channels.",

We show how the SDEs can be transformed into a set of Ordinary Differential Equations which can be easily solved numerically. Our solution methodology scales well to a large number of flows. As an application, we model and solve a system where RED is the AQM policy. Our results show excellent agreement with those of similar networks simulated using the well known ns simulator. Our model enables us to get an in-depth understanding of the RED algorithm. Using the tools developed in this paper, we present a critical analysis of the RED algorithm. We explain the role played by the RED configuration parameters on the behavior of the algorithm in a network. We point out a flaw in the RED averaging mechanism which we believe is a cause of tuning problems for RED. We believe this modeling/solution methodology has a great potential in analyzing and understanding various network congestion control algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Network virtualization is a powerful way to run multiple architectures or experiments simultaneously on a shared infrastructure. However, making efficient use of the underlying resources requires effective techniques for virtual network embedding--mapping each virtual network to specific nodes and links in the substrate network. Since the general embedding problem is computationally intractable, past research restricted the problem space to allow efficient solutions, or focused on designing heuristic algorithms. In this paper, we advocate a different approach: rethinking the design of the substrate network to enable simpler embedding algorithms and more efficient use of resources, without restricting the problem space. In particular, we simplify virtual link embedding by: i) allowing the substrate network to split a virtual link over multiple substrate paths and ii) employing path migration to periodically re-optimize the utilization of the substrate network. We also explore node-mapping algorithms that are customized to common classes of virtual-network topologies. Our simulation experiments show that path splitting, path migration,and customized embedding algorithms enable a substrate network to satisfy a much larger mix of virtual networks",

We compare Tahoe and Reno TCP, the two most common reference implementations for TCP, with two modified versions of Reno TCP. The first version is New-Reno TCP, a modified version of TCP without SACK that avoids some of Reno TCP's performance problems when multiple packets are dropped from a window of data. The second version is SACK TCP, a conservative extension of Reno TCP modified to use the SACK option being proposed in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). We describe the congestion control algorithms in our simulated implementation of SACK TCP and show that while selective acknowledgments are not required to solve Reno TCP's performance problems when multiple packets are dropped, the absence of selective acknowledgments does impose limits to TCP's ultimate performance. In particular, we show that without selective acknowledgments, TCP implementations are constrained to either retransmit at most one dropped packet per round-trip time, or to retransmit packets that might have already been successfully delivered.",

The unique feature of our protocol is that it conserves battery power at nodes by intelligently powering off nodes that are not actively transmitting or receiving packets. The manner in which nodes power themselves off does not influence the delay or throughput characteristics of our protocol. We illustrate the power conserving behavior of PAMAS via extensive simulations performed over ad hoc networks containing 10-20 nodes. Our results indicate that power savings of between 10% and 70% are attainable in most systems. Finally, we discuss how the idea of power awareness can be built into other multiaccess protocols as well.",

The first part proposes new guidelines for TCP's response to ECN mechanisms (e.g., Source Quench packets, ECN fields in packet headers). Next, using simulations, we explore the benefits and drawbacks of ECN in TCP/IP networks. Our simulations use RED gateways modified to set an ECN bit in the IP packet header as an indication of congestion, with Reno-style TCP modified to respond to ECN as well as to packet drops as indications of congestion. The simulations show that one advantage of ECN mechanisms is in avoiding unnecessary packet drops, and therefore avoiding unnecessary delay for packets from low-bandwidth delay-sensitive TCP connections. A second advantage of ECN mechanisms is in networks (generally LANs) where the effectiveness of TCP retransmit timers is limited by the coarse granularity of the TCP clock. The paper also discusses some implementation issues concerning specific ECN mechanisms in TCP/IP networks.",

DCell scales doubly exponentially as the node degree increases. DCell is fault tolerant since it does not have single point of failure and its distributed fault-tolerant routing protocol performs near shortest-path routing even in the presence of severe link or node failures. DCell also provides higher network capacity than the traditional tree-based structure for various types of services. Furthermore, DCell can be incrementally expanded and a partial DCell provides the same appealing features. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments show that DCell is a viable interconnection structure for data centers.",

We combine our findings in a new (non-Markovian) source model for VBR video and present an algorithm for generating synthetic traffic. Trace-driven simulations show that statistical multiplexing results in significant bandwidth efficiency even when long-range dependence is present. Simulations of our source model show long-range dependence and heavy-tailed marginals to be important components which are not accounted for in currently used VBR video traffic models.",

    "abstract": "Reliable communication protocols require that all the intended recipients of a message receive the message intact. Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) techniques are used in unicast protocols, but they do not scale well to multicast protocols with large groups of receivers, since segment losses tend to become uncorrelated thus greatly reducing the effectiveness of retransmissions. In such cases, Forward Error Correction (FEC) techniques can be used, consisting in the transmission of redundant packets (based on error correcting codes) to allow the receivers to recover from independent packet losses.Despite the widespread use of error correcting codes in many fields of information processing, and a general consensus on the usefulness of FEC techniques within some of the Internet protocols, very few actual implementations exist of the latter. This probably derives from the different types of applications, and from concerns related to the complexity of implementing such codes in software. To fill this gap, in this paper we provide a very basic description of erasure codes, describe an implementation of a simple but very flexible erasure code to be used in network protocols, and discuss its performance and possible applications. Our code is based on Vandermonde matrices computed over GF ( p r ), can be implemented very efficiently on common microprocessors, and is suited to a number of different applications, which are briefly discussed in the paper. An implementation of the erasure code shown in this paper is available from the author, and is able to encode/decode data at speeds up to several MB/s running on a Pentium 133.",

With the former approach it is not easy to set and control the various operational parameters such as bandwidth, delays, queue sizes. Simulators are easier to control, but they are often only an approximate model of the desired setting, especially for what regards the various traffic generators (both producers and consumers) and their interaction with the protocol itself.In this paper we show how a simple, yet flexible and accurate network simulator - dummynet - can be built with minimal modifications to an existing protocol stack, allowing experiments to be run on a standalone system. dummynet works by intercepting communications of the protocol layer under test and simulating the effects of finite queues, bandwidth limitations and communication delays. It runs in a fully operational system, hence allowing the use of real traffic generators and protocol implementations, while solving the problem of simulating unusual environments. With our tool, doing experiments with network protocols is as simple as running the desired set of applications on a workstation.A FreeBSD implementation of dummynet , targeted to TCP, is available from the author.

The challenge for any alternative protocol is to better utilize networks with high bandwidth-delay products in a simple and robust manner without interacting badly with existing traffic. Scalable TCP is a simple sender-side alteration to the TCP congestion window update algorithm. It offers a robust mechanism to improve performance in highspeed wide area networks using traditional TCP receivers. Scalable TCP is designed to be incrementally deployable and behaves identically to traditional TCP stacks when small windows are sufficient. The performance of the scheme is evaluated through experimental results gathered using a Scalable TCP implementation for the Linux operating system and a gigabit transatlantic network. The preliminary results gathered suggest that the deployment of Scalable TCP would have negligible impact on existing network traffic at the same time as improving bulk transfer performance in highspeed wide area networks.",

In particular, we show that a MAC layer function - probe is the primary contributor to the overall handoff latency. In our study, we observe that the latency is significant enough to affect the quality of service for many applications (or network connections). Further we find variations in the latency from one hand-off to another as well as with APs and STAs used from different vendors. Finally, we discuss optimizations on the probe phase which can potentially reduce the probe latency by as much as 98% (and a minimum of 12% in our experiments). Based on the study, we draw some guidelines for future handoff schemes.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes COPE, a new architecture for wireless mesh networks. In addition to forwarding packets, routers mix (i.e., code) packets from different sources to increase the information content of each transmission. We show that intelligently mixing packets increases network throughput. Our design is rooted in the theory of network coding. Prior work on network coding is mainly theoretical and focuses on multicast traffic. This paper aims to bridge theory with practice; it addresses the common case of unicast traffic, dynamic and potentially bursty flows, and practical issues facing the integration of network coding in the current network stack. We evaluate our design on a 20-node wireless network, and discuss the results of the first testbed deployment of wireless network coding. The results show that COPE largely increases network throughput. The gains vary from a few percent to several folds depending on the traffic pattern, congestion level, and transport protocol.",

In a sybil attack,a malicious user obtains multiple fake identities and pretends to be multiple, distinct nodes in the system. By controlling a large fraction of the nodes in the system,the malicious user is able to \"out vote\" the honest users in collaborative tasks such as Byzantine failure defenses. This paper presents SybilGuard , a novel protocol for limiting the corruptive influences of sybil attacks.Our protocol is based on the \"social network \"among user identities, where an edge between two identities indicates a human-established trust relationship. Malicious users can create many identities but few trust relationships. Thus, there is a disproportionately-small \"cut\" in the graph between the sybil nodes and the honest nodes. SybilGuard exploits this property to bound the number of identities a malicious user can create.We show the effectiveness of SybilGuard both analytically and experimentally.",

Unlike conventional network testbeds, however, we advocate an approach that supports both researchers that want to develop new services, and clients that want to use them. This dual use, in turn, suggests four design principles that are not widely supported in existing testbeds: services should be able to run continuously and access a slice of the overlay's resources, control over resources should be distributed, overlay management services should be unbundled and run in their own slices, and APIs should be designed to promote application development. We believe a testbed that supports these design principles will facilitate the emergence of a new service-oriented network architecture . Towards this end, the paper also briefly describes PlanetLab, an overlay network being designed with these four principles in mind.",

Robustness translates into loss resilience and facilitates the design of simple distributed algorithms that perform well, even if decisions are based only on partial information.

    "abstract": "The current Internet infrastructure has very few built-in protection mechanisms, and is therefore vulnerable to attacks and failures. In particular, recent events have illustrated the Internet's vulnerability to both denial of service (DoS) attacks and flash crowds in which one or more links in the network (or servers at the edge of the network) become severely congested. In both DoS attacks and flash crowds the congestion is due neither to a single flow, nor to a general increase in traffic, but to a well-defined subset of the traffic --- an aggregate . This paper proposes mechanisms for detecting and controlling such high bandwidth aggregates. Our design involves both a local mechanism for detecting and controlling an aggregate at a single router, and a cooperative pushback mechanism in which a router can ask upstream routers to control an aggregate. While certainly not a panacea, these mechanisms could provide some needed relief from flash crowds and flooding-style DoS attacks. The presentation in this paper is a first step towards a more rigorous evaluation of these mechanisms.",

They will enable new applications, especially those based on application-specific multicast, information fusion, and other services that leverage network-based computation and storage. Furthermore, they will accelerate the pace of innovation by decoupling network services from the underlying hardware and allowing new services to be loaded into the infrastructure on demand.

There is, moreover, a simple relation between the parameters describing the intensities of the Noah Effect (high variability) and the Joseph Effect (self-similarity). This provides a simple physical explanation for the presence of self-similar traffic patterns in modern high-speed network traffic that is consistent with traffic measurements at the source level. We illustrate how this mathematical result can be combined with modern high-performance computing capabilities to yield a simple and efficient linear-time algorithm for generating self-similar traffic traces.We also show how to obtain in the limit a L&amp;eacute;vy stable motion, that is, a process with stationary and independent increments but with infinite variance marginals. While we have presently no empirical evidence that such a limit is consistent with measured network traffic, the result might prove relevant for some future networking scenarios.",

Our measurements suggest that this latter behavior is important from a modeling perspective, as almost all of our TCP traces contained more time-out events than fast retransmit events.

The performance impact of feature set reduction, using Consistency-based and Correlation-based feature selection, is demonstrated on Naïve Bayes, C4.5, Bayesian Network and Naïve Bayes Tree algorithms.

    "abstract": "This paper describes Extremely Opportunistic Routing (ExOR), a new unicast routing technique for multi-hop wireless networks. ExOR forwards each packet through a sequence of nodes, deferring the choice of each node in the sequence until after the previous node has transmitted the packet on its radio. ExOR then determines which node, of all the nodes that successfully received that transmission, is the node closest to the destination. That closest node transmits the packet. The result is that each hop moves the packet farther (or average) than the hops of the best possible pre-determined route.The ExOR design addresses the challenge of choosing a forwarding node after transmission using a distributed algorithm. First, when a node transmits a packet, it includes in the packet a simple schedule describing the priority order in which the potential receivers should forward the packet. The node computes the schedule based on shared measurements of inter-node delivery rates. ExOR then uses a distributed slotted MAC protocol for acknowledgements to ensure that the receivers agree who the highest priority receiver was.The efficacy of ExOR depends mainly on the rate at which the reception probability falls off with distance. Simulations based on measured radio characteristics [6] suggest that ExOR reduces the total number of transmissions by nearly a factor of two over the best possible pre-determined route.",

    "abstract": "Today's data networks are surprisingly fragile and difficult to manage. We argue that the root of these problems lies in the complexity of the control and management planes--the software and protocols coordinating network elements--and particularly the way the decision logic and the distributed-systems issues are inexorably intertwined. We advocate a complete refactoring of the functionality and propose three key principles--network-level objectives, network-wide views, and direct control--that we believe should underlie a new architecture. Following these principles, we identify an extreme design point that we call \"4D,\" after the architecture's four planes: decision, dissemination, discovery, and data. The 4D architecture completely separates an AS's decision logic from pro-tocols that govern the interaction among network elements. The AS-level objectives are specified in the decision plane, and en-forced through direct configuration of the state that drives how the data plane forwards packets. In the 4D architecture, the routers and switches simply forward packets at the behest of the decision plane, and collect measurement data to aid the decision plane in controlling the network. Although 4D would involve substantial changes to today's control and management planes, the format of data packets does not need to change; this eases the deployment path for the 4D architecture, while still enabling substantial innovation in network control and management. We hope that exploring an extreme design point will help focus the attention of the research and industrial communities on this crucially important and intellectually challenging area.",

In particular, the data center network should enable any server to be assigned to any service. To meet these goals, we present VL2, a practical network architecture that scales to support huge data centers with uniform high capacity between servers, performance isolation between services, and Ethernet layer-2 semantics. VL2 uses (1) flat addressing to allow service instances to be placed anywhere in the network, (2) Valiant Load Balancing to spread traffic uniformly across network paths, and (3) end-system based address resolution to scale to large server pools, without introducing complexity to the network control plane. VL2's design is driven by detailed measurements of traffic and fault data from a large operational cloud service provider. VL2's implementation leverages proven network technologies, already available at low cost in high-speed hardware implementations, to build a scalable and reliable network architecture. As a result, VL2 networks can be deployed today, and we have built a working prototype. We evaluate the merits of the VL2 design using measurement, analysis, and experiments. Our VL2 prototype shuffles 2.7 TB of data among 75 servers in 395 seconds - sustaining a rate that is 94% of the maximum possible.",

The latency of retrieving a Web document depends on several factors such as the network bandwidth, propagation time and the speed of the server and client computers. Although several proposals have been made for reducing this latency, it is difficult to push it to the point where it becomes insignificant.This motivates our work, where we investigate a scheme for reducing the latency perceived by users by predicting and prefetching files that are likely to be requested soon, while the user is browsing through the currently displayed page. In our scheme the server, which gets to see requests from several clients, makes predictions while individual clients initiate prefetching. We evaluate our scheme based on trace-driven simulations of prefetching over both high-bandwidth and low-bandwidth links. Our results indicate that prefetching is quite beneficial in both cases, resulting in a significant reduction in the average access time at the cost of an increase in network traffic by a similar fraction. We expect prefetching to be particularly profitable over non-shared (dialup) links and high-bandwidth, high-latency (satellite) links.",

Compared to previous approaches, King has several advantages. Unlike IDMaps, King does not require the deployment of additional infrastructure, and unlike GNP, King does not require end hosts to agree upon a set of reference points. Unlike both IDMaps and GNP, King's estimates are based on direct online measurements rather than offline extrapolation. Because King uses existing DNS infrastructure, King scales naturally both in terms of the number of hosts that can be measured and in terms of the number of hosts performing measurements.After describing the techniques used in King, we present an extensive evaluation and analysis of the accuracy and consistency of our tool. Specifically, our evaluation shows that the accuracy of King is significantly better than the accuracy of IDMaps, and that King tends to preserve order among its latency estimates.

We prototype our design by building our own analog circuit boards and integrating them with a fully WiFi-PHY compatible software radio implementation. We show experimentally that our design works robustly in noisy indoor environments, and provides close to the expected theoretical doubling of throughput in practice.",

In the process, 1) we identify the relevant transport level quantities, 2) we discuss the tradeoffs between placing the monitors within the VoIP gateways versus placement of the monitors within the transport path, and 3) we identify several areas where further work and consensus within the industry are required. We discover that the relevant transport level quantities are the delay, network packet loss and the decoder's de-jitter buffer packet loss. We find that an in-path monitor requires the definition of a reference de-jitter buffer implementation to estimate voice quality based upon observed transport measurements. Finally, we suggest that more studies are required, which evaluate the quality of various VoIP codecs in the presence of representative packet loss patterns.",

    "abstract": "P2P file downloading and streaming have already become very popular Internet applications. These systems dramatically reduce the server loading, and provide a platform for scalable content distribution, as long as there is interest for the content. P2P-based video-on-demand (P2P-VoD) is a new challenge for the P2P technology. Unlike streaming live content, P2P-VoD has less synchrony in the users sharing video content, therefore it is much more difficult to alleviate the server loading and at the same time maintaining the streaming performance. To compensate, a small storage is contributed by every peer, and new mechanisms for coordinating content replication, content discovery, and peer scheduling are carefully designed. In this paper, we describe and discuss the challenges and the architectural design issues of a large-scale P2P-VoD system based on the experiences of a real system deployed by PPLive. The system is also designed and instrumented with monitoring capability to measure both system and component specific performance metrics (for design improvements) as well as user satisfaction. After analyzing a large amount of collected data, we present a number of results on user behavior, various system performance metrics, including user satisfaction, and discuss what we observe based on the system design. The study of a real life system provides valuable insights for the future development of P2P-VoD technology.",

ZigZag's core contribution is a new form of interference cancellation that exploits asynchrony across successive collisions. Specifically, 802.11 retransmissions, in the case of hidden terminals, cause successive collisions. These collisions have different interference-free stretches at their start, which ZigZag exploits to bootstrap its decoding. ZigZag makes no changes to the 802.11 MAC and introduces no overhead when there are no collisions. But, when senders collide, ZigZag attains the same throughput as if the colliding packets were a priori scheduled in separate time slots. We build a prototype of ZigZag in GNU Radio. In a testbed of 14 USRP nodes, ZigZag reduces the average packet loss rate at hidden terminals from 72.6% to about 0.7%.",

Our approach leverages existing TV and cellular transmissions to eliminate the need for wires and batteries, thus enabling ubiquitous communication where devices can communicate among themselves at unprecedented scales and in locations that were previously inaccessible. To achieve this, we introduce ambient backscatter, a new communication primitive where devices communicate by backscattering ambient RF signals. Our design avoids the expensive process of generating radio waves; backscatter communication is orders of magnitude more power-efficient than traditional radio communication. Further, since it leverages the ambient RF signals that are already around us, it does not require a dedicated power infrastructure as in traditional backscatter communication. To show the feasibility of our design, we prototype ambient backscatter devices in hardware and achieve information rates of 1 kbps over distances of 2.5 feet and 1.5 feet, while operating outdoors and indoors respectively. We use our hardware prototype to implement proof-of-concepts for two previously infeasible ubiquitous communication applications.",

    "abstract": "OpenFlow is a great concept, but its original design imposes excessive overheads. It can simplify network and traffic management in enterprise and data center environments, because it enables flow-level control over Ethernet switching and provides global visibility of the flows in the network. However, such fine-grained control and visibility comes with costs: the switch-implementation costs of involving the switch's control-plane too often and the distributed-system costs of involving the OpenFlow controller too frequently, both on flow setups and especially for statistics-gathering. In this paper, we analyze these overheads, and show that OpenFlow's current design cannot meet the needs of high-performance networks. We design and evaluate DevoFlow, a modification of the OpenFlow model which gently breaks the coupling between control and global visibility, in a way that maintains a useful amount of visibility without imposing unnecessary costs. We evaluate DevoFlow through simulations, and find that it can load-balance data center traffic as well as fine-grained solutions, without as much overhead: DevoFlow uses 10--53 times fewer flow table entries at an average switch, and uses 10--42 times fewer control messages.",

We then study packet traces collected at a small number of switches in one data center and find evidence of ON-OFF traffic behavior.

Embedding multiple virtual networks (VNs) on a shared substrate is a challenging problem on cloud computing platforms and large-scale sliceable network testbeds. In this paper we apply the Markov Random Walk (RW) model to rank a network node based on its resource and topological attributes. This novel topology-aware node ranking measure reflects the relative importance of the node. Using node ranking we devise two VN embedding algorithms. The first algorithm maps virtual nodes to substrate nodes according to their ranks, then embeds the virtual links between the mapped nodes by finding shortest paths with unsplittable paths and solving the multi-commodity flow problem with splittable paths. The second algorithm is a backtracking VN embedding algorithm based on breadth-first search, which embeds the virtual nodes and links during the same stage using node ranks. Extensive simulation experiments show that the topology-aware node rank is a better resource measure and the proposed RW-based algorithms increase the long-term average revenue and acceptance ratio compared to the existing embedding algorithms.",

We try to answer these questions by analyzing a 17-month trace of over 10 million spam messages collected at an Internet \"spam sinkhole\", and by correlating this data with the results of IP-based blacklist lookups, passive TCP fingerprinting information, routing information, and botnet \"command and control\" traces.We find that most spam is being sent from a few regions of IP address space, and that spammers appear to be using transient \"bots\" that send only a few pieces of email over very short periods of time. Finally, a small, yet non-negligible, amount of spam is received from IP addresses that correspond to short-lived BGP routes, typically for hijacked prefixes. These trends suggest that developing algorithms to identify botnet membership, filtering email messages based on network-leve l properties (which are less variable than email content), and improving the security of the Internet routing infrastructure, may prove to be extremely effective for combating spam.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes ExOR,an integrated routing and MAC protocol that increases the throughput of large unicast transfers in multi-hop wireless networks. ExOR chooses each hop of a packet's route after the transmission for that hop, so that the choice can reflect which intermediate nodes actually received the transmission. This deferred choice gives each transmission multiple opportunities to make progress. As a result ExOR can use long radio links with high loss rates, which would be avoided by traditional routing. ExOR increases a connection's throughput while using no more network capacity than traditional routine.ExOR's design faces the following challenges. The nodes that receive each packet must agree on their identities and choose one forwarder.The agreement protocol must have low overhead, but must also be robust enough that it rarely forwards a packet zero times or more than once. Finally, ExOR must choose the forwarder with the lowest remaining cost to the ultimate destination.Measurements of an implementation on a 38-node 802.11b test-bed show that ExOR increases throughput for most node pairs when compared with traditional routing. For pairs between which traditional routing uses one or two hops, ExOR's robust acknowledgments prevent unnecessary retransmissions,increasing throughput by nearly 35%. For more distant pairs, ExOR takes advantage of the choice of forwarders to provide throughput gains of a factor of two to four.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing demand for network devices capable of examining the content of data packets in order to improve network security and provide application-specific services. Most high performance systems that perform deep packet inspection implement simple string matching algorithms to match packets against a large, but finite set of strings. owever, there is growing interest in the use of regular expression-based pattern matching, since regular expressions offer superior expressive power and flexibility. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) representations are typically used to implement regular expressions. However, DFA representations of regular expression sets arising in network applications require large amounts of memory, limiting their practical application.In this paper, we introduce a new representation for regular expressions, called the Delayed Input DFA (D 2 FA), which substantially reduces space equirements as compared to a DFA. A D 2 FA is constructed by transforming a DFA via incrementally replacing several transitions of the automaton with a single default transition. Our approach dramatically reduces the number of distinct transitions between states. For a collection of regular expressions drawn from current commercial and academic systems, a D2FA representation reduces transitions by more than 95%. Given the substantially reduced space equirements, we describe an efficient architecture that can perform deep packet inspection at multi-gigabit rates. Our architecture uses multiple on-chip memories in such a way that each remains uniformly occupied and accessed over a short duration, thus effectively distributing the load and enabling high throughput. Our architecture can provide ostffective packet content scanning at OC-192 rates with memory requirements that are consistent with current ASIC technology.",

Unlike switches in the public telephony network which exhibit failover on the order of milliseconds, our experimental measurements show that inter-domain routers in the packet switched Internet may take tens of minutes to reach a consistent view of the network topology after a fault. These delays stem from temporary routing table oscillations formed during the operation of the BGP path selection process on Internet backbone routers. During these periods of delayed convergence , we show that end-to-end Internet paths will experience intermittent loss of connectivity, as well as increased packet loss and latency. We present a two-year study of Internet routing convergence through the experimental instrumentation of key portions of the Internet infrastructure, including both passive data collection and fault-injection machines at major Internet exchange points. Based on data from the injection and measurement of several hundred thousand inter-domain routing faults, we describe several unexpected properties of convergence and show that the measured upper bound on Internet inter-domain routing convergence delay is an order of magnitude slower than previously thought. Our analysis also shows that the upper theoretic computational bound on the number of router states and control messages exchanged during the process of BGP convergence is factorial with respect to the number of autonomous systems in the Internet. Finally, we demonstrate that much of the observed convergence delay stems from specific router vendor implementation decisions and ambiguity in the BGP specification.",

    "abstract": "Cloud data centers host diverse applications, mixing workloads that require small predictable latency with others requiring large sustained throughput. In this environment, today's state-of-the-art TCP protocol falls short. We present measurements of a 6000 server production cluster and reveal impairments that lead to high application latencies, rooted in TCP's demands on the limited buffer space available in data center switches. For example, bandwidth hungry \"background\" flows build up queues at the switches, and thus impact the performance of latency sensitive \"foreground\" traffic. To address these problems, we propose DCTCP, a TCP-like protocol for data center networks. DCTCP leverages Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) in the network to provide multi-bit feedback to the end hosts. We evaluate DCTCP at 1 and 10Gbps speeds using commodity, shallow buffered switches. We find DCTCP delivers the same or better throughput than TCP, while using 90% less buffer space. Unlike TCP, DCTCP also provides high burst tolerance and low latency for short flows. In handling workloads derived from operational measurements, we found DCTCP enables the applications to handle 10X the current background traffic, without impacting foreground traffic. Further, a 10X increase in foreground traffic does not cause any timeouts, thus largely eliminating incast problems.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents BCube, a new network architecture specifically designed for shipping-container based, modular data centers. At the core of the BCube architecture is its server-centric network structure, where servers with multiple network ports connect to multiple layers of COTS (commodity off-the-shelf) mini-switches. Servers act as not only end hosts, but also relay nodes for each other. BCube supports various bandwidth-intensive applications by speeding-up one-to-one, one-to-several, and one-to-all traffic patterns, and by providing high network capacity for all-to-all traffic. BCube exhibits graceful performance degradation as the server and/or switch failure rate increases. This property is of special importance for shipping-container data centers, since once the container is sealed and operational, it becomes very difficult to repair or replace its components. Our implementation experiences show that BCube can be seamlessly integrated with the TCP/IP protocol stack and BCube packet forwarding can be efficiently implemented in both hardware and software. Experiments in our testbed demonstrate that BCube is fault tolerant and load balancing and it significantly accelerates representative bandwidth-intensive applications.",

    "abstract": "Active networks allow their users to inject customized programs into the nodes of the network. An extreme case, in which we are most interested, replaces packets with \"capsules\" - program fragments that are executed at each network router/switch they traverse.Active architectures permit a massive increase in the sophistication of the computation that is performed within the network. They will enable new applications, especially those based on application-specific multicast, information fusion, and other services that leverage network-based computation and storage. Furthermore, they will accelerate the pace of innovation by decoupling network services from the underlying hardware and allowing new services to be loaded into the infrastructure on demand.In this paper, we describe our vision of an active network architecture, outline our approach to its design, and survey the technologies that can be brought to bear on its implementation. We propose that the research community mount a joint effort to develop and deploy a wide area ActiveNet.",

    "abstract": "Opportunistic routing is a recent technique that achieves high throughput in the face of lossy wireless links. The current opportunistic routing protocol, ExOR, ties the MAC with routing, imposing a strict schedule on routers' access to the medium. Although the scheduler delivers opportunistic gains, it misses some of the inherent features of the 802.11 MAC. For example, it prevents spatial reuse and thus may underutilize the wireless medium. It also eliminates the layering abstraction, making the protocol less amenable to extensions to alternate traffic types such as multicast. This paper presents MORE, a MAC-independent opportunistic routing protocol. MORE randomly mixes packets before forwarding them. This randomness ensures that routers that hear the same transmission do not forward the same packets. Thus, MORE needs no special scheduler to coordinate routers and can run directly on top of 802.11. Experimental results from a 20-node wireless testbed show that MORE's median unicast throughput is 22% higher than ExOR, and the gains rise to 45% over ExOR when there is a chance of spatial reuse. For multicast, MORE's gains increase with the number of destinations, and are 35-200% greater than ExOR.",

Most conventional protocols exhibit their least desirable behavior for highly dynamic interconnection topologies. We propose a new methodology for routing and topology information maintenance in dynamic networks. The basic idea behind the protocol is to divide the graph into a number of overlapping clusters. A change in the network topology corresponds to a change in cluster membership. We present algorithms for creation of clusters, as well as algorithms to maintain them in the presence of various network events. Compared to existing and conventional routing protocols, the proposed cluster-based approach incurs lower overhead during topology updates and also has quicker reconvergence. The effectiveness of this approach also lies in the fact that existing routing protocols can be directly applied to the network --- replacing the nodes by clusters.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a new approach to Internet host mobility. We argue that by separating local and wide area mobility, the performance of existing mobile host protocols (e.g. Mobile IP) can be significantly improved. We propose Cellular IP, a new lightweight and robust protocol that is optimized to support local mobility but efficiently interworks with Mobile IP to provide wide area mobility support. Cellular IP shows great benefit in comparison to existing host mobility proposals for environments where mobile hosts migrate frequently, which we argue, will be the rule rather than the exception as Internet wireless access becomes ubiquitous. Cellular IP maintains distributed cache for location management and routing purposes. Distributed paging cache coarsely maintains the position of 'idle' mobile hosts in a service area. Cellular IP uses this paging cache to quickly and efficiently pinpoint 'idle' mobile hosts that wish to engage in 'active' communications. This approach is beneficial because it can accommodate a large number of users attached to the network without overloading the location management system. Distributed routing cache maintains the position of active mobile hosts in the service area and dynamically refreshes the routing state in response to the handoff of active mobile hosts. These distributed location management and routing algorithms lend themselves to a simple and low cost implementation of Internet host mobility requiring no new packet formats, encapsulations or address space allocation beyond what is present in IP.",

    "abstract": "At some point in the future, how far out we do not exactly know, wireless access to the Internet will outstrip all other forms of access bringing the freedom of mobility to the way we access the web, communicate with each other, and conduct business. In short, the Internet is going mobile and wireless, perhaps quite soon. A number of diverse technologies are leading the charge, including, 3G cellular networks based on CDMA technology, a wide variety of what is deemed 2.5G cellular technologies (e.g., EDGE, GPRS and HDR), and IEEE 802.11 wireless local area networks (WLANs). Wireless ISPs will offer a number of these technologies to mobile users. In some case, handsets will come with software radios that simultaneously support multiple access technologies on-the-fly; for example, IEEE 802.11 for high-bandwidth access in urban areas and GPRS for wide area access in rural areas. Each technology has its pros and cons. First and second generation cellular systems offer wide area low bandwidth voice services based on analog and digital technology, respectively. The 3G cellular systems are designed to carry voice, video and data simultaneously, and offer data rates of 144 Kbps for fast-moving mobile users in vehicles, 384 Kbps for slower moving pedestrian users, and 2 Mbps from fixed locations. Note that all users within a cell share these data rates. The 3G networks offer higher capacity and increased spectral efficiency but retain a circuit-switched, hierarchical architecture. In contrast, WLAN offers even higher bandwidth and is considered IP friendly because it offers a link layer that is very similar to wired Ethernet. However, in comparison to 3G networks, WLAN only operates within the local area, only supports best effort services, and uses shared unlicensed spectrum where few quality assurances can be provided to users. Recently, there has been a considerable amount of press on the slow rollout of 3G. However, there are some signs for optimism. Japan's NTT DoCoMo started offering 3G services in October 2001 in the Tokyo area. This came after the initial postponement of the rollout of 3G services by providers in Japan and Europe. Since May 2001, 5,000 residents in the Tokyo area have been using new 3G phones that offer improved i-mode service and real-time videoconferencing. The initial video offering uses a 64 Kbps circuit that carries video and audio combined. One of the guest editors had the opportunity to use a trial handset to set up a video call to a colleague in a taxi while traveling through Tokyo. The real-time video call, which used MPEG4 technology, presented mixed service quality but the experience of setting up the call between two taxis was exciting. I-mode currently has 29 million subscribers in Japan and DoCoMo hopes to keep that figure rising with the new service offerings. The DoCoMo radio access network is based on WCDMA and the core network on ATM switching. Many carriers in the US and Europe will be keenly watching what is happening in Tokyo. Wireless providers in the United States are eager to follow suit but are rolling out service in phases with emphasis on 2.5G technologies such as GPRS, which provides an always-on connection to the Internet that allows users to toggle between surfing the web, a phone call, or text messaging without losing the connection. Carriers in Europe, which have invested more than $100 billion to buy 3G radio spectrum licenses and will need to invest another $100 billion for the build-out of the 3G networks, will be keeping a close watch on DoCoMo's successes and failures. The vast majority of WLAN deployed today is based on IEEE 802.11b operating at 2.4 Ghz and offering data rates up to 11 Mbps. Recently, a number of companies have demonstrated IEEE 802.11 a, which operates in the 5Ghz band and offers data rates up to 54 Mbps. In fact, Atheros Communications supports a \"turbo-networking\" mode that delivers 108 Mbps, roughly equivalent to Fast Ethernet. The cost of the 3G spectrum and the build-out of the 3G networks have been so prohibitive that many operators have been pushed to the brink of bankruptcy. As a result, many small operators in Europe are sharing the cost of the build-out by sharing core and radio access network infrastructure. In contrast, WLAN infrastructure operates in unlicensed frequency bands and is very cheap in comparison to cellular equipment. Cheap, because WLAN base-station transceivers are priced at less than $1,000, and transceiver cards are around $100 or come built into computers. Public wireless LANs can handle large volumes of data at significantly lower costs compared to leading 3G technologies. The cost benefit and bandwidth differential offered by WLAN technology makes it a disruptive technology as the cellular operators migrate from 2G to 3G. Disruptive technologies are characterized as being cheaper and of lower performance than sustainin g technologies (e.g., 2.5G or 3G solutions). Most public wireless networks and enterprise networks use WLAN, not because it is more secure, robust or spectrally efficient, but simply because it is cheap, offers high bandwidth, makes networks easy to build and configure, and, importantly, it works. Typically, customers are not initially satisfied with the performance offered by disruptive technologies when they are first introduced. For WLAN to compete in the marketplace with 2.5G and 3G solutions, public WLAN operators would need to be capable of building metropolitan area networks that provided suitable support for voice-over-IP there by enabling voice communications. Sharing unlicensed spectrum means that wireless ISPs cannot build managed networks where services are tightly controlled, in isolation from other operators, as a means of assuring performance. Historically, however, disruptive technologies have tended to resolve such performance problems as they mature and begin to capture market share. Examples of wireless extensions to Internet are all around us today. Here in New York City many companies, university campuses, coffee shops and stores offer wireless access to the web using WLAN technology. Columbia University, for example, provides students and faculty wireless access to the web as they move around campus. Companies such as MobiStar and Waypoint provide wireless connections at hotels, airports and cafes. Around Manhattan, Starbucks coffee shops offer wireless access to the Internet. At the grassroots level, community groups are putting up wireless antennas around the New York City area and in other cities offering free access to Internet. Some predict that these \"freenets\", which have a feel reminiscent to Napster, will ultimately succumb to a sustained corporate challenge or new wireless ISPs that offer cheap services across dense urban areas. The road to success for such fledgling operators may be littered with a number of business, regulatory and performance obstacles. There are a number of companies, standards bodies, and industrial fora vying to define future wireless extensions to the Internet. The end result is that operators are faced with a large and confusing array of choices on how best to build next generation mobile networks. 3G systems offer support for seamless mobility, paging, and service quality but are built on complex and costly connection-oriented networking infrastructure that lacks the inherent flexibility, scalability, and cost effectiveness found in IP networks. In contrast, Mobile IP represents a simple and scalable global mobility solution but lacks support for fast handoff control, real-time location tracking, and authentication and distributed policy management found in cellular networks today. There has also been considerable interest in new emerging wireless technologies such as personal area networks, mobile ad hoc networks and sensor networks. How these technologies interwork with the global Internet is an active area of research. A number of micro-mobility protocols (e.g., Cellular IP, Hawaii, Hierarchical Mobile IP) and fast handoff schemes have been discussed in the IETF Mobile IP Working Group that address some of these performance and scalability issues. These protocols are designed for environments where mobile hosts change their point of attachment to the network so frequently that the basic Mobile IP protocol tunneling mechanism introduces network overhead in terms of increased delay, packet loss and signaling. For example, many real-time wireless applications (e.g., voice-over-IP) would experience noticeable degradation of service with frequent handoff. Establishment of new tunnels can introduce additional delays in the handoff process, causing packet loss and delayed delivery of data to applications. This delay is inherent in the round-trip incurred by Mobile IP as the registration request is sent to the home agent and the response sent back to the foreign agent. Micromobility protocols aim to handle local movement (e.g., within a domain) of mobile hosts without interaction with the Mobile IP enabled Internet. This has the benefit of reducing delay and packet loss during handoff and eliminating registration between mobile hosts and possibly distant home agents when mobile hosts remain inside their local coverage areas. Eliminating registration in this manner reduces the signaling load experienced by the network in support of mobility. As the numbers of wireless users grow so will the signaling overhead associated with mobility management. In cellular networks registration and paging techniques are used to minimize the signaling overhead and optimize mobility management performance. Currently, Mobile IP supports registration but not paging. An important characteristic of micro-mobility protocols is their ability to reduce the signaling overhead related to frequent mobile migrations taking into account a mobile host's operational mode (i.e., active or idle). When wireless access to Internet becomes the norm then Mobile IP will have to provide efficient and scalable location tracking in support of idle users, and IP paging in support of active communications. Support for \"passive connectivity\" to the wireless Internet balances a number of important design considerations. For example, only keeping the approximate location information of idle users requires significantly less signaling and thus reduces the load over the air interface and in the network. Reducing signaling over the air interfaces in this manner also has the benefit of preserving the power reserves of mobile hosts. Currently, the IETF Seamoby Working Group is tasked with developing an IP paging protocol. The papers in this special issue address a number of the issues and challenges discussed above. We received a total of 32 excellent submissions for this special issue -- a much greater response to our call for papers than we expected. The papers came from different regions around the world and addressed many different aspects of research. Each paper was reviewed by three or more experts, who evaluated the technical content and suitability of the paper for publication in this special issue. As guest editors of the special issue we had the very difficult job of selecting only six papers from those submitted. Several deserving papers could not be accommodated in this special issue because of space. We hope to see those papers appear later in ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review. The first three papers in this special issue address a number of enhancements to Mobile IP and cellular networks to provide for better support for fast handoff and context transfer, wireless Internet telephony, and IP paging. The final three papers deal with the emerging technologies of personal area networks, mobile ad hoc networks and sensor networks. In the first paper, Jonathan Lennox, Kazutaka Murakami, Mehmet Karaul and Thomas F. La Porta, Lucent Technologies, discuss internetworking Internet telephony and wireless telecommunications networks. The authors propose a number of schemes to directly interconnect the 3G UMTS and SIP Internet telephony systems. The next paper by Rajeev Koodli and Charles E. Perkins, Nokia, deals with seamless handoff and context relocation in mobile networks. Context transfer refers to state information (e.g., QOS state) associated with a particular service (e.g., VoIP) that needs to be re-established with mobility. The authors show that fast handoff with context transfer at the network layer can support uninterrupted voice-over-IP services. The paper by Pars Mutaf and Claude Castelluccia, INRIA, proposes adaptive per-host IP paging. The authors observe that many of the existing IP paging proposals found in the literature promote the use of static or manually configured paging areas. The authors argue that there is a need for dynamic and adaptive paging area management that takes into account host mobility and traffic patterns in the network. Robin Kravets, Casey Carter and Luiz Magalhaes, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, discuss cooperative approaches to user mobility. The authors propose the necessary networking functionality that allows groups of mobile devices (e.g., a set of devices that collectively comprise a personal area network) to interact and be seamlessly integrated into the Internet. In the next paper, Jyoti Raju and J. J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves UC Santa Cruz, present a new mobile ad hoc network routing protocol called source tracing and compare it with dynamic source routing (DSR). Both on-demand and table-driven implementations are considered. The final paper in this special issue, by Samir Goel and Tomasz Imielinski, Rutgers University, considers the problem of monitoring data in large sensor networks. The authors propose a prediction-based monitoring scheme that can be visualized by leveraging concepts and techniques found in image processing. There are many other technical challenges before Internet goes truly wireless and mobile. For example, there is a need to minimize the impact of mobility on TCP performance, resolve security issues over-the-air, and further study how best content can be pushed toward mobile users. Finally, in the wake of the recent attack in New York City, we anticipate new advances in rapidly deployable wireless infrastructure, self-configuring networks, and sensor networks - collectively forming disaster relief networks. As guest editors it has been a great pleasure to put together this issue. We would like to thank the authors for their contributions and the reviewers for their time, energy, and comments that helped shape this special issue. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do.",

The problem has the added constraints of finite buffers at each node and the general property that no contemporaneous end-to-end path may ever exist. This situation limits the applicability of traditional routing approaches that tend to treat outages as failures and seek to find an existing end-to-end path. We propose a framework for evaluating routing algorithms in such environments. We then develop several algorithms and use simulations to compare their performance with respect to the amount of knowledge they require about network topology. We find that, as expected, the algorithms using the least knowledge tend to perform poorly. We also find that with limited additional knowledge, far less than complete global knowledge, efficient algorithms can be constructed for routing in such environments. To the best of our knowledge this is the first such investigation of routing issues in DTNs.",

    "abstract": "Congestion control is a recognized problem in complex networks. We have discovered that the Department of Defense's Internet Protocol (IP), a pure datagram protocol, and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), a transport layer protocol, when used together, are subject to unusual congestion problems caused by interactions between the transport and datagram layers. In particular, IP gateways are vulnerable to a phenomenon we call congestion collapse, especially when such gateways connect networks of widely different bandwidth. We have developed solutions that prevent congestion collapse. These problems are not generally recognized because these protocols are used most often on networks built on top of ARPANET IMP technology. ARPANET IMP based networks traditionally have uniform bandwidth, identical switching nodes, and are sized with substantial excess capacity. This excess capacity, and the ability of the IMP system to throttle the transmissions of hosts has for most IP/TCP hosts and networks, been adequate to handle congestion. With the recent split of the ARPANET into two interconnected networks and the growth of other networks with differing properties connected to the ARPANET, however, reliance on the benign properties of the IMP system is no longer enough to allow hosts to communicate rapidly and reliably. Improved handling of congestion is now mandatory for successful network operation under load. Ford Aerospace and Communications Corporation, and its parent company, Ford Motor Company, operate the only private IP/TCP long-haul network in existence today. This network connects six facilities (one in Michigan, two in California, one in Colorado, one in Texas, and one in England) some with extensive local networks. This net is cross-tied to the ARPANET but uses its own long-haul circuits; traffic between Ford facilities flows over private leased circuits, including a leased transatlantic satellite connection. All switching nodes are pure IP datagram switches with no node-to-node flow control, and all hosts run software either written or heavily modified by Ford or Ford Aerospace. Bandwidth of links in this network varies widely, from 1200 to 10,000,000 bits per second. In general, we have not been able to afford the luxury of excess long-haul bandwidth that the ARPANET possesses, and our long-haul links are heavily loaded during peak periods. Transit times of several seconds are thus common in our network. Because of our pure datagram orientation, heavy loading, and wide variation in bandwidth, we have had to solve problems that the ARPANET/MILNET community is just beginning to recognize. Our network is sensitive to suboptimal behavior by host TCP implementations, both on and off our own net. We have devoted considerable effort to examining TCP behavior under various conditions, and have solved some widely prevalent problems with TCP. We present here two problems and their solutions. Many TCP implementations have these problems; &lt;i&gt;if throughput is worse through an ARPANET/MILNET gateway for a given TCP implementation than throughput across a single net, there is a high probability that the TCP implementation has one or both of these problems&lt;/i&gt;.",

One difficulty in dealing with self-similar models is how to efficiently synthesize traces (sample paths) corresponding to self-similar traffic. We present a fast Fourier transform method for synthesizing approximate self-similar sample paths for one type of self-similar process, Fractional Gaussian Noise, and assess its performance and validity. We find that the method is as fast or faster than existing methods and appears to generate close approximations to true self-similar sample paths. We also discuss issues in using such synthesized sample paths for simulating network traffic, and how an approximation used by our method can dramatically speed up evaluation of Whittle's estimator for H , the Hurst parameter giving the strength of long-range dependence present in a self-similar time series.",

    "abstract": "Many DTN routing protocols use a variety of mechanisms, including discovering the meeting probabilities among nodes, packet replication, and network coding. The primary focus of these mechanisms is to increase the likelihood of finding a path with limited information, so these approaches have only an incidental effect on such routing metrics as maximum or average delivery latency. In this paper, we present RAPID , an intentional DTN routing protocol that can optimize a specific routing metric such as worst-case delivery latency or the fraction of packets that are delivered within a deadline. The key insight is to treat DTN routing as a resource allocation problem that translates the routing metric into per-packet utilities which determine how packets should be replicated in the system. We evaluate RAPID rigorously through a prototype of RAPID deployed over a vehicular DTN testbed of 40 buses and simulations based on real traces. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to report on a routing protocol deployed on a real DTN at this scale. Our results suggest that RAPID significantly outperforms existing routing protocols for several metrics. We also show empirically that for small loads RAPID is within 10% of the optimal performance.",

However the challenge of effectively analyzing this massive data source for anomaly diagnosis is as yet unmet. We argue that the distributions of packet features (IP addresses and ports) observed in flow traces reveals both the presence and the structure of a wide range of anomalies. Using entropy as a summarization tool, we show that the analysis of feature distributions leads to significant advances on two fronts: (1) it enables highly sensitive detection of a wide range of anomalies, augmenting detections by volume-based methods, and (2) it enables automatic classification of anomalies via unsupervised learning. We show that using feature distributions, anomalies naturally fall into distinct and meaningful clusters. These clusters can be used to automatically classify anomalies and to uncover new anomaly types. We validate our claims on data from two backbone networks (Abilene and Geant) and conclude that feature distributions show promise as a key element of a fairly general network anomaly diagnosis framework.",

    "abstract": "Recent empirical studies [6] have shown that Internet topologies exhibit power laws of the form y = x α for the following relationships: (P1) outdegree of node (domain or router) versus rank; (P2) number of nodes versus outdegree; (P3) number of node pairs within a neighborhood versus neighborhood size (in hops); and (P4) eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix versus rank. However, causes for the appearance of such power laws have not been convincingly given. In this paper, we examine four factors in the formation of Internet topologies. These factors are (F1) preferential connectivity of a new node to existing nodes; (F2) incremental growth of the network; (F3) distribution of nodes in space; and (F4) locality of edge connections. In synthetically generated network topologies, we study the relevance of each factor in causing the aforementioned power laws as well as other properties, namely diameter, average path length and clustering coefficient. Different kinds of network topologies are generated: (T1) topologies generated using our parametrized generator, we call BRITE; (T2) random topologies generated using the well-known Waxman model [12]; (T3) Transit-Stub topologies generated using GT-ITM tool [3]; and (T4) regular grid topologies. We observe that some generated topologies may not obey power laws P1 and P2. Thus, the existence of these power laws can be used to validate the accuracy of a given tool in generating representative Internet topologies. Power laws P3 and P4 were observed in nearly all considered topologies, but different topologies showed different values of the power exponent α. Thus, while the presence of power laws P3 and P4 do not give strong evidence for the representativeness of a generated topology, the value of α in P3 and P4 can be used as a litmus test for the representativeness of a generated topology. We also find that factors F1 and F2 are the key contributors in our study which provide the resemblance of our generated topologies to that of the Internet.",

    "abstract": "For applications relying on the transfer of multimedia, and in particular continuous media, it is essential that quality of service (QoS) is guaranteed system-wide, including end-systems, communications systems and networks. Although researchers have addressed many isolated areas of QoS provision, little attention has so far been paid to the definition of an integrated and coherent framework that incorporates QoS interfaces, management and mechanisms across all architectural layers. To address this deficiency, we are developing a Quality of Service Architecture (QoS-A) which offers a framework to specify and implement the required performance properties of multimedia applications over high-performance ATM-based networks. The QoS-A incorporates the notions of flow, service contract and flow management. Flows characterise the production, transmission and eventual consumption of single media streams, service contracts are binding agreements between users and providers and flow management provides for the monitoring and maintenance of the contracted QoS levels. This paper provides an overview of the QoS-A and focuses particularly on the role of the transport service and protocol in the architecture. We describe a multimedia enhanced transport service (METS), flow management and transport layer service contract. We show how QoS levels contracted at the transport service interface can be assured in the context of our local ATM environment.",

    "abstract": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems, which provide a variety of popular services, such as file sharing, video streaming and voice-over-IP, contribute a significant portion of today's Internet traffic. By building overlay networks that are oblivious to the underlying Internet topology and routing, these systems have become one of the greatest traffic-engineering challenges for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and the source of costly data traffic flows. In an attempt to reduce these operational costs, ISPs have tried to shape, block or otherwise limit P2P traffic, much to the chagrin of their subscribers, who consistently finds ways to eschew these controls or simply switch providers. In this paper, we present the design, deployment and evaluation of an approach to reducing this costly cross-ISP traffic without sacrificing system performance. Our approach recycles network views gathered at low cost from content distribution networks to drive biased neighbor selection without any path monitoring or probing. Using results collected from a deployment in BitTorrent with over 120,000 users in nearly 3,000 networks, we show that our lightweight approach significantly reduces cross-ISP traffic and, over 33% of the time, it selects peers along paths that are within a single autonomous system (AS). Further, we find that our system locates peers along paths that have two orders of magnitude lower latency and 30% lower loss rates than those picked at random, and that these high-quality paths can lead to significant improvements in transfer rates. In challenged settings where peers are overloaded in terms of available bandwidth, our approach provides 31% average download-rate improvement; in environments with large available bandwidth, it increases download rates by 207% on average (and improves median rates by 883%",

It eliminates the retransmission ambiguity, thereby solving the problems caused by spurious timeouts and spurious fast retransmits. It can be incrementally deployed as it is backwards compatible and does not change TCP's congestion control semantics. In environments where spurious retransmissions occur frequently, the algorithm can improve the end-to-end throughput by several tens of percent. An exact quantification is, however, highly dependent on the path characteristics over time. The Eifel algorithm finally makes TCP truly wireless-capable without the need for proxies between the end points. Another key novelty is that the Eifel algorithm provides for the implementation of a more optimistic retransmission timer because it reduces the penalty of a spurious timeout to a single (in the common case) spurious retransmission.",

The resulting dilution of locality in the flooding stream complicates the victim's abilities both to isolate the attack traffic in order to block it, and to use traceback techniques for locating the source of streams of packets with spoofed source addresses, such as ITRACE [Be00a], probabilistic packet marking [SWKA00], [SP01], and SPIE [S+01]. We discuss a number of possible defenses against reflector attacks, finding that most prove impractical, and then assess the degree to which different forms of reflector traffic will have characteristic signatures that the victim can use to identify and filter out the attack traffic. Our analysis indicates that three types of reflectors pose particularly significant threats: DNS and Gnutella servers, and TCP-based servers (particularly Web servers) running on TCP implementations that suffer from predictable initial sequence numbers. We argue in conclusion in support of \"reverse ITRACE\" [Ba00] and for the utility of packet traceback techniques that work even for low volume flows, such as SPIE.",

While the P2P users are a good source of revenue for the Internet Service Providers (ISPs), the immense P2P traffic also poses a significant traffic engineering challenge to the ISPs. This is because P2P systems either implement their own routing in the overlay topology or may use a P2P routing underlay [1], both of which are largely independent of the Internet routing, and thus impedes the ISP's traffic engineering capabilities. On the other hand, P2P users are primarily interested in finding their desired content quickly, with good performance. But as the P2P system has no access to the underlying network, it either has to measure the path performance itself or build its overlay topology agnostic of the underlay. This situation is disadvantageous for both the ISPs and the P2P users. To overcome this, we propose and evaluate the feasibility of a solution where the ISP offers an \"oracle\" to the P2P users. When the P2P user supplies the oracle with a list of possible P2P neighbors, the oracle ranks them according to certain criteria, like their proximity to the user or higher bandwidth links. This can be used by the P2P user to choose appropriate neighbors, and therefore improve its performance. The ISP can use this mechanism to better manage the immense P2P traffic, e.g., to keep it inside its network, or to direct it along a desired path. The improved network utilization will also enable the ISP to provide better service to its customers.",

As a result, minimum-hop-count routing often chooses routes that have significantly less capacity than the best paths that exist in the network. Much of the reason for this is that many of the radio links between nodes have loss rates low enough that the routing protocol is willing to use them, but high enough that much of the capacity is consumed by retransmissions. These observations suggest that more attention be paid to link quality when choosing ad hoc routes; the paper presents measured link characteristics likely to be useful in devising a better path quality metric.",

We consider the interaction between the bias against connections with multiple congested gateways, the bias of the TCP window modification algorithm against connections with longer roundtrip times, and the bias of Drop Tail and Random Drop gateways against bursty traffic. Using simulations and a heuristic analysis, we show that in a network with the window modification algorithm in 4.3 tahoe BSD TCP and with Random Drop or Drop Tail gateways, a longer connection with multiple congested gateways can receive unacceptably low throughput. We show that in a network with no bias against connections with longer roundtrip times and with no bias against bursty traffic, a connection with multiple congested gateways can receive an acceptable level of throughput.We discuss the application of several current measures of fairness to networks with multiple congested gateways, and show that different measures of fairness have quite different implications. One view is that each connection should receive the same throughput in bytes/second, regardless of roundtrip times or numbers of congested gateways. Another view is that each connection should receive the same share of the network's scarce congested resources. In general, we believe that the fairness criteria for connections with multiple congested gateways requires further consideration.",

Splitting traffic at the granularity of packets quickly and accurately assigns the desired traffic share to each path, but can reorder packets within a TCP flow, confusing TCP congestion control. Splitting traffic at the granularity of a flow avoids packet reordering but may overshoot the desired shares by up to 60% in dynamic environments, resulting in low end-to-end network goodput Contrary to popular belief, we show that one can systematically split a single flow across multiple paths without causing packet reordering. We propose FLARE, a new traffic splitting algorithm that operates on bursts of packets, carefully chosen to avoid reordering. Using a combination of analysis and trace-driven simulations, we show that FLARE attains accuracy and responsiveness comparable to packet switching without reordering packets. FLARE is simple and can be implemented with a few KB of router state",

SpotFi only uses information that is already exposed by WiFi chips and does not require any hardware or firmware changes, yet achieves the same accuracy as state-of-the-art localization systems. SpotFi makes two key technical contributions. First, SpotFi incorporates super-resolution algorithms that can accurately compute the angle of arrival (AoA) of multipath components even when the access point (AP) has only three antennas. Second, it incorporates novel filtering and estimation techniques to identify AoA of direct path between the localization target and AP by assigning values for each path depending on how likely the particular path is the direct path. Our experiments in a multipath rich indoor environment show that SpotFi achieves a median accuracy of 40 cm and is robust to indoor hindrances such as obstacles and multipath.",

Measurements have been made under conditions intended to better understand performance barriers imposed by network equipment queueing capacities and queue drop strategies.The IBM RS/6000 based routers currently supporting ANSNET performed very well in these tests. Measurements have been made with the current software and performance enhanced software. Single TCP flows are able to achieve 40 Mb/s and competing multiple TCP flows achieve over 41 Mb/s link utilization on 44.7 Mb/s DS3 links with delays comparable to US cross continent ANSNET delays. Congestion collapse is demonstrated with intentionally reduced queueing capacity and using window sizes much larger than optimal.A variation of Floyd and Jacobson's Random Early Detection (RED) algorithm [1] is tested. Performance improved with the use of RED for tests involving multiple flows. With RED and queueing capacity at or above the delay bandwidth product, congestion collapse is avoided, allowing the maximum window size to safely be set arbitrarily high.Queueing capacity greater than or equal to the delay bandwidth product and RED are recommended. RED provides performance improvement in all but the single flow case, but cannot substitute for adequate queueing capacity, particularly if high speed flows are to be supported.",

    "abstract": "In Software Defined Networking (SDN) the control plane is physically separate from the forwarding plane. Control software programs the forwarding plane (e.g., switches and routers) using an open interface, such as OpenFlow. This paper aims to overcomes two limitations in current switching chips and the OpenFlow protocol: i) current hardware switches are quite rigid, allowing ``Match-Action'' processing on only a fixed set of fields, and ii) the OpenFlow specification only defines a limited repertoire of packet processing actions. We propose the RMT (reconfigurable match tables) model, a new RISC-inspired pipelined architecture for switching chips, and we identify the essential minimal set of action primitives to specify how headers are processed in hardware. RMT allows the forwarding plane to be changed in the field without modifying hardware. As in OpenFlow, the programmer can specify multiple match tables of arbitrary width and depth, subject only to an overall resource limit, with each table configurable for matching on arbitrary fields. However, RMT allows the programmer to modify all header fields much more comprehensively than in OpenFlow. Our paper describes the design of a 64 port by 10 Gb/s switch chip implementing the RMT model. Our concrete design demonstrates, contrary to concerns within the community, that flexible OpenFlow hardware switch implementations are feasible at almost no additional cost or power.",

To some extent, these limitations may be inherent for Ethernet/IP style protocols when trying to support arbitrary topologies. We observe that data center networks are often managed as a single logical network fabric with a known baseline topology and growth model. We leverage this observation in the design and implementation of PortLand, a scalable, fault tolerant layer 2 routing and forwarding protocol for data center environments. Through our implementation and evaluation, we show that PortLand holds promise for supporting a ``plug-and-play\" large-scale, data center network.",

The experimental results show that VRR provides robust performance across a wide range of environments and workloads. It performs comparably to, or better than, the best wireless routing protocol in each experiment.

Diagnosing anomalies is critical for both network operators and end users. It is a difficult problem because one must extract and interpret anomalous patterns from large amounts of high-dimensional, noisy data.In this paper we propose a general method to diagnose anomalies. This method is based on a separation of the high-dimensional space occupied by a set of network traffic measurements into disjoint subspaces corresponding to normal and anomalous network conditions. We show that this separation can be performed effectively by Principal Component Analysis.Using only simple traffic measurements from links, we study volume anomalies and show that the method can: (1) accurately detect when a volume anomaly is occurring; (2) correctly identify the underlying origin-destination (OD) flow which is the source of the anomaly; and (3) accurately estimate the amount of traffic involved in the anomalous OD flow.We evaluate the method's ability to diagnose ( i.e., detect, identify, and quantify) both existing and synthetically injected volume anomalies in real traffic from two backbone networks. Our method consistently diagnoses the largest volume anomalies, and does so with a very low false alarm rate.",

In contrast to previous methods, our approach is based on observing and identifying patterns of host behavior at the transport layer. We analyze these patterns at three levels of increasing detail (i) the social, (ii) the functional and (iii) the application level. This multilevel approach of looking at traffic flow is probably the most important contribution of this paper. Furthermore, our approach has two important features. First, it operates in the dark , having (a) no access to packet payload, (b) no knowledge of port numbers and (c) no additional information other than what current flow collectors provide. These restrictions respect privacy, technological and practical constraints. Second, it can be tuned to balance the accuracy of the classification versus the number of successfully classified traffic flows. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three real traces. Our results show that we are able to classify 80%-90% of the traffic with more than 95% accuracy.",

In this paper, we conduct a comparison of several current geolocation databases -both commercial and free- to have an insight of the limitations in their usability. First, the vast majority of entries in the databases refer only to a few popular countries (e.g., U.S.). This creates an imbalance in the representation of countries across the IP blocks of the databases. Second, these entries do not reflect the original allocation of IP blocks, nor BGP announcements. In addition, we quantify the accuracy of geolocation databases on a large European ISP based on ground truth information. This is the first study using a ground truth showing that the overly fine granularity of database entries makes their accuracy worse, not better. Geolocation databases can claim country-level accuracy, but certainly not city-level.",

The models then predict packet delivery and throughput in the same network for different sets of transmitters with the same node placements. We evaluate our models for the base case of two senders that broadcast packets simultaneously. We find that they are effective at predicting when there will be significant interference effects.

DIFANE relegates the controller to the simpler task of partitioning these rules over the switches. DIFANE can be readily implemented with commodity switch hardware, since all data-plane functions can be expressed in terms of wildcard rules that perform simple actions on matching packets. Experiments with our prototype on Click-based OpenFlow switches show that DIFANE scales to larger networks with richer policies.",

Given that there is little support in the network for optimizing such measures, bottlenecks could occur anywhere in the delivery system. Consequently, a robust bitrate adaptation algorithm in client-side players is critical to ensure good user experience. Previous studies have shown key limitations of state-of-art commercial solutions and proposed a range of heuristic fixes. Despite the emergence of several proposals, there is still a distinct lack of consensus on: (1) How best to design this client-side bitrate adaptation logic (e.g., use rate estimates vs. buffer occupancy); (2) How well specific classes of approaches will perform under diverse operating regimes (e.g., high throughput variability); or (3) How do they actually balance different QoE objectives (e.g., startup delay vs. rebuffering). To this end, this paper makes three key technical contributions. First, to bring some rigor to this space, we develop a principled control-theoretic model to reason about a broad spectrum of strategies. Second, we propose a novel model predictive control algorithm that can optimally combine throughput and buffer occupancy information to outperform traditional approaches.

We report on an analysis of 40,000 end-to-end route measurements conducted using repeated \"traceroutes\" between 37 Internet sites. We analyze the routing behavior for pathological conditions, routing stability, and routing symmetry. For pathologies, we characterize the prevalence of routing loops, erroneous routing, infrastructure failures, and temporary outages. We find that the likelihood of encountering a major routing pathology more than doubled between the end of 1994 and the end of 1995, rising from 1.5% to 3.4%. For routing stability, we define two separate types of stability, \"prevalence,\" meaning the overall likelihood that a particular route is encountered, and \"persistence,\" the likelihood that a route remains unchanged over a long period of time. We find that Internet paths are heavily dominated by a single prevalent route, but that the time periods over which routes persist show wide variation, ranging from seconds up to days. About 2/3's of the Internet paths had routes persisting for either days or weeks. For routing symmetry, we look at the likelihood that a path through the Internet visits at least one different city in the two directions. At the end of 1995, this was the case half the time, and at least one different autonomous system was visited 30% of the time.",

But done simplistically, these re-configurations can also cause severe, transient congestion because different switches may apply updates at different times. We develop a novel technique that leverages a small amount of scratch capacity on links to apply updates in a provably congestion-free manner, without making any assumptions about the order and timing of updates at individual switches. Further, to scale to large networks in the face of limited forwarding table capacity, SWAN greedily selects a small set of entries that can best satisfy current demand. It updates this set without disrupting traffic by leveraging a small amount of scratch capacity in forwarding tables. Experiments using a testbed prototype and data-driven simulations of two production networks show that SWAN carries 60% more traffic than the current practice.",

We show that, for the first time, wireless packet delivery can be accurately predicted for commodity 802.11 NICs from only the channel measurements that they provide. Our model uses 802.11n Channel State Information measurements as input to an OFDM receiver model we develop by using the concept of effective SNR. It is simple, easy to deploy, broadly useful, and accurate. It makes packet delivery predictions for 802.11a/g SISO rates and 802.11n MIMO rates, plus choices of transmit power and antennas. We report testbed experiments that show narrow transition regions (&lt;2 dB for most links) similar to the near-ideal case of narrowband, frequency-flat channels. Unlike RSSI, this lets us predict the highest rate that will work for a link, trim transmit power, and more. We use trace-driven simulation to show that our rate prediction is as good as the best rate adaptation algorithms for 802.11a/g, even over dynamic channels, and extends this good performance to 802.11n.",

    "abstract": "Software Defined Networking envisions smart centralized controllers governing the forwarding behavior of dumb low-cost switches. But are \"dumb\" switches an actual strategic choice, or (at least to some extent) are they a consequence of the lack of viable alternatives to OpenFlow as programmatic data plane forwarding interface? Indeed, some level of (programmable) control logic in the switches might be beneficial to offload logically centralized controllers (de facto complex distributed systems) from decisions just based on local states (versus network-wide knowledge), which could be handled at wire speed inside the device itself. Also, it would reduce the amount of flow processing tasks currently delegated to specialized middleboxes. The underlying challenge is: can we devise a stateful data plane programming abstraction (versus the stateless OpenFlow match/action table) which still entails high performance and remains consistent with the vendors' preference for closed platforms? We posit that a promising answer revolves around the usage of extended finite state machines, as an extension (super-set) of the OpenFlow match/action abstraction. We concretely turn our proposed abstraction into an actual table-based API, and, perhaps surprisingly, we show how it can be supported by (mostly) reusing core primitives already implemented in OpenFlow devices.",

    "abstract": "Modern enterprises almost ubiquitously deploy middlebox processing services to improve security and performance in their networks. Despite this, we find that today's middlebox infrastructure is expensive, complex to manage, and creates new failure modes for the networks that use them. Given the promise of cloud computing to decrease costs, ease management, and provide elasticity and fault-tolerance, we argue that middlebox processing can benefit from outsourcing the cloud. Arriving at a feasible implementation, however, is challenging due to the need to achieve functional equivalence with traditional middlebox deployments without sacrificing performance or increasing network complexity. In this paper, we motivate, design, and implement APLOMB, a practical service for outsourcing enterprise middlebox processing to the cloud. Our discussion of APLOMB is data-driven, guided by a survey of 57 enterprise networks, the first large-scale academic study of middlebox deployment. We show that APLOMB solves real problems faced by network administrators, can outsource over 90% of middlebox hardware in a typical large enterprise network, and, in a case study of a real enterprise, imposes an average latency penalty of 1.1ms and median bandwidth inflation of 3.8%.",

This change of paradigm leads to a new data plane: data consumers send out Interest packets, routers forward them and maintain the state of pending Interests, which is used to guide Data packets back to the consumers. NDN routers' forwarding process is able to detect network problems by observing the two-way traffic of Interest and Data packets, and explore multiple alternative paths without loops. This is in sharp contrast to today's IP forwarding process which follows a single path chosen by the routing process, with no adaptability of its own.

    "abstract": "As the distribution of the video over the Internet becomes main- stream and its consumption moves from the computer to the TV screen, user expectation for high quality is constantly increasing. In this context, it is crucial for content providers to understand if and how video quality affects user engagement and how to best invest their resources to optimize video quality. This paper is a first step towards addressing these questions. We use a unique dataset that spans different content types, including short video on demand (VoD), long VoD, and live content from popular video con- tent providers. Using client-side instrumentation, we measure quality metrics such as the join time, buffering ratio, average bitrate, rendering quality, and rate of buffering events. We quantify user engagement both at a per-video (or view) level and a per-user (or viewer) level. In particular, we find that the percentage of time spent in buffering (buffering ratio) has the largest impact on the user engagement across all types of content. However, the magnitude of this impact depends on the content type, with live content being the most impacted. For example, a 1% increase in buffering ratio can reduce user engagement by more than three minutes for a 90-minute live video event. We also see that the average bitrate plays a significantly more important role in the case of live content than VoD content.",

In this work, we suggest an alternative approach: rather than presuming that capacity estimation is required, it is perhaps better to begin by using only the buffer, and then ask when capacity estimation is needed. We test the viability of this approach through a series of experiments spanning millions of real users in a commercial service. We start with a simple design which directly chooses the video rate based on the current buffer occupancy. Our own investigation reveals that capacity estimation is unnecessary in steady state; however using simple capacity estimation (based on immediate past throughput) is important during the startup phase, when the buffer itself is growing from empty. This approach allows us to reduce the rebuffer rate by 10-20% compared to Netflix's then-default ABR algorithm, while delivering a similar average video rate, and a higher video rate in steady state.",

These transfers can have a significant impact on job performance, accounting for more than 50% of job completion times. Despite this impact, there has been relatively little work on optimizing the performance of these data transfers, with networking researchers traditionally focusing on per-flow traffic management. We address this limitation by proposing a global management architecture and a set of algorithms that (1) improve the transfer times of common communication patterns, such as broadcast and shuffle, and (2) allow scheduling policies at the transfer level, such as prioritizing a transfer over other transfers. Using a prototype implementation, we show that our solution improves broadcast completion times by up to 4.5X compared to the status quo in Hadoop. We also show that transfer-level scheduling can reduce the completion time of high-priority transfers by 1.7X.",

To answer these questions, we examine fundamental limits to control plane propagation latency on an upcoming Internet2 production deployment, then expand our scope to over 100 publicly available WAN topologies. As expected, the answers depend on the topology.

Moreover, pFabric delivers this performance with a very simple design that is based on a key conceptual insight: datacenter transport should decouple flow scheduling from rate control. For flow scheduling, packets carry a single priority number set independently by each flow; switches have very small buffers and implement a very simple priority-based scheduling/dropping mechanism. Rate control is also correspondingly simpler; flows start at line rate and throttle back only under high and persistent packet loss. We provide theoretical intuition and show via extensive simulations that the combination of these two simple mechanisms is sufficient to provide near-optimal performance.",

To utilize this bandwidth requires different flows take different paths, which poses a challenge. In short, a single-path transport seems ill-suited to such networks. We propose using Multipath TCP as a replacement for TCP in such data centers, as it can effectively and seamlessly use available bandwidth, giving improved throughput and better fairness on many topologies. We investigate what causes these benefits, teasing apart the contribution of each of the mechanisms used by MPTCP. Using MPTCP lets us rethink data center networks, with a different mindset as to the relationship between transport protocols, rout- ing and topology. MPTCP enables topologies that single path TCP cannot utilize. As a proof-of-concept, we present a dual-homed variant of the FatTree topology. With MPTCP, this outperforms FatTree for a wide range of workloads, but costs the same. In existing data centers, MPTCP is readily deployable leveraging widely deployed technologies such as ECMP. We have run MPTCP on Amazon EC2 and found that it outperforms TCP by a factor of three when there is path diversity. But the biggest benefits will come when data centers are designed for multipath transports.",

    "abstract": "RFIDs are emerging as a vital component of the Internet of Things. In 2012, billions of RFIDs have been deployed to locate equipment, track drugs, tag retail goods, etc. Current RFID systems, however, can only identify whether a tagged object is within radio range (which could be up to tens of meters), but cannot pinpoint its exact location. Past proposals for addressing this limitation rely on a line-of-sight model and hence perform poorly when faced with multipath effects or non-line-of-sight, which are typical in real-world deployments. This paper introduces the first fine-grained RFID positioning system that is robust to multipath and non-line-of-sight scenarios. Unlike past work, which considers multipath as detrimental, our design exploits multipath to accurately locate RFIDs. The intuition underlying our design is that nearby RFIDs experience a similar multipath environment (e.g., reflectors in the environment) and thus exhibit similar multipath profiles . We capture and extract these multipath profiles by using a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) created via antenna motion. We then adapt dynamic time warping (DTW) techniques to pinpoint a tag's location. We built a prototype of our design using USRP software radios. Results from a deployment of 200 commercial RFIDs in our university library demonstrate that the new design can locate misplaced books with a median accuracy of 11~cm.",

Worse, since they only allocate cores and memory, the resources that they ignore (disk and network) can be over-allocated leading to interference, failures and hogging of cores or memory that could have been used by other tasks. We present Tetris, a cluster scheduler that packs, i.e., matches multi-resource task requirements with resource availabilities of machines so as to increase cluster efficiency (makespan). Further, Tetris uses an analog of shortest-running-time-first to trade-off cluster efficiency for speeding up individual jobs. Tetris' packing heuristics seamlessly work alongside a large class of fairness policies.

    "abstract": "This paper \"peeks under the covers\" at the subsystems that provide the basic functionality of a leading content delivery network. Based on our experiences in building one of the largest distributed systems in the world, we illustrate how sophisticated algorithmic research has been adapted to balance the load between and within server clusters, manage the caches on servers, select paths through an overlay routing network, and elect leaders in various contexts. In each instance, we first explain the theory underlying the algorithms, then introduce practical considerations not captured by the theoretical models, and finally describe what is implemented in practice. Through these examples, we highlight the role of algorithmic research in the design of complex networked systems. The paper also illustrates the close synergy that exists between research and industry where research ideas cross over into products and product requirements drive future research.",

    "abstract": "Datacenter transports aim to deliver low latency messaging together with high throughput. We show that simple packet delay, measured as round-trip times at hosts, is an effective congestion signal without the need for switch feedback. First, we show that advances in NIC hardware have made RTT measurement possible with microsecond accuracy, and that these RTTs are sufficient to estimate switch queueing. Then we describe how TIMELY can adjust transmission rates using RTT gradients to keep packet latency low while delivering high bandwidth. We implement our design in host software running over NICs with OS-bypass capabilities. We show using experiments with up to hundreds of machines on a Clos network topology that it provides excellent performance: turning on TIMELY for OS-bypass messaging over a fabric with PFC lowers 99 percentile tail latency by 9X while maintaining near line-rate throughput. Our system also outperforms DCTCP running in an optimized kernel, reducing tail latency by $13$X. To the best of our knowledge, TIMELY is the first delay-based congestion control protocol for use in the datacenter, and it achieves its results despite having an order of magnitude fewer RTT signals (due to NIC offload) than earlier delay-based schemes such as Vegas.",

Accordingly, researchers and industry practitioners alike have focused a great deal of effort designing network fabrics to efficiently interconnect and manage the traffic within these datacenters in performant yet efficient fashions. Unfortunately, datacenter operators are generally reticent to share the actual requirements of their applications, making it challenging to evaluate the practicality of any particular design. Moreover, the limited large-scale workload information available in the literature has, for better or worse, heretofore largely been provided by a single datacenter operator whose use cases may not be widespread. In this work, we report upon the network traffic observed in some of Facebook's datacenters. While Facebook operates a number of traditional datacenter services like Hadoop, its core Web service and supporting cache infrastructure exhibit a number of behaviors that contrast with those reported in the literature. We report on the contrasting locality, stability, and predictability of network traffic in Facebook's datacenters, and comment on their implications for network architecture, traffic engineering, and switch design.",

    "abstract": "Existing multicast routing mechanisms were intended for use within regions where a group is widely represented or bandwidth is universally plentiful. When group members, and senders to those group members, are distributed sparsely across a wide area, these schemes are not efficient; data packets or membership report information are occasionally sent over many links that do not lead to receivers or senders, respectively. We have developed a multicast routing architecture that efficiently establishes distribution trees across wide area internets, where many groups will be sparsely represented. Efficiency is measured in terms of the state, control message processing, and data packet processing, required across the entire network in order to deliver data packets to the members of the group. Our Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) architecture: (a) maintains the traditional IP multicast service model of receiver-initiated membership; (b) can be configured to adapt to different multicast group and network characteristics; (c) is not dependent on a specific unicast routing protocol; and (d) uses soft-state mechanisms to adapt to underlying network conditions and group dynamics. The robustness, flexibility, and scaling properties of this architecture make it well suited to large heterogeneous inter-networks.",

    "abstract": "Much of the traffic in existing packet networks is highly periodic, either because of periodic sources (e.g., real time speech or video, rate control) or because window flow control protocols have a periodic cycle equal to the connection roundtrip time (e.g., a network-bandwidth limited TCP bulk data transfer). Control theory suggests that this periodicity can resonate (i.e., have a strong, non-linear interaction) with deterministic estimation or control algorithms in network gateways. 1 In this paper we define the notion of traffic phase in a packet-switched network and describe how phase differences between competing traffic streams can be the dominant factor in relative throughput. Drop Tail gateways in a TCP/IP network with strongly periodic traffic can result in systematic discrimination against some connections. We demonstrate this behavior with both simulations and theoretical analysis. This discrimination can be eliminated with the addition of appropriate randomization to the network. In particular, analysis suggests that simply coding a gateway to drop a random packet from its queue (rather than the tail) on overflow is often sufficient.We do not claim that Random Drop gateways solve all of the problems of Drop Tail gateways. Biases against bursty traffic and long roundtrip time connections are shared by both Drop Tail and Random Drop gateways. Correcting the bursty traffic bias has led us to investigate a different kind of randomized gateway algorithm that operates on the traffic stream, rather than on the queue. Preliminary results show that the Random Early Detection gateway, a newly developed gateway congestion avoidance algorithm, corrects this bias against bursty traffic. The roundtrip time bias (at least in TCP/IP networks) results from the TCP window increase algorithm, not from the gateway dropping policy, and we briefly discuss changes to the window increase algorithm that could eliminate this bias.",

This is expensive at high speeds. On the other hand, cheaper approximations of fair queuing that have been reported in the literature exhibit unfair behavior. In this paper, we describe a new approximation of fair queuing, that we call Deficit Round Robin . Our scheme achieves nearly perfect fairness in terms of throughput, requires only O (1) work to process a packet, and is simple enough to implement in hardware. Deficit Round Robin is also applicable to other scheduling problems where servicing cannot be broken up into smaller units, and to distributed queues.",

The lower cost allows us to consider using two or more radios in the same device. Given this, we argue that wireless systems that use multiple radios in a collaborative manner dramatically improve system performance and functionality over the traditional single radio wireless systems that are popular today. In this context, we revisit some standard problems in wireless networking, including energy management, capacity enhancement, mobility management, channel failure recovery, and last-hop packet scheduling. We show that a systems approach can alleviate many of the performance and robustness issues prevalent in current wireless LAN systems. We explore the implications of the multi-radio approach on software and hardware design, as well as on algorithmic and protocol research issues. We identify three key design guidelines for constructing multi-radio systems and present results from two systems that we have built. Our experience supports our position that a multi-radio platform offers significant ben-efits for wireless systems.",

We propose using changes in round-trip delay as an implicit feedback. Using a black-box model of the network, we derive an expression for the optimal window as a function of the gradient of the delay-window curve.The problems of selfish optimum and social optimum are also addressed. It is shown that without a careful design, it is possible to get into a race condition during heavy congestion, where each user wants more resources than others, thereby leading to a diverging condition.It is shown that congestion avoidance using round-trip delay is a promising approach. The approach has the advantage that there is absolutely no overhead for the network itself. It is exemplified by a simple scheme. The performance of the scheme is analyzed using a simulation model. The scheme is shown to be efficient, fair, convergent, and adaptive to changes in network configuration.The scheme as described works only for networks which can be modeled with queueing servers with constant service times. Further research is required to extend it for implementation in practical networks. Several directions for future research have been suggested.",

While providing excellent quality-of-service, this approach has limited scalability because it requires routers to keep per-flow state and to process per-flow reservation messages. In an attempt to implement admission control without these scalability problems, several recent papers have proposed various forms of endpoint admission control . In these designs, the hosts (the endpoints) probe the network to detect the level of congestion; the host admits the flow only if the detected level of congestion is sufficiently low. This paper is devoted to the study of endpoint admission control. We first consider several architectural issues that guide (and constrain) the design of such systems. We then use simulations to evaluate the performance of endpoint admission control in various settings. The modest performance degradation between traditional router-based admission control and endpoint admission control suggests that a real-time service based on endpoint probing may be viable.",

Modern universities, corporate campuses and government offices routinely de-ploy scores of access points to blanket their sites with wireless Internet access. However, while the fine-grained behavior of the 802.11 protocol itself has been well studied, our understanding of how large 802.11 networks behave in their full empirical complex-ity is surprisingly limited. In this paper, we present a system called Jigsaw that uses multiple monitors to provide a single unified view of all physical, link, network and transport-layer activity on an 802.11 network. To drive this analysis, we have deployed an infrastructure of over 150 radio monitors that simultaneously capture all 802.11b and 802.11g activity in a large university building (1M+ cubic feet). We describe the challenges posed by both the scale and ambiguity inherent in such an architecture, and explain the algorithms and inference techniques we developed to address them. Finally, using a 24-hour distributed trace containing more than 1.5 billion events, we use Jigsaw's global cross-layer viewpoint to isolate performance artifacts, both explicit, such as management inefficiencies, and implicit, such as co-channel interference. We believe this is the first analysis combining this scale and level of detail for a production 802.11 network.",

We identify repeated byte ranges between packets to avoid retransmitting the redundant data. We find a high level of redundancy and are able to detect repetition that Web proxy caches are not. In our traces, after Web proxy caching has been applied, an additional 39% of the original volume of Web traffic is found to be redundant.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new approach to preventing and constraining denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Instead of being able to send anything to anyone at any time, in our architecture, nodes must first obtain \"permission to send\" from the destination; a receiver provides tokens, or capabilities, to those senders whose traffic it agrees to accept. The senders then include these tokens in packets. This enables verification points distributed around the network to check that traffic has been certified as legitimate by both endpoints and the path in between, and to cleanly discard unauthorized traffic. We show that our approach addresses many of the limitations of the currently popular approaches to DoS based on anomaly detection, traceback, and pushback. Further, we argue that our approach can be readily implemented in today's technology, is suitable for incremental deployment, and requires no more of a security infrastructure than that already needed to fix BGP's security weaknesses. Finally, our proposal facilitates innovation in application and networking protocols, something increasingly curtailed by existing DoS measures.",

    "abstract": "Sensor networks are especially useful in catastrophic or emergency scenarios such as floods, fires, terrorist attacks or earthquakes where human participation may be too dangerous. However, such disaster scenarios pose an interesting design challenge since the sensor nodes used to collect and communicate data may themselves fail suddenly and unpredictably, resulting in the loss of valuable data. Furthermore, because these networks are often expected to be deployed in response to a disaster, or because of sudden configuration changes due to failure, these networks are often expected to operate in a \"zero-configuration\" paradigm, where data collection and transmission must be initiated immediately, before the nodes have a chance to assess the current network topology. In this paper, we design and analyze techniques to increase \"persistence\" of sensed data, so that data is more likely to reach a data sink, even as network nodes fail. This is done by replicating data compactly at neighboring nodes using novel \"Growth Codes\" that increase in efficiency as data accumulates at the sink. We show that Growth Codes preserve more data in the presence of node failures than previously proposed erasure resilient techniques.",

The mechanism uses a novel probing mechanism to solicit feedback information in a scalable manner and to estimate the number of receivers. In addition, it separates the congestion signal from the congestion control algorithm, so as to cope with heterogeneous networks. This mechanism has been implemented in the IVS video conference system using options within RTP to elicit information about the quality of the video delivered to the receivers. The H.261 coder of IVS then uses this information to adjust its output rate, the goal being to maximize the perceptual quality of the image received at the destinations while minimizing the bandwidth used by the video transmission. We find that our prototype control mechanism is well suited to the Internet environment. Furthermore, it prevents video sources from creating congestion in the Internet. Experiments are underway to investigate how the scalable proving mechanism can be used to facilitate multicast video distribution to large number of participants.",

Routing needs to respond quickly to achieve the potential benefits, but not so quickly that the network is destabilized. This paper studies how rapidly routing can respond, without compromising stability.We present a sufficient condition for the local stability of end-to-end algorithms for joint routing and rate control. The network model considered allows an arbitrary interconnection of sources and resources, and heterogeneous propagation delays. The sufficient condition we present is decentralized: the responsiveness of each route is restricted by the round-trip time of that route alone, and not by the round-trip times of other routes. Our results suggest that stable, scalable load-sharing across paths, based on end-to-end measurements, can be achieved on the same rapid time-scale as rate control, namely the time-scale of round-trip times.",

In this paper we show that with typical Internet flow sizes, existing (TCP Reno) and newly proposed (XCP) congestion control algorithms make flows last much longer than necessary - often by one or two orders of magnitude. In contrast, we show how a new and practical algorithm - RCP (Rate Control Protocol) - enables flows to complete close to the minimum possible",

Such an RTT distribution is important in buffer provisioning, configuration of active queue management, and detection of congestion unresponsive traffic. The proposed methodology is based on two techniques. The first technique is applicable to TCP caller-to-callee flows, and it is based on the 3-way handshake messages. The second technique is applicable to callee-to-caller flows, when the callee transfers a number of MSS segments to the caller, and it is based on the slow-start phase of TCP. The complete estimation algorithm reports an RTT for 55-85% of the TCP workload, in terms of bytes, in the traces that we examined. Verification experiments show that about 90% of the passive measurements are within 10% or 5ms, whichever is larger, of the RTT that ping would measure. Also, measurements on several NLANR traces show that the two estimation techniques agree within 25ms for 70-80% of the processed TCP connections. We also apply the estimation methodology on a number of NLANR traces and examine the variability of the measured RTT distributions in both short and long timescales.",

We first validate and confirm an earlier finding, originally due to Paxson and Floyd [14], that actual WAN traffic is consistent with statistical self-similarity for sufficiently large time scales. We then relate this large-time scaling phenomenon to the empirically observed characteristics of WAN traffic at the level of individual connections or applications. In particular, we present here original results about a detailed statistical analysis of Web-session characteristics, and report on an intriguing scaling property of measured WAN traffic at the transport layer (i.e., number of TCP connection arrivals per time unit). This scaling property of WAN traffic at the TCP layer was absent in the pre-Web period but has become ubiquitous in today's WWW-dominated WANs and is a direct consequence of the ever-increasing popularity of the Web (WWW) and its emergence as the major contributor to WAN traffic. Moreover, we show that this changing nature of WAN traffic can be naturally accounted for by self-similar traffic models, primarily because of their ability to provide physical explanations for empirically observed traffic phenomena in a networking context. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that actual WAN traffic traces also exhibit scaling properties over small time scales, but that the small-time scaling phenomenon is distinctly different from the observed large-time scaling property. We relate this newly observed characteristic of WAN traffic to the effects that the dominant network protocols (e.g., TCP) and controls have on the flow of packets across the network and discuss the potential that multifractals have in this context for providing a structural modeling approach for WAN traffic and for capturing in a compact and parsimonious manner the observed scaling phenomena at large as well as small time scales.",

The key to achieving this is the ability to route on flat labels. In this paper we take an initial stab at this challenge, proposing and analyzing our ROFL routing algorithm. While its scaling and efficiency properties are far from ideal, our results suggest that the idea of routing on flat labels cannot be immediately dismissed.",

The distribution of inter-node loss rates is relatively uniform over the whole range of loss rates; there is no clear threshold separating \"in range\" and \"out of range.\" Most links have relatively stable loss rates from one second to the next, though a small minority have very bursty losses at that time scale. Signal-to-noise ratio and distance have little predictive value for loss rate. The large number of links with intermediate loss rates is probably due to multi-path fading rather than attenuation or interference.The phenomena discussed here are all well-known. The contributions of this paper are an understanding of their relative importance, of how they interact, and of the implications for MAC and routing protocol design.",

Simulation scenarios are carefully designed in order to investigate goodput, fairness and friendliness provided by each of the algorithms. Results show that Westwood+ TCP is friendly towards New Reno TCP and improves fairness in bandwidth allocation whereas Vegas TCP is fair but it is not able to grab its bandwidth share when coexisting with Reno or in the presence of reverse traffic because of its RTT-based congestion detection mechanism. Finally results show that Westwood+ remarkably improves utilization of wireless links that are affected by losses not due to congestion.",

    "abstract": "Researchers have proposed a variety of metrics to measure important graph properties, for instance, in social, biological, and computer networks. Values for a particular graph metric may capture a graph's resilience to failure or its routing efficiency. Knowledge of appropriate metric values may influence the engineering of future topologies, repair strategies in the face of failure, and understanding of fundamental properties of existing networks. Unfortunately, there are typically no algorithms to generate graphs matching one or more proposed metrics and there is little understanding of the relationships among individual metrics or their applicability to different settings. We present a new, systematic approach for analyzing network topologies. We first introduce the d K-series of probability distributions specifying all degree correlations within d -sized subgraphs of a given graph G . Increasing values of d capture progressively more properties of G at the cost of more complex representation of the probability distribution. Using this series, we can quantitatively measure the distance between two graphs and construct random graphs that accurately reproduce virtually all metrics proposed in the literature. The nature of the d K-series implies that it will also capture any future metrics that may be proposed. Using our approach, we construct graphs for d =0, 1, 2, 3 and demonstrate that these graphs reproduce, with increasing accuracy, important properties of measured and modeled Internet topologies. We find that the d =2 case is sufficient for most practical purposes, while d =3 essentially reconstructs the Internet AS-and router-level topologies exactly. We hope that a systematic method to analyze and synthesize topologies offers a significant improvement to the set of tools available to network topology and protocol researchers.",

We evaluate IFRC extensively on a 40-node wireless sensor network testbed. IFRC achieves a fair and efficient rate allocation that is within 20-40% of the optimal fair rate allocation on some network topologies. Its rate adaptation mechanism is highly effective: we did not observe a single instance of queue overflow in our many experiments. Finally, IFRC can be extended easily to support situations where only a subset of the nodes transmit, where the network has multiple base stations, or where nodes are assigned different transmission weights.",

    "abstract": "Even with the significant focus on IP address lookup in the published literature as well as focus on this market by commercial semiconductor vendors, there is still a challenge for router architects to find solutions that simultaneously meet 3 criteria: scaling in terms of lookup speeds as well as table sizes, the ability to perform high speed updates, and the ability to fit into the overall memory architecture of an Level 3 forwarding engine or packet processor with low systems cost overhead. In this paper, we describe a scheme that meets all three criteria. By contrast, published and commercial semiconductor solutions meet some but not all of these three criteria.For example, many approaches that provide dense tables have poor update times; others require large amounts of expensive high speed memory dedicated to this application. Many IP address lookup approaches do not take into account the flexibility of ASICs or the structure of modern high speed memory technologies such as RLDRAM[1] and FCRAM[2]. In this paper, we present a family of IP lookup schemes using a data structure that compactly encodes large prefix tables in order to address the criteria listed above. We also present a series of optimizations to the core algorithm that allows the memory access width of the algorithm to be reduced at the cost of memory references or allocated memory. Such flexibility in performance versus density is an important feature for the lookup engine of routers that may be deployed in different networks with varying requirements on address lookup length and table density (e.g. global IPv4 networks, global v6, VPN based v4 networks, MPLS, and IP tunneling encapsulation points).",

Through detailed measurements in controlled and live environments, and using only commodity 802.11 hardware, we first quantify the impact of channel width on throughput, range, and power consumption. Taken together, our findings make a strong case for wireless systems that adapt channel width. Such adaptation brings unique benefits. For instance, when the throughput required is low, moving to a narrower channel increases range and reduces power consumption; in fixed-width systems, these two quantities are always in conflict. We then present a channel width adaptation algorithm, called SampleWidth, for the base case of two communicating nodes. This algorithm is based on a simple search process that builds on top of existing techniques for adapting modulation. Per specified policy, it can maximize throughput or minimize power consumption. Evaluation using a prototype implementation shows that SampleWidth correctly identities the optimal width under a range of scenarios. In our experiments with mobility, it increases throughput by more than 60% compared to the best fixed-width configuration.",

    "abstract": "Internetworks can be built from many different kinds of networks, with varying limits on maximum packet size. Throughput is usually maximized when the largest possible packet is sent; unfortunately, some routes can carry only very small packets. The IP protocol allows a gateway to fragment a packet if it is too large to be transmitted. Fragmentation is at best a necessary evil; it can lead to poor performance or complete communication failure. There are a variety of ways to reduce the likelihood of fragmentation; some can be incorporated into existing IP implementations without changes in protocol specifications. Others require new protocols, or modifications to existing protocols.",

    "abstract": "Routing protocols for wireless ad hoc networks have traditionally focused on finding paths with minimum hop count. However, such paths can include slow or lossy links, leading to poor throughput. A routing algorithm can select better paths by explicitly taking the quality of the wireless links into account. In this paper, we conduct a detailed, empirical evaluation of the performance of three link-quality metrics---ETX, per-hop RTT, and per-hop packet pair---and compare them against minimum hop count. We study these metrics using a DSR-based routing protocol running in a wireless testbed. We find that the ETX metric has the best performance when all nodes are stationary. We also find that the per-hop RTT and per-hop packet-pair metrics perform poorly due to self-interference. Interestingly, the hop-count metric outperforms all of the link-quality metrics in a scenario where the sender is mobile.",

This paper describes an alternative network architecture called SEATTLE that achieves the best of both worlds: The scalability of IP combined with the simplicity of Ethernet. SEATTLE provides plug-and-play functionality via flat addressing, while ensuring scalability and efficiency through shortest-path routing and hash-based resolution of host information. In contrast to previous work on identity-based routing, SEATTLE ensures path predictability and stability, and simplifies network management. We performed a simulation study driven by real-world traffic traces and network topologies, and used Emulab to evaluate a prototype of our design based on the Click and XORP open-source routing platforms. Our experiments show that SEATTLE efficiently handles network failures and host mobility, while reducing control overhead and state requirements by roughly two orders of magnitude compared with Ethernet bridging.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes MIXIT, a system that improves the throughput of wireless mesh networks. MIXIT exploits a basic property of mesh networks: even when no node receives a packet correctly, any given bit is likely to be received by some node correctly. Instead of insisting on forwarding only correct packets, MIXIT routers use physical layer hints to make their best guess about which bits in a corrupted packet are likely to be correct and forward them to the destination. Even though this approach inevitably lets erroneous bits through, we find that it can achieve high throughput without compromising end-to-end reliability. The core component of MIXIT is a novel network code that operates on small groups of bits, called symbols. It allows the nodes to opportunistically route groups of bits to their destination with low overhead. MIXIT's network code also incorporates an end-to-end error correction component that the destination uses to correct any errors that might seep through. We have implemented MIXIT on a software radio platform running the Zigbee radio protocol. Our experiments on a 25-node indoor testbed show that MIXIT has a throughput gain of 2.8x over MORE, a state-of-the-art opportunistic routing scheme, and about 3.9x over traditional routing using the ETX metric.",

Hence, we propose VROOM (Virtual ROuters On the Move), a new network-management primitive that avoids unnecessary changes to the logical topology by allowing (virtual) routers to freely move from one physical node to another. In addition to simplifying existing network-management tasks like planned maintenance and service deployment, VROOM can also help tackle emerging challenges such as reducing energy consumption. We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of novel migration techniques for virtual routers with either hardware or software data planes. Our evaluation shows that VROOM is transparent to routing protocols and results in no performance impact on the data traffic when a hardware-based data plane is used.",

    "abstract": "Routers must perform packet classification at high speeds to efficiently implement functions such as firewalls and QoS routing. Packet classification requires matching each packet against a database of filters (or rules), and forwarding the packet according to the highest priority filter. Existing filter schemes with fast lookup time do not scale to large filter databases. Other more scalable schemes work for 2-dimensional filters, but their lookup times degrade quickly with each additional dimension. While there exist good hardware solutions, our new schemes are geared towards software implementation.We introduce a generic packet classification algorithm, called Tuple Space Search (TSS) . Because real databases typically use only a small number of distinct field lengths, by mapping filters to tuples even a simple linear search of the tuple space can provide significant speedup over naive linear search over the filters. Each tuple is maintained as a hash table that can be searched in one memory access. We then introduce techniques for further refining the search of the tuple space, and demonstrate their effectiveness on some firewall databases. For example, a real database of 278 filters had a tuple space of 41 which our algorithm prunes to 11 tuples. Even as we increased the filter database size from 1K to 100K (using a random two-dimensional filter generation model), the number of tuples grew from 53 to only 186, and the pruned tuples only grew from 1 to 4. Our Pruned Tuple Space search is also the only scheme known to us that allows fast updates and fast search times. We also show a lower bound on the general tuple space search problem, and describe an optimal algorithm, called Rectangle Search , for two-dimensional filters.",

In addition, we show the performance of a conservative approach to \"undo\" the congestion control state changes made in conjunction with spurious retransmissions. Finally, we propose several alternatives to dynamically make the fast retransmission algorithm more tolerant of the reordering observed in the network and assess these algorithms.",

The interesting challenge for the scheme is to use a minimal amount of feedback (one bit in each packet) from the network to adjust the amount of traffic allowed into the network. The servers in the network detect congestion and set a congestion indication bit on packets flowing in the forward direction. The congestion indication is communicated back to the users through the transport level acknowledgement. The scheme is distributed, adapts to the dynamic state of the network, converges to the optimal operating point, is quite simple to implement, and has low overhead while operational. The scheme also addresses a very important aspect of fairness in the service provided to the various sources utilizing the network. The scheme attempts to maintain fairness in service provided to multiple sources. This paper presents the scheme and the analysis that went into the choice of the various decision mechanisms. We also address the performance of the scheme under transient changes in the network and for pathological conditions.",

Intuitively, the critical characteristic of this self-similar traffic is that there is no natural length of a \"burst\": at every time scale ranging from a few milliseconds to minutes and hours, similar-looking traffic bursts are evident; we find that aggregating streams of such traffic typically intensifies the self-similarity (\"burstiness\") instead of smoothing it.Our conclusions are supported by a rigorous statistical analysis of hundreds of millions of high quality Ethernet traffic measurements collected between 1989 and 1992, coupled with a discussion of the underlying mathematical and statistical properties of self-similarity and their relationship with actual network behavior. We also consider some implications for congestion control in high-bandwidth networks and present traffic models based on self-similar stochastic processes that are simple, accurate, and realistic for aggregate traffic.",

    "abstract": "In Layer Four switching, the route and resources allocated to a packet are determined by the destination address as well as other header fields of the packet such as source address, TCP and UDP port numbers. Layer Four switching unifies firewall processing, RSVP style resource reservation filters, QoS Routing, and normal unicast and multicast forwarding into a single framework. In this framework, the forwarding database of a router consists of a potentially large number of filters on key header fields. A given packet header can match multiple filters, so each filter is given a cost, and the packet is forwarded using the least cost matching filter .In this paper, we describe two new algorithms for solving the least cost matching filter problem at high speeds. Our first algorithm is based on a grid-of-tries construction and works optimally for processing filters consisting of two prefix fields (such as destination-source filters) using linear space. Our second algorithm, cross-producting, provides fast lookup times for arbitrary filters but potentially requires large storage. We describe a combination scheme that combines the advantages of both schemes. The combination scheme can be optimized to handle pure destination prefix filters in 4 memory accesses, destination-source filters in 8 memory accesses worst case, and all other filters in 11 memory accesses in the typical case.",

IP routing lookup requires computing the best matching prefix, for which standard solutions like hashing were believed to be inapplicable. The best existing solution we know of, BSD radix tries, scales badly as IP moves to 128 bit addresses. Our paper describes a new algorithm for best matching prefix using binary search on hash tables organized by prefix lengths. Our scheme scales very well as address and routing table sizes increase: independent of the table size, it requires a worst case time of log 2 ( address bits ) hash lookups. Thus only 5 hash lookups are needed for IPv4 and 7 for IPv6. We also introduce Mutating Binary Search and other optimizations that, for a typical IPv4 backbone router with over 33,000 entries, considerably reduce the average number of hashes to less than 2, of which one hash can be simplified to an indexed array access. We expect similar average case behavior for IPv6.",

    "abstract": "As the Internet makes the transition from research testbed to commercial enterprise, the topic of pricing in computer networks has suddenly attracted great attention. Much of the discussion in the network design community and the popular press centers on the usage-based vs. flat pricing debate. The more academic literature has largely focused on devising optimal pricing policies; achieving optimal welfare requires charging marginal congestion costs for usage. In this paper we critique this optimality paradigm on three grounds: (1) marginal cost prices may not produce sufficient revenue to fully recover costs and so are perhaps of limited relevance, (2) congestion costs are inherently inaccessible to the network and so cannot reliably form the basis for pricing, and (3) there are other, more structural, goals besides optimality, and some of these goals are incompatible with the global uniformity required for optimal pricing schemes. For these reasons, we contend that the research agenda on pricing in computer network should shift away from the optimality paradigm and focus more on structural and architectural issues. Such issues include allowing local control of pricing policies, fostering interconnection, handling multicast appropriately, and allowing receivers to pay for transmission. To illustrate our point, we describe how these goals might be accomplished in the context of a different pricing paradigm: edge pricing. In addition, we argue that in the context of this edge pricing paradigm, usage-based pricing and flat pricing are not radically different but instead both reside along the single continuum of usage-constraining pricing policies.",

    "abstract": "The Internet consists of thousands of independent domains with different, and sometimes competing, business interests. However, the current interdomain routing protocol (BGP) limits each router to using a single route for each destination prefix, which may not satisfy the diverse requirements of end users. Recent proposals for source routing offer an alternative where end hosts or edge routers select the end-to-end paths. However, source routing leaves transit domains with very little control and introduces difficult scalability and security challenges. In this paper, we present a multi-path inter-domain routing protocol called MIRO that offers substantial flexiility, while giving transit domains control over the flow of traffic through their infrastructure and avoiding state explosion in disseminating reachability information. In MIRO, routers learn default routes through the existing BGP protocol, and arbitrary pairs of domains can negotiate the use of additional paths (bound to tunnels in the data plane) tailored to their special needs. MIRO retains the simplicity of BGP for most traffic, and remains backwards compatible with BGP to allow for incremental deployability. Experiments with Internet topology and routing data illustrate that MIRO offers tremendous flexibility for path selection with reasonable overhead.",

    "abstract": "The success of Skype has inspired a generation of peer-to-peer-based solutions for satisfactory real-time multimedia services over the Internet. However, fundamental questions, such as whether VoIP services like Skype are good enough in terms of user satisfaction,have not been formally addressed. One of the major challenges lies in the lack of an easily accessible and objective index to quantify the degree of user satisfaction .In this work, we propose a model, geared to Skype, but generalizable to other VoIP services, to quantify VoIP user satisfaction based on a rigorous analysis of the call duration from actual Skype traces. The User Satisfaction Index (USI) derived from the model is unique in that 1) it is composed by objective source-and network-level metrics, such as the bit rate, bit rate jitter, and round-trip time, 2) unlike speech quality measures based on voice signals, such as the PESQ model standardized by ITU-T, the metrics are easily accessible and computable for real-time adaptation, and 3) the model development only requires network measurements, i.e., no user surveys or voice signals are necessary. Our model is validated by an independent set of metrics that quantifies the degree of user interaction from the actual traces.",

    "abstract": "Theory and experiments show that as the per-flow product of bandwidth and latency increases, TCP becomes inefficient and prone to instability, regardless of the queuing scheme. This failing becomes increasingly important as the Internet evolves to incorporate very high-bandwidth optical links and more large-delay satellite links.To address this problem, we develop a novel approach to Internet congestion control that outperforms TCP in conventional environments, and remains efficient, fair, scalable, and stable as the bandwidth-delay product increases. This new eXplicit Control Protocol, XCP, generalizes the Explicit Congestion Notification proposal (ECN). In addition, XCP introduces the new concept of decoupling utilization control from fairness control. This allows a more flexible and analytically tractable protocol design and opens new avenues for service differentiation.Using a control theory framework, we model XCP and demonstrate it is stable and efficient regardless of the link capacity, the round trip delay, and the number of sources. Extensive packet-level simulations show that XCP outperforms TCP in both conventional and high bandwidth-delay environments. Further, XCP achieves fair bandwidth allocation, high utilization, small standing queue size, and near-zero packet drops, with both steady and highly varying traffic. Additionally, the new protocol does not maintain any per-flow state in routers and requires few CPU cycles per packet, which makes it implementable in high-speed routers.",

    "abstract": "TCP flows start with an initial congestion window of at most four segments or approximately 4KB of data. Because most Web transactions are short-lived, the initial congestion window is a critical TCP parameter in determining how quickly flows can finish. While the global network access speeds increased dramatically on average in the past decade, the standard value of TCP's initial congestion window has remained unchanged. In this paper, we propose to increase TCP's initial congestion window to at least ten segments (about 15KB). Through large-scale Internet experiments, we quantify the latency benefits and costs of using a larger window, as functions of network bandwidth, round-trip time (RTT), bandwidth-delay product (BDP), and nature of applications. We show that the average latency of HTTP responses improved by approximately 10% with the largest benefits being demonstrated in high RTT and BDP networks. The latency of low bandwidth networks also improved by a significant amount in our experiments. The average retransmission rate increased by a modest 0.5%, with most of the increase coming from applications that effectively circumvent TCP's slow start algorithm by using multiple concurrent connections. Based on the results from our experiments, we believe the initial congestion window should be at least ten segments and the same be investigated for standardization by the IETF.",

This paper adopts the opposite approach; it encourages strategically picked senders to interfere. Instead of forwarding packets, routers forward the interfering signals. The destination leverages network-level information to cancel the interference and recover the signal destined to it. The result is analog network coding because it mixes signals not bits. So, what if wireless routers forward signals instead of packets? Theoretically, such an approach doubles the capacity of the canonical 2-way relay network. Surprisingly, it is also practical. We implement our design using software radios and show that it achieves significantly higher throughput than both traditional wireless routing and prior work on wireless network coding.",

Electricity prices exhibit both temporal and geographic variation, due to regional demand differences, transmission inefficiencies, and generation diversity. Starting with historical electricity prices, for twenty nine locations in the US, and network traffic data collected on Akamai's CDN, we use simulation to quantify the possible economic gains for a realistic workload.

    "abstract": "The ability to provide differentiated services to users with widely varying requirements is becoming increasingly important, and Internet Service Providers would like to provide these differentiated services using the same shared network infrastructure. The key mechanism, that enables differentiation in a connectionless network, is the packet classification function that parses the headers of the packets, and after determining their context, classifies them based on administrative policies or real-time reservation decisions. Packet classification, however, is a complex operation that can become the bottleneck in routers that try to support gigabit link capacities. Hence, many proposals for differentiated services only require classification at lower speed edge routers and also avoid classification based on multiple fields in the packet header even if it might be advantageous to service providers. In this paper, we present new packet classification schemes that, with a worst-case and traffic-independent performance metric, can classify packets, by checking amongst a few thousand filtering rules, at rates of a million packets per second using range matches on more than 4 packet header fields. For a special case of classification in two dimensions, we present an algorithm that can handle more than 128K rules at these speeds in a traffic independent manner. We emphasize worst-case performance over average case performance because providing differentiated services requires intelligent queueing and scheduling of packets that precludes any significant queueing before the differentiating step (i.e., before packet classification). The presented filtering or classification schemes can be used to classify packets for security policy enforcement, applying resource management decisions, flow identification for RSVP reservations, multicast look-ups, and for source-destination and policy based routing. The scalability and performance of the algorithms have been demonstrated by implementation and testing in a prototype system.",

As a result, securing group communications (i.e., providing confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of messages delivered between group members) will become a critical networking issue.In this paper, we present a novel solution to the scalability problem of group/multicast key management. We formalize the notion of a secure group as a triple ( U,K,R ) where U denotes a set of users, K a set of keys held by the users, and R a user-key relation. We then introduce key graphs to specify secure groups. For a special class of key graphs, we present three strategies for securely distributing rekey messages after a join/leave, and specify protocols for joining and leaving a secure group. The rekeying strategies and join/leave protocols are implemented in a prototype group key server we have built. We present measurement results from experiments and discuss performance comparisons. We show that our group key management service, using any of the three rekeying strategies, is scalable to large groups with frequent joins and leaves. In particular, the average measured processing time per join/leave increases linearly with the logarithm of group size.",

These attacks are widely applicable because they stem from the sender behavior specified in RFC 2581 rather than implementation bugs. We then show that it is possible to modify TCP to eliminate this undesirable behavior entirely, without requiring assumptions of any kind about receiver behavior. This is a strong result: with our solution a receiver can only reduce the data transfer rate by misbehaving, thereby eliminating the incentive to do so.",

We point out that RED allows unfair bandwidth sharing when a mixture of the three traffic types shares a link. This unfairness is caused by the fact that at any given time RED imposes the same loss rate on all flows, regardless of their bandwidths.We propose Fair Random Early Drop (FRED), a modified version of RED. FRED uses per-active-flow accounting to impose on each flow a loss rate that depends on the flow's buffer use.We show that FRED provides better protection than RED for adaptive (fragile and robust) flows. In addition, FRED is able to isolate non-adaptive greedy traffic more effectively. Finally, we present a \"two-packet-buffer\" gateway mechanism to support a large number of flows without incurring additional queueing delays inside the network. These improvements are demonstrated by simulations of TCP and UDP traffic.FRED does not make any assumptions about queueing architecture; it will work with a FIFO gateway. FRED's per-active-flow accounting uses memory in proportion to the total number of buffers used: a FRED gateway maintains state only for flows for which it has packets buffered, not for all flows that traverse the gateway.",

This paper provides measurement results showing the impact of the current network environment on a number of traditional and proposed protocol mechanisms (e.g., Path MTU Discovery, Explicit Congestion Notification, etc.).

The outcome, the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol or DCCP, adds to a UDP-like foundation the minimum mechanisms necessary to support congestion control. We thought those mechanisms would resemble TCP's, but without reliability and, especially, cumulative acknowledgements, we had to reconsider almost every aspect of TCP's design.

These revisions only affect the individual link costs (or metrics) on which the PSN (packet switching node) bases its routing decisions. They do not affect the SPF (“shortest path first”) algorithm employed to compute routes (installed in May 1979). The previous link metric was packet delay averaged over a ten second interval, which performed effectively under light-to-moderate traffic conditions. However, in heavily loaded networks it led to routing instabilities and wasted link and processor bandwidth. The revised metric constitutes a move away from the strict delay metric: it acts similar to a delay-based metric under lightly loads and to a capacity-based metric under heavy loads. It will not always result in shortest-delay paths. Since the delay metric produced shortest-delay paths only under conditions of light loading, the revised metric involves giving up the guarantee of shortest-delay paths under light traffic conditions for the sake of vastly improved performance under heavy traffic conditions.",

    "abstract": "The design of the IP protocol makes it difficult to reliably identify the originator of an IP packet. Even in the absence of any deliberate attempt to disguise a packet's origin, wide-spread packet forwarding techniques such as NAT and encapsulation may obscure the packet's true source. Techniques have been developed to determine the source of large packet flows, but, to date, no system has been presented to track individual packets in an efficient, scalable fashion.We present a hash-based technique for IP traceback that generates audit trails for traffic within the network, and can trace the origin of a single IP packet delivered by the network in the recent past. We demonstrate that the system is effective, space-efficient (requiring approximately 0.5% of the link capacity per unit time in storage), and implementable in current or next-generation routing hardware. We present both analytic and simulation results showing the system's effectiveness.",

Unlike many other efforts that have analyzed client accesses as seen by proxies, we focus on the server end. We analyze the dynamics of both the server content and client accesses made to the server. The former considers the content creation and modification process while the latter considers page popularity and locality in client accesses. Some of our key results are: (a) files tend to change little when they are modified, (b) a small set of files tends to get modified repeatedly, (c) file popularity follows a Zipf-like distribution with a parameter &amp;agr that is much larger than reported in previous, proxy-based studies, and (d) there is significant temporal stability in file popularity but not much stability in the domains from which clients access the popular content. We discuss the implications of these findings for techniques such as Web caching (including cache consistency algorithms), and prefetching or server-based ``push'' of Web content.",

    "abstract": "State of the art, real-time, rate-adaptive, multimedia applications adjust their transmission rate to match the available network capacity. Unfortunately, this source-based rate-adaptation performs poorly in a heterogeneous multicast environment because there is no single target rate --- the conflicting bandwidth requirements of all receivers cannot be simultaneously satisfied with one transmission rate. If the burden of rate-adaption is moved from the source to the receivers, heterogeneity is accommodated. One approach to receiver-driven adaptation is to combine a layered source coding algorithm with a layered transmission system. By selectively forwarding subsets of layers at constrained network links, each user receives the best quality signal that the network can deliver. We and others have proposed that selective-forwarding be carried out using multiple IP-Multicast groups where each receiver specifies its level of subscription by joining a subset of the groups. In this paper, we extend the multiple group framework with a rate-adaptation protocol called Receiver-driven Layered Multicast, or RLM. Under RLM, multicast receivers adapt to both the static heterogeneity of link bandwidths as well as dynamic variations in network capacity (i.e., congestion). We describe the RLM protocol and evaluate its performance with a preliminary simulation study that characterizes user-perceived quality by assessing loss rates over multiple time scales. For the configurations we simulated, RLM results in good throughput with transient short-term loss rates on the order of a few percent and long-term loss rates on the order of one percent. Finally, we discuss our implementation of a software-based Internet video codec and its integration with RLM.",

    "abstract": "We study the capacity of static wireless networks, both ad hoc and hybrid, under the Protocol and Physical Models of communication, proposed in [1]. For ad hoc networks with &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; nodes, we show that under the Physical Model, where signal power is assumed to attenuate as 1/r&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;, α &gt; 2, the transport capacity scales as Θ(√&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;) bit-meters/sec. The same bound holds even when the nodes are allowed to approach arbitrarily close to each other and even under a more generalized notion of the Physical Model wherein the data rate is Shannon's logarithmic function of the SINR at the receiver. This result is sharp since it closes the gap that existed between the previous best known upper bound of O(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;α-1/α&lt;/sup&gt;) and lower bound of Ω(√n). We also show that any spatio-temporal scheduling of transmissions and their ranges that is feasible under the Protocol Model can also be realized under the Physical Model by an appropriate choice of power levels for appropriate thresholds. This allows the generalization of various lower bound constructions from the Protocol Model to the Physical Model. In particular, this provides a better lower bound on the best case transport capacity than in [1]. For hybrid networks, we consider an overlay of μ&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; randomly placed wired base stations. It has previously been shown in [6] that if all nodes adopt a common power level, then each node can be provided a throughput of at most Θ(1/log &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;) to randomly chosen destinations. Here we show that by allowing nodes to perform power control and properly choosing ν(1/log &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;), it is further possible to provide a throughput of Θ(1) to any fraction &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;, 0 &lt; &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 1, of nodes. This result holds under both the Protocol and Physical models of communication. On the one hand, it shows that that the aggregate throughput capacity, measured as the sum of individual throughputs, can scale linearly in the number of nodes. On the other hand, the result underscores the importance of choosing minimum power levels for communication and suggests that simply communicating with the closest node or base station could yield good capacity even for multihop hybrid wireless networks.",

Regular expressions are the language of choice for writing signatures, but standard DFA or NFA representations are unsuitable for high-speed environments, requiring too much memory, too much time, or too much per-flow state. DFAs are fast and can be readily combined, but doing so often leads to state-space explosion. NFAs, while small, require large per-flow state and are slow. We propose a solution that simultaneously addresses all these problems. We start with a first-principles characterization of state-space explosion and give conditions that eliminate it when satisfied. We show how auxiliary variables can be used to transform automata so that they satisfy these conditions, which we codify in a formal model that augments DFAs with auxiliary variables and simple instructions for manipulating them. Building on this model, we present techniques, inspired by principles used in compiler optimization, that systematically reduce runtime and per-flow state. In our experiments, signature sets from Snort and Cisco Systems achieve state-space reductions of over four orders of magnitude, per-flow state reductions of up to a factor of six, and runtimes that approach DFAs.",

    "abstract": "Data-intensive applications that operate on large volumes of data have motivated a fresh look at the design of data center networks. The first wave of proposals focused on designing pure packet-switched networks that provide full bisection bandwidth. However, these proposals significantly increase network complexity in terms of the number of links and switches required and the restricted rules to wire them up. On the other hand, optical circuit switching technology holds a very large bandwidth advantage over packet switching technology. This fact motivates us to explore how optical circuit switching technology could benefit a data center network. In particular, we propose a hybrid packet and circuit switched data center network architecture (or HyPaC for short) which augments the traditional hierarchy of packet switches with a high speed, low complexity, rack-to-rack optical circuit-switched network to supply high bandwidth to applications. We discuss the fundamental requirements of this hybrid architecture and their design options. To demonstrate the potential benefits of the hybrid architecture, we have built a prototype system called c-Through. c-Through represents a design point where the responsibility for traffic demand estimation and traffic demultiplexing resides in end hosts, making it compatible with existing packet switches. Our emulation experiments show that the hybrid architecture can provide large benefits to unmodified popular data center applications at a modest scale. Furthermore, our experimental experience provides useful insights on the applicability of the hybrid architecture across a range of deployment scenarios.",

    "abstract": "A family of medium access control protocols for single-channel packet radio networks is specified and analyzed. These protocols are based on a new channel access discipline called floor acquisition multiple access (FAMA), which consists of both carrier sensing and a collision-avoidance dialogue between a source and the intended receiver of a packet. Control of the channel (the floor) is assigned to at most one station in the network at any given time, and this station is guaranteed to be able to transmit one or more data packets to different destinations with no collision with transmissions from other stations. The minimum length needed in control packets to acquire the floor is specified as a function of the channel propagation time. The medium access collision avoidance (MACA) protocol proposed by Karn and variants of CSMA based on collision avoidance are shown to be variants of FAMA protocols when control packets last long enough compared to the channel propagation delay. The throughput of FAMA protocols is analyzed and compared with the throughput of non-persistent CSMA. This analysis shows that using carrier sensing as an integral part of the floor acquisition strategy provides the benefits of MACA in the presence of hidden terminals, and can provide a throughput comparable to, or better than, that of non-persistent CSMA when no hidden terminals exist.",

    "abstract": "Reliable transport protocols such as TCP are tuned to perform well in traditional networks where packet losses occur mostly because of congestion. However, networks with wireless and other lossy links also suffer from significant non-congestion-related losses due to reasons such as bit errors and handoffs. TCP responds to all losses by invoking congestion control and avoidance algorithms, resulting in degraded end-to-end performance in wireless and lossy systems. In this paper, we compare several schemes designed to improve the performance of TCP in such networks. These schemes are classified into three broad categories: end-to-end protocols, where the sender is aware of the wireless link; link-layer protocols, that provide local reliability; and split-connection protocols, that break the end-to-end connection into two parts at the base station. We present the results of several experiments performed in both LAN and WAN environments, using throughput and goodput as the metrics for comparison.Our results show that a reliable link-layer protocol with some knowledge of TCP provides very good performance. Furthermore, it is possible to achieve good performance without splitting the end-to-end connection at the base station. We also demonstrate that selective acknowledgments and explicit loss notifications result in significant performance improvements.",

    "abstract": "Data centers deploy a variety of middleboxes (e.g., firewalls, load balancers and SSL offloaders) to protect, manage and improve the performance of applications and services they run. Since existing networks provide limited support for middleboxes, administrators typically overload path selection mechanisms to coerce traffic through the desired sequences of middleboxes placed on the network path. These ad-hoc practices result in a data center network that is hard to configure and maintain, wastes middlebox resources, and cannot guarantee middlebox traversal under network churn. To address these issues, we propose the policy-aware switching layer or PLayer, a new layer-2 for data centers consisting of inter-connected policy-aware switches or pswitches. Unmodified middleboxes are placed off the network path by plugging them into pswitches. Based on policies specified by administrators, pswitches explicitly forward different types of traffic through different sequences of middleboxes. Experiments using our prototype software pswitches suggest that the PLayer is flexible, uses middleboxes efficiently, and guarantees correct middlebox traversal under churn.",

The work was prompted by the lack of published results concerning the issues associated with the implementation of MANET routing protocols on actual wireless networks, as opposed to results of simulation experiments. We examined implementations of two distance vector MANET routing protocols and found a number of problems with both protocols during the course of our experiments. The most significant was that neither protocol could provide a stable route over any multi-hop network connection. The route discovery process of both protocols is fooled by the transient availability of network links to nodes that were more than one hop away. Packets transmitted over a fading channel cause the routing protocol to conclude incorrectly that there is a new one hop neighbor that could provide a lower metric (hop count) route to even more distant nodes. This can occur even when nodes are stationary, mobility resulted in even less route stability. We implemented a simple signal strength based neighbor selection procedure to test our assertion that fading channels and unreliable network links were the cause of the failure of the routing protocols. The result was that neighbor discovery and the filtering for neighbors with which nodes could communicate reliably enables the creation of reliable multihop routes. Based on our experiences, we outline several recommendations for future work in MANET research.",

We find that current WiFi handoff methods, in which clients communicate with one basestation at a time, lead to frequent disruptions in connectivity. We also find that clients can overcome many disruptions by communicating with multiple basestations simultaneously. These findings lead us to develop ViFi, a protocol that opportunistically exploits basestation diversity to minimize disruptions and support interactive applications for mobile clients. ViFi uses a decentralized and lightweight probabilistic algorithm for coordination between participating basestations. Our evaluation using a two-month long deployment and trace-driven simulations shows that its link-layer performance comes close to an ideal diversity-based protocol. Using two applications, VoIP and short TCP transfers, we show that the link layer performance improvement translates to better application performance. In our deployment, ViFi doubles the number of successful short TCP transfers and doubles the length of disruption-free VoIP sessions compared to an existing WiFi-style handoff protocol.",

In this work we introduce novel heuristics for inferring AS relationships. Our heuristics improve upon previous works in several technical aspects, which we outline in detail and demonstrate with several examples. Seeking to increase the value and reliability of our inference results, we then focus on validation of inferred AS relationships. We perform a survey with ASs' network administrators to collect information on the actual connectivity and policies of the surveyed ASs. Based on the survey results, we find that our new AS relationship inference techniques achieve high levels of accuracy: we correctly infer 96.5% customer to provider (c2p), 82.8% peer to peer (p2p), and 90.3% sibling to sibling (s2s) relationships. We then cross-compare the reported AS connectivity with the AS connectivity data contained in BGP tables. We find that BGP tables miss up to 86.2% of the true adjacencies of the surveyed ASs. The majority of the missing links are of the p2p type, which highlights the limitations of present measuring techniques to capture links of this type. Finally, to make our results easily accessible and practically useful for the community, we open an AS relationship repository where we archive, on a weekly basis, and make publicly available the complete Internet AS-level topology annotated with AS relationship information for every pair of AS neighbors.",

Among our findings is that the simple strategy of picking a uniform-random replacement whenever a node fails performs surprisingly well. We explain its performance through analysis in a stochastic model.Second, we show that a class of strategies, which we call \"Preference List\" strategies, arise commonly as a result of optimizing for a metric other than churn, and produce high churn relative to more randomized strategies under realistic node failure patterns. Using this insight, we demonstrate and explain differences in performance for designs that incorporate varying degrees of randomization. We give examples from a variety of protocols, including anycast, over-lay multicast, and distributed hash tables. In many cases, simply adding some randomization can go a long way towards reducing churn.",

    "abstract": "An important class of datacenter applications, called Online Data-Intensive (OLDI) applications, includes Web search, online retail, and advertisement. To achieve good user experience, OLDI applications operate under soft-real-time constraints (e.g., 300 ms latency) which imply deadlines for network communication within the applications. Further, OLDI applications typically employ tree-based algorithms which, in the common case, result in bursts of children-to-parent traffic with tight deadlines. Recent work on datacenter network protocols is either deadline-agnostic (DCTCP) or is deadline-aware (D3) but suffers under bursts due to race conditions. Further, D3 has the practical drawbacks of requiring changes to the switch hardware and not being able to coexist with legacy TCP. We propose Deadline-Aware Datacenter TCP (D2TCP), a novel transport protocol, which handles bursts, is deadline-aware, and is readily deployable. In designing D2TCP, we make two contributions: (1) D2TCP uses a distributed and reactive approach for bandwidth allocation which fundamentally enables D2TCP's properties. (2) D2TCP employs a novel congestion avoidance algorithm, which uses ECN feedback and deadlines to modulate the congestion window via a gamma-correction function. Using a small-scale implementation and at-scale simulations, we show that D2TCP reduces the fraction of missed deadlines compared to DCTCP and D3 by 75% and 50%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The shared nature of the network in today's multi-tenant datacenters implies that network performance for tenants can vary significantly. This applies to both production datacenters and cloud environments. Network performance variability hurts application performance which makes tenant costs unpredictable and causes provider revenue loss. Motivated by these factors, this paper makes the case for extending the tenant-provider interface to explicitly account for the network. We argue this can be achieved by providing tenants with a virtual network connecting their compute instances. To this effect, the key contribution of this paper is the design of virtual network abstractions that capture the trade-off between the performance guarantees offered to tenants, their costs and the provider revenue. To illustrate the feasibility of virtual networks, we develop Oktopus, a system that implements the proposed abstractions. Using realistic, large-scale simulations and an Oktopus deployment on a 25-node two-tier testbed, we demonstrate that the use of virtual networks yields significantly better and more predictable tenant performance. Further, using a simple pricing model, we find that the our abstractions can reduce tenant costs by up to 74% while maintaining provider revenue neutrality.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale Internet applications can benefit from an ability to predict round-trip times to other hosts without having to contact them first. Explicit measurements are often unattractive because the cost of measurement can outweigh the benefits of exploiting proximity information. Vivaldi is a simple, light-weight algorithm that assigns synthetic coordinates to hosts such that the distance between the coordinates of two hosts accurately predicts the communication latency between the hosts. Vivaldi is fully distributed, requiring no fixed network infrastructure and no distinguished hosts. It is also efficient: a new host can compute good coordinates for itself after collecting latency information from only a few other hosts. Because it requires little com-munication, Vivaldi can piggy-back on the communication patterns of the application using it and scale to a large number of hosts. An evaluation of Vivaldi using a simulated network whose latencies are based on measurements among 1740 Internet hosts shows that a 2-dimensional Euclidean model with height vectors embeds these hosts with low error (the median relative error in round-trip time prediction is 11 percent).",

    "abstract": "All Internet routers contain buffers to hold packets during times of congestion. Today, the size of the buffers is determined by the dynamics of TCP's congestion control algorithm. In particular, the goal is to make sure that when a link is congested, it is busy 100% of the time; which is equivalent to making sure its buffer never goes empty. A widely used rule-of-thumb states that each link needs a buffer of size B = overline RTT x C , where overline RTT is the average round-trip time of a flow passing across the link, and C is the data rate of the link. For example, a 10Gb/s router linecard needs approximately 250ms x 10Gb/s = 2.5Gbits of buffers; and the amount of buffering grows linearly with the line-rate. Such large buffers are challenging for router manufacturers, who must use large, slow, off-chip DRAMs. And queueing delays can be long, have high variance, and may destabilize the congestion control algorithms. In this paper we argue that the rule-of-thumb ( B = (overline RTT x C ) is now outdated and incorrect for backbone routers. This is because of the large number of flows (TCP connections) multiplexed together on a single backbone link. Using theory, simulation and experiments on a network of real routers, we show that a link with n flows requires no more than B = (overline RTT x C ) √ n , for long-lived or short-lived TCP flows. The consequences on router design are enormous: A 2.5Gb/s link carrying 10,000 flows could reduce its buffers by 99% with negligible difference in throughput; and a 10Gb/s link carrying 50,000 flows requires only 10Mbits of buffering, which can easily be implemented using fast, on-chip SRAM.",

    "abstract": "Based on experiments conducted in a network simulator and over real networks, this paper proposes changes to the congestion control scheme in current TCP implementations to improve its behavior during the start-up period of a TCP connection.The scheme, which includes Slow-start, Fast Retransmit, and Fast Recovery algorithms, uses acknowledgments from a receiver to dynamically calculate reasonable operating values for a sender's TCP parameters governing when and how much a sender can pump into the network. During the start-up period, because a TCP sender starts with default parameters, it often ends up sending too many packets and too fast, leading to multiple losses of packets from the same window. This paper shows that recovery from losses during this start-up period is often unnecessarily time-consuming.In particular, using the current Fast Retransmit algorithm, when multiple packets in the same window are lost, only one of the packet losses may be recovered by each Fast Retransmit; the rest are often recovered by Slow-start after a usually lengthy retransmission timeout. Thus, this paper proposes changes to the Fast Retransmit algorithm so that it can quickly recover from multiple packet losses without waiting unnecessarily for the timeout. These changes, tested in the simulator and on the real networks, show significant performance improvements, especially for short TCP transfers. The paper also proposes other changes to help minimize the number of packets lost during the start-up period.",

However, the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) does not facilitate common traffic engineering tasks, such as balancing load across multiple links to a neighboring AS or directing traffic to a different neighbor. Solving these problems is difficult because the number of possible changes to routing policies is too large to exhaustively test all possibilities, some changes in routing policy can have an unpredictable effect on the flow of traffic, and the BGP decision process implemented by router vendors limits an operator's control over path selection.We propose fundamental objectives for interdomain traffic engineering and specific guidelines for achieving these objectives within the context of BGP . Using routing and traffic data from the AT&amp;T backbone we show how certain BGP policy changes can move traffic in a predictable fashion, despite limited knowledge about the routing policies in neighboring AS's. Then, we show how operators can gain greater flexibility by relaxing some steps in the BGP decision process and ensuring that neighboring AS's send consistent advertisements at each peering location. Finally, we show that an operator can manipulate traffic efficiently by changing the routes for a small number of prefixes (or groups of related prefixes) that consistently receive a large amount of traffic.",

The result is to provide end-systems with a high-level of path diversity that allows them to bypass unde-sirable locations within the network. Unlike explicit source routing, our scheme is inherently scalable and compatible with ISP policies because it derives from the deployed Internet routing.

Rather than manually formulate each endpoint's reaction to congestion signals, as in traditional protocols, we developed a program called Remy that generates congestion-control algorithms to run at the endpoints. In this approach, the protocol designer specifies their prior knowledge or assumptions about the network and an objective that the algorithm will try to achieve, e.g., high throughput and low queueing delay. Remy then produces a distributed algorithm---the control rules for the independent endpoints---that tries to achieve this objective. In simulations with ns-2, Remy-generated algorithms outperformed human-designed end-to-end techniques, including TCP Cubic, Compound, and Vegas. In many cases, Remy's algorithms also outperformed methods that require intrusive in-network changes, including XCP and Cubic-over-sfqCoDel (stochastic fair queueing with CoDel for active queue management). Remy can generate algorithms both for networks where some parameters are known tightly a priori , e.g. datacenters, and for networks where prior knowledge is less precise, such as cellular networks. We characterize the sensitivity of the resulting performance to the specificity of the prior knowledge, and the consequences when real-world conditions contradict the assumptions supplied at design-time.",

However, while high-speed wireless access is easy to achieve in an enterprise network via low-cost IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) access points, wireless technology in public spaces is in its infancy. \"Hot spots\" provide high-speed wireless access, but do so in very few isolated \"islands\" at immense costs. Likewise, while fixed wireless (e.g. LMDS) and 3G can provide ubiquitous coverage and 3G can support mobility, throughputs can often be two orders of magnitude slower than WiFi.In this paper, we formulate the challenges of building a high-performance, scalable and widely deployed wireless Internet along 10 premises. We make the case for the requirement of a fundamental new architecture based on beamforming antennas deployed on fixed, wire-powered Transit Access Points (TAPs) that form a multi-hopping wireless backbone with a limited number of wired ingress/egress points.

Such synthesis is needed because traffic matrices are a crucial input for testing many new networking algorithms, but traffic matrices themselves are generally kept secret by providers. Furthermore, even given traffic matrices from a real network, it is difficult to realistically adjust these to generate a range of scenarios (for instance for different network sizes). This note is concerned with the first step presented in [8]: generation of a matrix with similar statistics to that of a real traffic matrix. The method applied in [8] is based on fitting a large number of distributions, and finding that the log-normal distribution appears to fit most consistently. Best fits (without some intuitive explanation for the fit) are fraught with problems. How general are the results? How do the distribution parameters relate? This note presents a simpler approach based on a gravity model. Its simplicity provides us with a better understanding of the origins of the results of [8], and this insight is useful, particularly because it allows one to adapt the synthesis process to different scenarios in a more intuitive manner. Additionally, [8] measures the quality of its fit to the distribution's body. This note shows that the tails of the distributions are less heavy than the log-normal distribution (a counterintuitive result for Internet traffic), and that the gravity model replicates these tails more accurately.",

    "abstract": "Many past systems have explored how to eliminate redundant transfers from network links and improve network efficiency. Several of these systems operate at the application layer, while the more recent systems operate on individual packets. A common aspect of these systems is that they apply to localized settings, e.g. at stub network access links. In this paper, we explore the benefits of deploying packet-level redundant content elimination as a universal primitive on all Internet routers. Such a universal deployment would immediately reduce link loads everywhere. However, we argue that far more significant network-wide benefits can be derived by redesigning network routing protocols to leverage the universal deployment. We develop \"redundancy-aware\" intra- and inter-domain routing algorithms and show that they enable better traffic engineering, reduce link usage costs, and enhance ISPs' responsiveness to traffic variations. In particular, employing redundancy elimination approaches across redundancy-aware routes can lower intra and inter-domain link loads by 10-50%. We also address key challenges that may hinder implementation of redundancy elimination on fast routers. Our current software router implementation can run at OC48 speeds.",

    "abstract": "As a reliable, end-to-end transport protocol, the ARPA Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) uses positive acknowledgements and retransmission to guarantee delivery. TCP implementations are expected to measure and adapt to changing network propagation delays so that its retransmission behavior balances user throughput and network efficiency. However, TCP suffers from a problem we call retransmission ambiguity : when an acknowledgement arrives for a segment that has been retransmitted, there is no indication which transmission is being acknowledged. Many existing TCP implementations do not handle this problem correctly. This paper reviews the various approaches to retransmission and presents a novel and effective approach to the retransmission ambiguity problem.",

    "abstract": "As multicast applications are deployed for mainstream use, the need to secure multicast communications will become critical. Multicast, however, does not fit the point-to-point model of most network security protocols which were designed with unicast communications in mind. As we will show, securing multicast (or group) communications is fundamentally different from securing unicast (or paired) communications. In turn, these differences can result in scalability problems for many typical applications.In this paper, we examine and model the differences between unicast and multicast security and then propose Iolus: a novel framework for scalable secure multicasting. Protocols based on Iolus can be used to achieve a variety of security objectives and may be used either to directly secure multicast communications or to provide a separate group key management service to other \"security-aware\" applications. We describe the architecture and operation of Iolus in detail and also describe our experience with a protocol based on the Iolus framework.",

    "abstract": "For some time, the networking community has assumed that it is impossible to do IP routing lookups in software fast enough to support gigabit speeds. IP routing lookups must find the routing entry with the longest matching prefix , a task that has been thought to require hardware support at lookup frequencies of millions per second.We present a forwarding table data structure designed for quick routing lookups. Forwarding tables are small enough to fit in the cache of a conventional general purpose processor. With the table in cache, a 200 MHz Pentium Pro or a 333 MHz Alpha 21164 can perform a few million lookups per second. This means that it is feasible to do a full routing lookup for each IP packet at gigabit speeds without special hardware.The forwarding tables are very small, a large routing table with 40,000 routing entries can be compacted to a forwarding table of 150-160 Kbytes. A lookup typically requires less than 100 instructions on an Alpha, using eight memory references accessing a total of 14 bytes.",

Central to the StopIt design is a novel closed-control, open-service architecture: any receiver can use StopIt to block the undesired traffic it receives, yet the design is robust to various strategic attacks from millions of bots, including filter exhaustion attacks and bandwidth flooding attacks that aim to disrupt the timely installation of filters. Our evaluation shows that StopIt can block the attack traffic from a few millions of attackers within tens of minutes with bounded router memory. We compare StopIt with existing filter-based and capability-based DoS defense systems under simulated DoS attacks of various types and scales. Our results show that StopIt outperforms existing filter-based systems, and can prevent legitimate communications from being disrupted by various DoS flooding attacks. It also outperforms capability-based systems in most attack scenarios, but a capability-based system is more effective in a type of attack that the attack traffic does not reach a victim, but congests a link shared by the victim. These results suggest that both filters and capabilities are highly effective DoS defense mechanisms, but neither is more effective than the other in all types of DoS attacks.",

First, packets from the individual connections, rather than being mixed together, completely separate into individual clusters.

For simulations of congested networks, the effective throughput of TCP over ATM can be quite low when cells are dropped at the congested ATM switch. The low throughput is due to wasted bandwidth as the congested link transmits cells from “corrupted” packets, i.e., packets in which at least one cell is dropped by the switch. This fragmentation effect can be corrected and high throughput can be achieved if the switch drops whole packets prior to buffer overflow; we call this strategy Early Packet Discard. We also discuss general issues of congestion avoidance for best-effort traffic in ATM networks.",

We can also identify simple gestures made behind a wall, and combine a sequence of gestures to communicate messages to a wireless receiver without carrying any transmitting device. The paper introduces two main innovations. First, it shows how one can use MIMO interference nulling to eliminate reflections off static objects and focus the receiver on a moving target. Second, it shows how one can track a human by treating the motion of a human body as an antenna array and tracking the resulting RF beam.

Though long believed to be robust to strategic manipulation, recent work has empirically shown that BitTorrent does not provide its users incentive to follow the protocol. We propose an auction-based model to study and improve upon BitTorrent's incentives. The insight behind our model is that BitTorrent uses, not tit-for-tat as widely believed, but an auction to decide which peers to serve. Our model not only captures known, performance-improving strategies, it shapes our thinking toward new, effective strategies. For example, our analysis demonstrates, counter-intuitively, that BitTorrent peers have incentive to intelligently under-report what pieces of the file they have to their neighbors. We implement and evaluate a modification to BitTorrent in which peers reward one another with proportional shares of bandwidth. Within our game-theoretic model, we prove that a proportional-share client is strategy-proof. With experiments on PlanetLab, a local cluster, and live downloads, we show that a proportional-share unchoker yields faster downloads against BitTorrent and BitTyrant clients, and that under-reporting pieces yields prolonged neighbor interest.",

We evaluate path splicing for intradomain routing using slices generated from perturbed link weights and find that splicing achieves reliability that approaches the best possible using a small number of slices, for only a small increase in latency and no adverse effects on traffic in the network. In the case of interdomain routing, where splicing derives multiple trees from edges in alternate backup routes, path splicing achieves near-optimal reliability and can provide significant benefits even when only a fraction of ASes deploy it. We also describe several other applications of path splicing, as well as various possible deployment paths.",

Additionally, to minimize client download times, such systems perform extensive network and server measurements, and use them to redirect clients to different servers over short time scales. In this paper, we explore techniques for inferring and exploiting network measurements performed by the largest CDN, Akamai; our objective is to locate and utilize quality Internet paths without performing extensive path probing or monitoring.Our contributions are threefold. First, we conduct a broad measurement study of Akamai's CDN. We probe Akamai's network from 140 PlanetLab vantage points for two months. We find that Akamai redirection times, while slightly higher than advertised, are sufficiently low to be useful for network control. Second, we empirically show that Akamai redirections overwhelmingly correlate with network latencies on the paths between clients and the Akamai servers. Finally, we illustrate how large-scale overlay networks can exploit Akamai redirections to identify the best detouring nodes for one-hop source routing. Our research shows that in more than 50% of investigated scenarios, it is better to route through the nodes \"recommended\" by Akamai, than to use the direct paths. Because this is not the case for the rest of the scenarios, we develop lowoverhead pruning algorithms that avoid Akamai-driven paths when they are not beneficial.",

    "abstract": "The soft real-time nature of large scale web applications in today's datacenters, combined with their distributed workflow, leads to deadlines being associated with the datacenter application traffic. A network flow is useful, and contributes to application throughput and operator revenue if, and only if, it completes within its deadline. Today's transport pro- tocols (TCP included), given their Internet origins, are agnostic to such flow deadlines. Instead, they strive to share network resources fairly. We show that this can hurt application performance. Motivated by these observations, and other (previously known) deficiencies of TCP in the datacenter environment, this paper presents the design and implementation of D3, a deadline-aware control protocol that is customized for the datacenter environment. D3 uses explicit rate control to apportion bandwidth according to flow deadlines. Evaluation from a 19-node, two-tier datacenter testbed shows that D3, even without any deadline information, easily outper- forms TCP in terms of short flow latency and burst tolerance. Further, by utilizing deadline information, D3 effectively doubles the peak load that the datacenter network cansupport.",

    "abstract": "It has been reported worldwide that peer-to-peer traffic is taking up a significant portion of backbone networks. In particular, it is prominent in Japan because of the high penetration rate of fiber-based broadband access. In this paper, we first report aggregated traffic measurements collected over 21 months from seven ISPs covering 42% of the Japanese backbone traffic. The backbone is dominated by symmetric residential traffic which increased 37%in 2005. We further investigate residential per-customer trafficc in one of the ISPs by comparing DSL and fiber users, heavy-hitters and normal users, and geographic traffic matrices. The results reveal that a small segment of users dictate the overall behavior; 4% of heavy-hitters account for 75% of the inbound volume, and the fiber users account for 86%of the inbound volume. About 63%of the total residential volume is user-to-user traffic. The dominant applications exhibit poor locality and communicate with a wide range and number of peers. The distribution of heavy-hitters is heavy-tailed without a clear boundary between heavy-hitters and normal users, which suggests that users start playing with peer-to-peer applications, become heavy-hitters, and eventually shift from DSL to fiber. We provide conclusive empirical evidence from a large and diverse set of commercial backbone data that the emergence of new attractive applications has drastically affected traffic usage and capacity engineering requirements.",

Next, a novel inference engine based on formal language methods reconstructs packets that were not captured by any monitor and determines whether each packet was received by its destination. Finally, Wit derives network performance measures from this enhanced trace; we show how to estimate the number of stations competing for the medium. We assess Wit with a mix of real traces and simulation tests. We find that merging and inference both significantly enhance the originally captured trace. We apply Wit to multi-monitor traces from a live network to show how it facilitates 802.11 MAC analyses that would otherwise be difficult or rely on less accurate heuristics.",

VeriFlow is a layer between a software-defined networking controller and network devices that checks for network-wide invariant violations dynamically as each forwarding rule is inserted.

However, trends in communication scenarios show that WHAT is being exchanged becoming more important than WHO are exchanging information. Van Jacobson describes this as moving from interconnecting machines to interconnecting information. Any change of this part of the Internet needs argumentation as to why it should be undertaken in the first place. In this position paper, we identify four key challenges, namely information-centrism of applications, supporting and exposing tussles, increasing accountability, and addressing attention scarcity, that we believe an information-centric internetworking architecture could address better and would make changing such crucial part worthwhile. We recognize, however, that a much larger and more systematic debate for such change is needed, underlined by factual evidence on the gain for such change.",

However, in scenarios that require packet processing to be redistributed across a collection of network function (NF) instances, simultaneously achieving all three goals requires a framework that provides efficient, coordinated control of both internal NF state and network forwarding state. To this end, we design a control plane called OpenNF. We use carefully designed APIs and a clever combination of events and forwarding updates to address race conditions, bound overhead, and accommodate a variety of NFs. Our evaluation shows that OpenNF offers efficient state control without compromising flexibility, and requires modest additions to NFs.",

    "abstract": "Today's data centers face extreme challenges in providing low latency. However, fair sharing, a principle commonly adopted in current congestion control protocols, is far from optimal for satisfying latency requirements. We propose Preemptive Distributed Quick ( PDQ ) flow scheduling, a protocol designed to complete flows quickly and meet flow deadlines. PDQ enables flow preemption to approximate a range of scheduling disciplines. For example, PDQ can emulate a shortest job first algorithm to give priority to the short flows by pausing the contending flows. PDQ borrows ideas from centralized scheduling disciplines and implements them in a fully distributed manner, making it scalable to today's data centers. Further, we develop a multipath version of PDQ to exploit path diversity. Through extensive packet-level and flow-level simulation, we demonstrate that PDQ significantly outperforms TCP, RCP and D 3 in data center environments. We further show that PDQ is stable, resilient to packet loss, and preserves nearly all its performance gains even given inaccurate flow information.",

Existing designs, however, consume significant power and computational resources, and hence cannot be run on low complexity, power constrained backscatter devices. This paper makes two main contributions: (1) we introduce the first multi-antenna cancellation design that operates on backscatter devices while retaining a small form factor and power footprint, (2) we introduce a novel coding mechanism that enables long range communication as well as concurrent transmissions and can be decoded on backscatter devices. We build hardware prototypes of the above designs that can be powered solely using harvested energy from TV and solar sources. The results show that our designs provide benefits for both RFID and ambient backscatter systems: they enable RFID tags to communicate directly with each other at distances of tens of meters and through multiple walls. They also increase the communication rate and range achieved by ambient backscatter systems by 100X and 40X respectively. We believe that this paper represents a substantial leap in the capabilities of backscatter communication.",

    "abstract": "Improving users' quality of experience (QoE) is crucial for sustaining the advertisement and subscription based revenue models that enable the growth of Internet video. Despite the rich literature on video and QoE measurement, our understanding of Internet video QoE is limited because of the shift from traditional methods of measuring video quality (e.g., Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and user experience (e.g., opinion scores). These have been replaced by new quality metrics (e.g., rate of buffering, bitrate) and new engagement centric measures of user experience (e.g., viewing time and number of visits). The goal of this paper is to develop a predictive model of Internet video QoE. To this end, we identify two key requirements for the QoE model: (1) it has to be tied in to observable user engagement and (2) it should be actionable to guide practical system design decisions. Achieving this goal is challenging because the quality metrics are interdependent, they have complex and counter-intuitive relationships to engagement measures, and there are many external factors that confound the relationship between quality and engagement (e.g., type of video, user connectivity). To address these challenges, we present a data-driven approach to model the metric interdependencies and their complex relationships to engagement, and propose a systematic framework to identify and account for the confounding factors. We show that a delivery infrastructure that uses our proposed model to choose CDN and bitrates can achieve more than 20\\% improvement in overall user engagement compared to strawman approaches.",

Central to the calculus are two definitions, maximum-(virtual)-backlog-centric (m. b. c) stochastic arrival curve and stochastic service curve , which respectively generalize arrival curve and service curve in the deterministic network calculus framework. With m. b. c stochastic arrival curve and stochastic service curve, various basic results are derived under the (min, +)algebra for the general case analysis, which are crucial to the development of stochastic network calculus. These results include (i)superposition of flows, (ii)concatenation of servers, (iii) output characterization, (iv)per-flow service under aggregation, and (v)stochastic backlog and delay guarantees. In addition, to perform independent case analysis, stochastic strict server is defined, which uses an ideal service process and an impairment process to characterize a server. The concept of stochastic strict server not only allows us to improve the basic results (i)-(v)under the independent case, but also provides a convenient way to find the stochastic service curve of a serve. Moreover, an approach is introduced to find the m.b.c stochastic arrival curve of a flow and the stochastic service curve of a server.",

However, many applications in gaming and gesture based interface see more benefits in knowing the detailed shape of a motion. Such trajectory tracing requires a resolution several fold higher than what existing RF-based positioning systems can offer. This paper shows that one can provide a dramatic increase in trajectory tracing accuracy, even with a small number of antennas. The key enabler for our design is a multi-resolution positioning technique that exploits an intrinsic tradeoff between improving the resolution and resolving ambiguity in the location of the RF source. The unique property of this design is its ability to precisely reconstruct the minute details in the trajectory shape, even when the absolute position might have an offset. We built a prototype of our design with commercial off-the-shelf RFID readers and tags and used it to enable a virtual touch screen, which allows a user to interact with a desired computing device by gesturing or writing her commands in the air, where each letter is only a few centimeters wide.",

    "abstract": "Wideband technologies in the unlicensed spectrum can satisfy the ever-increasing demands for wireless bandwidth created by emerging rich media applications. The key challenge for such systems, however, is to allow narrowband technologies that share these bands (say, 802.11 a/b/g/n, Zigbee) to achieve their normal performance, without compromising the throughput or range of the wideband network. This paper presents SWIFT, the first system where high-throughput wideband nodes are shown in a working deployment to coexist with unknown narrowband devices, while forming a network of their own. Prior work avoids narrowband devices by operating below the noise level and limiting itself to a single contiguous unused band. While this achieves coexistence, it sacrifices the throughput and operating distance of the wideband device. In contrast, SWIFT creates high throughput wireless links by weaving together non-contiguous unused frequency bands that change as narrowband devices enter or leave the environment. This design principle of cognitive aggregation allows SWIFT to achieve coexistence, while operating at normal power, and thereby obtaining higher throughput and greater operating range. We implement SWIFT on a wideband hardware platform, and evaluate it in the presence of 802.11 devices. In comparison to a baseline that coexists with narrowband devices by operating below their noise level, SWIFT is equally narrowband-friendly but achieves 3.6-10.5x higher throughput and 6x greater range.",

Many proposals are addressing the perceived problems, ranging from new enhanced protocols to fix specific problems up to the most radical proposal to redesign and deploy a fully new Internet. Most of the problems in the current Internet are rooted in the tremendous pace of increase of its use. As a consequence there was little time to address the deficiencies of the Internet from an architectural point of view. Within FP7, the European Commission has facilitated the creation of European expert groups around the theme FIRE \"Future Internet Research and Experimentation\". FIRE has two related dimensions: on one hand, promoting experimentally-driven long-term, visionary research on new paradigms and networking concepts and architectures for the future Internet; on the other hand, building a large-scale experimentation facility supporting both medium- and long-term research on networks and services by gradually federating existing and new testbeds for emerging or future Internet technologies. By addressing future challenges for the Internet such as mobility, scalability, security and privacy, this new experimentally-driven approach is challenging the mainstream perceptions for future Internet development. This new initiative is intended to complement the more industrially-driven approaches which are addressed under the FP7 Objective \"The Network of the Future\" within the FP7-ICT Workprogramme 2007-08. FIRE is focused on exploring new and radically better technological solutions for the future Internet, while preserving the \"good\" aspects of the current Internet, in terms of openness, freedom of expression and ubiquitous access. The FIRE activities are being launched in the 2nd ICT call, which closes in October 2007, under the FP7-ICT Objective 1.6 \"New Paradigms and Experimental Facilities\" (budget ε40m).

    "abstract": "Low latency analytics on geographically distributed datasets (across datacenters, edge clusters) is an upcoming and increasingly important challenge. The dominant approach of aggregating all the data to a single datacenter significantly inflates the timeliness of analytics. At the same time, running queries over geo-distributed inputs using the current intra-DC analytics frameworks also leads to high query response times because these frameworks cannot cope with the relatively low and variable capacity of WAN links. We present Iridium, a system for low latency geo-distributed analytics. Iridium achieves low query response times by optimizing placement of both data and tasks of the queries. The joint data and task placement optimization, however, is intractable. Therefore, Iridium uses an online heuristic to redistribute datasets among the sites prior to queries' arrivals, and places the tasks to reduce network bottlenecks during the query's execution. Finally, it also contains a knob to budget WAN usage. Evaluation across eight worldwide EC2 regions using production queries show that Iridium speeds up queries by 3× -- 19× and lowers WAN usage by 15% -- 64% compared to existing baselines.",

    "abstract": "The Internet's routing system is facing stresses due to its poor fundamental scaling properties. Compact routing is a research field that studies fundamental limits of routing scalability and designs algorithms that try to meet these limits. In particular, compact routing research shows that shortest-path routing, forming a core of traditional routing algorithms, cannot guarantee routing table (RT) sizes that on all network topologies grow slower than linearly as functions of the network size. However, there are plenty of compact routing schemes that relax the shortest-path requirement and allow for improved, sublinear RT size scaling that is mathematically provable for all static network topologies. In particular, there exist compact routing schemes designed for grids, trees, and Internet-like topologies that offer RT sizes that scale logarithmically with the network size. In this paper, we demonstrate that in view of recent results in compact routing research, such logarithmic scaling on Internet-like topologies is fundamentally impossible in the presence of topology dynamics or topology-independent (flat) addressing. We use analytic arguments to show that the number of routing control messages per topology change cannot scale better than linearly on Internet-like topologies. We also employ simulations to confirm that logarithmic RT size scaling gets broken by topology-independent addressing, a cornerstone of popular locator-identifier split proposals aiming at improving routing scaling in the presence of network topology dynamics or host mobility. These pessimistic findings lead us to the conclusion that a fundamental re-examination of assumptions behind routing models and abstractions is needed in order to find a routing architecture that would be able to scale \"indefinitely.",

    "abstract": "Extensive measurement studies have shown that end-to-end Internet path performance degradation is correlated with routing dynamics. However, the root cause of the correlation between routing dynamics and such performance degradation is poorly understood. In particular, how do routing changes result in degraded end-to-end path performance in the first place? How do factors such as topological properties, routing policies, and iBGP configurations affect the extent to which such routing events can cause performance degradation? Answers to these questions are critical for improving network performance.In this paper, we conduct extensive measurement that involves both controlled routing updates through two tier-1 ISPs and active probes of a diverse set of end-to-end paths on the Internet. We find that routing changes contribute to end-to-end packet loss significantly. Specifically, we study failover events in which a link failure leads to a routing change and recovery events in which a link repair causes a routing change. In both cases, it is possible to experience data plane performance degradation in terms of increased long loss burst as well as forwarding loops. Furthermore, we find that common routing policies and iBGP configurations of ISPs can directly affect the end-to-end path performance during routing changes. Our work provides new insights into potential measures that network operators can undertake to enhance network performance.",

However, the Internet is composed of a large number of independent autonomous systems (ASes) resulting in complex interactions, and until now no model of the Internet has succeeded in producing predictions of acceptable accuracy.We demonstrate that there are two limitations of prior models: (i) they have all assumed that an Autonomous System (AS) is an atomic structure - it is not, and (ii) models have tended to oversimplify the relationships between ASes. Our approach uses multiple quasi-routers to capture route diversity within the ASes, and is deliberately agnostic regarding the types of relationships between ASes. The resulting model ensures that its routing is consistent with the observed routes. Exploiting a large number of observation points, we show that our model provides accurate predictions for unobserved routes, a first step towards developing structural mod-els of the Internet that enable real applications.",

    "abstract": "Today a spectrum of solutions are available for istributing content over the Internet, ranging from commercial CDNs to ISP-operated CDNs to content-provider-operated CDNs to peer-to-peer CDNs. Some deploy servers in just a few large data centers while others deploy in thousands of locations or even on millions of desktops. Recently, major CDNs have formed strategic alliances with large ISPs to provide content delivery network solutions. Such alliances show the natural evolution of content delivery today driven by the need to address scalability issues and to take advantage of new technology and business opportunities. In this paper we revisit the design and operating space of CDN-ISP collaboration in light of recent ISP and CDN alliances. We identify two key enablers for supporting collaboration and improving content delivery performance: informed end-user to server assignment and in-network server allocation. We report on the design and evaluation of a prototype system, NetPaaS, that materializes them. Relying on traces from the largest commercial CDN and a large tier-1 ISP, we show that NetPaaS is able to increase CDN capacity on-demand, enable coordination, reduce download time, and achieve multiple traffic engineering goals leading to a win-win situation for both ISP and CDN.",

FORTE dynamically controls the fraction of user traffic directed to each datacenter in response to changes in both request workload and carbon footprint. It allows an operator to navigate the three-way tradeoff between access latency, carbon footprint, and electricity costs and to determine an optimal datacenter upgrade plan in response to increases in traffic load. We use FORTE to show that carbon taxes or credits are impractical in incentivizing carbon output reduction by providers of large-scale Internet applications. However, they can reduce carbon emissions by 10% without increasing the mean latency nor the electricity bill.",

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been much excitement in the research community over using social networks to mitigate multiple identity, or Sybil, attacks. A number of schemes have been proposed, but they differ greatly in the algorithms they use and in the networks upon which they are evaluated. As a result, the research community lacks a clear understanding of how these schemes compare against each other, how well they would work on real-world social networks with different structural properties, or whether there exist other (potentially better) ways of Sybil defense. In this paper, we show that, despite their considerable differences, existing Sybil defense schemes work by detecting local communities (i.e., clusters of nodes more tightly knit than the rest of the graph) around a trusted node. Our finding has important implications for both existing and future designs of Sybil defense schemes. First, we show that there is an opportunity to leverage the substantial amount of prior work on general community detection algorithms in order to defend against Sybils. Second, our analysis reveals the fundamental limits of current social network-based Sybil defenses: We demonstrate that networks with well-defined community structure are inherently more vulnerable to Sybil attacks, and that, in such networks, Sybils can carefully target their links in order make their attacks more effective.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosing problems in networks is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Existing tools to assist operators primarily focus on analyzing control plane configuration. Configuration analysis is limited in that it cannot find bugs in router software, and is harder to generalize across protocols since it must model complex configuration languages and dynamic protocol behavior. This paper studies an alternate approach: diagnosing problems through static analysis of the data plane. This approach can catch bugs that are invisible at the level of configuration files, and simplifies unified analysis of a network across many protocols and implementations. We present Anteater, a tool for checking invariants in the data plane. Anteater translates high-level network invariants into boolean satisfiability problems (SAT), checks them against network state using a SAT solver, and reports counterexamples if violations have been found. Applied to a large university network, Anteater revealed 23 bugs, including forwarding loops and stale ACL rules, with only five false positives. Nine of these faults are being fixed by campus network operators.",

    "abstract": "We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of CONGA, a network-based distributed congestion-aware load balancing mechanism for datacenters. CONGA exploits recent trends including the use of regular Clos topologies and overlays for network virtualization. It splits TCP flows into flowlets, estimates real-time congestion on fabric paths, and allocates flowlets to paths based on feedback from remote switches. This enables CONGA to efficiently balance load and seamlessly handle asymmetry, without requiring any TCP modifications. CONGA has been implemented in custom ASICs as part of a new datacenter fabric. In testbed experiments, CONGA has 5x better flow completion times than ECMP even with a single link failure and achieves 2-8x better throughput than MPTCP in Incast scenarios. Further, the Price of Anarchy for CONGA is provably small in Leaf-Spine topologies; hence CONGA is nearly as effective as a centralized scheduler while being able to react to congestion in microseconds. Our main thesis is that datacenter fabric load balancing is best done in the network, and requires global schemes such as CONGA to handle asymmetry.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of social and technological networks has attracted a lot of attention as social networking applications and mobile sensing devices have given us a wealth of real data. Classic studies looked at analysing static or aggregated networks, i.e., networks that do not change over time or built as the results of aggregation of information over a certain period of time. Given the soaring collections of measurements related to very large, real network traces, researchers are quickly starting to realise that connections are inherently varying over time and exhibit more dimensionality than static analysis can capture. In this paper we propose new temporal distance metrics to quantify and compare the speed (delay) of information diffusion processes taking into account the evolution of a network from a global view. We show how these metrics are able to capture the temporal characteristics of time-varying graphs, such as delay, duration and time order of contacts (interactions), compared to the metrics used in the past on static graphs. We also characterise network reachability with the concepts of in- and out-components. Then, we generalise them with a global perspective by defining temporal connected components. As a proof of concept we apply these techniques to two classes of time-varying networks, namely connectivity of mobile devices and interactions on an online social network.",

As LTE deployments move towards femto and pico cells, even operators struggle to fully understand the propagation and interference patterns affecting their service, particularly indoors. This paper introduces LTEye, the first open platform to monitor and analyze LTE radio performance at a fine temporal and spatial granularity. LTEye accesses the LTE PHY layer without requiring private user information or provider support. It provides deep insights into the PHY-layer protocols deployed in these networks. LTEye's analytics enable researchers and policy makers to uncover serious deficiencies in these networks due to inefficient spectrum utilization and inter-cell interference. In addition, LTEye extends synthetic aperture radar (SAR), widely used for radar and backscatter signals, to operate over cellular signals. This enables businesses and end-users to localize mobile users and capture the distribution of LTE performance across spatial locations in their facility. As a result, they can diagnose problems and better plan deployment of repeaters or femto cells. We implement LTEye on USRP software radios, and present empirical insights and analytics from multiple AT&amp;T and Verizon base stations in our locality.",

This is because interacting players must frequently exchange state updates, and high player counts would exceed the bandwidth available to participating machines. In this paper, we describe Donnybrook, a system that enables epic-scale battles without dedicated server resources, even in a fast-paced game with tight latency bounds. It achieves this scalability through two novel components. First, it reduces bandwidth demand by estimating what players are paying attention to, thereby enabling it to reduce the frequency of sending less important state updates. Second, it overcomes resource and interest heterogeneity by disseminating updates via a multicast system designed for the special requirements of games: that they have multiple sources, are latency-sensitive, and have frequent group membership changes. We present user study results using a prototype implementation based on Quake III that show our approach provides a desirable user experience. We also present simulation results that demonstrate Donnybrook's efficacy in enabling battles of up to 900 players.",

    "abstract": "Wireless communication has become an intrinsic part of modern implantable medical devices (IMDs). Recent work, however, has demonstrated that wireless connectivity can be exploited to compromise the confidentiality of IMDs' transmitted data or to send unauthorized commands to IMDs---even commands that cause the device to deliver an electric shock to the patient. The key challenge in addressing these attacks stems from the difficulty of modifying or replacing already-implanted IMDs. Thus, in this paper, we explore the feasibility of protecting an implantable device from such attacks without modifying the device itself. We present a physical-layer solution that delegates the security of an IMD to a personal base station called the shield . The shield uses a novel radio design that can act as a jammer-cum-receiver. This design allows it to jam the IMD's messages, preventing others from decoding them while being able to decode them itself. It also allows the shield to jam unauthorized commands---even those that try to alter the shield's own transmissions. We implement our design in a software radio and evaluate it with commercial IMDs. We find that it effectively provides confidentiality for private data and protects the IMD from unauthorized commands.",

In this paper, we explore its use to relieve hotspots in oversubscribed data center (DC) networks. By experimenting with prototype equipment, we show that the DC environment is well suited to a deployment of 60GHz links contrary to concerns about interference and link reliability. Using directional antennas, many wireless links can run concurrently at multi-Gbps rates on top-of-rack (ToR) switches. The wired DC network can be used to sidestep several common wireless problems. By analyzing production traces of DC traffic for four real applications, we show that adding a small amount of network capacity in the form of wireless flyways to the wired DC network can improve performance. However, to be of significant value, we find that one hop indirect routing is needed. Informed by our 60GHz experiments and DC traffic analysis, we present a design that uses DC traffic levels to select and adds flyways to the wired DC network. Trace-driven evaluations show that network-limited DC applications with predictable traffic workloads running on a 1:2 oversubscribed network can be sped up by 45% in 95% of the cases, with just one wireless device per ToR switch. With two devices, in 40% of the cases, the performance is identical to that of a non-oversubscribed network.",

    "abstract": "Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has seen a significant resurgence in recent years. ICN promises benefits to users and service providers along several dimensions (e.g., performance, security, and mobility). These benefits, however, come at a non-trivial cost as many ICN proposals envision adding significant complexity to the network by having routers serve as content caches and support nearest-replica routing. This paper is driven by the simple question of whether this additional complexity is justified and if we can achieve these benefits in an incrementally deployable fashion. To this end, we use trace-driven simulations to analyze the quantitative benefits attributed to ICN (e.g., lower latency and congestion). Somewhat surprisingly, we find that pervasive caching and nearest-replica routing are not fundamentally necessary---most of the performance benefits can be achieved with simpler caching architectures. We also discuss how the qualitative benefits of ICN (e.g., security, mobility) can be achieved without any changes to the network. Building on these insights, we present a proof-of-concept design of an incrementally deployable ICN architecture.",

Load balancing schemes based on flow hashing, e.g., ECMP, cause congestion when hash collisions occur and can perform poorly in asymmetric topologies. Recent proposals to load balance the network require centralized traffic engineering, multipath-aware transport, or expensive specialized hardware. We propose a mechanism that avoids these limitations by (i) pushing load-balancing functionality into the soft network edge (e.g., virtual switches) such that no changes are required in the transport layer, customer VMs, or networking hardware, and (ii) load balancing on fine-grained, near-uniform units of data (flowcells) that fit within end-host segment offload optimizations used to support fast networking speeds. We design and implement such a soft-edge load balancing scheme, called Presto, and evaluate it on a 10 Gbps physical testbed. We demonstrate the computational impact of packet reordering on receivers and propose a mechanism to handle reordering in the TCP receive offload functionality. Presto's performance closely tracks that of a single, non-blocking switch over many workloads and is adaptive to failures and topology asymmetry.",

These properties suggest the possibility of offloading most of the traffic from a complex controller (e.g., a software router) to a simple forwarder (e.g., a commodity switch), by letting the forwarder handle a very limited set of flows; the heavy hitters. As the volume of traffic from a set of flows is highly dynamic, maintaining a reliable set of heavy hitters over time is challenging. This is especially true when we face a volume limit in the non-offloaded traffic in combination with a constraint in the size of the heavy hitter set or its rate of change. We propose a set selection strategy that takes advantage of the properties of heavy hitters at different time scales. Based on real Internet traffic traces, we show that our strategy is able to offload most of the traffic while limiting the rate of change of the heavy hitter set, suggesting the feasibility of alternative router designs.",

However, the interactions among applications, network transport protocol, and the radio layer still remain unexplored. In this work, we conduct an in-depth study of these interactions and their impact on performance, using a combination of active and passive measurements. We observed that LTE has significantly shorter state promotion delays and lower RTTs than those of 3G networks. We discovered various inefficiencies in TCP over LTE such as undesired slow start. We further developed a novel and lightweight passive bandwidth estimation technique for LTE networks. Using this tool, we discovered that many TCP connections significantly under-utilize the available bandwidth. On average, the actually used bandwidth is less than 50% of the available bandwidth. This causes data downloads to be longer, and incur additional energy overhead. We found that the under-utilization can be caused by both application behavior and TCP parameter setting. We found that 52.6% of all downlink TCP flows have been throttled by limited TCP receive window, and that data transfer patterns for some popular applications are both energy and network unfriendly. All these findings highlight the need to develop transport protocol mechanisms and applications that are more LTE-friendly.",

    "abstract": "BGP severely constrains how networks can deliver traffic over the Internet. Today's networks can only forward traffic based on the destination IP prefix, by selecting among routes offered by their immediate neighbors. We believe Software Defined Networking (SDN) could revolutionize wide-area traffic delivery, by offering direct control over packet-processing rules that match on multiple header fields and perform a variety of actions. Internet exchange points (IXPs) are a compelling place to start, given their central role in interconnecting many networks and their growing importance in bringing popular content closer to end users. To realize a Software Defined IXP (an \"SDX\"), we must create compelling applications, such as \"application-specific peering\"---where two networks peer only for (say) streaming video traffic. We also need new programming abstractions that allow participating networks to create and run these applications and a runtime that both behaves correctly when interacting with BGP and ensures that applications do not interfere with each other. Finally, we must ensure that the system scales, both in rule-table size and computational overhead. In this paper, we tackle these challenges and demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of our solutions through controlled and in-the-wild experiments. Our experiments demonstrate that our SDX implementation can implement representative policies for hundreds of participants who advertise full routing tables while achieving sub-second convergence in response to configuration changes and routing updates.",

    "abstract": "Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) are generally considered to be the successors of the four Network Access Points (NAPs) that were mandated as part of the decommissioning of the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) in 1994/95 to facilitate the transition from the NSFNET to the \"public Internet\" as we know it today. While this popular view does not tell the whole story behind the early beginnings of IXPs, what is true is that since around 1994, the number of operational IXPs worldwide has grown to more than 300 (as of May 2013), with the largest IXPs handling daily traffic volumes comparable to those carried by the largest Tier-1 ISPs. However, IXPs have never really attracted much attention from the networking research community. At first glance, this lack of interest seems understandable as IXPs have apparently little to do with current \"hot\" topic areas such as data centers and cloud services or Software Defined Networking (SDN) and mobile communication. However, we argue in this article that, in fact, IXPs are all about data centers and cloud services and even SDN and mobile communication and should be of great interest to networking researchers interested in understanding the current and future Internet ecosystem. To this end, we survey the existing but largely fragmented sources of publicly available information about IXPs to describe their basic technical and operational aspects and highlight the critical differences among the various IXPs in the different regions of the world, especially in Europe and North America. More importantly, we illustrate the important role that IXPs play in today's Internet ecosystem and discuss how IXP-driven innovation in Europe is shaping and redefining the Internet marketplace, not only in Europe but increasingly so around the world.",

Even when the initial and final configurations are correct, the update process itself often steps through intermediate configurations that exhibit incorrect behaviors. This paper introduces the notion of consistent network updates---updates that are guaranteed to preserve well-defined behaviors when transitioning mbetween configurations. We identify two distinct consistency levels, per-packet and per-flow, and we present general mechanisms for implementing them in Software-Defined Networks using switch APIs like OpenFlow. We develop a formal model of OpenFlow networks, and prove that consistent updates preserve a large class of properties. We describe our prototype implementation, including several optimizations that reduce the overhead required to perform consistent updates. We present a verification tool that leverages consistent updates to significantly reduce the complexity of checking the correctness of network control software. Finally, we describe the results of some simple experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of these optimizations on example applications.",

    "abstract": "MobilityFirst is a future Internet architecture with mobility and trustworthiness as central design goals. Mobility means that all endpoints -- devices, services, content, and networks -- should be able to frequently change network attachment points in a seamless manner. Trustworthiness means that the network must be resilient to the presence of a small number of malicious endpoints or network routers. MobilityFirst enhances mobility by cleanly separating names or identifiers from addresses or network locations, and enhances security by representing both in an intrinsically verifiable manner, relying upon a massively scalable, distributed, global name service to bind names and addresses, and to facilitate services including device-to-service, multicast, anycast, and context-aware communication, content retrieval, and more. A key insight emerging from our experience is that a logically centralized global name service can significantly enhance mobility and security and transform network-layer functionality. Recognizing and validating this insight is the key contribution of the MobilityFirst architectural effort.",

    "abstract": "Modern data centers are massive, and support a range of distributed applications across potentially hundreds of server racks. As their utilization and bandwidth needs continue to grow, traditional methods of augmenting bandwidth have proven complex and costly in time and resources. Recent measurements show that data center traffic is often limited by congestion loss caused by short traffic bursts. Thus an attractive alternative to adding physical bandwidth is to augment wired links with wireless links in the 60 GHz band. We address two limitations with current 60 GHz wireless proposals. First, 60 GHz wireless links are limited by line-of-sight, and can be blocked by even small obstacles. Second, even beamforming links leak power, and potential interference will severely limit concurrent transmissions in dense data centers. We propose and evaluate a new wireless primitive for data centers, 3D beamforming , where 60 GHz signals bounce off data center ceilings, thus establishing indirect line-of-sight between any two racks in a data center. We build a small 3D beamforming testbed to demonstrate its ability to address both link blockage and link interference, thus improving link range and number of concurrent transmissions in the data center. In addition, we propose a simple link scheduler and use traffic simulations to show that these 3D links significantly expand wireless capacity compared to their 2D counterparts.",

    "abstract": "An ideal datacenter network should provide several properties, including low median and tail latency, high utilization (throughput), fair allocation of network resources between users or applications, deadline-aware scheduling, and congestion (loss) avoidance. Current datacenter networks inherit the principles that went into the design of the Internet, where packet transmission and path selection decisions are distributed among the endpoints and routers. Instead, we propose that each sender should delegate control---to a centralized arbiter---of when each packet should be transmitted and what path it should follow. This paper describes Fastpass, a datacenter network architecture built using this principle. Fastpass incorporates two fast algorithms: the first determines the time at which each packet should be transmitted, while the second determines the path to use for that packet. In addition, Fastpass uses an efficient protocol between the endpoints and the arbiter and an arbiter replication strategy for fault-tolerant failover. We deployed and evaluated Fastpass in a portion of Facebook's datacenter network. Our results show that Fastpass achieves high throughput comparable to current networks at a 240x reduction is queue lengths (4.35 Mbytes reducing to 18 Kbytes), achieves much fairer and consistent flow throughputs than the baseline TCP (5200x reduction in the standard deviation of per-flow throughput with five concurrent connections), scalability from 1 to 8 cores in the arbiter implementation with the ability to schedule 2.21 Terabits/s of traffic in software on eight cores, and a 2.5x reduction in the number of TCP retransmissions in a latency-sensitive service at Facebook.",

However, the relatively slow switching times (10--100 ms) assumed by these approaches, and the accompanying latencies of their control planes, has limited its use to only the largest data center networks with highly aggregated and constrained workloads. As faster switch technologies become available, designing a control plane capable of supporting them becomes a key challenge. In this paper, we design and implement an OCS prototype capable of switching in 11.5 us, and we use this prototype to expose a set of challenges that arise when supporting switching at microsecond time scales. In response, we propose a microsecond-latency control plane based on a circuit scheduling approach we call Traffic Matrix Scheduling (TMS) that proactively communicates circuit assignments to communicating entities so that circuit bandwidth can be used efficiently.",

CON comes with a potential for a wide range of benefits, including reduced congestion and improved delivery speed by means of content caching, simpler configuration of network devices, and security at the data level. However, it remains an interesting open question whether or not, and to what extent, this emerging networking paradigm bears new privacy challenges. In this paper, we provide a systematic privacy analysis of CON and the common building blocks among its various architectural instances in order to highlight emerging privacy threats, and analyze a few potential countermeasures.

    "abstract": "In contrast to today's IP-based host-oriented Internet architecture, Information-Centric Networking (ICN) emphasizes content by making it directly addressable and routable. Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture is an instance of ICN that is being developed as a candidate next-generation Internet architecture. By opportunistically caching content within the network, NDN appears to be well-suited for large-scale content distribution and for meeting the needs of increasingly mobile and bandwidth-hungry applications that dominate today's Internet. One key feature of NDN is the requirement for each content object to be digitally signed by its producer. Thus, NDN should be, in principle, immune to distributing fake (aka \"poisoned\") content. However, in practice, this poses two challenges for detecting fake content in NDN routers: (1) overhead due to signature verification and certificate chain traversal, and (2) lack of trust context, i.e., determining which public keys are trusted to verify which content. Because of these issues, NDN does not force routers to verify content signatures, which makes the architecture susceptible to content poisoning attacks. This paper explores root causes of, and some cures for, content poisoning attacks in NDN. In the process, it becomes apparent that meaningful mitigation of content poisoning is contingent upon a network-layer trust management architecture, elements of which we construct, while carefully justifying specific design choices. This work represents the initial effort towards comprehensive trust management for NDN.",

However, new flexible hardware is on the horizon that will provide customizable packet processing pipelines needed to implement Paxos. While this new hardware is still not readily available, several vendors and consortia have made the programming languages that target these devices public. This paper describes an implementation of Paxos in one of those languages, P4. Implementing Paxos provides a critical use case for P4, and will help drive the requirements for data plane languages in general.

In this paper, we address inter-coflow scheduling for two different objectives: decreasing communication time of data-intensive jobs and guaranteeing predictable communication time. We introduce the concurrent open shop scheduling with coupled resources problem, analyze its complexity, and propose effective heuristics to optimize either objective. We present Varys, a system that enables data-intensive frameworks to use coflows and the proposed algorithms while maintaining high network utilization and guaranteeing starvation freedom. EC2 deployments and trace-driven simulations show that communication stages complete up to 3.16X faster on average and up to 2X more coflows meet their deadlines using Varys in comparison to per-flow mechanisms. Moreover, Varys outperforms non-preemptive coflow schedulers by more than 5X.",

    "abstract": "Many countries are deploying Covid-19 contact tracing apps that use Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) to detect proximity within 2m for 15 minutes. However, Bluetooth LE is an unproven technology for this application, raising concerns about the efficacy of these apps. Indeed, measurements indicate that the Bluetooth LE received signal strength can be strongly affected by factors including (i) the model of handset used, (ii) the relative orientation of handsets, (iii) absorption by human bodies, bags etc. and (iv) radio wave reflection from walls, floors, furniture. The impact on received signal strength is comparable with that caused by moving 2m, and so has the potential to seriously affect the reliability of proximity detection. These effects are due the physics of radio propagation and suggest that the development of accurate methods for proximity detection based on Bluetooth LE received signal strength is likely to be challenging. We call for action in three areas. Firstly, measurements are needed that allow the added value of deployed apps within the overall contact tracing system to be evaluated, e.g. data on how many of the people notified by the app would not have been found by manual contact tracing and what fraction of people notified by an app actually test positive for Covid-19. Secondly, the 2m/15 minute proximity limit is only a rough guideline. The real requirement is to use handset sensing to evaluate infection risk and this requires a campaign to collect measurements of both handset sensor data and infection outcomes. Thirdly, a concerted effort is needed to collect controlled Bluetooth LE measurements in a wide range of real-world environments, the data reported here being only a first step in that direction.",

Our design scales by dividing inter-domain anycast routing into two components. The first component builds inexpensive default anycast routes that consume no bandwidth or storage space. The second component, controlled by the edge domains, generates enhanced anycast routes that are customized according to the beneficiary domain's interests. We evaluate the performance of our design using simulation, and prove its practicality by implementing it in the Multi-threaded Routing Toolkit.",

    "abstract": "As IP technologies providing both tremendous capacity and the ability to establish dynamic secure associations between endpoints emerge, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are going through dramatic growth. The number of endpoints per VPN is growing and the communication pattern between endpoints is becoming increasingly hard to forecast. Consequently, users are demanding dependable, dynamic connectivity between endpoints, with the network expected to accommodate any traffic matrix, as long as the traffic to the endpoints does not overwhelm the rates of the respective ingress and egress links. We propose a new service interface, termed a hose , to provide the appropriate performance abstraction. A hose is characterized by the aggregate traffic to and from one endpoint in the VPN to the set of other endpoints in the VPN, and by an associated performance guarantee.Hoses provide important advantages to a VPN customer: (i) flexibility to send traffic to a set of endpoints without having to specify the detailed traffic matrix, and (ii) reduction in the size of access links through multiplexing gains obtained from the natural aggregation of the flows between endpoints. As compared with the conventional point to point (or customer-pipe) model for managing QoS, hoses provide reduction in the state information a customer must maintain. On the other hand, hoses would appear to increase the complexity of the already difficult problem of resource management to support QoS. To manage network resources in the face of this increased uncertainty, we consider both conventional statistical multiplexing techniques, and a new resizing technique based on online measurements.To study these performance issues, we run trace driven simulations, using traffic derived from AT&amp;amp;T's voice network, and from a large corporate data network. From the customer's perspective, we find that aggregation of traffic at the hose level provides significant multiplexing gains. From the provider's perspective, we find that the statistical multiplexing and resizing techniques deal effectively with uncertainties about the traffic, providing significant gains over the conventional alternative of a mesh of statically sized customer-pipes between endpoints.",

In this paper, we describe and evaluate route-based distributed packet filtering (DPF), a novel approach to distributed DoS (DDoS) attack prevention. We show that DPF achieves proactiveness and scalability, and we show that there is an intimate relationship between the effectiveness of DPF at mitigating DDoS attack and power-law network topology.The salient features of this work are two-fold. First, we show that DPF is able to proactively filter out a significant fraction of spoofed packet flows and prevent attack packets from reaching their targets in the first place. The IP flows that cannot be proactively curtailed are extremely sparse so that their origin can be localized---i.e., IP traceback---to within a small, constant number of candidate sites. We show that the two proactive and reactive performance effects can be achieved by implementing route-based filtering on less than 20% of Internet autonomous system (AS) sites. Second, we show that the two complementary performance measures are dependent on the properties of the underlying AS graph. In particular, we show that the power-law structure of Internet AS topology leads to connectivity properties which are crucial in facilitating the observed performance effects.",

Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) are expected to eliminate flooding and central servers, but can require many long-haul message deliveries. We introduce Mithos, an content-addressable overlay network that only uses minimal routing information and is directly suitable as an underlay network for P2P systems, both using traditional and DHT addressing. Unlike other schemes, it also efficiently provides locality-aware connectivity, thereby ensuring that a message reaches its destination with minimal overhead. Mithos provides for highly efficient forwarding, making it suitable for use in high-throughput applications. Paired with its ability to have addresses directly mapped into a subspace of the IPv6 address space, it provides a potential candidate for native deployment. Additionally, Mithos can be used to support third-party triangulation to quickly select a close-by replica of data or services.",

More specifically, under this architecture, core routers do not maintain any QoS reservation states, whether per-flow or aggregate . Instead, QoS reservation states are stored at and managed by bandwidth broker(s). There are several advantages of such a bandwidth broker architecture. Among others, it relieves core routers of QoS control functions such as admission control and QoS state management, and thus enables a network service provider to introduce new (guaranteed) services without necessarily requiring software/hardware upgrades at core routers. Furthermore, it allows us to design efficient admission control algorithms without incurring any overhead at core routers. The proposed bandwidth broker architecture is designed based on a core stateless virtual time reference system developed in [20].",

    "abstract": "In apparent contrast to the well-documented self-similar (i.e., monofractal) scaling behavior of measured LAN traffic, recent studies have suggested that measured TCP/IP and ATM WAN traffic exhibits more complex scaling behavior, consistent with multifractals. To bring multifractals into the realm of networking, this paper provides a simple construction based on cascades (also known as multiplicative processes) that is motivated by the protocol hierarchy of IP data networks. The cascade framework allows for a plausible physical explanation of the observed multifractal scaling behavior of data traffic and suggests that the underlying multiplicative structure is a traffic invariant for WAN traffic that co-exists with self-similarity. In particular, cascades allow us to refine the previously observed self-similar nature of data traffic to account for local irregularities in WAN traffic that are typically associated with networking mechanisms operating on small time scales, such as TCP flow control.To validate our approach, we show that recent measurements of Internet WAN traffic from both an ISP and a corporate environment are consistent with the proposed cascade paradigm and hence with multifractality. We rely on wavelet-based time-scale analysis techniques to visualize and to infer the scaling behavior of the traces, both globally and locally. We also discuss and illustrate with some examples how this cascade-based approach to describing data network traffic suggests novel ways for dealing with networking problems and helps in building intuition and physical understanding about the possible implications of multifractality on issues related to network performance analysis.",

While the use of cellular technologies can cut down on the time to deploy access networks, the cost economics make this non-viable in growing telecom economies. In the Digital Gangetic Plains (DGP) project, we are exploring the use of 802.11 as a long-distance access technology. 802.11 is currently cost-priced due to competitive mass production and hence is attractive for low cost and rapid deployment in rural areas.We have built an extensive testbed in a rural setting consisting of multi-hop directional 802.11 links, the testbed spanning up to 80km at its longest. To our knowledge such a long-distance, multi-hop testbed based on 802.11 is unique thus far. While 802.11 is attractive in terms of cost economics, it was inherently designed for indoor use. Our novel use of the technology for outdoor, long-distance access links presents several challenges. Our experience with the testbed has brought several research as well as operational issues to the fore. In this paper, we describe the novel technical challenges that lie ahead in using 802.11 to bridge the digital divide.",

With speak-up, a victimized server encourages all clients, resources permitting, to automatically send higher volumes of traffic . We suppose that attackers are already using most of their upload bandwidth so cannot react to the encouragement. Good clients, however, have spare upload bandwidth and will react to the encouragement with drastically higher volumes of traffic. The intended outcome of this traffic inflation is that the good clients crowd out the bad ones, thereby capturing a much larger fraction of the server's resources than before. We experiment under various conditions and find that speak-up causes the server to spend resources on a group of clients in rough proportion to their aggregate upload bandwidth. This result makes the defense viable and effective for a class of real attacks.",

For certain situations, the rate of checksum failures can be even higher: in one hour-long test we observed a checksum failure of 1 packet in 400. We investigate why so many errors are observed, when link-level CRCs should catch nearly all of them. We have collected nearly 500,000 packets which failed the TCP or UDP or IP checksum. This dataset shows the Internet has a wide variety of error sources which can not be detected by link-level checks. We describe analysis tools that have identified nearly 100 different error patterns. Categorizing packet errors, we can infer likely causes which explain roughly half the observed errors. The causes span the entire spectrum of a network stack, from memory errors to bugs in TCP. After an analysis we conclude that the checksum will fail to detect errors for roughly 1 in 16 million to 10 billion packets. From our analysis of the cause of errors, we propose simple changes to several protocols which will decrease the rate of undetected error. Even so, the highly non-random distribution of errors strongly suggests some applications should employ application-level checksums or equivalents.",

    "abstract": "Internet routers require buffers to hold packets during times of congestion. The buffers need to be fast, and so ideally they should be small enough to use fast memory technologies such as SRAM or all-optical buffering. Unfortunately, a widely used rule-of-thumb says we need a bandwidth-delay product of buffering at each router so as not to lose link utilization. This can be prohibitively large. In a recent paper, Appenzeller et al. challenged this rule-of-thumb and showed that for a backbone network, the buffer size can be divided by pN without sacrificing throughput, where N is the number of ows sharing the bottleneck. In this paper, we explore how buffers in the backbone can be significantly reduced even more, to as little as a few dozen packets, if we are willing to sacrifice a small amount of link capacity. We argue that if the TCP sources are not overly bursty, then fewer than twenty packet buffers are sufficient for high throughput. Specifically, we argue that O(log W) buffers are sufficient, where W is the window size of each ow. We support our claim with analysis and a variety of simulations. The change we need to make to TCP is minimal--each sender just needs to pace packet injections from its window. Moreover, there is some evidence that such small buffers are sufficient even if we don't modify the TCP sources so long as the access network is much slower than the backbone, which is true today and likely to remain true in the future. We conclude that buffers can be made small enough for all-optical routers with small integrated optical buffers.",

The research community has not had at its disposal any information about how to construct realistic traffic matrices. We introduce here the two basic problems that need to be addressed to construct such matrices. The first is that of synthetically generating traffic volume levels that obey spatial and temporal patterns as observed in realistic traffic matrices. The second is that of assigning a set of numbers (representing traffic levels) to particular node pairs in a given topology. This paper provides an in-depth discussion of the many issues that arise when addressing these problems. Our approach to the first problem is to extract statistical characteristics for such traffic from real data collected inside two large IP backbones. We dispel the myth that uniform distributions can be used to randomly generate numbers for populating a traffic matrix. Instead, we show that the lognormal distribution is better for this purpose as it describes well the mean rates of origin-destination flows. We provide estimates for the mean and variance properties of the traffic matrix flows from our datasets. We explain the second problem and discuss the notion of a traffic matrix being well-matched to a topology. We provide two initial solutions to this problem, one using an ILP formulation that incorporates simple and well formed constraints. Our second solution is a heuristic one that incorporates more challenging constraints coming from carrier practices used to design and evolve topologies.",

The primary contribution is the outcome of a detailed comparative evaluation of the three existing techniques. We evaluate these methods with respect to the estimation errors yielded, sensitivity to prior information required and sensitivity to the statistical assumptions they make. We study the impact of characteristics such as path length and the amount of link sharing on the estimation errors. Using actual data from a Tier-1 backbone, we assess the validity of the typical assumptions needed by the TM estimation techniques. The secondary contribution of our work is the proposal of a new direction for TM estimation based on using choice models to model POP fanouts. These models allow us to overcome some of the problems of existing methods because they can incorporate additional data and information about POPs and they enable us to make a fundamentally different kind of modeling assumption. We validate this approach by illustrating that our modeling assumption matches actual Internet data well. Using two initial simple models we provide a proof of concept showing that the incorporation of knowledge of POP features (such as total incoming bytes, number of customers, etc.) can reduce estimation errors. Our proposed approach can be used in conjunction with existing or future methods in that it can be used to generate good priors that serve as inputs to statistical inference techniques.",

    "abstract": "Hash tables are fundamental components of several network processing algorithms and applications, including route lookup, packet classification, per-flow state management and network monitoring. These applications, which typically occur in the data-path of high-speed routers, must process and forward packets with little or no buffer, making it important to maintain wire-speed throughout. A poorly designed hash table can critically affect the worst-case throughput of an application, since the number of memory accesses required for each lookup can vary. Hence, high throughput applications require hash tables with more predictable worst-case lookup performance. While published papers often assume that hash table lookups take constant time, there is significant variation in the number of items that must be accessed in a typical hash table search, leading to search times that vary by a factor of four or more.We present a novel hash table data structure and lookup algorithm which improves the performance over a naive hash table by reducing the number of memory accesses needed for the most time-consuming lookups. This allows designers to achieve higher lookup performance for a given memory bandwidth, without requiring large amounts of buffering in front of the lookup engine. Our algorithm extends the multiple-hashing Bloom Filter data structure to support exact matches and exploits recent advances in embedded memory technology. Through a combination of analysis and simulations we show that our algorithm is significantly faster than a naive hash table using the same amount of memory, hence it can support better throughput for router applications that use hash tables.",

However, there are still strong concerns about the increased cost of QoS routing, both in terms of more complex and frequent computations and increased routing protocol overhead. The main goals of this paper are to study these two cost components, and propose solutions that achieve good routing performance with reduced processing cost. First, we identify the parameters that determine the protocol traffic overhead, namely (a) policy for triggering updates, (b) sensitivity of this policy, and (c) clamp down timers that limit the rate of updates. Using simulation, we study the relative significance of these factors and investigate the relationship between routing performance and the amount of update traffic. In addition, we explore a range of design options to reduce the processing cost of QoS routing algorithms, and study their effect on routing performance. Based on the conclusions of these studies, we develop extensions to the basic QoS routing, that can achieve good routing performance with limited update generation rates. The paper also addresses the impact on the results of a number of secondary factors such as topology, high level admission control, and characteristics of network traffic.",

One approach to addressing this problem is based on static analysis of routing policies to determine if they are safe.

    "abstract": "The single class best effort service available in the current Internet does not provide the guarantees, typically expressed in terms of minimum bandwidth and/or maximum delay or loss, associated with real-time applications such as live video. One way to support such applications in best effort networks is to use control mechanisms that adapt the coding, transmission, reception, and decoding processes at the source and at the destination(s) depending on the state of the network. In this paper, we examine and report on our experience over the past several years with such mechanisms for videoconferencing software. We illustrate our points with results obtained with the IVS software developed at INRIA.We consider in particular rate and error control mechanisms. These mechanisms adapt the bandwidth requirements and the resilience to packet loss of the video stream sent by a source coder. We have found that they do prevent video sources from swamping the resources of the Internet, and that they provide reasonably graceful degradation of image quality during periods of network congestion. However, they raise thorny issues of fairness with non-real time traffic sources (such as TCP sources) and of scalability for the multicast delivery of video in heterogeneous networks. We examine different approaches to tackling these problems.",

    "abstract": "Accurate network traffic measurement is required for accounting, bandwidth provisioning and detecting DoS attacks. These applications see the traffic as a collection of flows they need to measure. As link speeds and the number of flows increase, keeping a counter for each flow is too expensive (using SRAM) or slow (using DRAM). The current state-of-the-art methods (Cisco's sampled NetFlow) which log periodically sampled packets are slow, inaccurate and resource-intensive. Previous work showed that at different granularities a small number of \"heavy hitters\" accounts for a large share of traffic. Our paper introduces a paradigm shift for measurement by concentrating only on large flows --- those above some threshold such as 0.1% of the link capacity.We propose two novel and scalable algorithms for identifying the large flows: sample and hold and multistage filters, which take a constant number of memory references per packet and use a small amount of memory. If $M$ is the available memory, we show analytically that the errors of our new algorithms are proportional to $1/M$; by contrast, the error of an algorithm based on classical sampling is proportional to $1/\\sqrtM$, thus providing much less accuracy for the same amount of memory. We also describe further optimizations such as early removal and conservative update that further improve the accuracy of our algorithms, as measured on real traffic traces, by an order of magnitude. Our schemes allow a new form of accounting called threshold accounting in which only flows above a threshold are charged by usage while the rest are charged a fixed fee. Threshold accounting generalizes usage-based and duration based pricing.",

In this paper, we argue that it is also important to ensure the robustness of packet forwarding itself.

However, services provided with current stateless solutions, Diffserv included, have lower flexibility, utilization, and/or assurance level as compared to the services that can be provided with per flow mechanisms.In this paper, we propose techniques that do not require per flow management (either control or data planes) at core routers, but can implement guaranteed services with levels of flexibility, utilization, and assurance similar to those that can be provided with per flow mechanisms. In this way we can simultaneously achieve high quality of service, high scalability and robustness. The key technique we use is called Dynamic Packet State (DPS), which provides a lightweight and robust mechanism for routers to coordinate actions and implement distributed algorithms.

Intuitively, the critical characteristic of this self-similar traffic is that there is no natural length of a \"burst\": at every time scale ranging from a few milliseconds to minutes and hours, similar-looking traffic bursts are evident; we find that aggregating streams of such traffic typically intensifies the self-similarity (\"burstiness\") instead of smoothing it.Our conclusions are supported by a rigorous statistical analysis of hundreds of millions of high quality Ethernet traffic measurements collected between 1989 and 1992, coupled with a discussion of the underlying mathematical and statistical properties of self-similarity and their relationship with actual network behavior. We also consider some implications for congestion control in high-bandwidth networks and present traffic models based on self-similar stochastic processes that are simple, accurate, and realistic for aggregate traffic.",

However, most of the mechanisms proposed to accomplish this, such as Fair Queueing [16, 6] and its many variants [2, 23, 15], involve complicated packet scheduling algorithms. These algorithms, while increasingly common in router designs, may not be inexpensively implementable at extremely high speeds; thus, finding more easily implementable variants of such algorithms may be of significant practical value. This paper proposes an algorithm called Approximate Fair Dropping (AFD), which bases its dropping decisions on the recent history of packet arrivals. AFD retains a simple forwarding path and requires an amount of additional state that is small compared to current packet buffers. Simulation results, which we describe here, suggest that the design provides a reasonable degree of fairness in a wide variety of operating conditions. The performance of our approach is aided by the fact that the vast majority of Internet flows are slow but the fast flows send the bulk of the bits. This allows a small sample of recent history to provide accurate rate estimates of the fast flows.",

The paper describes the principles that have guided our design, including the IP multicast group delivery model, an end-to-end, receiver-based model of reliability, and the application level framing protocol model. As with unicast communications, the performance of a reliable multicast delivery algorithm depends on the underlying topology and operational environment. We investigate that dependence via analysis and simulation, and demonstrate an adaptive algorithm that uses the results of previous loss recovery events to adapt the control parameters used for future loss recovery. With the adaptive algorithm, our reliable multicast delivery algorithm provides good performance over a wide range of underlying topologies.",

The goal in this effort is to improve the synchronization accuracy for fast computers and networks from the tens of milliseconds regime of the present technology to the submillisecond regime of the future.In order to assess how well these improvements work, a series of experiments is described in which the error contributions of various modern Unix system hardware and software components are calibrated. These experiments define the accuracy and stability expectations of the computer clock and establish its design parameters with respect to time and frequency error tolerances. The paper concludes that submillisecond accuracies are indeed practical, but that further improvements will be possible only through the use of temperature-compensated local clock oscillators.",

    "abstract": "This poster describes the results of a 500 million packet trace of a popular on-line, multiplayer, game server. The results show that the traffic behavior of this heavily loaded game server is highly predictable and can be attributed to the fact that current game designs target the saturation of the narrowest, last-mile link (i.e. 56k modems). Specifically, in order to maximize the interactivity of the game itself and to provide relatively uniform experiences between players playing over different network speeds, on-line games typically fix their usage requirements in such a way as to saturate the network link of their lowest speed players. While the traffic observed is highly predictable, the trace also indicates that these on-line games provide significant challenges to current network infrastructure. As a result of synchronous game logic requiring an extreme amount of interactivity, a close look at the trace reveals the presence of large, highly periodic, bursts of small packets. With such stringent demands on interactivity, routers must be designed with enough capacity to quickly route such bursts without delay. As current routers are designed for bulk data transfers with larger packets, a significant, concentrated deployment of on-line game servers will have the potential for overwhelming current networking equipment.",

In this paper, we provide a plausible physical explanation for the occurrence of self-similarity in high-speed network traffic. Our explanation is based on convergence results for processes that exhibit high variability (i.e., infinite variance) and is supported by detailed statistical analyses of real-time traffic measurements from Ethernet LAN's at the level of individual sources.Our key mathematical result states that the superposition of many ON/OFF sources (also known as packet trains ) whose ON-periods and OFF-periods exhibit the Noah Effect (i.e., have high variability or infinite variance) produces aggregate network traffic that features the Joseph Effect (i.e., is self-similar or long-range dependent). There is, moreover, a simple relation between the parameters describing the intensities of the Noah Effect (high variability) and the Joseph Effect (self-similarity). An extensive statistical analysis of two sets of high time-resolution traffic measurements from two Ethernet LAN's (involving a few hundred active source-destination pairs) confirms that the data at the level of individual sources or source-destination pairs are consistent with the Noah Effect. We also discuss implications of this simple physical explanation for the presence of self-similar traffic patterns in modern high-speed network traffic for (i) parsimonious traffic modeling (ii) efficient synthetic generation of realistic traffic patterns, and (iii) relevant network performance and protocol analysis.",

Our objective is to define an access method optimized for throughput and fairness, able to dynamically adapt to physical channel conditions, to operate near optimum for a wide range of error rates, and to provide equal time shares when hosts use different bit rates.We propose a novel access method derived from 802.11 DCF [2] ( Distributed Coordination Function ) in which all hosts use similar values of the contention window CW to benefit from good short-term access fairness. We call our method Idle Sense , because each host observes the mean number of idle slots between transmission attempts to dynamically control its contention window. Unlike other proposals, Idle Sense enables each host to estimate its frame error rate, which can be used for switching to the right bit rate. We present simulations showing how the method leads to high throughput, low collision overhead, and low delay. The method also features fast reactivity and time-fair channel allocation.",

Nodes in an ad hoc network must cooperate and carry out a distributed routing protocol in order to make multi-hop communications possible. On Demand Routing is one of the most popular routing styles in ad hoc networks. In On Demand Routing, \"flooding\" is used to find a feasible route from source to destination. The function of flooding is to deliver a packet from one source to every other node in the system. Conventional flooding can be very costly in On Demand networks in terms of network throughput efficiency as well as node energy consumption. The main reason is that the same packet is rebroadcast unnecessarily several times (redundant rebroadcast). Indeed, the penalty of redundant rebroadcast increases when the size of network grows and the density of network increases. In this paper we introduce a novel clustering scheme, call Passive Clustering that can reduce the redundant rebroadcast effect in flooding. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme in the AODV (Ad hoc, On demand Distance Vector) routing scheme.",

DIRPE works without prior knowledge of the database, scales when a large number of ranges is present, and has good incremental update properties.Our second algorithm addresses the problem of finding multiple matches in a TCAM. When searched, TCAMs return the first matching entry; however, new applications require either the first few or all matching entries. We describe a novel algorithm, called Multi-match Using Discriminators (MUD), that finds multiple matches without storing any per-search state information in the TCAM, thus making it suitable for multi-threaded environments. MUD does not increase the number of TCAM entries needed, and hence scales to large databases.Our algorithms do not require any modifications to existing TCAMs and are hence relatively easy to deploy. We evaluate the algorithms using real-life and random databases.",

    "abstract": "In order to perform realistic network simulations, one needs a traffic generator that is capable of generating realistic synthetic traffic in a closed-loop fashion that \"looks like\" traffic found on an actual network. We describe such a traffic generation system for the widely used ns-2 simulator. The system takes as input a packet header trace taken from a network link of interest. The trace is \"reverse compiled\" into a source-level characterization of each TCP connection present in the trace. The characterization, called a connection vector, is then used as input to an ns module called tmix that emulates the socket-level behavior of the source application that created the corresponding connection in the trace. This emulation faithfully reproduces the essential pattern of socket reads and writes that the original application performed without knowledge of what the original application actually was. When combined with a network path emulation component we have constructed called DelayBox , the resulting traffic generated in the simulation is statistically representative of the traffic measured on the real link. This approach to synthetic traffic generation allows one to automatically repro-duce in ns the full range of TCP connections found on an arbitrary link. Thus with our tools, researchers no longer need make arbitrary decisions on how traffic is generated in simulations and can instead easily generate TCP traffic that represents the use of a net-work by the full mix of applications measured on actual network links of interest. The method is evaluated by applying it to packet header traces taken from campus and wide-area networks and comparing the statistical properties of traffic on the measured links with traffic generated by tmix in ns .",

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks have attracted attention from a diverse set of researchers, due to the unique combination of distributed, resource and data processing constraints. However, until now, the lack of real sensor network deployments have resulted in ad-hoc assumptions on a wide range of issues including topology characteristics and data distribution. As deployments of sensor networks become more widespread [1, 2], many of these assumptions need to be revisited.This paper deals with the fundamental issue of spatio-temporal irregularity in sensor networks We make the case for the existence of such irregular spatio-temporal sampling, and show that it impacts many performance issues in sensor networks. For instance, data aggregation schemes provide inaccurate results, compression efficiency is dramatically reduced, data storage skews storage load among nodes and incurs significantly greater routing overhead. To mitigate the impact of irregularity, we outline a spectrum of solutions. For data aggregation and compression, we propose the use of spatial interpolation of data (first suggested by Ganeriwal et al in [3] and temporal signal segmentation followed by alignment. To reduce the cost of data-centric storage and routing, we propose the use of virtualization, and boundary detection.",

    "abstract": "Congestion control is a recognized problem in complex networks. We have discovered that the Department of Defense's Internet Protocol (IP), a pure datagram protocol, and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), a transport layer protocol, when used together, are subject to unusual congestion problems caused by interactions between the transport and datagram layers. In particular, IP gateways are vulnerable to a phenomenon we call congestion collapse, especially when such gateways connect networks of widely different bandwidth. We have developed solutions that prevent congestion collapse.These problems are not generally recognized because these protocols are used most often on networks built on top of ARPANET IMP technology. ARPANET IMP based networks traditionally have uniform bandwidth, identical switching nodes, and are sized with substantial excess capacity. This excess capacity, and the ability of the IMP system to throttle the transmissions of hosts has for most IP/TCP hosts and networks, been adequate to handle congestion. With the recent split of the ARPANET into two interconnected networks and the growth of other networks with differing properties connected to the ARPANET, however, reliance on the benign properties of the IMP system is no longer enough to allow hosts to communicate rapidly and reliably. Improved handling of congestion is now mandatory for successful network operation under load.Ford Aerospace and Communications Corporation, and its parent company, Ford Motor Company, operate the only private IP/TCP long-haul network in existence today. This network connects six facilities (one in Michigan, two in California, one in Colorado, one in Texas, and one in England) some with extensive local networks. This net is cross-tied to the ARPANET but uses its own long-haul circuits; traffic between Ford facilities flows over private leased circuits, including a leased transatlantic satellite connection. All switching nodes are pure IP datagram switches with no node-to-node flow control, and all hosts run software either written or heavily modified by Ford or Ford Aerospace. Bandwidth of links in this network varies widely, from 1200 to 10,000,000 bits per second. In general, we have not been able to afford the luxury of excess long-haul bandwidth that the ARPANET possesses, and our long-haul links are heavily loaded during peak periods. Transit times of several seconds are thus common in our network.Because of our pure datagram orientation, heavy loading, and wide variation in bandwidth, we have had to solve problems that the ARPANET/MILNET community is just beginning to recognize. Our network is sensitive to suboptimal behavior by host TCP implementations, both on and off our own net. We have devoted considerable effort to examining TCP behavior under various conditions, and have solved some widely prevalent problems with TCP. We present here two problems and their solutions. Many TCP implementations have these problems; if throughput is worse through an ARPANET/MILNET gateway for a given TCP implementation than throughput across a single net, there is a high probability that the TCP implementation has one or both of these problems.",

Using this model we present a decentralized channel access scheme for scalable packet radio networks that is free of packet loss due to collisions and that at each hop requires no per-packet transmissions other than the single transmission used to convey the packet to the next-hop station. We also show that with a modest fraction of the radio spectrum, pessimistic assumptions about propagation resulting in maximum-possible self-interference, and an optimistic view of future signal processing capabilities that a self-organizing packet radio network may scale to millions of stations within a metro area with raw per-station rates in the hundreds of megabits per second.",

In this white paper I try to find the signal in the noise by taking a largely technical look at various definitions of network neutrality and the feasibility and complexity of implementing systems that support those ideas.First off, there are a lot of emotional terms used to describe various aspects of what makes the melting pot of the neutrality debate. For example, censorship or black-holing (where route filtering, fire-walling and port blocking might say what is happening in less insightful way); free-riding is often bandied about to describe the business of making money on the net (rather than overlay service provision); monopolistic tendencies, instead of the natural inclination of an organisation that owns a lot of kit that they've sunk capital into, to want to make revenue from it.The paper describes the basic realities of the net, which has never been a level playing field for many accidental and some deliberate reasons, and then looks at the future evolution of IP (and lower level) services; the evolution of overlay services, and the evolution of the structure of the ISP business space (access, core and other); finally, I appeal to simple minded economic and regulatory arguments to ask whether there is any case at all for &lt;I&gt;special pleading&lt;/I&gt; for the Internet as a special case, different from other services, or utilities.

    "abstract": "Vivaldi is a distributed algorithm that assigns synthetic coordinates to internet hosts, so that the Euclidean distance between two hosts' coordinates predicts the network latency between them. Each node in Vivaldi computes its coordinates by simulating its position in a network of physical springs. Vivaldi is both distributed and efficient: no fixed infrastructure need be deployed and a new host can compute useful coordinates after collecting latency information from only a few other hosts. Vivaldi can rely on piggy-backing latency information on application traffic instead of generating extra traffic by sending its own probe packets.This paper evaluates Vivaldi through simulations of 750 hosts, with a matrix of inter-host latencies derived from measurements between 750 real Internet hosts. Vivaldi finds synthetic coordinates that predict the measured latencies with a median relative error of 14 percent. The simulations show that a new host joining an existing Vivaldi system requires fewer than 10 probes to achieve this accuracy. Vivaldi is currently used by the Chord distributed hash table to perform proximity routing, replica selection, and retransmission timer estimation.",

Persona provides an effective means of creating applications in which users, not the OSN, define policy over access to private data.

In this paper, we design practical H-PFQ algorithms by using one-level Packet Fair Queueing (PFQ) servers as basic building blocks, and develop techniques to analyze delay and fairness properties of the resulted H-PFQ servers. We demonstrate that, in order to provide tight delay bounds in a H-PFQ server, it is essential for the one-level PFQ servers to have small Worst-case Fair Indices (WFI). We propose a new one-level PFQ algorithm called WF 2 Q+ that is the first to have all the following three properties: (a) providing the tightest delay bound among all PFQ algorithms; (b) having the smallest WFI among all PFQ algorithms; and (c) having a relatively low implementation complexity of O(log N). We show that practical H-PFQ algorithms can be implemented by using WF 2 Q+ as the basic building block and prove that the resulting H-WF 2 Q+ algorithms provide similar delay bounds and bandwidth distribution as those provided by a H-GPS server.

In this paper we quantitatively characterize the IPv4 address allocations made over the past six years and the global BGP routing table size changes during the same period of time. About 63,000 address blocks have been allocated since the beginning of the Internet, of which about 18,000 address blocks were allocated during our study period, from November 1997 to August 2004. Among these 18,000 allocations, 90% of them started being announced into the BGP routing table within 75 days after the allocation, while 8% of them has not been used up to now. Among all the address blocks that have ever been used, 45% of them were split into fragments smaller than the original allocated blocks; without these fragementations, the current BGP table would have been about half of its current size. Furthermore, we found that the evolution of BGP routing table consists of both the appearance of new prefixes and the disappearance of old prefixes. While the change of the BGP routing table size only reflects the combined results of the two processes, the dynamics of either process is much higher than that of the BGP table size. Finally, we classify routing prefixes into covering and covered ones, and examine their evolution separately. For the covered prefixes, which account for almost half of the BGP table size, we infer their practical motives such as multihoming, load balancing, and traffic engineering, etc., via a classification method.",

By varying the interval between probe packets, it is possible to study the structure of the Internet load over different time scales. In this paper, the time scales of interest range from a few milliseconds to a few minutes. Our observations agree with results obtained by others using simulation and experimental approaches. For example, our estimates of Internet workload are consistent with the hypothesis of a mix of bulk traffic with larger packet size, and interactive traffic with smaller packet size. We observe compression (or clustering) of the probe packets, rapid fluctuations of queueing delays over small intervals, etc. Our results also show interesting and less expected behavior. For example, we find that the losses of probe packets are essentially random unless the probe traffic uses a large fraction of the available bandwidth. We discuss the implications of these results on the design of control mechanisms for the Internet.",

    "abstract": "High performance computer communication between multiprocessor nodes requires significant improvements over conventional host-to-network adapters. Current host-to-network adapter interfaces impose excessive processing, system bus and interrupt overhead on a multiprocessor host. Current network adapters are either limited in function, wasting key host resources such as the system bus and the processors, or else intelligent but too slow, because of complex transport protocols and because of an inadequate internal memory architecture. Conventional transport protocols are too complex for hardware implementation and too slow without it. In this paper, we describe the design of a network adapter board for the VMP multiprocessor machine that addresses these issues. The adapter uses a host interface that is designed for minimal latency, minimal interrupt processing overhead and minimal system bus and memory access overhead. The network adapter itself has a novel internal memory and processing architecture that implements some of the key performance-critical transport layer functions in hardware. This design is integrated with VMTP, a new transport protocol specifically designed for efficient implementation on an intelligent high-performance network adapter. Although targeted for the VMP system, the design is applicable to other multiprocessors as well as uni-processors.",

Any timeout based action is a guess based on incomplete information, and as such is bound to be non-optimal.

We show that the use of such small buffers can lead to excessively high loss rates (up to 5%-15%in our simulations) in congested access links that carry many flows. Even if the link is fully utilized, small buffers lead to lower throughput for most large TCP flows, and significant variability in the per-flow throughput and transfer latency. We also discuss some important issues in router buffer sizing that are often ignored",

First, during flooding attacks router memory and network bandwidth consumed by flow records can increase beyond what is available; second, selecting the right static sampling rate is difficult because no single rate gives the right tradeoff of memory use versus accuracy for all traffic mixes; third, the heuristics routers use to decide when a flow is reported are a poor match to most applications that work with time bins; finally, it is impossible to estimate without bias the number of active flows for aggregates with non-TCP traffic.In this paper we propose Adaptive NetFlow, deployable through an update to router software, which addresses many shortcomings of NetFlow by dynamically adapting the sampling rate to achieve robustness without sacrificing accuracy. To enable counting of non-TCP flows, we propose an optional Flow Counting Extension that requires augmenting existing hardware at routers. Both our proposed solutions readily provide descriptions of the traffic of progressively smaller sizes. Transmitting these at progressively higher levels of reliability allows graceful degradation of the accuracy of traffic reports in response to network congestion on the reporting path.",

    "abstract": "A detailed understanding of the many facets of the Internet's topological structure is critical for evaluating the performance of networking protocols, for assessing the effectiveness of proposed techniques to protect the network from nefarious intrusions and attacks, or for developing improved designs for resource provisioning. Previous studies of topology have focused on interpreting measurements or on phenomenological descriptions and evaluation of graph-theoretic properties of topology generators. We propose a complementary approach of combining a more subtle use of statistics and graph theory with a first-principles theory of router-level topology that reflects practical constraints and tradeoffs. While there is an inevitable tradeoff between model complexity and fidelity, a challenge is to distill from the seemingly endless list of potentially relevant technological and economic issues the features that are most essential to a solid understanding of the intrinsic fundamentals of network topology. We claim that very simple models that incorporate hard technological constraints on router and link bandwidth and connectivity, together with abstract models of user demand and network performance, can successfully address this challenge and further resolve much of the confusion and controversy that has surrounded topology generation and evaluation.",

    "abstract": "A large fraction of today's Internet applications are internally publish/subscribe in nature; the current architecture makes it cumbersome and inept to support them. In essence, supporting efficient publish/subscribe requires data-oriented naming, efficient multicast, and in-network caching. Deployment of native IP-based multicast has failed, and overlay-based multicast systems are inherently inefficient. We surmise that scalable and efficient publish/subscribe will require substantial architectural changes, such as moving from endpoint-oriented systems to information-centric architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel multicast forwarding fabric, suitable for large-scale topic-based publish/subscribe. Due to very simple forwarding decisions and small forwarding tables, the fabric may be more energy efficient than the currently used ones. To understand the limitations and potential, we provide efficiency and scalability analysis via simulations and early measurements from our two implementations. We show that the system scales up to metropolitan WAN sizes, and we discuss how to interconnect separate networks.",

The increased number of online businesses, specialized websites and modern profiling techniques have all contributed to an explosion of the income of ad brokers from online advertising. The single biggest threat to this growth, is however, click-fraud. Trained botnets and individuals are hired by click-fraud specialists in order to maximize the revenue of certain users from the ads they publish on their websites, or to launch an attack between competing businesses. In this note we wish to raise the awareness of the networking research community on potential research areas within the online advertising field. As an example strategy, we present Bluff ads; a class of ads that join forces in order to increase the effort level for click-fraud spammers. Bluff ads are either targeted ads, with irrelevant display text, or highly relevant display text, with irrelevant targeting information. They act as a litmus test for the legitimacy of the individual clicking on the ads. Together with standard threshold-based methods, fake ads help to decrease click-fraud levels.",

Based on empirical observations and analytical results, we identify interesting properties of today's update traffic and user behavior.Building on this analysis, we consider alternative patch delivery strategies such as caching and peer-to-peer and evaluate their performance. We identify key factors that determine the effectiveness of these schemes in reducing the server workload and the network traffic, and in speeding-up the patch delivery. Most of our findings are invariant properties induced by either user behavior or architectural characteristics of today's Internet, and thus apply to the general problem of Internet-wide dissemination of software updates.",

Alternatively, it can transparently intercept the hijacked traffic by forwarding it onto the owner. This paper presents a study of such prefix hijacking and interception with the following contributions: (1). We present a methodology for prefix interception, (2). We estimate the fraction of traffic to any prefix that can be hijacked and intercepted in the Internet today, (3). The interception methodology is implemented and used to intercept real traffic to our prefix, (4). We conduct a detailed study to detect ongoing prefix interception. We find that: Our hijacking estimates are in line with the impact of past hijacking incidents and show that ASes higher up in the routing hierarchy can hijack a significant amount of traffic to any prefix, including popular prefixes. A less apparent result is that the same holds for prefix interception too. Further, our implementation shows that intercepting traffic to a prefix in the Internet is almost as simple as hijacking it. Finally, while we fail to detect ongoing prefix interception, the detection exercise highlights some of the challenges posed by the prefix interception problem.",

    "abstract": "Many basic network engineering tasks (e.g., traffic engineering, capacity planning, anomaly detection) rely heavily on the availability and accuracy of traffic matrices. However, in practice it is challenging to reliably measure traffic matrices. Missing values are common. This observation brings us into the realm of compressive sensing, a generic technique for dealing with missing values that exploits the presence of structure and redundancy in many real-world systems. Despite much recent progress made in compressive sensing, existing compressive-sensing solutions often perform poorly for traffic matrix interpolation, because real traffic matrices rarely satisfy the technical conditions required for these solutions. To address this problem, we develop a novel spatio-temporal compressive sensing framework with two key components: (i) a new technique called Sparsity Regularized Matrix Factorization (SRMF) that leverages the sparse or low-rank nature of real-world traffic matrices and their spatio-temporal properties, and (ii) a mechanism for combining low-rank approximations with local interpolation procedures. We illustrate our new framework and demonstrate its superior performance in problems involving interpolation with real traffic matrices where we can successfully replace up to 98% of the values. Evaluation in applications such as network tomography, traffic prediction, and anomaly detection confirms the flexibility and effectiveness of our approach.",

In these networks, receivers can experience a drastic reduction in application throughput when simultaneously requesting data from many servers using TCP. Inbound data overfills small switch buffers, leading to TCP timeouts lasting hundreds of milliseconds. For many datacenter workloads that have a barrier synchronization requirement (e.g., filesystem reads and parallel data-intensive queries), throughput is reduced by up to 90%. For latency-sensitive applications, TCP timeouts in the datacenter impose delays of hundreds of milliseconds in networks with round-trip-times in microseconds. Our practical solution uses high-resolution timers to enable microsecond-granularity TCP timeouts. We demonstrate that this technique is effective in avoiding TCP incast collapse in simulation and in real-world experiments. We show that eliminating the minimum retransmission timeout bound is safe for all environments, including the wide-area.",

    "abstract": "Internet topology discovery consists of inferring the inter-router connectivity (\"links\") and the mapping from IP addresses to routers (\"alias resolution\"). Current topology discovery techniques use TTL-limited \"traceroute\" probes to discover links and use direct router probing to resolve aliases. The often-ignored record route (RR) IP option provides a source of disparate topology data that could augment existing techniques, but it is difficult to properly align with traceroute-based topologies because router RR implementations are under-standardized. Correctly aligned RR and traceroute topologies have fewer false links, include anonymous and hidden routers, and discover aliases for routers that do not respond to direct probing. More accurate and feature-rich topologies benefit overlay construction and network diagnostics, modeling, and measurement. We present DisCarte, a system for aligning and cross-validating RR and traceroute topology data using observed engineering practices DisCarte uses disjunctive logic programming (DLP), a logical inference and constraint solving technique, to intelligently merge RR and traceroute data. We demonstrate that the resultant topology is more accurate and complete than previous techniques by validating its internal consistency and by comparing to publicly-available topologies. We classify irregularities in router implementations and introduce a divide-and-conquer technique used to scale DLP to Internet-sized systems.",

The experiments are designed to evaluate the availability, accuracy and reliability of international standard time distribution using the Internet and the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which has been designated an Internet Standard protocol. NTP is designed specifically for use in a large, diverse internet system operating at speeds from mundane to lightwave. In NTP a distributed subnet of time servers operating in a self-organizing, hierarchical, master-slave configuration exchange precision timestamps in order to synchronize host clocks to each other and national time standards via wire or radio.The experiments are designed to locate Internet hosts and gateways that provide time by one of three time distribution protocols and evaluate the accuracy of their indications. For those hosts that support NTP, the experiments determine the distribution of errors and other statistics over paths spanning major portions of the globe. Finally, the experiments evaluate the accuracy and reliability of precision timekeeping using NTP and typical Internet paths involving ARPANET, NSFNET and regional networks. The experiments demonstrate that timekeeping throughout most portions of the Internet can be maintained to an accuracy of a few tens of milliseconds and a stability of a few milliseconds per day, even in cases of failure or disruption of clocks, time servers or networks.",

    "abstract": "Skype is a very popular VoIP software which has recently attracted the attention of the research community and network operators. Following a closed source and proprietary design, Skype protocols and algorithms are unknown. Moreover, strong encryption mechanisms are adopted by Skype, making it very difficult to even glimpse its presence from a traffic aggregate. In this paper, we propose a framework based on two complementary techniques to reveal Skypetraffic in real time. The first approach, based on Pearson'sChi-Square test and agnostic to VoIP-related trafficcharacteristics, is used to detect Skype's fingerprint from the packet framing structure, exploiting the randomness introduced at the bit level by the encryption process. Conversely, the second approach is based on a stochastic characterization of Skype traffic in terms of packet arrival rate and packet length, which are used as features of a decision process based on Naive Bayesian Classifiers.In order to assess the effectiveness of the above techniques, we develop an off-line cross-checking heuristic based on deep-packet inspection and flow correlation, which is interesting per se. This heuristic allows us to quantify the amount of false negatives and false positives gathered by means of the two proposed approaches: results obtained from measurements in different networks show that the technique is very effective in identifying Skype traffic. While both Bayesian classifier and packet inspection techniques are commonly used, the idea of leveraging on randomness to reveal traffic is novel. We adopt this to identify Skype traffic, but the same methodology can be applied to other classification problems as well.",

In one popular model of internet addressing, a hierarchical form of network and local (within network) address is used, with the source providing only the destination address while the intermediate network(s) and/or Gateways between networks take care of routing packets to that destination by various paths. This and related techniques requiring some form of routing table and knowledge at intermediate nodes are more fully discussed in [1,2,3]. This paper considers another technique for internet routing in which the source of internet packets specifies the complete internet route. When the entire route accompanies each internet packet, no routing decisions or tables are required at Gateways, but the packet format is complicated and overhead increases. In particular, the packet must carry a varying number of intermediate addresses depending on the path and destination [4]. This overhead may be reduced by setting up a fixed route with connection tables [1] when a connection is established.",

    "abstract": "Correctness of the Chord ring-maintenance protocol would mean that the protocol can eventually repair all disruptions in the ring structure, given ample time and no further disruptions while it is working. In other words, it is \"eventual reachability.\" Under the same assumptions about failure behavior as made in the Chord papers, no published version of Chord is correct. This result is based on modeling the protocol in Alloy and analyzing it with the Alloy Analyzer. By combining the right selection of pseudocode and textual hints from several papers, and fixing flaws revealed by analysis, it is possible to get a version that may be correct. The paper also discusses the significance of these results, describes briefly how Alloy is used to model and reason about Chord, and compares Alloy analysis to model-checking.",

    "abstract": "We study the impact on 802.11 networks of RF interference from devices such as Zigbee and cordless phones that increasingly crowd the 2.4GHz ISM band, and from devices such as wireless camera jammers and non-compliant 802.11 devices that seek to disrupt 802.11 operation. Our experiments show that commodity 802.11 equipment is surprisingly vulnerable to certain patterns of weak or narrow-band interference. This enables us to disrupt a link with an interfering signal whose power is 1000 times weaker than the victim's 802.11 signals, or to shut down a multiple AP, multiple channel managed network at a location with a single radio interferer. We identify several factors that lead to these vulnerabilities, ranging from MAC layer driver implementation strategies to PHY layer radio frequency implementation strategies. Our results further show that these factors are not overcome by simply changing 802.11 operational parameters (such as CCA threshold, rate and packet size) with the exception of frequency shifts. This leads us to explore rapid channel hopping as a strategy to withstand RF interference. We prototype a channel hopping design using PRISM NICs, and find that it can sustain throughput at levels of RF interference well above that needed to disrupt unmodified links, and at a reasonable cost in terms of switching overheads.",

We conclude by suggesting that changing YouTube block sending to be less bursty would improve the performance and reduce the bandwidth usage of YouTube video streams.",

    "abstract": "IP prefix hijacking remains a major threat to the security of the Internet routing system due to a lack of authoritative prefix ownership information. Despite many efforts in designing IP prefix hijack detection schemes, no existing design can satisfy all the critical requirements of a truly effective system: real-time, accurate, light-weight, easily and incrementally deployable, as well as robust in victim notification. In this paper, we present a novel approach that fulfills all these goals by monitoring network reachability from key external transit networks to one's own network through lightweight prefix-owner-based active probing. Using the prefix-owner's view of reachability, our detection system, iSPY, can differentiate between IP prefix hijacking and network failures based on the observation that hijacking is likely to result in topologically more diverse polluted networks and unreachability. Through detailed simulations of Internet routing, 25-day deployment in 88 ASes (108 prefixes), and experiments with hijacking events of our own prefix from multiple locations, we demonstrate that iSPY is accurate with false negative ratio below 0.45% and false positive ratio below 0.17%. Furthermore, iSPY is truly real-time; it can detect hijacking events within a few minutes.",

    "abstract": "Web applications have now become so sophisticated that rendering a typical page may require hundreds of intra-datacenter flows. At the same time, web sites must meet strict page creation deadlines of 200-300 ms to satisfy user demands for interactivity. Long-tailed flow completion times make it challenging for web sites to meet these constraints. They are forced to choose between rendering a subset of the complex page, or delay its rendering, thus missing deadlines and sacrificing either quality or responsiveness. Either option leads to potential financial loss. In this paper, we present a new cross-layer network stack aimed at reducing the long tail of flow completion times. The approach exploits cross-layer information to reduce packet drops, prioritize latency-sensitive flows, and evenly distribute network load, effectively reducing the long tail of flow completion times. We evaluate our approach through NS-3 based simulation and Click-based implementation demonstrating our ability to consistently reduce the tail across a wide range of workloads. We often achieve reductions of over 50% in 99.9 th percentile flow completion times.",

    "abstract": "In many situations it can be enormously helpful to archive the raw contents of a network traffic stream to disk, to enable later inspection of activity that becomes interesting only in retrospect. We present a Time Machine (TM) for network traffic that provides such a capability. The TM leverages the heavy-tailed nature of network flows to capture nearly all of the likely-interesting traffic while storing only a small fraction of the total volume. An initial proof-of-principle prototype established the forensic value of such an approach, contributing to the investigation of numerous attacks at a site with thousands of users. Based on these experiences, a rearchitected implementation of the system provides flexible, highperformance traffic stream capture, indexing and retrieval, including an interface between the TM and a real-time network intrusion detection system (NIDS). The NIDS controls the TM by dynamically adjusting recording parameters, instructing it to permanently store suspicious activity for offline forensics, and fetching traffic from the past for retrospective analysis. We present a detailed performance evaluation of both stand-alone and joint setups, and report on experiences with running the system live in high-volume environments.",

    "abstract": "The past few years have witnessed a lot of debate on how large Internet router buffers should be. The widely believed rule-of-thumb used by router manufacturers today mandates a buffer size equal to the delay-bandwidth product. This rule was first challenged by researchers in 2004 who argued that if there are a large number of long-lived TCP connections flowing through a router, then the buffer size needed is equal to the delay-bandwidth product divided by the square root of the number of long-lived TCP flows. The publication of this result has since reinvigorated interest in the buffer sizing problem with numerous other papers exploring this topic in further detail - ranging from papers questioning the applicability of this result to proposing alternate schemes to developing new congestion control algorithms, etc. This paper provides a synopsis of the recently proposed buffer sizing strategies and broadly classifies them according to their desired objective: link utilisation, and per-flow performance. We discuss the pros and cons of these different approaches. These prior works study buffer sizing purely in the context of TCP. Subsequently, we present arguments that take into account both real-time and TCP traffic. We also report on the performance studies of various high-speed TCP variants and experimental results for networks with limited buffers. We conclude this paper by outlining some interesting avenues for further research.",

    "abstract": "Layer-4 load balancing is fundamental to creating scale-out web services. We designed and implemented Ananta, a scale-out layer-4 load balancer that runs on commodity hardware and meets the performance, reliability and operational requirements of multi-tenant cloud computing environments. Ananta combines existing techniques in routing and distributed systems in a unique way and splits the components of a load balancer into a consensus-based reliable control plane and a decentralized scale-out data plane. A key component of Ananta is an agent in every host that can take over the packet modification function from the load balancer, thereby enabling the load balancer to naturally scale with the size of the data center. Due to its distributed architecture, Ananta provides direct server return (DSR) and network address translation (NAT) capabilities across layer-2 boundaries. Multiple instances of Ananta have been deployed in the Windows Azure public cloud with combined bandwidth capacity exceeding 1Tbps. It is serving traffic needs of a diverse set of tenants, including the blob, table and relational storage services. With its scale-out data plane we can easily achieve more than 100Gbps throughput for a single public IP address. In this paper, we describe the requirements of a cloud-scale load balancer, the design of Ananta and lessons learnt from its implementation and operation in the Windows Azure public cloud.",

Apple iMessage, for example, handles over 2 billion messages each day, while WhatsApp claims 16 billion messages from 400 million international users. To protect user privacy, many of these services typically implement end-to-end and transport layer encryption, which are meant to make eavesdropping infeasible even for the service providers themselves. In this paper, however, we show that it is possible for an eavesdropper to learn information about user actions, the language of messages, and even the length of those messages with greater than 96% accuracy despite the use of state-of-the-art encryption technologies simply by observing the sizes of encrypted packets. While our evaluation focuses on Apple iMessage, the attacks are completely generic and we show how they can be applied to many popular messaging services, including WhatsApp, Viber, and Telegram.",

Users can then work with the network, rather than around it, to achieve better performance, security, or predictable behavior. Our API serves well as the next layer atop current SDN stacks. Our design addresses the two key challenges: how to safely decompose control and visibility of the network, and how to resolve conflicts between untrusted users and across requests, while maintaining baseline levels of fairness and security. Using a real OpenFlow testbed, we demonstrate our API's feasibility through microbenchmarks, and its usefulness by experiments with four real applications modified to take advantage of it.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents SoftRate, a wireless bit rate adaptation protocol that is responsive to rapidly varying channel conditions. Unlike previous work that uses either frame receptions or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimates to select bit rates, SoftRate uses confidence information calculated by the physical layer and exported to higher layers via the SoftPHY interface to estimate the prevailing channel bit error rate (BER). Senders use this BER estimate, calculated over each received packet (even when the packet has no bit errors), to pick good bit rates. SoftRate's novel BER computation works across different wireless environments and hardware without requiring any retraining. SoftRate also uses abrupt changes in the BER estimate to identify interference, enabling it to reduce the bit rate only in response to channel errors caused by attenuation or fading. Our experiments conducted using a software radio prototype show that SoftRate achieves 2X higher throughput than popular frame-level protocols such as SampleRate and RRAA. It also achieves 20% more throughput than an SNR-based protocol trained on the operating environment, and up to 4X higher throughput than an untrained SNR-based protocol. The throughput gains using SoftRate stem from its ability to react to channel variations within a single packet-time and its robustness to collision losses.",

    "abstract": "In multi-tenant datacenters, jobs of different tenants compete for the shared datacenter network and can suffer poor performance and high cost from varying, unpredictable network performance. Recently, several virtual network abstractions have been proposed to provide explicit APIs for tenant jobs to specify and reserve virtual clusters (VC) with both explicit VMs and required network bandwidth between the VMs. However, all of the existing proposals reserve a fixed bandwidth throughout the entire execution of a job. In the paper, we first profile the traffic patterns of several popular cloud applications, and find that they generate substantial traffic during only 30%-60% of the entire execution, suggesting existing simple VC models waste precious networking resources. We then propose a fine-grained virtual network abstraction, Time-Interleaved Virtual Clusters (TIVC), that models the time-varying nature of the networking requirement of cloud applications. To demonstrate the effectiveness of TIVC, we develop Proteus, a system that implements the new abstraction. Using large-scale simulations of cloud application workloads and prototype implementation running actual cloud applications, we show the new abstraction significantly increases the utilization of the entire datacenter and reduces the cost to the tenants, compared to previous fixed-bandwidth abstractions.",

    "abstract": "Many data center applications perform rich and complex tasks (e.g., executing a search query or generating a user's news-feed). From a network perspective, these tasks typically comprise multiple flows, which traverse different parts of the network at potentially different times. Most network resource allocation schemes, however, treat all these flows in isolation -- rather than as part of a task -- and therefore only optimize flow-level metrics. In this paper, we show that task-aware network scheduling, which groups flows of a task and schedules them together, can reduce both the average as well as tail completion time for typical data center applications. To achieve these benefits in practice, we design and implement Baraat, a decentralized task-aware scheduling system. Baraat schedules tasks in a FIFO order but avoids head-of-line blocking by dynamically changing the level of multiplexing in the network. Through experiments with Memcached on a small testbed and large-scale simulations, we show that Baraat outperforms state-of-the-art decentralized schemes (e.g., pFabric) as well as centralized schedulers (e.g., Orchestra) for a wide range of workloads (e.g., search, analytics, etc).",

    "abstract": "The two largest U.S. wireless ISPs have recently moved towards usage-based pricing to better manage the growing demand on their networks. Yet usage-based pricing still requires ISPs to over-provision capacity for demand at peak times of the day. Time-dependent pricing (TDP) addresses this problem by considering when a user consumes data, in addition to how much is used. We present the architecture, implementation, and a user trial of an end-to-end TDP system called TUBE. TUBE creates a price-based feedback control loop between an ISP and its end users. On the ISP side, it computes TDP prices so as to balance the cost of congestion during peak periods with that of offering lower prices in less congested periods. On mobile devices, it provides a graphical user interface that allows users to respond to the offered prices either by themselves or using an \"autopilot\" mode. We conducted a pilot TUBE trial with 50 iPhone or iPad 3G data users, who were charged according to our TDP algorithms. Our results show that TDP benefits both operators and customers, flattening the temporal fluctuation of demand while allowing users to save money by choosing the time and volume of their usage.",

Unlike prior RDMA-based key-value systems, HERD focuses its design on reducing network round trips while using efficient RDMA primitives; the result is substantially lower latency, and throughput that saturates modern, commodity RDMA hardware. HERD has two unconventional decisions: First, it does not use RDMA reads, despite the allure of operations that bypass the remote CPU entirely. Second, it uses a mix of RDMA and messaging verbs, despite the conventional wisdom that the messaging primitives are slow. A HERD client writes its request into the server's memory; the server computes the reply. This design uses a single round trip for all requests and supports up to 26 million key-value operations per second with 5μs average latency. Notably, for small key-value items, our full system throughput is similar to native RDMA read throughput and is over 2X higher than recent RDMA-based key-value systems. We believe that HERD further serves as an effective template for the construction of RDMA-based datacenter services.",

    "abstract": "Many network middleboxes perform deep packet inspection (DPI), a set of useful tasks which examine packet payloads. These tasks include intrusion detection (IDS), exfiltration detection, and parental filtering. However, a long-standing issue is that once packets are sent over HTTPS, middleboxes can no longer accomplish their tasks because the payloads are encrypted. Hence, one is faced with the choice of only one of two desirable properties: the functionality of middleboxes and the privacy of encryption. We propose BlindBox, the first system that simultaneously provides {\\em both} of these properties. The approach of BlindBox is to perform the deep-packet inspection {\\em directly on the encrypted traffic. BlindBox realizes this approach through a new protocol and new encryption schemes. We demonstrate that BlindBox enables applications such as IDS, exfiltration detection and parental filtering, and supports real rulesets from both open-source and industrial DPI systems. We implemented BlindBox and showed that it is practical for settings with long-lived HTTPS connections. Moreover, its core encryption scheme is 3-6 orders of magnitude faster than existing relevant cryptographic schemes.",

    "abstract": "Erasure codes such as Reed-Solomon (RS) codes are being extensively deployed in data centers since they offer significantly higher reliability than data replication methods at much lower storage overheads. These codes however mandate much higher resources with respect to network bandwidth and disk IO during reconstruction of data that is missing or otherwise unavailable. Existing solutions to this problem either demand additional storage space or severely limit the choice of the system parameters. In this paper, we present \"Hitchhiker\", a new erasure-coded storage system that reduces both network traffic and disk IO by around 25% to 45% during reconstruction of missing or otherwise unavailable data, with no additional storage, the same fault tolerance, and arbitrary flexibility in the choice of parameters, as compared to RS-based systems. Hitchhiker 'rides' on top of RS codes, and is based on novel encoding and decoding techniques that will be presented in this paper. We have implemented Hitchhiker in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). When evaluating various metrics on the data-warehouse cluster in production at Facebook with real-time traffic and workloads, during reconstruction, we observe a 36% reduction in the computation time and a 32% reduction in the data read time, in addition to the 35% reduction in network traffic and disk IO. Hitchhiker can thus reduce the latency of degraded reads and perform faster recovery from failed or decommissioned machines.",

Resilience of in-network caches can be improved by guaranteeing that all content therein stored is valid. Digital signatures could be indeed used to verify content integrity and provenance. However, their operation may be much slower than the line rate, thus limiting caching of cryptographically verified objects to a small subset of the forwarded ones. How this affects caching performance? To answer such a question, we devise a simple analytical approach which permits to assess performance of an LRU caching strategy storing a randomly sampled subset of requests. A key feature of our model is the ability to handle traffic beyond the traditional Independent Reference Model, thus permitting us to understand how performance vary in different temporal locality conditions. Results, also verified on real world traces, show that content integrity verification does not necessarily bring about a performance penalty; rather, in some specific (but practical) conditions, performance may even improve.",

The censorship tools inspect DNS queries near the ISP's boundary routers for sensitive domain keywords and inject forged DNS responses, blocking the users from accessing censored sites, such as twitter and facebook. Unfortunately this causes collateral damage, affecting communication beyond the censored networks when outside DNS traffic traverses censored links. In this paper, we analyze the causes of the collateral damages and measure the Internet to identify the injecting activities and their effect. We find 39 ASes in China injecting forged DNS replies. Furthermore, 26 of 43,000 measured open resolvers outside China, distributed in 109 countries, may suffer some collateral damage from these forged replies. Different from previous work that considers the collateral damage being limited to queries to root servers (F, I, J) located in China, we find that most collateral damage arises when the paths between resolvers and some TLD name servers transit through ISPs in China.",

However, existing efficient schedulers require a priori coflow information and ignore cluster dynamics like pipelining, task failures, and speculative executions, which limit their applicability. Schedulers without prior knowledge compromise on performance to avoid head-of-line blocking. In this paper, we present Aalo that strikes a balance and efficiently schedules coflows without prior knowledge. Aalo employs Discretized Coflow-Aware Least-Attained Service (D-CLAS) to separate coflows into a small number of priority queues based on how much they have already sent across the cluster. By performing prioritization across queues and by scheduling coflows in the FIFO order within each queue, Aalo's non-clairvoyant scheduler reduces coflow completion times while guaranteeing starvation freedom. EC2 deployments and trace-driven simulations show that communication stages complete 1.93X faster on average and 3.59X faster at the 95th percentile using Aalo in comparison to per-flow mechanisms. Aalo's performance is comparable to that of solutions using prior knowledge, and Aalo outperforms them in presence of cluster dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Conventional static datacenter (DC) network designs offer extreme cost vs. performance tradeoffs---simple leaf-spine networks are cost-effective but oversubscribed, while \"fat tree\"-like solutions offer good worst-case performance but are expensive. Recent results make a promising case for augmenting an oversubscribed network with reconfigurable inter-rack wireless or optical links. Inspired by the promise of reconfigurability, this paper presents FireFly, an inter-rack network solution that pushes DC network design to the extreme on three key fronts: (1) all links are reconfigurable; (2) all links are wireless; and (3) non top-of-rack switches are eliminated altogether. This vision, if realized, can offer significant benefits in terms of increased flexibility, reduced equipment cost, and minimal cabling complexity. In order to achieve this vision, we need to look beyond traditional RF wireless solutions due to their interference footprint which limits range and data rates. Thus, we make the case for using free-space optics (FSO). We demonstrate the viability of this architecture by (a) building a proof-of-concept prototype of a steerable small form factor FSO device using commodity components and (b) developing practical heuristics to address algorithmic and system-level challenges in network design and management.",

    "abstract": "Load balancing is a foundational function of datacenter infrastructures and is critical to the performance of online services hosted in datacenters. As the demand for cloud services grows, expensive and hard-to-scale dedicated hardware load balancers are being replaced with software load balancers that scale using a distributed data plane that runs on commodity servers. Software load balancers offer low cost, high availability and high flexibility, but suffer high latency and low capacity per load balancer, making them less than ideal for applications that demand either high throughput, or low latency or both. In this paper, we present Duet, which offers all the benefits of software load balancer, along with low latency and high availability -- at next to no cost. We do this by exploiting a hitherto overlooked resource in the data center networks -- the switches themselves. We show how to embed the load balancing functionality into existing hardware switches, thereby achieving organic scalability at no extra cost. For flexibility and high availability, Duet seamlessly integrates the switch-based load balancer with a small deployment of software load balancer. We enumerate and solve several architectural and algorithmic challenges involved in building such a hybrid load balancer. We evaluate Duet using a prototype implementation, as well as extensive simulations driven by traces from our production data centers. Our evaluation shows that Duet provides 10x more capacity than a software load balancer, at a fraction of a cost, while reducing latency by a factor of 10 or more, and is able to quickly adapt to network dynamics including failures.",

Intermediate link delivery rates are common indoors across a wide range of deployment environments. Typical access points share spectrum with dozens of nearby networks, but the presence of a network on a channel does not predict channel utilization. Most access points see 2.4 GHz channel utilization of 20% or more, with the top decile seeing greater than 50%, and the majority of the channel use contains decodable 802.11 headers.",

We show that unlocking this potential is non-trivial: such constellations provide inherently variable connectivity, which today's Internet is ill-suited to accommodate. We therefore study cost-performance tradeoffs in the design space for Internet routing that incorporates satellite connectivity examining four solutions ranging from naively using BGP to an ideal, clean-slate design. We find that the optimal solution is provided by a path-aware networking architecture in which end-hosts obtain information and control over network paths. However, a pragmatic and more deployable approach inspired by the design of content distribution networks can also achieve stable and close-to-optimal performance.",

    "abstract": "This demo presents a measurement toolkit, Mahimahi, that records websites and replays them under emulated network conditions. Mahimahi is structured as a set of arbitrarily composable UNIX shells. It includes two shells to record and replay Web pages, RecordShell and ReplayShell, as well as two shells for network emulation, DelayShell and LinkShell. In addition, Mahimahi includes a corpus of recorded websites along with benchmark results and link traces (https://github.com/ravinet/sites). Mahimahi improves on prior record-and-replay frameworks in three ways. First, it preserves the multi-origin nature of Web pages, present in approximately 98% of the Alexa U.S. Top 500, when replaying. Second, Mahimahi isolates its own network traffic, allowing multiple instances to run concurrently with no impact on the host machine and collected measurements. Finally, Mahimahi is not inherently tied to browsers and can be used to evaluate many different applications. A demo of Mahimahi recording and replaying a Web page over an emulated link can be found at http://youtu.be/vytwDKBA-8s. The source code and instructions to use Mahimahi are available at http://mahimahi.mit.edu/.",

    "abstract": "Software-defined networking introduces the possibility of building self-tuning networks that constantly monitor network conditions and react rapidly to important events such as congestion. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art monitoring mechanisms for conventional networks require hundreds of milliseconds to seconds to extract global network state, like link utilization or the identity of \"elephant\" flows. Such latencies are adequate for responding to persistent issues, e.g., link failures or long-lasting congestion, but are inadequate for responding to transient problems, e.g., congestion induced by bursty workloads sharing a link. In this paper, we present Planck, a novel network measurement architecture that employs oversubscribed port mirroring to extract network information at 280 µs--7 ms timescales on a 1 Gbps commodity switch and 275 µs--4 ms timescales on a 10 Gbps commodity switch,over 11x and 18x faster than recent approaches, respectively (and up to 291x if switch firmware allowed buffering to be disabled on some ports). To demonstrate the value of Planck's speed and accuracy, we use it to drive a traffic engineering application that can reroute congested flows in milliseconds. On a 10 Gbps commodity switch, Planck-driven traffic engineering achieves aggregate throughput within 1--4% of optimal for most workloads we evaluated, even with flows as small as 50 MiB, an improvement of up to 53% over previous schemes.",

    "abstract": "Control planes of forthcoming Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) will be distributed : to ensure availability and fault-tolerance, to improve load-balancing, and to reduce overheads, modules of the control plane should be physically distributed. However, in order to guarantee consistency of network operation, actions performed on the data plane by different controllers may need to be synchronized , which is a nontrivial task. In this paper, we propose a synchronization framework for control planes based on atomic transactions, implemented in-band , on the data-plane switches. We argue that this in-band approach is attractive as it keeps the failure scope local and does not require additional out-of-band coordination mechanisms. It allows us to realize fundamental consensus primitives in the presence of controller failures, and we discuss their applications for consistent policy composition and fault-tolerant control-planes. Interestingly, by using part of the data plane configuration space as a shared memory and leveraging the match-action paradigm, we can implement our synchronization framework in today's standard OpenFlow protocol, and we report on our proof-of-concept implementation.",

We discuss the significance of probe calibration and how we leverage it to identify load issues in older hardware versions (38.6% overall as of Sep 2014) of probes. We show how performance measurement platforms (such as RIPE Atlas, SamKnows, BISmark and Dasu) can benefit from each other by demonstrating two example use-cases.

    "abstract": "Debugging faults in complex networks often requires capturing and analyzing traffic at the packet level. In this task, datacenter networks (DCNs) present unique challenges with their scale, traffic volume, and diversity of faults. To troubleshoot faults in a timely manner, DCN administrators must a) identify affected packets inside large volume of traffic; b) track them across multiple network components; c) analyze traffic traces for fault patterns; and d) test or confirm potential causes. To our knowledge, no tool today can achieve both the specificity and scale required for this task. We present Everflow, a packet-level network telemetry system for large DCNs. Everflow traces specific packets by implementing a powerful packet filter on top of \"match and mirror\" functionality of commodity switches. It shuffles captured packets to multiple analysis servers using load balancers built on switch ASICs, and it sends \"guided probes\" to test or confirm potential faults. We present experiments that demonstrate Everflow's scalability, and share experiences of troubleshooting network faults gathered from running it for over 6 months in Microsoft's DCNs.",

This paper initiates the study of algorithmically exploiting the exibilities present in virtualized and software-defined networks. Particularly, we are interested in the initial as well as the incremental deployment of middleboxes. We present a deterministic O (log(min{ n,k })) approximation algorithm for n -node computer networks, where k is the middlebox capacity. The algorithm is based on optimizing over a submodular function which can be computed efficiently using a fast augmenting path approach. The derived approximation bound is optimal: the underlying problem is computationally hard to approximate within sublogarithmic factors, unless P = NP holds. We additionally present an exact algorithm based on integer programming, and complement our formal analysis with simulations. In particular, we consider the number of used middleboxes and highlight the benefits of the approximation algorithm in incremental deployments. Our approach also finds interesting applications, e.g., in the context of incremental deployment of software-defined networks.",

    "abstract": "Shaken by severe compromises, the Web’s Public Key Infrastructure has seen the addition of several security mechanisms over recent years. One such mechanism is the Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS record, that gives domain name holders control over which Certification Authorities (CAs) may issue certificates for their domain. First defined in RFC 6844, adoption by the CA/B forum mandates that CAs validate CAA records as of September 8, 2017. The success of CAA hinges on the behavior of three actors: CAs, domain name holders, and DNS operators. We empirically study their behavior, and observe that CAs exhibit patchy adherence in issuance experiments, domain name holders configure CAA records in encouraging but error-prone ways, and only six of the 31 largest DNS operators enable customers to add CAA records. Furthermore, using historic CAA data, we uncover anomalies for already-issued certificates. We disseminated our results in the community. This has already led to specific improvements at several CAs and revocation of mis-issued certificates. Furthermore, in this work, we suggest ways to improve the security impact of CAA. To foster further improvements and to practice reproducible research, we share raw data and analysis tools.",

    "abstract": "Traffic measurement is a critical component for the control and engineering of communication networks. We argue that traffic measurement should make it possible to obtain the spatial flow of traffic through the domain, i.e., the paths followed by packets between any ingress and egress point of the domain. Most resource allocation and capacity planning tasks can benefit from such information. Also, traffic measurements should be obtained without a routing model and without knowledge of network state. This allows the traffic measurement process to be resilient to network failures and state uncertainty. We propose a method that allows the direct inference of traffic flows through a domain by observing the trajectories of a subset of all packets traversing the network. The key advantages of the method are that (i) it does not rely on routing state, (ii) its implementation cost is small, and (iii) the measurement reporting traffic is modest and can be controlled precisely. The key idea of the method is to sample packets based on a hash function computed over the packet content. Using the same hash function will yield the same sample set of packets in the entire domain, and enables us to reconstruct packet trajectories.",

We refer to such an architecture as End System Multicast. While End System Multicast has several potential advantages, a key concern is the performance penalty associated with such a design. While preliminary simulation results conducted in static environments are promising, they have yet to consider the challenging performance requirements of real world applications in a dynamic and heterogeneous Internet environment.In this paper, we explore how Internet environments and application requirements can influence End System Multicast design. We explore these issues in the context of audio and video conferencing: an important class of applications with stringent performance requirements. We conduct an extensive evaluation study of schemes for constructing overlay networks on a wide-area test-bed of about twenty hosts distributed around the Internet. Our results demonstrate that it is important to adapt to both latency and bandwidth while constructing overlays optimized for conferencing applications. Further, when relatively simple techniques are incorporated into current self-organizing protocols to enable dynamic adaptation to latency and bandwidth, the performance benefits are significant. Our results indicate that End System Multicast is a promising architecture for enabling performance-demanding conferencing applications in a dynamic and heterogeneous Internet environment.",

    "abstract": "RSVP has been designed to support resource reservation in the Internet. However, it has two major problems: complexity and scalability. The former results in large message processing overhead at end systems and routers, and inefficient firewall processing at the edge of the network. The latter implies that in a backbone environment, the amount of bandwidth consumed by refresh messages and the storage space that is needed to support a large number of flows at a router are too large. We have developed a new reservation mechanism that simplifies the process of establishing reserved flows while preserving many unique features introduced by RSVP. Simplicity is measured in terms of control message processing, data packet processing, and user-level flexibility. Features such as robustness, advertising network service availability and resource sharing among multiple senders are also supported in the proposal.The proposed mechanism, YESSIR (YEt another Sender Session Internet Reservations) generates reservation requests by senders to reduce the processing overhead, builds on top of RTCP, uses soft state to maintain reservation states, supports shared reservation and associated flow merging and is compatible with the IETF Integrated Services models.YESSIR extends the all-or-nothing reservation model to support partial reservations that improve over the duration of the session.To address the scalability issue, we investigate the possibility of using YESSIR for per-stream reservation and RSVP for aggregate reservation.",

We evaluate and compare different replication strategies and reveal interesting structure: Two very common but very different replication strategies - uniform and proportional - yield the same average performance on successful queries, and are in fact worse than any replication strategy which lies between them. The optimal strategy lies between the two and can be achieved by simple distributed algorithms. These fundamental results o.er a new understanding of replication and show that currently deployed replication strategies are far from optimal and that optimal replication is attainable by protocols that resemble existing ones in simplicity and operation.",

Nevertheless it is not widely deployed due to the overhead of existing protocols. In this paper we propose a new protocol called \"Summary Cache\"; each proxy keeps a summary of the URLs of cached documents of each participating proxy and checks these summaries for potential hits before sending any queries. Two factors contribute to the low overhead: the summaries are updated only periodically, and the summary representations are economical --- as low as 8 bits per entry. Using trace-driven simulations and a prototype implementation, we show that compared to the existing Internet Cache Protocol (ICP), Summary Cache reduces the number of inter-cache messages by a factor of 25 to 60, reduces the bandwidth consumption by over 50%, and eliminates between 30% to 95% of the CPU overhead, while at the same time maintaining almost the same hit ratio as ICP. Hence Summary Cache enables cache sharing among a large number of proxies.",

Such a service would enable a large and interesting class of location-aware applications. This is a challenging problem because an IP address does not inherently contain an indication of location.We present and evaluate three distinct techniques, collectively referred to as IP2Geo , for determining the geographic location of Internet hosts. The first technique, Geo Track , infers location based on the DNS names of the target host or other nearby network nodes. The second technique, GeoPing , uses network delay measurements from geographically distributed locations to deduce the coordinates of the target host. The third technique, GeoCluster , combines partial (and possibly inaccurate) host-to-location mapping information and BGP prefix information to infer the location of the target host. Using extensive and varied data sets, we evaluate the performance of these techniques and identify fundamental challenges in deducing geographic location from the IP address of an Internet host.",

    "abstract": "Interframe compression techniques, such as those used in MPEG video, give rise to a coded bit stream where picture sizes differ by a factor of 10 or more. As a result, buffering is needed to reduce (smooth) rate fluctuations of encoder output from one picture to the next; without smoothing, the performance of networks that carry such video traffic would be adversely affected. Various techniques have been suggested for controlling the output rate of a VBR encoder to alleviate network congestion or prevent buffer overflow. Most of these techniques, however, are lossy , and should be used only as a last resort. In this paper, we design and specify an algorithm for lossless smoothing. The algorithm is characterized by three parameters: D (delay bound), K (number of pictures with known sizes), and H (lookahead interval). We present a theorem which guarantees that, if K ≥ 1, the algorithm finds a solution that satisfies the delay bound. (Although the algorithm and theorem were motivated by MPEG video, they are applicable to the smoothing of compressed video in general). To study performance characteristics of the algorithm, we conducted a large number of experiments using statistics from four MPEG video sequences.",

The fundamental feature of the scheme is that the proofs of origin and receipt are not exchanged until both principals have submitted their digitally signed evidence to a trusted third party intermediary. This ensures that if the non-repudiation protocol is not completed, neither principal can gain from the exchange. An added advantage is that the process of dispute arbitration is considerably simplified since a small number of rules are required to decide whether an alleged data exchange took place.",

Yet little is known about the frequency of misconfiguration or its causes, except for the few spectacular incidents of widespread outages. In this paper, we present the first quantitative study of BGP misconfiguration. Over a three week period, we analyzed routing table advertisements from 23 vantage points across the Internet backbone to detect incidents of misconfiguration. For each incident we polled the ISP operators involved to verify whether it was a misconfiguration, and to learn the cause of the incident. We also actively probed the Internet to determine the impact of misconfiguration on connectivity.Surprisingly, we find that configuration errors are pervasive, with 200-1200 prefixes (0.2-1.0% of the BGP table size) suffering from misconfiguration each day. Close to 3 in 4 of all new prefix advertisements were results of misconfiguration. Fortunately, the connectivity seen by end users is surprisingly robust to misconfigurations. While misconfigurations can substantially increase the update load on routers, only one in twenty five affects connectivity. While the causes of misconfiguration are diverse, we argue that most could be prevented through better router design.",

Especially many wireless network technologies contain such links. Spurious retransmission timeouts often cause unnecessary retransmission of several segments, which is harmful for TCP performance. Recent proposals for avoiding unnecessary retransmissions after a spurious RTO require use of TCP options which must be implemented and enabled at both ends of teh connection. We introduce a new TCP sender algorithm for recovery after a retransmission timeout and show that unnecessary retransmissions after a spurious retransmission timeout, improving the TCP performance considerably. The algorithm is friendly towards other TCP connections, because it follows the congestion control principles and injects packets to the network at same rate as a conventional TCP sender. We implemented the algorithm and compared its performance to conventional TCP and Eifel TCP when RTOs occurred either due to sudden delays or due to packet losses. The results show that our algorithm either improves performance or gives similar througput as the other TCP variants evaluated in different test cases.",

In this paper, we propose a new paradigm called trajectory based forwarding (or TBF), which is a generalization of source based routing and Cartesian routing. We argue that TBF is an ideal technique for routing in dense ad-hoc networks. Trajectories are a natural namespace for describing route paths when the topology of the network matches the topography of the physical surroundings in which it is deployed which by very definition is embedded computing.We show how simple trajectories can be used in implementing important networking protocols such as flooding, discovery, and network management. Trajectory routing is very effective in implementing many networking functions in a quick and approximate way, as it needs very few support services. We discuss several research challenges in the design of network protocols that use specific trajectories for forwarding packets.",

The structure of the graph enables efficient discovery of data items given their keys but it does not support complex queries.Should we build Gnutella on a structured overlay? We believe the answer is yes. We replaced the random graph in Gnutella by a structured overlay while retaining the content placement and discovery mechanisms of unstructured overlays to support complex queries. Our preliminary results indicate that we can use structure to improve the performance of floods and rondom walks. They also indicate that structure can be used to reduce maintenance overhead, which is surprising because it is commonly believed that unstructured overlays have lower maintenance overhead than structured overlays.",

We show how to split, replicate, and erasure code message fragments over multiple delivery paths to optimize the probability of successful message delivery. We provide a formulation of this problem and solve it for two cases: a 0/1 (Bernoulli) path delivery model where messages are either fully lost or delivered, and a Gaussian path delivery model where only a fraction of a message may be delivered. Ideas from the modern portfolio theory literature are borrowed to solve the underlying optimization problem. Our approach is directly relevant to solving similar problems that arise in replica placement in distributed file systems and virtual node placement in DHTs. In three different simulated DTN scenarios covering a wide range of applications, we show the effectiveness of our approach in handling failures.",

Next we examine three alternate mechanisms for generating and using acknowledgments designed to mitigate the negative impact of delayed acknowledgments. The first method is to generate delayed ACKs only when the sender is not using the slow start algorithm. The second mechanism, called byte counting , allows TCP senders to increase the amount of data being injected into the network based on the amount of data acknowledged rather than on the number of acknowledgments received. The last mechanism is a limited form of byte counting. Each of these mechanisms is evaluated in a simulated network with no competing traffic, as well as a dynamic environment with a varying amount of competing traffic. We study the costs and benefits of the alternate mechanisms when compared to the standard algorithm with delayed ACKs.",

We look at both of these problems in the context of TCP, using a large TCP measurement set [Pax97b] for trace-driven simulations. For RTO estimation, we evaluate a number of different algorithms, finding that the performance of the estimators is dominated by their minimum values, and to a lesser extent, the timer granularity, while being virtually unaffected by how often round-trip time measurements are made or the settings of the parameters in the exponentially-weighted moving average estimators commonly used. For bandwidth estimation, we explore techniques previously sketched in the literature [Hoe96, AD98] and find that in practice they perform less well than anticipated.

    "abstract": "A wireless ad hoc network is formed by a group of wireless hosts, without the use of any infrastructure. To enable communication, hosts cooperate among themselves to forward packets on behalf of each other. A key challenge in ad hoc networks lies in designing efficient routing strategies. While several routing protocols have been proposed, most of them aim to select one optimal route between the source and destination. The MAC layer at each intermediate node is then required to forward packets to the next downstream node on that route. We argue that choosing a single optimal route at the network layer may not be sufficient. Knowledge of short-term channel conditions at the MAC layer can play an important role in improving end-to-end performance. Instantaneous interference, channel contention, power constraints and other considerations may be taken into account along with the network layer's long-term view. This paper proposes MAC layer anycasting - a forwarding strategy that combines the guidelines from the network layer, with MAC layer knowledge of the local channel. We describe some applications of MAC-layer anycasting , and discuss the performance related tradeoffs.",

A client request for an uncached document may cause the removal of one or more cached documents. Variable document sizes and types allow a rich variety of policies to select a document for removal, in contrast to policies for CPU caches or demand paging, that manage homogeneous objects.

Through trace-driven simulation, we determine the maximum possible hit rate and weighted hit rate that a cache could ever achieve, and the removal policy that maximizes hit rate and weighted hit rate. The experiments use five traces of 37 to 185 days of client URL requests. Surprisingly, the criteria used by several proxy-server removal policies (LRU, Hyper-G, and a proposal by Pitkow and Recker) are among the worst performing criteria in our simulation; instead, replacing documents based on size maximizes hit rate in each of the studied workloads.",

    "abstract": "Engineering a large IP backbone network without an accurate, network-wide view of the traffic demands is challenging. Shifts in user behavior, changes in routing policies, and failures of network elements can result in significant (and sudden) fluctuations in load. In this paper, we present a model of traffic demands to support traffic engineering and performance debugging of large Internet Service Provider networks. By defining a traffic demand as a volume of load originating from an ingress link and destined to a set of egress links, we can capture and predict how routing affects the traffic traveling between domains. To infer the traffic demands, we propose a measurement methodology that combines flow-level measurements collected at all ingress links with reachability information about all egress links. We discuss how to cope with situations where practical considerations limit the amount and quality of the necessary data. Specifically, we show how to infer interdomain traffic demands using measurements collected at a smaller number of edge links --- the peering links connecting to neighboring providers. We report on our experiences in deriving the traffic demands in the AT&amp;T IP Backbone, by collecting, validating, and joining very large and diverse sets of usage, configuration, and routing data over extended periods of time. The paper concludes with a preliminary analysis of the observed dynamics of the traffic demands and a discussion of the practical implications for traffic engineering.",

The FACK algorithm is based on first principles of congestion control and is designed to be used with the proposed TCP SACK option. By decoupling congestion control from other algorithms such as data recovery, it attains more precise control over the data flow in the network. We introduce two additional algorithms to improve the behavior in specific situations. Through simulations we compare FACK to both Reno and Reno with SACK.

The ZRP proactively maintains routing information for a local neighborhood (routing zone), while reactively acquiring routes to destinations beyond the routing zone. This hybrid routing approach has the potential to be more efficient in the generation of control traffic than traditional routing schemes. However, without proper query control techniques, the ZRP can actually produce more traffic than standard flooding protocols.Our proposed query control schemes exploit the structure of the routing zone to provide enhanced detection (Query Detection (QD1/QD2)), termination (Loop-back Termination (LT), Early Termination (ET)) and prevention (Selective Bordercasting (SBC)) of overlapping queries. We demonstrate how certain combinations of these techniques can be applied to single channel or multiple channel ad-hoc networks to improve both the delay and control traffic performance of the ZRP. Our query control mechanisms allow the ZRP to provide routes to all accessible network nodes with only a fraction of the control traffic generated by purely proactive distance vector and purely reactive flooding schemes, and with a response time as low as 10% of a flooding route query delay.",

We report on an analysis of 40,000 end-to-end route measurements conducted using repeated \"traceroutes\" between 37 Internet sites. We analyze the routing behavior for pathological conditions, routing stability, and routing symmetry. For pathologies, we characterize the prevalence of routing loops, erroneous routing, infrastructure failures, and temporary outages. We find that the likelihood of encountering a major routing pathology more than doubled between the end of 1994 and the end of 1995, rising from 1.5% to 3.4%. For routing stability, we define two separate types of stability, \"prevalence\" meaning the overall likelihood that a particular route is encountered, and \"persistence,\" the likelihood that a route remains unchanged over a long period of time. We find that Internet paths are heavily dominated by a single prevalent route, but that the time periods over which routes persist show wide variation, ranging from seconds up to days. About 2/3's of the Internet paths had routes persisting for either days or weeks. For routing symmetry, we look at the likelihood that a path through the Internet visits at least one different city in the two directions. At the end of 1995, this was the case half the time, and at least one different autonomous system was visited 30% of the time.",

    "abstract": "Current intra-domain Traffic Engineering (TE) relies on offline methods, which use long term average traffic demands. It cannot react to realtime traffic changes caused by BGP reroutes, diurnal traffic variations, attacks, or flash crowds. Further, current TE deals with network failures by pre-computing alternative routings for a limited set of failures. It may fail to prevent congestion when unanticipated or combination failures occur, even though the network has enough capacity to handle the failure.This paper presents TeXCP, an online distributed TE protocol that balances load in realtime, responding to actual traffic demands and failures. TeXCP uses multiple paths to deliver demands from an ingress to an egress router, adaptively moving traffic from over-utilized to under-utilized paths. These adaptations are carefully designed such that, though done independently by each edge router based on local information, they balance load in the whole network without oscillations. We model TeXCP, prove the stability of the model, and show that it is easy to implement. Our extensive simulations show that, for the same traffic demands, a network using TeXCP supports the same utilization and failure resilience as a network that uses traditional offline TE, but with half or third the capacity.",

AQM flavors considered include \"RED\", the more recently proposed \"Gentle RED\" and an additional mechanism we call \"Gentle RED with instantaneous queue size\".We use experimentation to analyze the performance of the AQM mechanisms identified above on the aggregate traffic going through a congested router. The metrics used are: TCP goodput, TCP and UDP loss rate, queueing delay and consecutive loss probability. The AQM mechanisms are compared to Drop from Tail, the buffer management mechanism currently found in most operational routers.The major observation is that AQM mechanisms have a minor impact on the aggregate performance metrics we observe. On the other hand, we observe an important sensitivity of the AQMs considered to traffic characteristics that may compromise their operational deployment.",

Hardware-based experimentation provides realism, but is tightly coupled to the physical environment and circumstances under which experiments are carried out. To overcome this, researchers have understandably embraced simulation as a means of evaluation. Unfortunately, wireless simulation is plagued with inherent inaccuracies. To overcome the stark tradeoff between the realism of hardware-based experimentation and the repeatability of simulation-based experimentation, we are developing a wireless emulator that enables both realistic and repeatable experimentation. Unlike previous emulators, our approach simultaneously achieves both a high degree of realism and fine-grained repeatability by leveraging physical layer emulation.",

    "abstract": "Router mechanisms designed to achieve fair bandwidth allocations, like Fair Queueing, have many desirable properties for congestion control in the Internet. However, such mechanisms usually need to maintain state, manage buffers, and/or perform packet scheduling on a per flow basis, and this complexity may prevent them from being cost-effectively implemented and widely deployed. In this paper, we propose an architecture that significantly reduces this implementation complexity yet still achieves approximately fair bandwidth allocations. We apply this approach to an island of routers --- that is, a contiguous region of the network --- and we distinguish between edge routers and core routers. Edge routers maintain per flow state; they estimate the incoming rate of each flow and insert a label into each packet header based on this estimate. Core routers maintain no per flow state; they use FIFO packet scheduling augmented by a probabilistic dropping algorithm that uses the packet labels and an estimate of the aggregate traffic at the router. We call the scheme Core -Stateless Fair Queueing. We present simulations and analysis on the performance of this approach, and discuss an alternate approach.",

This paper argues that this approach has several advantages in managing and controlling a complex, federated, and evolving network: (1) a declarative logic language provides a natural way to express the kinds of statements that are common to this application domain, through temporal and positional logic rules, facts and expressions; and (2) distributed evaluation of such logic expressions provides many opportunities for performance optimization yielding an efficient system.",

    "abstract": "TCP has become the dominant protocol for all network data transport because it presents a simple uniform data delivery service which is sufficient for most applications over all types of lower network layers. By its very nature, TCP's adaption and retransmission strategies hide all of the details of the lower layers from the application. For example the only symptom of spurious packet loss (or nearly any other network problem) is longer elapsed time and lower performance.This information hiding is fundamentally important to the growth of the Internet because it decouples the evolution of applications from the evolution of link layers. However it also hides valuable information from researchers, educators, network administrators, and other people who would benefit from insight into the inner workings of TCP and the lower layers.In this paper, we present an architecture and infrastructure that provides for per-connection TCP instrumentation to expose otherwise hidden protocol events. We show examples how the infrastructure can be used in support of research, education and advanced network diagnostic tools.Our work was motivated by the observation that since about 1985 network data rates for typical novice network users have fallen by about three orders of magnitude behind expert users (who have kept up with Moore's Law). We use the term \"Wizard Gap\" to describe this phenomenon. The Web100 and Net100 projects were formed as one step in closing the Wizard Gap.",

Starting from observed traffic at a single point in the network, Swing automatically extracts distributions for user, application, and network behavior. It then generates live traffic corresponding to the underlying models in a network emulation environment running commodity network protocol stacks. We find that the generated traces are statistically similar to the original traces. Further, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to reproduce burstiness in traffic across a range of timescales using a model applicable to a variety of network settings. An initial sensitivity analysis reveals the importance of capturing and recreating user, application, and network characteristics to accurately reproduce such burstiness. Finally, we explore Swing's ability to vary user characteristics, application properties, and wide-area network conditions to project traffic characteristics into alternate scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge of the largest traffic ows in a network is important for many network management applications. The problem of finding these ows is known as the heavy-hitter problem and has been the subject of many studies in the past years. One of the most efficient and well-known algorithms for finding heavy hitters is lossy counting [29]. In this work we introduce probabilistic lossy counting (PLC), which enhances lossy counting in computing network traffic heavy hitters. PLC uses on a tighter error bound on the estimated sizes of traffic ows and provides probabilistic rather than deterministic guarantees on its accuracy. The probabilistic-based error bound substantially improves the memory consumption of the algorithm. In addition, PLC reduces the rate of false positives of lossy counting and achieves a low estimation error, although slightly higher than that of lossy counting We compare PLC with state-of-the-art algorithms for finding heavy hitters.

    "abstract": "The throughput of existing MIMO LANs is limited by the number of antennas on the AP. This paper shows how to overcome this limit. It presents interference alignment and cancellation (IAC), a new approach for decoding concurrent sender-receiver pairs in MIMO networks. IAC synthesizes two signal processing techniques, interference alignment and interference cancellation, showing that the combination applies to scenarios where neither interference alignment nor cancellation applies alone. We show analytically that IAC almost doubles the throughput of MIMO LANs. We also implement IAC in GNU-Radio, and experimentally demonstrate that for 2x2 MIMO LANs, IAC increases the average throughput by 1.5x on the downlink and 2x on the uplink.",

    "abstract": "Industry observers expect VoIP to eventually replace most of the existing land-line telephone connections. Currently however, quality and reliability concerns largely limit VoIP usage to either personal calls on cross-domain services such as Skype and Vonage, or to single-domain services such as trunking, where a core ISP carries long-distance voice as VoIP only within its backbone, to save cost with a unified voice/data infrastructure. This paper investigates the factors that prevent cross-domain VoIP deployments from achieving the quality and reliability of existing land-line telephony (PSTN). We ran over 50,000 VoIP phone calls between 24 locations in US and Europe for a three-week period. Our results indicate that VoIP usability is hindered as much by BGP's slow convergence as network congestion. In fact, about half of the unintelligible VoIP samples in our data occur within 10 minutes of a BGP update",

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose a radical solution to data hosting and delivery for the Internet of the future. The current data delivery architecture is \"network centric\", with content stored in data centers connected directly to Internet backbones. This approach has multiple drawbacks among which complexity of deploying data centers, power consumption, and lack of scalability are the most critical. We propose a totally innovative and orthogonal approach to traditional data centers, through what we call \"nano\" data centers, which are deployed in boxes at the edge of the network (e.g., in home gateways, set-top-boxes, etc.) and accessed using a new peer-to-peer communication infrastructure. Unlike traditional peer-to-peer clients, however, our nano data centers operate under a common management authority, e.g., the ISP who installs and maintains the set-top-boxes, and can thus cooperate more effectively and achieve a higher aggregate performance. Nano data centers are, therefore, better suited for providing guaranteed quality to new emerging applications such as online gaming, interactive IPTV and VoD, and user generated content",

    "abstract": "Designers of content distribution networks often need to determine how changes to infrastructure deployment and configuration affect service response times when they deploy a new data center, change ISP peering, or change the mapping of clients to servers. Today, the designers use coarse, back-of-the-envelope calculations, or costly field deployments; they need better ways to evaluate the effects of such hypothetical \"what-if\" questions before the actual deployments. This paper presents What-If Scenario Evaluator (WISE), a tool that predicts the effects of possible configuration and deployment changes in content distribution networks. WISE makes three contributions: (1) an algorithm that uses traces from existing deployments to learn causality among factors that affect service response-time distributions; (2) an algorithm that uses the learned causal structure to estimate a dataset that is representative of the hypothetical scenario that a designer may wish to evaluate, and uses these datasets to predict future response-time distributions; (3) a scenario specification language that allows a network designer to easily express hypothetical deployment scenarios without being cognizant of the dependencies between variables that affect service response times. Our evaluation, both in a controlled setting and in a real-world field deployment at a large, global CDN, shows that WISE can quickly and accurately predict service response-time distributions for many practical What-If scenarios.",

Consequently, many protocol verification tools have been built based on the method of reachability analysis. Nevertheless, it is also well known that state space explosion is the most severe limitation to the applicability of this method. Although researchers in the field have proposed various strategies to relieve this intricate problem when building the tools, a survey and evaluation of these strategies has not been done in the literature. In searching for an appropriate approach to tackling such a problem for a grammar-based validation tool, we have collected and evaluated these relief strategies, and have decided to develop our own from yet another but more systematic approach. The results of our research are now reported in this paper. Essentially, the paper is to serve two purposes: first, to give a survey and evaluation of existing relief strategies; second, to propose a new strategy, called PROVAT (PROtocol VAlidation Testing), which is inspired by the heuristic search techniques in Artificial Intelligence. Preliminary results of incorporating the PROVAT strategy into our validation tool are reviewed in the paper. These results show the empirical evidence of the effectiveness of the PROVAT strategy.",

They identify the heavy-hitters - flows that exchange high volumes of data, yet fail to identify the structure implicit in network traffic - do certain flows happen before, after or along with each other repeatedly over time? Since most traffic is generated by applications (web browsing, email, p2p), network traffic tends to be governed by a set of underlying rules. Malicious traffic such as network-wide scans for vulnerable hosts (mySQLbot) also presents distinct patterns. We present eXpose, a technique to learn the underlying rules that govern communication over a network. From packet timing information, eXpose learns rules for network communication that may be spread across multiple hosts, protocols or applications. Our key contribution is a novel statistical rule mining technique to extract significant communication patterns in a packet trace without explicitly being told what to look for. Going beyond rules involving flow pairs, eXpose introduces templates to systematically abstract away parts of flows thereby capturing rules that are otherwise unidentifiable. Deployments within our lab and within a large enterprise show that eXpose discovers rules that help with network monitoring, diagnosis, and intrusion detection with few false positives.",

    "abstract": "Video-on-demand in the Internet has become an immensely popular service in recent years. But due to its high bandwidth requirements and popularity, it is also a costly service to provide. We consider the design and potential benefits of peer-assisted video-on-demand, in which participating peers assist the server in delivering VoD content. The assistance is done in such a way that it provides the same user quality experience as pure client-server distribution. We focus on the single-video approach, whereby a peer only redistributes a video that it is currently watching. Using a nine-month trace from a client-server VoD deployment for MSN Video, we assess what the 95 percentile server bandwidth costs would have been if a peer-assisted employment had been instead used. We show that peer-assistance can dramatically reduce server bandwidth costs, particularly if peers prefetch content when there is spare upload capacity in the system. We consider the impact of peer-assisted VoD on the cross-traffic among ISPs. Although this traffic is significant, if care is taken to localize the P2P traffic within the ISPs, we can eliminate the ISP cross traffic while still achieving important reductions in server bandwidth. We also develop a simple analytical model which captures many of the critical features of peer-assisted VoD, including its operational modes.",

    "abstract": "Building distributed applications that run in data centers is hard. The CamCube project explores the design of a shipping container sized data center with the goal of building an easier platform on which to build these applications. CamCube replaces the traditional switch-based network with a 3D torus topology, with each server directly connected to six other servers. As in other proposals, e.g. DCell and BCube, multi-hop routing in CamCube requires servers to participate in packet forwarding. To date, as in existing data centers, these approaches have all provided a single routing protocol for the applications. In this paper we explore if allowing applications to implement their own routing services is advantageous, and if we can support it efficiently. This is based on the observation that, due to the flexibility offered by the CamCube API, many applications implemented their own routing protocol in order to achieve specific application-level characteristics, such as trading off higher-latency for better path convergence. Using large-scale simulations we demonstrate the benefits and network-level impact of running multiple routing protocols. We demonstrate that applications are more efficient and do not generate additional control traffic overhead. This motivates us to design an extended routing service allowing easy implementation of application-specific routing protocols on CamCube. Finally, we demonstrate that the additional performance overhead incurred when using the extended routing service on a prototype CamCube is very low.",

Such hybrid architectures enable enterprises to benefit from cloud-based architectures, while honoring application performance requirements, and privacy restrictions on what services may be migrated to the cloud. We make several contributions. First, we highlight the complexity inherent in enterprise applications today in terms of their multi-tiered nature, large number of application components, and interdependencies. Second, we have developed a model to explore the benefits of a hybrid migration approach. Our model takes into account enterprise-specific constraints, cost savings, and increased transaction delays and wide-area communication costs that may result from the migration. Evaluations based on real enterprise applications and Azure-based cloud deployments show the benefits of a hybrid migration approach, and the importance of planning which components to migrate. Third, we shed insight on security policies associated with enterprise applications in data centers. We articulate the importance of ensuring assurable reconfiguration of security policies as enterprise applications are migrated to the cloud. We present algorithms to achieve this goal, and demonstrate their efficacy on realistic migration scenarios.",

We revisit this important topic in this paper, focusing on not only comparing with the previous results, but also issues not well explored before. We have found that, compared to almost a decade ago, although certain characteristics remain unchanged (such as some temporal properties), BGP dynamics are now 'busier,' and more importantly, now have much less pathological behavior and are 'healthier'; for example, forwarding dynamics are now not only dominant, but also more consistent across different days. Contributions to BGP dynamics by different BGP peers-which are not proportional to the size of a peer's AS-are also more stable, and dynamics due to policy changes or duplicate announcements are usually from specific peers",

We study the performance users achieve and how various factors ranging from the user's choice of modem to the ISP's traffic shaping policies can affect performance.

    "abstract": "The use of cellular data networks is increasingly popular as network coverage becomes more ubiquitous and many diverse user-contributed mobile applications become available. The growing cellular traffic demand means that cellular network carriers are facing greater challenges to provide users with good network performance and energy efficiency, while protecting networks from potential attacks. To better utilize their limited network resources while securing the network and protecting client devices the carriers have already deployed various network policies that influence traffic behavior. Today, these policies are mostly opaque, though they directly impact application designs and may even introduce network vulnerabilities. We present NetPiculet , the first tool that unveils carriers' NAT and firewall policies by conducting intelligent measurement. By running NetPiculet on the major U.S. cellular providers as well as deploying it as a smartphone application in the wild covering more than 100 cellular ISPs, we identified the key NAT and firewall policies which have direct implications on performance, energy, and security. For example, NAT boxes and firewalls set timeouts for idle TCP connections, which sometimes cause significant energy waste on mobile devices. Although most carriers today deploy sophisticated firewalls, they are still vulnerable to various attacks such as battery draining and denial of service. These findings can inform developers in optimizing the interaction between mobile applications and cellular networks and also guide carriers in improving their network configurations.",

    "abstract": "Packet Classification is a key functionality provided by modern routers. Previous decision-tree algorithms, HiCuts and HyperCuts, cut the multi-dimensional rule space to separate a classifier's rules. Despite their optimizations, the algorithms incur considerable memory overhead due to two issues: (1) Many rules in a classifier overlap and the overlapping rules vary vastly in size, causing the algorithms' fine cuts for separating the small rules to replicate the large rules. (2) Because a classifier's rule-space density varies significantly, the algorithms' equi-sized cuts for separating the dense parts needlessly partition the sparse parts, resulting in many ineffectual nodes that hold only a few rules. We propose EffiCuts which employs four novel ideas: (1) Separable trees: To eliminate overlap among small and large rules, we separate all small and large rules. We define a subset of rules to be separable if all the rules are either small or large in each dimension. We build a distinct tree for each such subset where each dimension can be cut coarsely to separate the large rules, or finely to separate the small rules without incurring replication. (2) Selective tree merging: To reduce the multiple trees' extra accesses which degrade throughput, we selectively merge separable trees mixing rules that may be small or large in at most one dimension. (3) Equi-dense cuts: We employ unequal cuts which distribute a node's rules evenly among the children, avoiding ineffectual nodes at the cost of a small processing overhead in the tree traversal. (4) Node Co-location: To achieve fewer accesses per node than HiCuts and HyperCuts, we co-locate parts of a node and its children. Using ClassBench, we show that for similar throughput EffiCuts needs factors of 57 less memory than HyperCuts and of 4-8 less power than TCAM.",

    "abstract": "Data centers have a crucial role in current Internet architecture supporting content-centric networking. State-of-the-art data centers have different architectures like fat-tree, DCell, or BCube. However, their architectures share a common property: symmetry. Due to their symmetric nature, a tricky point with these architectures is that they are hard to be extended in small quantities. Contrary to state-of-the-art data center architectures, we propose an asymmetric data center topology generation method called Scafida inspired by scale-free networks; these data centers have not only small diameters and high fault tolerance, inherited by scale-free networks, but can also be scaled in smaller and less homogenous increments. We extend the original scale-free network generation algorithm of Barabasi and Albert to meet the physical constraints of switches and routers. Despite the fact that our method artificially limits the node degrees in the network, our data center architectures keep the preferable properties of scale-free networks. Based on extensive simulations we present preliminary results that are promising regarding the error tolerance, scalability, and flexibility of the architecture.",

    "abstract": "There is a long-standing vision of embedding backscatter nodes like RFIDs into everyday objects to build ultra-low power ubiquitous networks. A major problem that has challenged this vision is that backscatter communication is neither reliable nor efficient. Backscatter nodes cannot sense each other, and hence tend to suffer from colliding transmissions. Further, they are ineffective at adapting the bit rate to channel conditions, and thus miss opportunities to increase throughput, or transmit above capacity causing errors. This paper introduces a new approach to backscatter communication. The key idea is to treat all nodes as if they were a single virtual sender. One can then view collisions as a code across the bits transmitted by the nodes. By ensuring only a few nodes collide at any time, we make collisions act as a sparse code and decode them using a new customized compressive sensing algorithm. Further, we can make these collisions act as a rateless code to automatically adapt the bit rate to channel quality --i.e., nodes can keep colliding until the base station has collected enough collisions to decode. Results from a network of backscatter nodes communicating with a USRP backscatter base station demonstrate that the new design produces a 3.5× throughput gain, and due to its rateless code, reduces message loss rate in challenging scenarios from 50% to zero.",

Using a controlled setting allows us to independently investigate the influence on delay measurements when competing virtual machines (VMs) perform tasks that consume CPU, memory, I/O, hard disk, and network bandwidth. Our results indicate that heavy network usage from competing VMs can introduce delays as high as 100 ms to round-trip times. Furthermore, virtualization adds most of this delay when sending packets, whereas packet reception introduces little extra delay. Based on our findings, we discuss guidelines and propose a feedback mechanism to avoid measurement bias under virtualization.",

    "abstract": "It is envisaged that services and applications will migrate to a cloud-computing paradigm where thin-clients on user-devices access, over the network, applications hosted in data centers by application service providers. Examples are cloud-based gaming applications and cloud-supported virtual desktops. For good performance and efficiency, it is critical that these services are delivered from locations that are the best for the current (dynamically changing) set of users. To achieve this, we expect that services will be hosted on virtual machines in interconnected data centers and that these virtual machines will migrate dynamically to locations best-suited for the current user population. A basic network infrastructure need then is the ability to migrate virtual machines across multiple networks without losing service continuity. In this paper, we develop mechanisms to accomplish this using a network-virtualization architecture that relies on a set of distributed forwarding elements with centralized control (borrowing on several recent proposals in a similar vein). We describe a preliminary prototype system, built using Openflow components, that demonstrates the feasibility of this architecture in enabling seamless migration of virtual machines and in enhancing delivery of cloud-based services.",

    "abstract": "We assume the reader is somewhat familiar with the ongoing development of Aloha techniques as described briefly in Abramson's FJCC 7 0 paper and Roberts's SJCC72 paper. In short, an Aloha system permits the (hopefully) occasional interference of data packet transmissions in a multi-access channel and provides for the retransmission of lost packets after some randomly distributed interval. The purposes behind permitting interference and providing recovery are (1) reduced central communication control to improve reliability and (2) improved use of communication facilites under bursty loads as found in interactive computer communication. Aloha techniques are finding applicability in various communication contexts (e.g., satellites), but here the emphasis is on large populations of (potentially mobile) interactive terminals. Slotted . In a slotted Aloha system, all terminals begin their packet (re)transmissions at the ' tick of some global clock. Slotting has been advocated by Roberts as a simple way to improve the limiting thruput of an Aloha channel by a factor of 2. Global ticking can be implemented in a (hopefully positive) number of ways and its feasibility is assumed in this paper. We rely on slotting to simplify our analysis, but suggest that the stability and control phenomena studied are characteristic of Aloha systems in general. Controlled . The notion of an optimal retransmission delay was introduced by Roberts. We extend the notion to include dynamic control of retransmission delay. A controlled Aloha system has the property that its terminals adjust their retransmission behavior as a function of perceived channel utilization. It will be shown that such adjustments are implementable in at least one way and that they improve system performance under heavy loads. Blocking and Thinking . When a user's terminal has a ready packet, it is assumed that no new packets can be generated. The user is said to be blocked . When a user is not blocked, he is said to be thinking . This assumption about user behavior departs from Abramson 's analysis and is thought to produce more realistic solutions. Recall that Abramson (in FJCC70) modelled users as unperturbable, realtime, Poisson sources of new packets. By adding blocking to an Aloha model, transmission delays feed back (as in real life) on the generation of transmission requests. User sessions are said to be dilated by transmissions delays. It is intended that think time account for (1) delays in central system response, (2) return transmission delays, (3) real user thinking time, and (4) type-in time. Block time accounts only for delays due to transmissions through the multi-access channel. The following analysis rests on some (very) simplifying assumptions about an Aloha system in equilibrium, in steady state. While having a large population of users tends to support our steady-state arguments, the dynamics do indeed require more detailed investigation.",

The weights are either specified by a manager, or automatically assigned at each switch port based on a virtual machine heuristic for isolation. Bandwidth unused by a service is shared proportionately by other services, providing weighted hierarchical max-min fair sharing. On a testbed of Fulcrum switches, we demonstrate that NetShare provides bandwidth isolation in various settings, including multipath networks.",

    "abstract": "Today, a large fraction of Internet traffic is originated by Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). To cope with increasing demand for content, CDNs have deployed massively distributed infrastructures. These deployments pose challenges for CDNs as they have to dynamically map end-users to appropriate servers without being full+y aware of the network conditions within an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or the end-user location. On the other hand, ISPs struggle to cope with rapid traffic shifts caused by the dynamic server selection policies of the CDNs. The challenges that CDNs and ISPs face separately can be turned into an opportunity for collaboration. We argue that it is sufficient for CDNs and ISPs to coordinate only in server selection, not routing, in order to perform traffic engineering. To this end, we propose Content-aware Traffic Engineering (CaTE), which dynamically adapts server selection for content hosted by CDNs using ISP recommendations on small time scales. CaTE relies on the observation that by selecting an appropriate server among those available to deliver the content, the path of the traffic in the network can be influenced in a desired way. We present the design and implementation of a prototype to realize CaTE, and show how CDNs and ISPs can jointly take advantage of the already deployed distributed hosting infrastructures and path diversity, as well as the ISP detailed view of the network status without revealing sensitive operational information. By relying on tier-1 ISP traces, we show that CaTE allows CDNs to enhance the end-user experience while enabling an ISP to achieve several traffic engineering goals.",

However, unlike other resources, it is neither shared proportionally to payment, nor do cloud providers offer minimum guarantees on network bandwidth. The reason networks are more difficult to share is because the network allocation of a virtual machine (VM) X depends not only on the VMs running on the same machine with X , but also on the other VMs that X communicates with and the cross-traffic on each link used by X . In this paper, we start from the above requirements--payment proportionality and minimum guarantees--and show that the network-specific challenges lead to fundamental tradeoffs when sharing cloud networks. We then propose a set of properties to explicitly express these tradeoffs. Finally, we present three allocation policies that allow us to navigate the tradeoff space. We evaluate their characteristics through simulation and testbed experiments to show that they can provide minimum guarantees and achieve better proportionality than existing solutions.",

CarSpeak enables a car to query and access sensory information captured by other cars in a manner similar to how it accesses information from its local sensors. CarSpeak adopts a content-centric approach where information objects -- i.e., regions along the road -- are first class citizens. It names and accesses road regions using a multi-resolution system, which allows it to scale the amount of transmitted data with the available bandwidth. CarSpeak also changes the MAC protocol so that, instead of having nodes contend for the medium, contention is between road regions, and the medium share assigned to any region depends on the number of cars interested in that region. CarSpeak is implemented in a state-of-the-art autonomous driving system and tested on indoor and outdoor hardware testbeds including an autonomous golf car and 10 iRobot Create robots. In comparison with a baseline that directly uses 802.11, CarSpeak reduces the time for navigating around obstacles by 2.4x, and reduces the probability of a collision due to limited visibility by 14x.",

By contrast, our abstraction assumes no prior context and is useful in networking and distributed systems applications such as trading blocks in a peer-to-peer network, and synchronizing link-state databases after a partition. Our basic set-reconciliation method has a similarity with the peeling algorithm used in Tornado codes [6], which is not surprising, as there is an intimate connection between set difference and coding. Beyond set reconciliation, an essential component in our Difference Digest is a new estimator for the size of the set difference that outperforms min-wise sketches [3] for small set differences. Our experiments show that the Difference Digest is more efficient than prior approaches such as Approximate Reconciliation Trees [5] and Characteristic Polynomial Interpolation [17].

    "abstract": "Large datacenter operators with sites at multiple locations dimension their key resources according to the peak demand of the geographic area that each site covers. The demand of specific areas follows strong diurnal patterns with high peak to valley ratios that result in poor average utilization across a day. In this paper, we show how to rescue unutilized bandwidth across multiple datacenters and backbone networks and use it for non-real-time applications, such as backups, propagation of bulky updates, and migration of data. Achieving the above is non-trivial since leftover bandwidth appears at different times, for different durations, and at different places in the world. For this purpose, we have designed, implemented, and validated NetStitcher , a system that employs a network of storage nodes to stitch together unutilized bandwidth, whenever and wherever it exists. It gathers information about leftover resources, uses a store-and-forward algorithm to schedule data transfers, and adapts to resource fluctuations. We have compared NetStitcher with other bulk transfer mechanisms using both a testbed and a live deployment on a real CDN. Our testbed evaluation shows that NetStitcher outperforms all other mechanisms and can rescue up to five times additional datacenter bandwidth thus making it a valuable tool for datacenter providers. Our live CDN deployment demonstrates that our solution can perform large data transfers at a much lower cost than naive end-to-end or store-and-forward schemes.",

To address this problem we present a design for an power-proportional cluster consisting of a power-aware cluster manager and a set of heterogeneous machines. Our design makes use of currently available energy-efficient hardware, mechanisms for transitioning in and out of low-power sleep states, and dynamic provisioning and scheduling to continually adjust to workload and minimize power consumption. With our design we are able to reduce energy consumption while maintaining acceptable response times for a web service workload based on Wikipedia. With our dynamic provisioning algorithms we demonstrate via simulation a 63% savings in power usage in a typically provisioned datacenter where all machines are left on and awake at all times. Our results show that we are able to achieve close to 90% of the savings a theoretically optimal provisioning scheme would achieve. We have also built a prototype cluster which runs Wikipedia to demonstrate the use of our design in a real environment.",

    "abstract": "Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) uses auction-based spot pricing to sell spare capacity, allowing users to bid for cloud resources at a highly reduced rate. Amazon sets the spot price dynamically and accepts user bids above this price. Jobs with lower bids (including those already running) are interrupted and must wait for a lower spot price before resuming. Spot pricing thus raises two basic questions: how might the provider set the price, and what prices should users bid? Computing users' bidding strategies is particularly challenging: higher bid prices reduce the probability of, and thus extra time to recover from, interruptions, but may increase users' cost. We address these questions in three steps: (1) modeling the cloud provider's setting of the spot price and matching the model to historically offered prices, (2) deriving optimal bidding strategies for different job requirements and interruption overheads, and (3) adapting these strategies to MapReduce jobs with master and slave nodes having different interruption overheads. We run our strategies on EC2 for a variety of job sizes and instance types, showing that spot pricing reduces user cost by 90% with a modest increase in completion time compared to on-demand pricing.",

    "abstract": "To minimize user-perceived latencies, webservices are often deployed across multiple geographically distributed data centers. The premise of our work is that webservices deployed across multiple cloud infrastructure services can serve users from more data centers than that possible when using a single cloud service, and hence, offer lower latencies to users. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive measurement study to understand the potential latency benefits of deploying webservices across three popular cloud infrastructure services - Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine (GCE), and Microsoft Azure. We estimate that, as compared to deployments on one of these cloud services, users in up to half the IP address prefixes can have their RTTs reduced by over 20% when a webservice is deployed across the three cloud services. When we dig deeper to understand these latency benefits, we make three significant observations. First, when webservices shift from single-cloud to multi-cloud deployments, a significant fraction of prefixes will see latency benefits simply by being served from a different data center in the same location. This is because routing inefficiencies that exist between a prefix and a nearby data center in one cloud service are absent on the path from the prefix to a nearby data center in a different cloud service. Second, despite the latency improvements that a large fraction of prefixes will perceive, users in several locations (e.g., Argentina and Israel) will continue to incur RTTs greater than 100ms even when webservices span three large-scale cloud services (EC2, GCE, and Azure). Finally, we see that harnessing the latency benefits offered by multi-cloud deployments is likely to be challenging in practice; our measurements show that the data center which offers the lowest latency to a prefix often fluctuates between different cloud services, thus necessitating replication of data.",

    "abstract": "Can a software routing implementation compete in a field generally reserved for specialized lookup hardware? This paper presents DXR, an IPv4 lookup scheme based on transforming large routing tables into compact lookup structures which easily fit into cache hierarchies of modern CPUs. DXR supports various memory/speed tradeoffs and scales almost linearly with the number of CPU cores. The smallest configuration, D16R, distills a real-world BGP snapshot with 417,000 IPv4 prefixes and 213 distinct next hops into a structure consuming only 782 Kbytes, less than 2 bytes per prefix, and achieves 490 million lookups per second (MLps) in synthetic tests using uniformly random IPv4 keys on a commodity 8-core CPU. Some other DXR configurations exceed 700~MLps at the cost of increased memory footprint. DXR significantly outperforms a software implementation of DIR-24-8-BASIC, has better scalability, and requires less DRAM bandwidth. Our prototype works inside the FreeBSD kernel, which permits DXR to be used with standard APIs and routing daemons such as Quagga and XORP, and to be validated by comparing lookup results against the BSD radix tree.",

Using a large-scale dataset we collected, we show that paths frequently cross MPLS tunnels in today's Internet: in our data, at least 30% of the paths we tested traverse an MPLS tunnel. We also propose and evaluate several methods to reveal MPLS tunnels that are not explicitly flagged as such: we discover that their fraction is significant (up to half the explicit tunnel quantity) but most of them do not obscure IP-level topology discovery.",

We tackle the open problem of automatic, correct and fast composition of multiple independently specified network policies. We first develop a high-level Policy Graph Abstraction (PGA) that allows network policies to be expressed simply and independently, and leverage the graph structure to detect and resolve policy conflicts efficiently. Besides supporting ACL policies, PGA also models and composes service chaining policies, i.e., the sequence of middleboxes to be traversed, by merging multiple service chain requirements into conflict-free composed chains. Our system validation using a large enterprise network policy dataset demonstrates practical composition times even for very large inputs, with only sub-millisecond runtime latencies.",

In this work, we present the results of a survey we conducted among 75 network operators to study: (a) the operators' awareness of BGP prefix hijacking attacks, (b) presently used defenses (if any) against BGP prefix hijacking, (c) the willingness to adopt new defense mechanisms, and (d) reasons that may hinder the deployment of BGP prefix hijacking defenses. We expect the findings of this survey to increase the understanding of existing BGP hijacking defenses and the needs of network operators, as well as contribute towards designing new defense mechanisms that satisfy the requirements of the operators.",

Passive traffic measurements introduce no network traffic overhead, do not rely on unfiltered responses to probing, and could potentially apply to IPv6 as well. We investigate two challenges in using passive traffic for address utilization inference: the limited visibility of a single observation point; and the presence of spoofed IP addresses in packets that can distort results by implying faked addresses are active. We propose a methodology for removing such spoofed traffic on both darknets and live networks, which yields results comparable to inferences made from active probing. Our preliminary analysis reveals a number of promising findings, including novel insight into the usage of the IPv4 address space that would expand with additional vantage points.",

In this paper, we propose ElasticSwitch, an efficient and practical approach for providing bandwidth guarantees. ElasticSwitch is efficient because it utilizes the spare bandwidth from unreserved capacity or underutilized reservations. ElasticSwitch is practical because it can be fully implemented in hypervisors, without requiring a specific topology or any support from switches. Because hypervisors operate mostly independently, there is no need for complex coordination between them or with a central controller. Our experiments, with a prototype implementation on a 100-server testbed, demonstrate that ElasticSwitch provides bandwidth guarantees and is work-conserving, even in challenging situations.",

While first empirical results indicate that these flexibilities can be exploited to reconfigure and optimize the network toward the workload it serves and, e.g., providing the same bandwidth at lower infrastructure cost, only little is known today about the fundamental algorithmic problems underlying the design of reconfigurable networks. This paper initiates the study of the theory of demand-aware, self-adjusting networks. Our main position is that self-adjusting networks should be seen through the lense of self-adjusting datastructures. Accordingly, we present a taxonomy classifying the different algorithmic models of demand-oblivious, fixed demand-aware, and reconfigurable demand-aware networks, introduce a formal model, and identify objectives and evaluation metrics. We also demonstrate, by examples, the inherent advantage of demand-aware networks over state-of-the-art demand-oblivious, fixed networks (such as expanders). We conclude by observing that the usefulness of self-adjusting networks depends on the spatial and temporal locality of the demand; as relevant data is scarce, we call for community action.",

It serves as the basis for making a variety of management decisions for improving the performance, availability, security, and efficiency of networks. However, it is challenging to build real-time and fine-grained network telemetry systems because of the need to support a variety of measurement queries, handle a large amount of traffic for large networks, while staying within the resource constraints at hosts and switches. Today, most operators take a bottom-up approach by passively collecting data from individual devices and infer the network-wide information they need. They are often limited by the monitoring tools device vendors provide and find it hard to extract useful information. In this paper, we argue for a top-down approach: We should provide a high-level declarative abstraction for operators to specify measurement queries, programmable measurement primitives at switches and hosts, and a runtime that translates the high-level queries into low-level API calls. We discuss a few recent works taking this top-down approach and call for more research in this direction.",

We compare our implementation against the current version of iptables and other Linux firewalls, showing how it achieves a notable boost in terms of performance particularly when a high number of rules is involved. This result is achieved without requiring custom kernels or additional software frameworks (e.g., DPDK) that could not be allowed in some scenarios such as public data-centers.",

    "abstract": "Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 is a redesign of the Web's most important security protocol. It was standardized in August 2018 after a four year-long, unprecedented design process involving many cryptographers and industry stakeholders. We use the rare opportunity to track deployment, uptake, and use of a new mission-critical security protocol from the early design phase until well over a year after standardization. For a profound view, we combine and analyze data from active domain scans, passive monitoring of large networks, and a crowd-sourcing effort on Android devices. In contrast to TLS 1.2, where adoption took more than five years and was prompted by severe attacks on previous versions, TLS 1.3 is deployed surprisingly speedily and without security concerns calling for it. Just 15 months after standardization, it is used in about 20% of connections we observe. Deployment on popular domains is at 30% and at about 10% across the com/net/org top-level domains (TLDs). We show that the development and fast deployment of TLS 1.3 is best understood as a story of experimentation and centralization. Very few giant, global actors drive the development. We show that Cloudflare alone brings deployment to sizable numbers and describe how actors like Facebook and Google use their control over both client and server endpoints to experiment with the protocol and ultimately deploy it at scale. This story cannot be captured by a single dataset alone, highlighting the need for multi-perspective studies on Internet evolution.",

    "abstract": "Controlling an opaque system by reading some \"dials\" and setting some \"knobs,\" without really knowing what they do, is a hazardous and fruitless endeavor, particularly at scale. What we need are transparent networks, that start at the top with a high-level intent and map all the way down, through the control plane to the data plane. If we can specify the behavior we want in software, then we can check that the system behaves as we expect. This is impossible if the implementation is opaque. We therefore need to use open-source software or write it ourselves (or both), and have mechanisms for checking actual behavior against the specified intent. With fine-grain checking (e.g., every packet, every state variable), we can build networks that are more reliable, secure, and performant. In the limit, we can build networks that run autonomously under verifiable, closed-loop control. We believe this vision, while ambitious, is finally within our reach, due to deep programmability across the stack, both vertically (control and data plane) and horizontally (end to end). It will emerge naturally in some networks, as network owners take control of their software and engage in open-source efforts; whereas in enterprise networks it may take longer. In 5G access networks, there is a pressing need for our community to engage, so these networks, too, can operate autonomously under verifiable, closed-loop control.",

Existing solutions are mostly one-time efforts, hard to reproduce, change, or port across platforms. In this paper, we present Planter: a modular and efficient open-source framework for rapid prototyping of in-network machine learning models across a range of platforms and pipeline architectures. By identifying general mapping methodologies for machine learning algorithms, Planter introduces new machine learning mappings and improves existing ones. It provides users with several example use cases and supports different datasets, and was already extended by users to new fields and applications. Our evaluation shows that Planter improves machine learning performance compared with previous model-tailored works, while significantly reducing resource consumption and co-existing with network functionality.

We study the effects of traffic overload on routing protocols by quantifying the stability and robustness properties of two common Internet routing protocols, OSPF and BGP, when the routing control traffic is not isolated from data traffic. We develop analytical models to quantify the effect of congestion on the robustness of OSPF and BGP as a function of the traffic overload factor, queueing delays, and packet sizes. We perform extensive measurements in an experimental network of routers to validate the analytical results. Subsequently we use the analytical framework to investigate the effect of factors that are difficult to incorporate into an experimental setup, such as a wide range of link propagation delays and packet dropping policies. Our results show that increased queueing and propagation delays adversely affect BGP's resilience to congestion, in spite of its use of a reliable transport protocol. Our findings demonstrate the importance of selective treatment of routing protocol messages from other traffic, by using scheduling and utilizing buffer management policies in the routers, to achieve stable and robust network operation.",

Our work is motivated by trends in traffic patterns that threaten the long-term stability of the Internet. These trends include the use of multiple independent concurrent flows by Web applications and the increasing use of transport protocols and applications that do not adapt to congestion. We present an end-system architecture centered around a Congestion Manager (CM) that ensures proper congestion behavior and allows applications to easily adapt to network congestion. Our framework integrates congestion management across all applications and transport protocols. The CM maintains congestion parameters and exposes an API to enable applications to learn about network characteristics, pass information to the CM, and schedule data transmissions. Internally, it uses a window-based control algorithm, a scheduler to regulate transmissions, and a lightweight protocol to elicit feedback from receivers.We describe how TCP and an adaptive real-time streaming audio application can be implemented using the CM. Our simulation results show that an ensemble of concurrent TCP connections can effectively share bandwidth and obtain consistent performance, without adversely affecting other network flows. Our results also show that the CM enables audio applications to adapt to congestion conditions without having to perform congestion control or bandwidth probing on their own. We conclude that the CM provides a useful and pragmatic framework for building adaptive Internet applications.",

Based on trends such as increased link rates and improved CMOS technologies, we derive new design factors for such switch fabrics. For instance, we argue that the packet round-trip transmission time within the fabric has become a major design parameter. Furthermore, we observe that high-speed fabrics have become extremely dependent on serial I/O technology that is both high speed and high density. Finally, we conclude that in developing the architecture, packaging constraints must be put first and not as an afterthought, which also applies to solving the tremendous power consumption challenges.",

Because of the complexity of certain protocol formats, and because of the low-level of programming involved, writing such code is usually a cumbersome and error-prone process.

TCP control block sharing is a technique for reusing information among connections in series and aggregating it among connections in parallel. This paper explores the design space of a modified TCP stack that utilizes these two ideas, and one possible design (E-TCP) is presented in detail. E-TCP has been designed so that the network transmission behavior of group of parallel E-TCP connections closely resembles that of a single TCP/Reno connection. Simulated web accesses using HTTP/1.0 over E-TCP show a significant performance improvement compared to TCP/Reno connection bundles. This paper is first to evaluate performance using four different intra-ensemble schedulers for different workloads. In one scenario simulating a common case, E-TCP is 4-75% faster than Reno for transmitting the HTML parts of various pages, and 17-61% faster transmitting the whole pages. In the same scenario, reusing cached state speeds up repeated E-TCP page accesses by 17-53% for the HTML parts and 10-28% for the whole pages, compared to the initial access. E-TCP can also be integrated with other proposed TCP extensions (such as TCP/Vegas or TCP/SACK), to further improve performance.",

Our paper seeks to exploit this observation to produce a scalable packet classification scheme called Aggregated Bit Vector (ABV). Our paper takes the bit vector search algorithm (BV) described in [11] (which takes linear time) and adds two new ideas, recursive aggregation of bit maps and filter rearrangement, to create ABV (which can take logarithmic time for many databases). We show that ABV outperforms BV by an order of magnitude using simulations on both industrial firewall databases and synthetically generated databases.",

    "abstract": "Following the long-held belief that the Internet is hierarchical, the network topology generators most widely used by the Internet research community, Transit-Stub and Tiers, create networks with a deliberately hierarchical structure. However, in 1999 a seminal paper by Faloutsos et al. revealed that the Internet's degree distribution is a power-law. Because the degree distributions produced by the Transit-Stub and Tiers generators are not power-laws, the research community has largely dismissed them as inadequate and proposed new network generators that attempt to generate graphs with power-law degree distributions.Contrary to much of the current literature on network topology generators, this paper starts with the assumption that it is more important for network generators to accurately model the large-scale structure of the Internet (such as its hierarchical structure) than to faithfully imitate its local properties (such as the degree distribution). The purpose of this paper is to determine, using various topology metrics, which network generators better represent this large-scale structure. We find, much to our surprise, that network generators based on the degree distribution more accurately capture the large-scale structure of measured topologies. We then seek an explanation for this result by examining the nature of hierarchy in the Internet more closely; we find that degree-based generators produce a form of hierarchy that closely resembles the loosely hierarchical nature of the Internet.",

    "abstract": "There has been a growing concern about the potential impact of long-term correlations (second-order statistic) in variable-bit-rate (VBR) video traffic on ATM buffer dimensioning. Previous studies have shown that video traffic exhibits long-range dependence (LRD) (Hurst parameter large than 0.5). We investigate the practical implications of LRD in the context of realistic ATM traffic engineering by studying ATM multiplexers of VBR video sources over a range of desirable cell loss rates and buffer sizes (maximum delays). Using results based on large deviations theory, we introduce the notion of Critical Time Scale (CTS). For a given buffer size, link capacity, and the marginal distribution of frame size, the CTS of a VBR video source is defined as the number of frame correlations that contribute to the cell loss rate. In other words, second-order behavior at the time scale beyond the CTS does not significantly affect the network performance. We show that whether the video source model is Markov or has LRD, its CTS is finite, attains a small value for small buffer, and is a non-decreasing function of buffer size. Numerical results show that (i) even in the presence of LRD , long-term correlations do not have significant impact on the cell loss rate; and (ii) short-term correlations have dominant effect on cell loss rate, and therefore, well-designed Markov traffic models are effective for predicting Quality of Service (QOS) of LRD VBR video traffic. Therefore, we conclude that it is unnecessary to capture the long-term correlations of a real-time VBR video source under realistic ATM buffer dimensioning scenarios as far as the cell loss rates and maximum buffer delays are concerned.",

These models, which we will refer to collectively as the &lt;i&gt;B-A model&lt;/i&gt;, describe the detailed dynamics of the network growth process, modeling the way in which connections are made between ASs. There are two simple connectivity rules that define the evolution of AS connectivity over time: &lt;i&gt;incremental growth&lt;/i&gt; where a new AS connects to existing ASs, and &lt;i&gt;preferential connectivity&lt;/i&gt; where the likelihood of connecting to an AS is proportional to the vertex outdegree of the target AS. These simple rules, which are similar to the classical \"rich get richer\" model originally proposed by Simon [12], lead to power-law degree distributions. While the B-A model provably yields power-law vertex degree distributions, recent empirical evidence indicates that the model may not be consistent with the dynamics underlying the evolution of the actual AS topology. First, there is strong evidence [3, 4] that the degree distribution of the actual AS topology does not conform to a strict power law. However, the distribution is certainly &lt;i&gt;heavy-tailed&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;highly-variable&lt;/i&gt; in the sense that the observed vertex degrees typically range over three or four orders of magnitude; in some cases, the &lt;i&gt;tail&lt;/i&gt; of the degree distribution may fit a power law. These observations were gleaned from more complete pictures of AS - level connectivity (obtained by augmenting BGP route tables with peering relationships from other sources) than those used by earlier work [2, 6, 9]. Second, the B-A model's AS connectivity evolution rules can be shown to be inconsistent with empirical AS growth measurements [16]. As such, while the B-A model appears to produce topologies whose degree distribution characteristics exhibit power-law behavior, it cannot be a valid &lt;i&gt;explanation&lt;/i&gt; for the connectivity evolution in the AS topology. Clearly, some of these empirical observations don't corroborate the claim that the B-A model explains the phenomenon of highly variable vertex degrees in the Internet's AS topology [2]. However, the B-A model was originally proposed as a simple illustration of how some elementary mechanisms or rules can give rise to power law vertex degree distributions. As such, it is likely that the B-A model can be modified to accommodate these more recent findings [1], but we will neither discuss here such modifications nor comment on their possibility for success. Instead, we merely note that any such resulting model would seek, as does the original B-A model, to explain the highly variable degree distribution of the AS topology through the detailed dynamics of how connections between ASs are established. The purpose of this note is to raise the question --- motivated by the B-A approach---of whether the underlying cause of the high variability phenomenon of the vertex degree distribution lies in the detailed dynamics of network growth, or if there are alternative explanations. To that end, we briefly outline an alternative explanation for the AS topology degree distribution. We do not claim to have proven that this explanation holds; our purpose here is merely to expand the dialog to a larger class of explanations for the variability of the AS topology degree distribution.",

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes how TCP congestion control can propagate self-similarity between distant areas of the Internet. This property of TCP is due to its congestion control algorithm, which adapts to self-similar fluctuations on several timescales. The mechanisms and limitations of this propagation are investigated, and it is demonstrated that if a TCP connection shares a bottleneck link with a self-similar background traffic flow, it propagates the correlation structure of the background traffic flow above a characteristic timescale. The cut-off timescale depends on the end-to-end path properties, e.g., round-trip time and average window size. It is also demonstrated that even short TCP connections can propagate long-range correlations effectively. Our analysis reveals that if congestion periods in a connection's hops are long-range dependent, then the end-user perceived end-to-end traffic is also long-range dependent and it is characterized by the largest Hurst exponent. Furthermore, it is shown that self-similarity of one TCP stream can be passed on to other TCP streams that it is multiplexed with. These mechanisms complement the widespread scaling phenomena reported in a number of recent papers. Our arguments are supported with a combination of analytic techniques, simulations and statistical analyses of real Internet traffic measurements.",

    "abstract": "Human error in configuring routers undermines attempts to provide reliable, predictable end-to-end performance on IP networks. Manual configuration, while expensive and error-prone, is the dominant mode of operation, especially for large enterprise networks. These networks often lack the basic building blocks---an accurate equipment inventory, a debugged initial configuration, and a specification of local configuration policies---to support the holy grail of automation. We argue the migrating an existing network to automated configuration is a rich and challenging research problem rooted in data analysis and in the modeling of network protocols and operational practices. We propose a novel, bottom-up approach that proceeds in three phases: (i)analysis of configuration data to summarize the existing network state and uncover configuration problems; (ii) data mining to identify the network's local configuration policies and violations of these policies; and ultimately (iii)boot-strapping of a database to drive future configuration changes. The first stage reduces the number of errors, the second normalizes the local policies, and the third prevents new errors and reduces the manpower needed to configure the network. We describe the architecture of our EDGE tool for steps (i) and (ii), and present some examples from our experiences applying the tool to several large enterprise networks.",

The sending rate of a TCP source is determined by its window size, the round trip time and the rate of acknowledgments. TCP rate control affects these aspects by modifying the ack number and receiver window fields in acknowledgments and by modulating the acknowledgment rate. From a performance viewpoint a key benefit of TCP rate control is to avoid adverse performance effects due to packet losses such as reduced goodput and unfairness or large spread in per-user goodputs. Further, TCP rate control positively affects performance even if the bottleneck is non-local and the end-host TCP implementations are non-conforming. These aspects are demonstrated through a comparative study of TCP rate control, RED and TCP-ECN. The TCP rate control approach has been implemented and patented by Packeteer Inc.",

Our secure multicast protocol is designed to achieve the following goals. (1) It can run in any open network environment. It does not rely on any security mechanism on intermediate network switches or routers. (2) It can be built on top of any existing multicast architecture. (3) Our key distribution protocol is both secure and robust in the presence of long delay or membership message. (4) It can support dynamic group membership, e.g., JOIN/LEAVE/EXPEL operations, in a network bandwidth efficient manner. (5) It can provide copyright protection for the information provider. (6) It can help to identify insiders in the multicast session who are leaking information to the outside world. We have implemented a prototype system which validates our secure multicast protocol and evaluated it against various performance matrices.

    "abstract": "There is mounting experimental evidence that network traffic processes exhibit ubiquitous properties of self-similarity and long range dependence (LRD), i.e. of correlations over a wide range of time scales. However, there is still considerable debate about how to model such processes and about their impact on network and application performance. In this paper, we argue that much recent modeling work has failed to consider the impact of two important parameters, namely the finite range of time scales of interest in performance evaluation and prediction problems, and the first-order statistics such as the marginal distribution of the process.We introduce and evaluate a model in which these parameters can be easily controlled. Specifically, our model is a modulated fluid traffic model in which the correlation function of the fluid rate is asymptotically second-order self-similar with given Hurst parameter, then drops to zero at a cutoff time lag. We develop a very efficient numerical procedure to evaluate the performance of the single server queue fed with the above fluid input process. We use this procedure to examine the fluid loss rate for a wide range of marginal distributions, Hurst parameters, cutoff lags, and buffer sizes.Our main results are as follows. First, we find that the amount of correlation that needs to be taken into account for performance evaluation depends not only on the correlation structure of the source traffic, but also on time scales specific to the system under study. For example, the time scale associated to a queueing system is a function of the maximum buffer size. Thus for finite buffer queues, we find that the impact on loss of the correlation in the arrival process becomes nil beyond a time scale we refer to as the correlation horizon. Second, we find that loss depends in a crucial way on the marginal distribution of the fluid rate process. Third, our results suggest that reducing loss by buffering is hard. We advocate the use of source traffic control and statistical multiplexing instead.",

We show that delta encoding can provide remarkable improvements in response size and response delay for an important subset of HTTP content types. We also show the added benefit of data compression, and that the combination of delta encoding and data compression yields the best results.We propose specific extensions to the HTTP protocol for delta encoding and data compression.

Using several metrics which indicate the similarity between two distributions, we then compare the sampled traces to the parent population.

These traffic groups are carefully selected to be summable, and not to count the same traffic multiple times.Our results show that (1) the aggregated residential broad-band customer traffic in our data exceeds 100Gbps on average. Our data is considered to cover 41% of the total customer traffic in Japan, thus we can estimate that the total residential broadband traffic in Japan is currently about 250Gbps in total. (2) About 70% of the residential broadband traffic is constant all the time. The rest of the traffic has a daily fluctuation pattern with the peak in the evening hours. The behavior of residential broadband traffic deviates considerably from academic or office traffic. (3) The total traffic volume of the residential users is much higher than that of office users, so backbone traffic is dominated by the behavior of the residential user traffic. (4) The traffic volume exchanged through domestic private peering is comparable with the volume exchanged through the major IXes. (5) Within external traffic of ISPs, international traffic is about 23% for inbound and about 17% for outbound.

A Kalman state estimator is derived from discrete-time state space analysis, but there are difficulties in using the estimator in practice. These difficulties are overcome by a novel estimation scheme based on fuzzy logic.

    "abstract": "Internetworks can be built from many different kinds of networks, with varying limits on maximum packet size. Throughput is usually maximized when the largest possible packet is sent; unfortunately, some routes can carry only very small packets. The IP protocol allows a gateway to fragment a packet if it is too large to be transmitted. Fragmentation is at best a necessary evil; it can lead to poor performance or complete communication failure. There are a variety of ways to reduce the likelihood of fragmentation; some can be incorporated into existing IP implementations without changes in protocol specifications. Others require new protocols, or modifications to existing protocols.",

We'll see that different results apply to different parts of the network, and depend on several assumptions. For example, we believe that buffers can be safely reduced by an order of magnitude in the routers in service provider backbone networks; but it would be premature to reduce them in routers closer to the edge.",

We show analytically that the framework is scalable with logarithmic convergence when Internet latencies are modeled as a growth-constrained metric, a low-dimensional Euclidean metric, or a metric of low doubling dimension. Large scale simulations, based on latency measurements from 6.25 million node-pairs as well as an implementation deployed on PlanetLab show that the framework is accurate and effective.",

This paper presents the design and implementation of distributed rate limiters, which work together to enforce a global rate limit across traffic aggregates at multiple sites, enabling the coordinated policing of a cloud-based service's network traffic. Our abstraction not only enforces a global limit, but also ensures that congestion-responsive transport-layer flows behave as if they traversed a single, shared limiter. We present two designs - one general purpose, and one optimized for TCP - that allow service operators to explicitly trade off between communication costs and system accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. Both designs are capable of rate limiting thousands of flows with negligible overhead (less than 3% in the tested configuration). We demonstrate that our TCP-centric design is scalable to hundreds of nodes while robust to both loss and communication delay, making it practical for deployment in nationwide service providers.",

In this framework, loss-free and bounded-delay transmission is provided to the class of traffic with stringent delay and loss requirements, e.g., real-time traffic, while the bursty traffic without such requirements is treated on a different basis to achieve high transmission efficiency. Loss-free and bounded-delay transmission is accomplished by means of an admission policy which ensures smoothness of the traffic at the network edge, and the stop-and-go queueing which maintains the traffic smoothness throughout the network. Both the admission policy and the stop-and-go queueing are based on a time framing concept, addressed in a previous paper. This concept is further developed here to incorporate several frame sizes into the strategy, thereby providing the necessary flexibility in accommodating throughput and end-to-end delay requirements of different connections on an as-needed basis.",

We present a protocol that maintains the shortest-path routes in a dynamic topology, that is, in an environment where links and nodes can fail and recover at arbitrary times. The novelty of this protocol is that it avoids the bouncing effect and the looping problem that occur in the previous approaches of the distributed implementation of Bellman-Ford algorithm. The bouncing effect refers to the very long duration for convergence when failures happen or weights increase, and the nonterminating exchanges of messages, or counting-to-infinity behavior, in disconnected components of the network resulting from failures. The looping problems cause data packets to circulate and, thus, waste bandwidth. These undesirable effects are avoided without any increase in the overall message complexity of previous approaches required in the connected part of the network. The time complexity is better than the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm encountering failures. The key idea in the implementation is to maintain only loop-free paths, and search for the shortest path only from this set.",

A unique feature of our approach is that it enables an accurate prediction of the resulting throughput of individual flows. At its heart lies a simple yet model of the network that captures interference, traffic, and MAC-induced dependencies. Unless properly accounted for, these dependencies lead to unpredictable behaviors. For instance, we show that even a simple network of two links with one flow is vulnerable to severe performance degradation. We design algorithms that build on this model to optimize the network for fairness and throughput. Given traffic demands as input, these algorithms compute rates at which individual flows must send to meet the objective. Evaluation using a multi-hop wireless testbed as well as simulations show that our approach is very effective. When optimizing for fairness, our methods result in close to perfect fairness. When optimizing for throughput, they lead to 100-200% improvement for UDP traffic and 10-50% for TCP traffic.",

We have implemented the system and conducted an Internet evaluation on Planet-Lab using real traces from previous operational deployments of an overlay broadcasting system.

    "abstract": "Internet fault diagnosis is extremely important for end users, overlay network service providers (like Akamai [1]) and even Internet service providers (ISPs). However, because link-level properties cannot be uniquely determined from end-to-end measurements, the accuracy of existing statistical diagnosis approaches is subject to uncertainty from statistical assumptions about the network. In this paper, we propose a novel Least-biased End-to-end Network Diagnosis (in short, LEND) system for inferring link-level properties like loss rate. We define a minimal identifiable link sequence (MILS) as a link sequence of minimal length whose properties can be uniquely identified from end-to-end measurements. We also design efficient algorithms to find all the MILSes and infer their loss rates for diagnosis. Our LEND system works for any network topology and for both directed and undirected properties, and incrementally adapts to network topology and property changes. It gives highly accurate estimates of the loss rates of MILSes, as indicated by both extensive simulations and Internet experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such diagnosis can be achieved with fine granularity and in near real-time even for reasonably large overlay networks. Finally, LEND can supplement existing statistical inference approaches and provide smooth tradeoff between diagnosis accuracy and granularity.",

Compared to estimation methods that require multiple iterations with different probing rates, PGM uses a single probing rate and it infers the available bandwidth from a direct relation between the input and output rates of measurement packet pairs. An important assumption behind the PGM model is that the measured path has a single bottleneck link that determines the available bandwidth of the end-to-end path. In this letter, we show that, even though PGM is accurate in the case of a single queue, it cannot estimate the available bandwidth of multi-hop paths, even if there is a single bottleneck in the path. Whether PGM is accurate or not depends on the routing of cross traffic relative to the measurement traffic. PGM is accurate when the cross traffic follows the same path with the measurement traffic. In the general case, however, PGM can significantly underestimate the available bandwidth of an end-to-end path.",

Using a combination of rigorous results and carefully constructed examples and counter-examples, we map out the issues involved, and argue that PASTA is of very limited use in active probing. In particular, Poisson probes are not unique in their ability to sample without bias. Furthermore, PASTA ignores the issue of estimation variance, and the central need for an inversion phase to estimate the quantity of interest ased on what is directly observable.

Building on our previous comparison of DITL 2006 and DITL 2007 DNS datasets [28], we venture to extract historical trends, comparisons with other data sources, and interpretations, including traffic growth, usage patterns, impact of anycast distribution, and persistent problems in the root nameserver system that reflect ominously on the global Internet. Most notably, the data consistently reveals an extraordinary amount of DNS pollution -- an estimated 98% of the traffic at the root servers should not be there at all. Unfortunately, there is no clear path to reducing the pollution, so root server operators, and those who finance them, must perpetually overprovision to handle this pollution. Our study presents the most complete characterization to date of traffic reaching the roots, and while the study does not adequately fulfill the \"Day in the Life of the Internet\" vision, it does succeed at unequivocally demonstrating that the infrastructure on which we are all now betting our professional, personal, and political lives deserves a closer and more scientific look.",

Examples are the passive measurement of one-way delay or the observation of the path that a packet takes through a network. Nevertheless, due to high data rates and the need for fine granular measurements, the resource consumption for passive measurements can be immense. Furthermore, the resource consumption depends on the traffic in the network, which usually is highly dynamic. Packet and flow-selection methods provide a solution to reduce and control the resource consumption for passive measurements. In order to apply such techniques to multipoint measurements the selection processes need to be synchronized. Hash-based selection is a deterministic packet selection based on a hash function computed on selected parts of the packet content. This selection decision is consistent throughout the network and enables packet tracing and the measurement of delay between network nodes. Because the selection is based on deterministic function it can introduce bias which leads to wrong estimation of traffic characteristics. In this paper we define a set of quality criteria and select methods to investigate which hash function is most suitable for hash-based packet selection. We analyze 23 non-cryptographic and 2 cryptographic hash functions. Experiments are performed with real traffic traces from different networks. Based on the results we recommend 2 fast hash functions which show low bias and sample a representative subset of the population.",

    "abstract": "We present a new routing protocol, pathlet routing, in which networks advertise fragments of paths, called pathlets, that sources concatenate into end-to-end source routes. Intuitively, the pathlet is a highly flexible building block, capturing policy constraints as well as enabling an exponentially large number of path choices. In particular, we show that pathlet routing can emulate the policies of BGP, source routing, and several recent multipath proposals. This flexibility lets us address two major challenges for Internet routing: scalability and source-controlled routing. When a router's routing policy has only \"local\" constraints, it can be represented using a small number of pathlets, leading to very small forwarding tables and many choices of routes for senders. Crucially, pathlet routing does not impose a global requirement on what style of policy is used, but rather allows multiple styles to coexist. The protocol thus supports complex routing policies while enabling and incentivizing the adoption of policies that yield small forwarding plane state and a high degree of path choice.",

    "abstract": "The difficulty of scaling Online Social Networks (OSNs) has introduced new system design challenges that has often caused costly re-architecting for services like Twitter and Facebook. The complexity of interconnection of users in social networks has introduced new scalability challenges. Conventional vertical scaling by resorting to full replication can be a costly proposition. Horizontal scaling by partitioning and distributing data among multiples servers - e.g. using DHTs - can lead to costly inter-server communication. We design, implement, and evaluate SPAR, a social partitioning and replication middle-ware that transparently leverages the social graph structure to achieve data locality while minimizing replication. SPAR guarantees that for all users in an OSN, their direct neighbor's data is co-located in the same server. The gains from this approach are multi-fold: application developers can assume local semantics, i.e., develop as they would for a single server; scalability is achieved by adding commodity servers with low memory and network I/O requirements; and redundancy is achieved at a fraction of the cost. We detail our system design and an evaluation based on datasets from Twitter, Orkut, and Facebook, with a working implementation. We show that SPAR incurs minimum overhead, and can help a well-known open-source Twitter clone reach Twitter's scale without changing a line of its application logic and achieves higher throughput than Cassandra, Facebook's DHT based key-value store database.",

These attacks usually correlate external information with anonymized data and successfully de-anonymize objects with distinctive signatures. However, analyses of these attacks still underestimate the real risk of publishing anonymized data, as the most powerful attack against anonymization is traffic injection. We demonstrate that performing live traffic injection attacks against anonymization on a backbone network is not difficult, and that potential countermeasures against these attacks, such as traffic aggregation, randomization or field generalization, are not particularly effective. We then discuss tradeoffs of the attacker and defender in the so-called injection attack space. An asymmetry in the attack space significantly increases the chance of a successful de-anonymization through lengthening the injected traffic pattern. This leads us to re-examine the role of network data anonymization. We recommend a unified approach to data sharing, which uses anonymization as a part of a technical, legal, and social approach to data protection in the research and operations communities.",

We implement our framework in Haskell and leverage the multicore facilities of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) and runtime system. Our implementation schedules event handlers, allocates memory, optimizes message parsing and serialization, and reduces system calls in order to optimize cache usage, OS processing, and runtime system overhead. Our experiments show that McNettle can serve up to 5000 switches using a single controller with 46 cores, achieving throughput of over 14 million flows per second, near-linear scaling up to 46 cores, and latency under 200 μs for light loads and 10 ms with loads consisting of up to 5000 switches.",

Most existing approaches for replica selection rely on either central coordination (which has reliability, security, and scalability limitations) or distributed heuristics (which lead to suboptimal request distributions, or even instability). In contrast, the distributed mapping nodes in DONAR run a simple, efficient algorithm to coordinate their replica-selection decisions for clients. The protocol solves an optimization problem that jointly considers both client performance and server load, allowing us to show that the distributed algorithm is stable and effective. Experiments with our DONAR prototype--providing replica selection for CoralCDN and the Measurement Lab--demonstrate that our algorithm performs well \"in the wild.\" Our prototype supports DNS- and HTTP-based redirection, IP anycast, and a secure update protocol, and can handle many customer services with diverse policy objectives.",

We first analyze this issue mathematically by formulating it as an optimization problem to obtain the optimal shaping rate. Then a practical interest shaping algorithm is proposed to achieve high link utilization without congestive data loss. We further note that flow differentiation in NDN is complicated and design our scheme independently of traffic flows. We demonstrate our hop-by-hop interest shaper in conjunction with simple Additive-Increase-Multiplicative-Decrease (AIMD) clients using the ns3-based NDN simulator (ndnSIM).

We show that search response time (SRT) varies widely over time and also exhibits counter-intuitive behavior. It is actually higher during off-peak hours, when the query load is lower, than during peak hours. To resolve this paradox and explain SRT variations in general, we develop an analysis framework that separates systemic variations due to periodic changes in service usage and anomalous variations due to unanticipated events such as failures and denial-of-service attacks. We find that systemic SRT variations are primarily caused by systemic changes in aggregate network characteristics, nature of user queries, and browser types. For instance, one reason for higher SRTs during off-peak hours is that during those hours a greater fraction of queries come from slower, mainly-residential networks. We also develop a technique that, by factoring out the impact of such variations, robustly detects and diagnoses performance anomalies in SRT. Deployment experience shows that our technique detects three times more true (operator-verified) anomalies than existing techniques.",

In this paper, we present measurement results from a unique dataset containing more than 26 billion DNS query-response pairs collected from more than 600 globally distributed recursive DNS resolvers. We use this dataset to reaffirm findings in published work and notice some significant differences that could be attributed both to the evolving nature of DNS traffic and to our differing perspective. For example, we find that although characteristics of DNS traffic vary greatly across networks, the resolvers within an organization tend to exhibit similar behavior. We further find that more than 50% of DNS queries issued to root servers do not return successful answers, and that the primary cause of lookup failures at root servers is malformed queries with invalid TLDs. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach that detects malicious domain groups using temporal correlation in DNS queries. Our approach requires no comprehensive labeled training set, which can be difficult to build in practice. Instead, it uses a known malicious domain as anchor, and identifies the set of previously unknown malicious domains that are related to the anchor domain. Experimental results illustrate the viability of this approach, i.e. , we attain a true positive rate of more than 96%, and each malicious anchor domain results in a malware domain group with more than 53 previously unknown malicious domains on average.",

The existing approach for dealing with such high-power interferers makes the 802.11 network switch to a different channel; yet the ISM band is becoming increasingly crowded with diverse technologies, and hence many 802.11 access points may not find an interference-free channel. This paper presents TIMO, a MIMO design that enables 802.11n to communicate in the presence of high-power cross-technology interference. Unlike existing MIMO designs, however, which require all concurrent transmissions to belong to the same technology, TIMO can exploit MIMO capabilities to decode in the presence of a signal from a different technology, hence enabling diverse technologies to share the same frequency band. We implement a prototype of TIMO in GNURadio-USRP2 and show that it enables 802.11n to communicate in the presence of interference from baby monitors, cordless phones, and microwave ovens, transforming scenarios with a complete loss of connectivity to operational networks.",

Results from a 10-AP software-radio testbed show a linear increase in network throughput with a median gain of 8.1 to 9.4x. Our results also demonstrate that JMB's joint multi-user beamforming can provide throughput gains with unmodified 802.11n cards.",

This question captures the essence of the problem we address here. We study the intertwined propagation of two competing \"memes\" (or viruses, rumors, products etc.) in a composite network. A key novelty is the use of a composite network, which in its simplest model is defined as a single set of nodes with two distinct types of edges interconnecting them. Each meme spreads across the composite network in accordance to an SIS-like propagation model (a flu-like infection-recovery). To study the epidemic behavior of our system, we formulate it as a non-linear dynamic system (NLDS). We develop a metric for each meme that is based on the eigenvalue of an appropriately constructed matrix and argue that this metric plays a key role in determining the \"winning\" meme. First, we prove that our metric determines the tipping point at which both memes become extinct eventually. Second, we conjecture that the meme with the strongest metric will most likely prevail over the other, and we show evidence of that via simulations in both real and synthetic composite networks. Our work is among the first to study the interplay between two competing memes in composite networks.",

We are interested in MDCs where nodes are {\\em highly collaborative}. We develop computational offloading schemes that {\\em maximize the lifetime} of the ensemble of mobile devices where we consider the network to be alive as long as no device has depleted its battery. As a secondary contribution in this work, we develop and use an experimentation platform that allows us to evaluate a range of computational models and profiles derived from a realistic testbed.

    "abstract": "ACM Sigcomm 2006 published a paper [26] which was perceived to unify the deterministic and stochastic branches of the network calculus (abbreviated throughout as DNC and SNC) [39]. Unfortunately, this seemingly fundamental unification---which has raised the hope of a straightforward transfer of all results from DNC to SNC---is invalid. To substantiate this claim, we demonstrate that for the class of stationary and ergodic processes, which is prevalent in traffic modelling, the probabilistic arrival model from [26] is quasi-deterministic, i.e., the underlying probabilities are either zero or one. Thus, the probabilistic framework from [26] is unable to account for statistical multiplexing gain, which is in fact the raison d'être of packet-switched networks. Other previous formulations of SNC can capture statistical multiplexing gain, yet require additional assumptions [12], [22] or are more involved [14], [9] [28], and do not allow for a straightforward transfer of results from DNC. So, in essence, there is no free lunch in this endeavor. Our intention in this paper is to go beyond presenting a negative result by providing a comprehensive perspective on network calculus. To that end, we attempt to illustrate the fundamental concepts and features of network calculus in a systematic way, and also to rigorously clarify some key facts as well as misconceptions. We touch in particular on the relationship between linear systems, classical queueing theory, and network calculus, and on the lingering issue of tightness of network calculus bounds. We give a rigorous result illustrating that the statistical multiplexing gain scales as Ω(√ N ), as long as some small violations of system performance constraints are tolerable. This demonstrates that the network calculus can capture actual system behavior tightly when applied carefully. Thus, we positively conclude that it still holds promise as a valuable systematic methodology for the performance analysis of computer and communication systems, though the unification of DNC and SNC remains an open, yet quite elusive task.",

    "abstract": "Datacenter WAN traffic consists of high priority transfers that have to be carried as soon as they arrive alongside large transfers with pre-assigned deadlines on their completion (ranging from minutes to hours). The ability to offer guarantees to large transfers is crucial for business needs and impacts overall cost-of-business. State-of-the-art traffic engineering solutions only consider the current time epoch and hence cannot provide pre-facto promises for long-lived transfers. We present Tempus, an online traffic engineering scheme that exploits information on transfer size and deadlines to appropriately pack long-running transfers across network paths and time, thereby leaving enough capacity slack for future high-priority requests. Tempus builds on a tailored approximate solution to a mixed packing-covering linear program, which is parallelizable and scales well in both running time and memory usage. Consequently, Tempus is able to quickly and effectively update its solution when new transfers arrive or unexpected changes happen. These updates involve only small edits to existing transfers. Therefore, as experiments on traces from a large production WAN show, Tempus can offer and keep promises to long-lived transfers well in advance of their actual deadline; the promise on minimal transfer size is comparable with an offline optimal solution and outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by 2-3X.",

    "abstract": "To reduce the impact of network congestion on big data jobs, cluster management frameworks use various heuristics to schedule compute tasks and/or network flows. Most of these schedulers consider the job input data fixed and greedily schedule the tasks and flows that are ready to run. However, a large fraction of production jobs are recurring with predictable characteristics, which allows us to plan ahead for them. Coordinating the placement of data and tasks of these jobs allows for significantly improving their network locality and freeing up bandwidth, which can be used by other jobs running on the cluster. With this intuition, we develop Corral, a scheduling framework that uses characteristics of future workloads to determine an offline schedule which (i) jointly places data and compute to achieve better data locality, and (ii) isolates jobs both spatially (by scheduling them in different parts of the cluster) and temporally, improving their performance. We implement Corral on Apache Yarn, and evaluate it on a 210 machine cluster using production workloads. Compared to Yarn's capacity scheduler, Corral reduces the makespan of these workloads up to 33% and the median completion time up to 56%, with 20-90% reduction in data transferred across racks.",

    "abstract": "Many applications do not constrain the destinations of their network transfers. New opportunities emerge when such transfers contribute a large amount of network bytes. By choosing the endpoints to avoid congested links, completion times of these transfers as well as that of others without similar flexibility can be improved. In this paper, we focus on leveraging the flexibility in replica placement during writes to cluster file systems (CFSes), which account for almost half of all cross-rack traffic in data-intensive clusters. The replicas of a CFS write can be placed in any subset of machines as long as they are in multiple fault domains and ensure a balanced use of storage throughout the cluster. We study CFS interactions with the cluster network, analyze optimizations for replica placement, and propose Sinbad -- a system that identifies imbalance and adapts replica destinations to navigate around congested links. Experiments on EC2 and trace-driven simulations show that block writes complete 1.3X (respectively, 1.58X) faster as the network becomes more balanced. As a collateral benefit, end-to-end completion times of data-intensive jobs improve as well. Sinbad does so with little impact on the long-term storage balance.",

    "abstract": "When designing a distributed network protocol, typically it is infeasible to fully define the target network where the protocol is intended to be used. It is therefore natural to ask: How faithfully do protocol designers really need to understand the networks they design for? What are the important signals that endpoints should listen to? How can researchers gain confidence that systems that work well on well-characterized test networks during development will also perform adequately on real networks that are inevitably more complex, or future networks yet to be developed? Is there a tradeoff between the performance of a protocol and the breadth of its intended operating range of networks? What is the cost of playing fairly with cross-traffic that is governed by another protocol? We examine these questions quantitatively in the context of congestion control, by using an automated protocol-design tool to approximate the best possible congestion-control scheme given imperfect prior knowledge about the network. We found only weak evidence of a tradeoff between operating range in link speeds and performance, even when the operating range was extended to cover a thousand-fold range of link speeds. We found that it may be acceptable to simplify some characteristics of the network---such as its topology---when modeling for design purposes. Some other features, such as the degree of multiplexing and the aggressiveness of contending endpoints, are important to capture in a model.",

However, challenges in managing low-level details, such as setting up and maintaining correct and efficient forwarding tables on distributed switches, often compromise this conceptual simplicity. In this pa- per, we present Maple, a system that simplifies SDN programming by (1) allowing a programmer to use a standard programming language to design an arbitrary, centralized algorithm, which we call an algorithmic policy , to decide the behaviors of an entire network, and (2) providing an abstraction that the programmer-defined, centralized policy runs, conceptually, \"afresh\" on every packet entering a network, and hence is oblivious to the challenge of translating a high-level policy into sets of rules on distributed individual switches. To implement algorithmic policies efficiently, Maple includes not only a highly-efficient multicore scheduler that can scale efficiently to controllers with 40+ cores, but more importantly a novel tracing runtime optimizer that can automatically record reusable policy decisions, offload work to switches when possible, and keep switch flow tables up-to-date by dynamically tracing the dependency of policy decisions on packet contents as well as the environment (system state). Evaluations using real HP switches show that Maple optimizer reduces HTTP connection time by a factor of 100 at high load. During simulated benchmarking, Maple scheduler, when not running the optimizer, achieves a throughput of over 20 million new flow requests per second on a single machine, with 95-percentile latency under 10 ms.",

Recently, there have been many proposals to configure TCAM counters in hardware switches to monitor traffic. However, the TCAM memory at switches is fundamentally limited and the accuracy of the measurement tasks is a function of the resources devoted to them on each switch. This paper describes an adaptive measurement framework, called DREAM, that dynamically adjusts the resources devoted to each measurement task, while ensuring a user-specified level of accuracy. Since the trade-off between resource usage and accuracy can depend upon the type of tasks, their parameters, and traffic characteristics, DREAM does not assume an a priori characterization of this trade-off, but instead dynamically searches for a resource allocation that is sufficient to achieve a desired level of accuracy. A prototype implementation and simulations with three network-wide measurement tasks (heavy hitter, hierarchical heavy hitter and change detection) and diverse traffic show that DREAM can support more concurrent tasks with higher accuracy than several other alternatives.",

Research on these principles requires agile and flexible platforms that offer a wide range of real-world experimentations over different domains to open up innovations in 5G. To this end, we present Mosaic5G, a community-led consortium for sharing platforms, providing a number of software components, namely FlexRAN, LL-MEC, JOX and Store, spanning application, management, control and user plane on top of OpenAirInterface (OAI) platform. Finally, we show several use cases of Mosaic5G corresponding to widely-mentioned 5G research directions.",

    "abstract": "Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, technology enthusiasts have pushed for digital contact tracing as a critical tool for breaking the COVID-19 transmission chains. Motivated by this push, many countries and companies have created apps that enable digital contact tracing with the goal to identify the chain of transmission from an infected individual to others and enable early quarantine. Digital contact tracing applications like AarogyaSetu in India, TraceTogether in Singapore, SwissCovid in Switzerland, and others have been downloaded hundreds of millions of times. Yet, this technology hasn't seen the impact that we envisioned at the start of the pandemic. Some countries have rolled back their apps, while others have seen low adoption [12, 17]. Therefore, it is prudent to ask what the technology landscape of contact-tracing looks like and what are the missing pieces. We attempt to undertake this task in this paper. We present a high-level review of technologies underlying digital contact tracing, a set of metrics that are important while evaluating different contact tracing technologies, and evaluate where the different technologies stand today on this set of metrics. Our hope is two fold: (a) Future designers of contact tracing applications can use this review paper to understand the technology landscape, and (b) Researchers can identify and solve the missing pieces of this puzzle, so that we are ready to face the rest of the COVID-19 pandemic and any future pandemics. A majority of this discussion is focused on the ability to identify contact between individuals. The questions of ethics, privacy, and security of such contact tracing are briefly mentioned but not discussed in detail.",

To address this increasing divergence of functionality and overcome the Internet's architectural stagnation, we argue for the creation of an Extensible Internet (EI) that supports in-network services that go beyond best-effort packet delivery. To gain experience with this approach, we hope to soon deploy both an experimental version (for researchers) and a prototype version (for early adopters) of EI.

It is shown that the key features of the protocol and of the network can be expressed via a linear dynamical system in the so called max-plus algebra. This opens new ways of both analytical evaluation and fast simulation based on products of matrices in this algebra. This also leads to closed form formulas for the throughput allowed by TCP under natural assumptions on the behavior of the routers and on the detection of losses and timeouts; these new formulas are shown to refine those obtained from earlier models which either assume that the network could be reduced to a single bottleneck router and/or approximate the packets by a fluid.",

    "abstract": "Internet service providers face a daunting challenge in provisioning network resources, due to the rapid growth of the Internet and wide fluctuations in the underlying traffic patterns. The ability of dynamic routing to circumvent congested links and improve application performance makes it a valuable traffic engineering tool. However, deployment of load-sensitive routing is hampered by the overheads imposed by link-state update propagation, path selection, and signaling. Under reasonable protocol and computational overheads, traditional approaches to load-sensitive routing of IP traffic are ineffective, and can introduce significant route flapping, since paths are selected based on out-of-date link-state information. Although stability is improved by performing load-sensitive routing at the flow level, flapping still occurs, because most IP flows have a short duration relative to the desired frequency of link-state updates. To address the efficiency and stability challenges of load-sensitive routing, we introduce a new hybrid approach that performs dynamic routing of long-lived flows, while forwarding short-lived flows on static preprovisioned paths. By relating the detection of long-lived flows to the timescale of link-state update messages in the routing protocol, route stability is considerably improved. Through simulation experiments using a one-week ISP packet trace, we show that our hybrid approach significantly outperforms traditional static and dynamic routing schemes, by reacting to fluctuations in network load without introducing route flapping.",

However, despite all the attention these concepts have received, they remain difficult to use by non-experts. This difficulty can be attributed to a relative complexity of the mathematical basis, the absence of a systematic approach to their application and the absence of publicly available software. In this paper, we introduce SELFIS, a comprehensive tool, to facilitate the evaluation of LRD by practitioners. Our goal is to create a stand-alone public tool that can become a reference point for the community. Our tool integrates most of the required functionality for an in-depth LRD analysis, including several LRD estimators. In addition, SELFIS includes a powerful approach to stress-test the existence of LRD, Using our tool, evidence are presented that the widely-used LRD estimators can provide misleading results. It is worth mentioning that 25 researchers have acquired SELFIS within a month of its release, which clearly demonstrates the need for such a tool.",

    "abstract": "Internet multimedia traffic is increasing as applications like streaming media and packet telephony grow in popularity. It is important to monitor the volume and characteristics of this traffic, particularly because its behavior in the face of network congestion differs from that of the currently dominant TCP traffic. To monitor traffic on a high-speed link for extended periods, it is not practical to blindly capture all packets that traverse the link. We present mmdump , a tool that parses messages from RTSP, H.323 and similar multimedia session control protocols to set up and tear down packet filters as needed to gather traces of multimedia sessions. Unlike tcpdump, dynamic packet filters are necessary because these protocols dynamically negotiate TCP and UDP port numbers to carry the media content. Our tool captures only packets of interest for optional storage and further analysis, thus greatly reducing resource requirements. This paper presents the design and implementation of mmdump and demonstrates its utility in monitoring live RTSP and H.323 traffic on a commercial IP network. The preliminary results obtained from these measurements are presented.",

In order to keep the hand-off dropping probability below a pre-specified target value (thus providing a probabilistic QoS guarantee), we design and evaluate predictive and adaptive schemes for the bandwidth reservation for the existing connections' handoffs and the admission control of new connections.We first develop a method to estimate user mobility based on an aggregate history of hand-offs observed in each cell. This method is then used to predict (probabilistically) mobiles' directions and hand-off times in a cell. For each cell, the bandwidth to be reserved for hand-offs is calculated by estimating the total sum of fractional bandwidths of the expected hand-offs within a mobility-estimation time window. We also develop an algorithm that controls this window for efficient use of bandwidth and effective response to (1) time-varying traffic/mobility and (2) inaccuracy of mobility estimation. Three different admission-control schemes for new connection requests using this bandwidth reservation are proposed. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes to show that they meet our design goal and outperform the static reservation scheme under various scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Internet applications and users have very diverse service expectations, making the current same-service-to-all model inadequate and limiting. In the relative differentiated services approach, the network traffic is grouped in a small number of service classes which are ordered based on their packet forwarding quality , in terms of per-hop metrics for the queueing delays and packet losses. The users and applications, in this context, can adaptively choose the class that best meets their quality and pricing constraints, based on the assurance that higher classes will be better, or at least no worse, than lower classes . In this work, we propose the proportional differentiation model as a way to refine and quantify this basic premise of relative differentiated services. The proportional differentiation model aims to provide the network operator with the ' tuning knobs ' for adjusting the quality spacing between classes, independent of the class loads ; this cannot be achieved with other relative differentiation models, such as strict prioritization or capacity differentiation. We apply the proportional model on queueing-delay differentiation only, leaving the problem of coupled delay and loss differentiation for future work. We discuss the dynamics of the proportional delay differentiation model and state the conditions under which it is feasible . Then, we identify and evaluate (using simulations) two packet schedulers that approximate the proportional differentiation model in heavy-load conditions, even in short timescales. Finally, we demonstrate that such per-hop and class-based mechanisms can provide consistent end-to-end differentiation to individual flows from different classes, independently of the network path and flow characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Several recent proposals for an \"active networks\" architecture advocate the placement of user-defined computation within the network as a key mechanism to enable a wide range of new applications and protocols, including reliable multicast transports, mechanisms to foil denial of service attacks, intra-network real-time signal transcoding, and so forth. This laudable goal, however, creates a number of very difficult research problems, and although a number of pioneering research efforts in active networks have solved some of the preliminary small-scale problems, a large number of wide open problems remain. In this paper, we propose an alternative to active networks that addresses a restricted and more tractable subset of the active-networks design space. Our approach, which we (and others) call \"active services\", advocates the placement of user-defined computation within the network as with active networks, but unlike active networks preserves all of the routing and forwarding semantics of current Internet architecture by restricting the computation environment to the application layer. Because active services do not require changes to the Internet architecture, they can be deployed incrementally in today's Internet.We believe that many of the applications and protocols targeted by the active networks initiative can be solved with active services and, toward this end, we propose herein a specific architecture for an active service and develop one such service in detail --- the Media Gateway (MeGa) service --- that exploits this architecture. In defining our active service, we encountered six key problems --- service location, service control, service management, service attachment, service composition, and the definition of the service environment --- and have crafted solutions for these problems in the context of the MeGa service. To verify our design, we implemented and fielded MeGa on the UC Berkeley campus, where it has been used regularly for several months by real users who connect via ISDN to an \"on-line classroom\". Our initial experience indicates that our active services prototype provides a very flexible and programmable platform for intra-network computation that strikes a good balance between the flexibility of the active networks architecture and the practical constraints of incremental deployment in the current Internet.",

    "abstract": "Link striping algorithms are often used to overcome transmission bottlenecks in computer networks. Traditional striping algorithms suffer from two major disadvantages. They provide inadequate load sharing in the presence of variable length packets, and may result in non- FIFO delivery of data. We describe a new family of link striping algorithms that solves both problems. Our scheme applies to any layer that can provide multiple FIFO channels.We deal with variable sized packets by showing how fair queuing algorithms can be transformed into load sharing algorithms. Our transformation results in practical load sharing protocols, and shows a theoretical connection between two seemingly different problems. The same transformation can be applied to obtain load sharing protocols for links with different capacities. We deal with the FIFO requirement for two separate cases. If a sequence number can be added to each packet, we show how to speed up packet processing by letting the receiver simulate the sender algorithm. If no header can be added, we show how to provide quasi- FIFO delivery. Quasi- FIFO is FIFO except during occasional periods of loss of synchronization. We argue that quasi- FIFO is adequate for most applications. We also describe a simple technique for speedy restoration of synchronization in the event of loss.We develop an architectural framework for transparently embedding our protocol at the network level by striping IP packets across multiple physical interfaces. The resulting strIPe protocol has been implemented within the NetBSD kernel. Our measurements and simulations show that the protocol offers scalable throughput even when striping is done over dissimilar links, and that the protocol synchronizes quickly after packet loss. Measurements show performance improvements over conventional round robin striping schemes and striping schemes that do not resequence packets.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of large-scale, wide-area networking testbeds, researchers can deploy long-running services that interact with other resources on the Web. While such interaction can easily attract clients and traffic, our experience suggests that projects accepting outside input and interacting with outside resources must carefully consider the avenues for abuse of such services. The CoDeeN Content Distribution Network, deployed on PlanetLab, uses a network of caching Web proxy servers to intelligently distribute and cache requests from a potentially large client population. Due to CoDeeN's non-commerical nature, content is not pushed/advertised by content providers, but instead is pulled by clients who have configured their browsers to use CoDeeN.In effect, CoDeeN is one of the largest \"open\" proxy networks in the world, and therefore draws unwanted attention from malicious users. This paper discusses our experiences with undersirable traffic on CoDeeN, the mechanisms we developed to curtail it, and the future directions for such work. We believe that this work provides a safe alternative to open proxies and will encourage others to deploy similar systems. Some of the security mechanisms we are developing are suitable for ISPs to deploy on their own networks to detect misbehaving customers before problems arise. Finally, other research projects that allow \"open\" access to Web resources may face similar situations, and may be able to adopt similar mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Improving the performance of data transfers in the Internet (such as Web transfers) requires a detailed understanding of when and how delays are introduced. Unfortunately, the complexity of data transfers like those using HTTP is great enough that identifying the precise causes of delays is difficult. In this paper we describe a method for pinpointing where delays are introduced into applications like HTTP by using critical path analysis. By constructing and profiling the critical path, it is possible to determine what fraction of total transfer latency is due to packet propagation, network variation ( e.g., queuing at routers or route fluctuation), packet losses, and delays at the server and at the client. We have implemented our technique in a tool called tcpeval that automates critical path analysis for Web transactions. We show that our analysis method is robust enough to analyze traces taken for two different TCP implementations (Linux and FreeBSD). To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we present the results of critical path analysis for a set of Web transactions taken over 14 days under a variety of server and network conditions. The results show that critical path analysis can shed considerable light on the causes of delays in Web transfers, and can expose subtleties in the behavior of the entire end-to-end system.",

    "abstract": "Two important questions in high-speed networking are firstly, how to provide Gbit/s networking at low cost and secondly, how to provide a flexible low-level network interface so that applications can control their data from the instant it arrives. We describe some work that addresses both of these questions. The Jetstream Gbit/s LAN is an experimental, low-cost network interface that provides the services required by delay-sensitive traffic as well as meeting the performance needs of current applications. Jetstream is a combination of traditional shared-medium LAN technology and more recent ATM cell- and switch-based technology. Jetstream frames contain a channel identifier so that the network driver can immediately associate an incoming frame with its application. We have developed such a driver that enables applications to control how their data should be managed without the need to first move the data into the application's address space. Consequently, applications can elect to read just a part of a frame and then instruct the driver to move the remainder directly to its destination. Individual channels can elect to receive frames that have failed their CRC, while applications can specify frame-drop policies on a per-channel basis. Measured results show that both kernel- and user-space protocols can achieve very good throughput: applications using both TCP and our own reliable byte-stream protocol have demonstrated throughputs in excess of 200 Mbit/s. The benefits of running protocols in user-space are well known- the drawback has often been a severe penalty in the performance achieved. In this paper we show that it is possible to have the best of both worlds.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the throughput of large TCP transfers is important for a broad class of applications. This paper focuses on the design, empirical evaluation, and analysis of TCP throughput predictors. We first classify TCP throughput prediction techniques into two categories: Formula-Based (FB) and History-Based (HB). Within each class, we develop representative prediction algorithms, which we then evaluate empirically over the RON testbed. FB prediction relies on mathematical models that express the TCP throughput as a function of the characteristics of the underlying network path. It does not rely on previous TCP transfers in the given path, and it can be performed with non-intrusive network measurements. We show, however, that the FB method is accurate only if the TCP transfer is window-limited to the point that it does not saturate the underlying path, and explain the main causes of the prediction errors. HB techniques predict the throughput of TCP flows from a time series of previous TCP throughput measurements on the same path, when such a history is available. We show that even simple HB predictors, such as Moving Average and Holt-Winters, using a history of few and sporadic samples, can be quite accurate. On the negative side, HB predictors are highly path-dependent. We explain the cause of such path dependencies based on two key factors: the load on the path and the degree of statistical multiplexing.",

    "abstract": "We focus in this paper on Internet flows, consider their contributions to the overall traffic per time unit or bin, and perform a multi-scale and multi-protocol analysis to explore the persistency properties of those flows that contribute the most (also known as \"heavy hitters\" or \"elephants\"). Knowing the persistency features (or a lack thereof) of the heavy hitters and understanding their underlying causes is crucial when developing traffic engineering tools that focus primarily on optimizing system performance for elephant flows.The main difficulty when studying the persistency properties of flows is that the available measurements are either too fine-grained to perform large-scale studies (i.e., packet-level traces) or too coarse-grained to extract the detailed information necessary for the purpose at hand (i.e., Netflow traces, SNMP). We deal with this problem by assuming that flows have constant throughput through their lifetime. We then check the validity of this assumption by comparing our Netflow-derived findings against those obtained from directly studying the corresponding detailed packet-level traces. By considering different time aggregations (e.g., bin sizes between 1--10 minutes) and flow abstractions (e.g., raw IP flows, pre-fix flows), varying the definition of what constitutes an \"elephant\", and slicing by different protocols and applications, we present a methodology for studying persistency aspects exhibited by Internet flows. For example, we find that raw IP flows that are elephant flows for at least once (i.e., one bin or time unit) in their lifetimes tend to show a remarkable persistence to be elephants for much of their lifetimes, but certain aggregate flows exhibit more intricate persistency properties.",

    "abstract": "With increasing demand for multimedia applications, local area network (LAN) technologies are rapidly being upgraded to provide support for quality of service (QoS). In a network that consists of an interconnection of multiple LANs via bridges, the QoS of a flow depends on the length of an end-to-end forwarding path. In the IEEE 802.1D standard for bridges, a spanning tree is built among the bridges for loop-free frame forwarding. Albeit simple, this approach does not support all-pair shortest paths. In this paper, we present a novel bridge protocol, the Spanning Tree Alternate Routing (STAR) Bridge Protocol, that attempts to find and forward frames over alternate paths that are provably shorter than their corresponding tree paths. Being backward compatible to IEEE 802.1D, our bridge protocol allows cost-effective performance enhancement of an existing extended LAN by incrementally replacing a few bridges in the extended LAN by the new STAR bridges. We develop a strategy to ascertain bridge locations for maximum performance gain. Our study shows that we can significantly improve the end-to-end performance when deploying our bridge protocol.",

    "abstract": "Denial of service (DoS) attacks continue to threaten the reliability of networking systems. Previous approaches for protecting networks from DoS attacks are reactive in that they wait for an attack to be launched before taking appropriate measures to protect the network. This leaves the door open for other attacks that use more sophisticated methods to mask their traffic.We propose an architecture called Secure Overlay Services (SOS) that proactively prevents DoS attacks, geared toward supporting Emergency Services or similar types of communication. The architecture is constructed using a combination of secure overlay tunneling, routing via consistent hashing, and filtering. We reduce the probability of successful attacks by (i) performing intensive filtering near protected network edges, pushing the attack point perimeter into the core of the network, where high-speed routers can handle the volume of attack traffic, and (ii) introducing randomness and anonymity into the architecture, making it difficult for an attacker to target nodes along the path to a specific SOS-protected destination.Using simple analytical models, we evaluate the likelihood that an attacker can successfully launch a DoS attack against an SOS-protected network. Our analysis demonstrates that such an architecture reduces the likelihood of a successful attack to minuscule levels.",

The growing need to distribute applications across multiple, interconnected networks, and the increasing availability of high-performance, high-capacity switching nodes and networks, lead us to consider providing LAN-style multicasting across an internetwork. In this paper, we propose extensions to two common internetwork routing algorithms—distance-vector routing and link-state routing—to support low-delay datagram multicasting. We also suggest modifications to the single-spanning-tree routing algorithm, commonly used by link-layer bridges, to reduce the costs of multicasting in large extended LANs. Finally, we show how different link-layer and network-layer multicast routing algorithms can be combined hierarchically to support multicasting across large, heterogeneous internetworks.",

However, the flip side to the distributive nature of P2P networks is that it is not trivial to aggregate and broadcast global information efficiently. We believe that this aggregation/broadcast functionality is a fundamental service that should be layered over existing Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs), and in this work, we design a novel algorithm for this purpose. Specifically, we build an aggregation/broadcast tree in a bottom-up fashion by mapping nodes to their parents in the tree with a parent function. The particular parent function family we propose allows the efficient construction of multiple interior-node-disjoint trees, thus preventing single points of failure in tree structures. In this way, we provide DHTs with an ability to collect and disseminate information efficiently on a global scale. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm is efficient and robust.",

With the SPF-EE algorithm, traffic is routed along the shortest-paths under normal condition. However, in the presence of congestion and resource failures, the traffic can be dispersed temporarily to alternate paths without route re-computation. Simulation experiments show that the SPF-EE algorithm achieves grater throughput, higher responsiveness, better congestion control and fault tolerance, and substantially improves the performance of routing in a dynamic environment.",

Similar results have also been observed from measurements of other Internet links. The results in this paper show that reset connections arise from local events such as network outages, attacks, or reconfigurations, as well as from global trends in TCP usage. In particular, we identify application-level Web behaviour as the primary contributor to the global trend in reset TCP connections. The most prevalent anomaly is the absence of the normal connection termination handshake. Instead, connections are often reset by the client. We believe that particular implementations of HTTP/TCP connection management cause this global trend.",

There are two basic premises: (1) users are assumed to be independent and selfish, and (2) central administrative control is exercised only at the network switches. The operating points resulting from selfish user behavior depend crucially on the service disciplines implemented in network switches. This effect is investigated in a simple model consisting of a single exponential server shared by many Poisson sources. We discuss the extent to which one can guarantee, through the choice of switch service disciplines, that these selfish operating points will be efficient and fair. We also discuss to what extent the choice of switch service disciplines can ensure that these selfish operating points are unique and are easily and rapidly accessible by simple self-optimization techniques. We show that no service discipline can guarantee optimal efficiency. As for the other properties, we show that the traditional FIFO service discipline guarantees none of these properties, but that a service discipline called Fair Share guarantees all of them. While the treatment utilizes game-theoretic concepts, no previous knowledge of game theory is assumed.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing the evolution of Internet topology is important to our understanding of the Internet architecture and its interplay with technical, economic and social forces. A major challenge in obtaining empirical data on topology evolution is to identify real topology changes from the observed topology changes, since the latter can be due to either topology changes or transient routing dynamics. In this paper, we formulate the topology liveness problem and propose a solution based on the analysis of BGP data. We find that the impact of transient routing dynamics on topology observation decreases exponentially over time, and that the real topology dynamics consist of a constant-rate birth process and a constant-rate death process. Our model enables us to infer real topology changes from observation data with a given confidence level. We demonstrate the usefulness of the model by applying it to three applications: providing more accurate views of the topology, evaluating theoretical evolution models, and empirically characterizing the trends of topology evolution. We find that customer networks and provider networks have distinct evolution trends, which can provide an important input to the design of future Internet routing architecture.",

    "abstract": "Bit errors occur in wireless communication when interference or noise overcomes the coded and modulated transmission. Current wireless protocols may use forward error correction (FEC) to correct some small number of bit errors, but generally retransmit the whole packet if the FEC is insufficient. We observe that current wireless mesh network protocols retransmit a number of packets and that most of these retransmissions end up sending bits that have already been received multiple times, wasting network capacity. To overcome this inefficiency, we develop, implement, and evaluate a partial packet recovery (PPR) system. PPR incorporates two new ideas: (1) SoftPHY , an expanded physical layer (PHY) interface that provides PHY-independent hints to higher layers about the PHY's confidence in each bit it decodes, and (2) a postamble scheme to recover data even when a packet preamble is corrupted and not decodable at the receiver. Finally, we present PP-ARQ , an asynchronous link-layer ARQ protocol built on PPR that allows a receiver to compactly encode a request for retransmission of only those bits in a packet that are likely in error. Our experimental results from a 31-node Zigbee (802.15.4) testbed that includes Telos motes with 2.4 GHz Chipcon radios and GNU Radio nodes implementing the 802.15.4 standard show that PP-ARQ increases end-to-end capacity by a factor of 2x under moderate load.",

Prior work on this issue assumed that ASes seek only to obtain the best possible outgoing path for their traffic. In reality, other factors can influence a rational AS's behavior. Here we consider a more natural model, in which an AS is also interested in attracting incoming traffic (e.g., because other ASes pay it to carry their traffic). We ask what combinations of BGP enhancements and restrictions on routing policies can ensure that ASes have no incentive to lie about their data-plane paths. We find that protocols like S-BGP alone are insufficient, but that S-BGP does suffice if coupled with additional (quite unrealistic) restrictions on routing policies. Our game-theoretic analysis illustrates the high cost of ensuring that the ASes honestly announce data-plane paths in their BGP path announcements.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies reveal that the routing structures of operational networks are much more complex than a simple BGP/IGP hierarchy, highlighted by the presence of many distinct instances of routing protocols. However, the glue (how routing protocol instances interact and exchange routes among themselves) is still little understood or studied. For example, although Route Redistribution (RR), the implementation of the glue in router software, has been used in the Internet for more than a decade, it was only recently shown that RR is extremely vulnerable to anomalies similar to the permanent route oscillations in BGP. This paper takes an important step toward understanding how RR is used and how fundamental the role RR plays in practice. We developed a complete model and associated tools for characterizing interconnections between routing instances based on analysis of router configuration data. We analyzed and characterized the RR usage in more than 1600 operational networks. The findings are: (i) RR is indeed widely used; (ii) operators use RR to achieve important design objectives not realizable with existing routing protocols alone; (iii) RR configurations can be very diverse and complex. These empirical discoveries not only confirm that the RR glue constitutes a critical component of the current Internet routing architecture, but also emphasize the urgent need for more research to improve its safety and flexibility to support important design objectives.",

    "abstract": "By studying trouble tickets from small enterprise networks, we conclude that their operators need detailed fault diagnosis. That is, the diagnostic system should be able to diagnose not only generic faults (e.g., performance-related) but also application specific faults (e.g., error codes). It should also identify culprits at a fine granularity such as a process or firewall configuration. We build a system, called NetMedic, that enables detailed diagnosis by harnessing the rich information exposed by modern operating systems and applications. It formulates detailed diagnosis as an inference problem that more faithfully captures the behaviors and interactions of fine-grained network components such as processes. The primary challenge in solving this problem is inferring when a component might be impacting another. Our solution is based on an intuitive technique that uses the joint behavior of two components in the past to estimate the likelihood of them impacting one another in the present. We find that our deployed prototype is effective at diagnosing faults that we inject in a live environment. The faulty component is correctly identified as the most likely culprit in 80% of the cases and is almost always in the list of top five culprits.",

Most of the current hijacking detection approaches monitor IP prefixes on the control plane and detect inconsistencies in route advertisements and route qualities. We propose a different approach that utilizes information collected mostly from the data plane. Our method is motivated by two key observations: when a prefix is not hijacked, 1) the hop count of the path from a source to this prefix is generally stable; and 2) the path from a source to this prefix is almost always a super-path of the path from the same source to a reference point along the previous path, as long as the reference point is topologically close to the prefix. By carefully selecting multiple vantage points and monitoring from these vantage points for any departure from these two observations, our method is able to detect prefix hijacking with high accuracy in a light-weight, distributed, and real-time fashion. Through simulations constructed based on real Internet measurement traces, we demonstrate that our scheme is accurate with both false positive and false negative ratios below 0.5%.",

    "abstract": "Application-independent Redundancy Elimination (RE), or identifying and removing repeated content from network transfers, has been used with great success for improving network performance on enterprise access links. Recently, there is growing interest for supporting RE as a network-wide service. Such a network-wide RE service benefits ISPs by reducing link loads and increasing the effective network capacity to better accommodate the increasing number of bandwidth-intensive applications. Further, a networkwide RE service democratizes the benefits of RE to all end-to-end traffic and improves application performance by increasing throughput and reducing latencies. While the vision of a network-wide RE service is appealing, realizing it in practice is challenging. In particular, extending single vantage-point RE solutions designed for enterprise access links to the network-wide case is inefficient and/or requires modifying routing policies. We present SmartRE, a practical and efficient architecture for network-wide RE. We show that SmartRE can enable more effective utilization of the available resources at network devices, and thus can magnify the overall benefits of network-wide RE. We prototype our algorithms using Click and test our framework extensively using several real and synthetic traces.",

    "abstract": "Understanding Internet access trends at a global scale, i.e., what do people do on the Internet, is a challenging problem that is typically addressed by analyzing network traces. However, obtaining such traces presents its own set of challenges owing to either privacy concerns or to other operational difficulties. The key hypothesis of our work here is that most of the information needed to profile the Internet endpoints is already available around us - on the web. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for profiling and classifying endpoints. We implement and deploy a Google-based profiling tool, which accurately characterizes endpoint behavior by collecting and strategically combining information freely available on the web. Our 'unconstrained endpoint profiling' approach shows remarkable advances in the following scenarios: (i) Even when no packet traces are available, it can accurately predict application and protocol usage trends at arbitrary networks; (ii) When network traces are available, it dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art classification tools; (iii) When sampled flow-level traces are available, it retains high classification capabilities when other schemes literally fall apart. Using this approach, we perform unconstrained endpoint profiling at a global scale: for clients in four different world regions (Asia, South and North America and Europe). We provide the first-of-its-kind endpoint analysis which reveals fascinating similarities and differences among these regions.",

    "abstract": "Rate control protocols that utilise explicit feedback from routers are able to achieve fast convergence to an equilibrium which approximates processor-sharing on a single bottleneck link, and hence such protocols allow short flows to complete quickly. For a network, however, processor-sharing is not uniquely defined but corresponds with a choice of fairness criteria, and proportional fairness has a reasonable claim to be the network generalization of processor-sharing. In this paper, we develop a variant of RCP (rate control protocol) that achieves α-fairness when buffers are small, including proportional fairness as the case α = 1. At the level of theoretical abstraction treated, our model incorporates a general network topology, and heterogeneous propagation delays. For our variant of the RCP algorithm, we establish a simple decentralized sufficient condition for local stability. An outstanding question for explicit congestion control is whether the presence of feedback based on queue size is helpful or not, given the presence of feedback based on rate mismatch. We show that, for the variant of RCP considered here, feedback based on queue size may cause the queue to be less accurately controlled. A further outstanding question for explicit congestion control is the scale of the step-change in rate that is necessary at a resource to accommodate a new flow. We show that, for the variant of RCP considered here, this can be estimated from the aggregate flow through the resource, without knowledge of individual flow rates.",

To address this resource allocation problem, we propose an architecture that adopts a what if methodology to guide allocation decisions taken by the IaaS. The architecture uses a prediction engine with a lightweight simulator to estimate the performance of a given resource allocation and a genetic algorithm to find an optimized solution in the large search space. We have built a prototype for Topology-Aware Resource Allocation (TARA) and evaluated it on a 80 server cluster with two representative MapReduce-based benchmarks. Our results show that TARA reduces the job completion time of these applications by up to 59% when compared to application-independent allocation policies.",

How often do failures occur, how long do they last, what are their causes, and how do they impact customers? Traditionally, answering questions such as these has required dedicated (and often expensive) instrumentation broadly deployed across a network. We propose an alternative approach: opportunistically mining \"low-quality\" data sources that are already available in modern network environments. We describe a methodology for recreating a succinct history of failure events in an IP network using a combination of structured data (router configurations and syslogs) and semi-structured data (email logs). Using this technique we analyze over five years of failure events in a large regional network consisting of over 200 routers; to our knowledge, this is the largest study of its kind.",

YAMR provably constructs a set of paths that is resilient to any one inter-domain link failure, thus achieving high reliability in a systematic way. Further, even though YAMR maintains more paths than BGP, it actually requires significantly less control traffic, thus alleviating instead of worsening one of the Internet's scalability problems.

We report on our experiences conducting a diverse set of analyses in a differentially private manner. We are able to express all of our target analyses, though for some of them an approximate expression is required to keep the error-level low. By running these analyses on real datasets, we find that the error introduced for the sake of privacy is often (but not always) low even at high levels of privacy. We factor our learning into a toolkit that will be likely useful for other analyses. Overall, we conclude that differential privacy shows promise for a broad class of network analyses.",

The key idea in the code is the sequential application of a pseudo-random hash function to the message bits to produce a sequence of coded symbols for transmission. This encoding ensures that two input messages that differ in even one bit lead to very different coded sequences after the point at which they differ, providing good resilience to noise and bit errors. To decode spinal codes, this paper develops an approximate maximum-likelihood decoder, called the bubble decoder , which runs in time polynomial in the message size and achieves the Shannon capacity over both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and binary symmetric channel (BSC) models. Experimental results obtained from a software implementation of a linear-time decoder show that spinal codes achieve higher throughput than fixed-rate LDPC codes, rateless Raptor codes, and the layered rateless coding approach of Strider, across a range of channel conditions and message sizes. An early hardware prototype that can decode at 10 Mbits/s in FPGA demonstrates that spinal codes are a practical construction.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we design and evaluate a novel who-is-who service for inferring attributes that characterize individual Twitter users. Our methodology exploits the Lists feature, which allows a user to group other users who tend to tweet on a topic that is of interest to her, and follow their collective tweets. Our key insight is that the List meta-data (names and descriptions) provides valuable semantic cues about who the users included in the Lists are, including their topics of expertise and how they are perceived by the public. Thus, we can infer a user's expertise by analyzing the meta-data of crowdsourced Lists that contain the user. We show that our methodology can accurately and comprehensively infer attributes of millions of Twitter users, including a vast majority of Twitter's influential users (based on ranking metrics like number of followers). Our work provides a foundation for building better search and recommendation services on Twitter.",

    "abstract": "ISPs are increasingly selling \"tiered\" contracts, which offer Internet connectivity to wholesale customers in bundles, at rates based on the cost of the links that the traffic in the bundle is traversing. Although providers have already begun to implement and deploy tiered pricing contracts, little is known about how to structure them. While contracts that sell connectivity on finer granularities improve market efficiency, they are also more costly for ISPs to implement and more difficult for customers to understand. Our goal is to analyze whether current tiered pricing practices in the wholesale transit market yield optimal profits for ISPs and whether better bundling strategies might exist. In the process, we deliver two contributions: 1) we develop a novel way of mapping traffic and topology data to a demand and cost model, and 2) we fit this model on three large real-world networks: an European transit ISP, a content distribution network, and an academic research network, and run counterfactuals to evaluate the effects of different bundling strategies. Our results show that the common ISP practice of structuring tiered contracts according to the cost of carrying the traffic flows ( e.g. , offering a discount for traffic that is local) can be suboptimal and that dividing contracts based on both traffic demand and the cost of carrying it into only three or four tiers yields near-optimal profit for the ISP.",

    "abstract": "To serve users quickly, Web service providers build infrastructure closer to clients and use multi-stage transport connections. Although these changes reduce client-perceived round-trip times, TCP's current mechanisms fundamentally limit latency improvements. We performed a measurement study of a large Web service provider and found that, while connections with no loss complete close to the ideal latency of one round-trip time, TCP's timeout-driven recovery causes transfers with loss to take five times longer on average. In this paper, we present the design of novel loss recovery mechanisms for TCP that judiciously use redundant transmissions to minimize timeout-driven recovery. Proactive, Reactive, and Corrective are three qualitatively-different, easily-deployable mechanisms that (1) proactively recover from losses, (2) recover from them as quickly as possible, and (3) reconstruct packets to mask loss. Crucially, the mechanisms are compatible both with middleboxes and with TCP's existing congestion control and loss recovery. Our large-scale experiments on Google's production network that serves billions of flows demonstrate a 23% decrease in the mean and 47% in 99th percentile latency over today's TCP.",

This is because the switch landscape is fundamentally diverse in performance, feature set and supported APIs. We propose to address this challenge via a lightweight portability layer that acts as a rendezvous point between the requirements of controller application and the vendor knowledge of switch implementations. Above, applications specify rules in virtual flow tables annotated with semantic intents and expectations. Below, vendor specific drivers map them to optimized switch-specific rule sets.

    "abstract": "Several powerful forces are gathering to make fundamental and irrevocable changes to the century-old grid. The next-generation grid, often called the 'smart grid,' will feature distributed energy production, vastly more storage, tens of millions of stochastic renewable-energy sources, and the use of communication technologies both to allow precise matching of supply to demand and to incentivize appropriate consumer behaviour. These changes will have the effect of reducing energy waste and reducing the carbon footprint of the grid, making it 'smarter' and 'greener.' In this position paper, we discuss how the concepts and techniques pioneered by the Internet, the fruit of four decades of research in this area, are directly applicable to the design of a smart, green grid. This is because both the Internet and the electrical grid are designed to meet fundamental needs, for information and for energy, respectively, by connecting geographically dispersed suppliers with geographically dispersed consumers. Keeping this and other similarities (and fundamental differences, as well) in mind, we propose several specific areas where Internet concepts and technologies can contribute to the development of a smart, green grid. We also describe some areas where the Internet operations can be improved based on the experience gained in the electrical grid. We hope that our work will initiate a dialogue between the Internet and the smart grid communities.",

    "abstract": "Video traffic already represents a significant fraction of today's traffic and is projected to exceed 90% in the next five years. In parallel, user expectations for a high quality viewing experience (e.g., low startup delays, low buffering, and high bitrates) are continuously increasing. Unlike traditional workloads that either require low latency (e.g., short web transfers) or high average throughput (e.g., large file transfers), a high quality video viewing experience requires sustained performance over extended periods of time (e.g., tens of minutes). This imposes fundamentally different demands on content delivery infrastructures than those envisioned for traditional traffic patterns. Our large-scale measurements over 200 million video sessions show that today's delivery infrastructure fails to meet these requirements: more than 20% of sessions have a rebuffering ratio ≥ 10% and more than 14% of sessions have a video startup delay ≥ 10s. Using measurement-driven insights, we make a case for a video control plane that can use a global view of client and network conditions to dynamically optimize the video delivery in order to provide a high quality viewing experience despite an unreliable delivery infrastructure. Our analysis shows that such a control plane can potentially improve the rebuffering ratio by up to 2× in the average case and by more than one order of magnitude under stress.",

    "abstract": "Middleboxes are ubiquitous in today's networks and perform a variety of important functions, including IDS, VPN, firewalling, and WAN optimization. These functions differ vastly in their requirements for hardware resources ( e.g. , CPU cycles and memory bandwidth). Thus, depending on the functions they go through, different flows can consume different amounts of a middlebox's resources. While there is much literature on weighted fair sharing of link bandwidth to isolate flows, it is unclear how to schedule multiple resources in a middlebox to achieve similar guarantees. In this paper, we analyze several natural packet scheduling algorithms for multiple resources and show that they have undesirable properties. We propose a new algorithm, Dominant Resource Fair Queuing (DRFQ), that retains the attractive properties that fair sharing provides for one resource. In doing so, we generalize the concept of virtual time in classical fair queuing to multi-resource settings. The resulting algorithm is also applicable in other contexts where several resources need to be multiplexed in the time domain.",

A key insight underlying auspice is a demand-aware replica {placement engine} that intelligently replicates name records to provide low lookup latency, low update cost, and high availability. We have implemented a prototype of auspice and compared it against several commercial managed DNS providers as well as state-of-the-art research alternatives, and shown that auspice significantly outperforms both.

    "abstract": "Contemporary network stacks are masterpieces of generality, supporting many edge-node and middle-node functions. Generality comes at a high performance cost: current APIs, memory models, and implementations drastically limit the effectiveness of increasingly powerful hardware. Generality has historically been required so that individual systems could perform many functions. However, as providers have scaled services to support millions of users, they have transitioned toward thousands (or millions) of dedicated servers, each performing a few functions. We argue that the overhead of generality is now a key obstacle to effective scaling, making specialization not only viable, but necessary. We present Sandstorm and Namestorm, web and DNS servers that utilize a clean-slate userspace network stack that exploits knowledge of application-specific workloads. Based on the netmap framework, our novel approach merges application and network-stack memory models, aggressively amortizes protocol-layer costs based on application-layer knowledge, couples tightly with the NIC event model, and exploits microarchitectural features. Simultaneously, the servers retain use of conventional programming frameworks. We compare our approach with the FreeBSD and Linux stacks using the nginx web server and NSD name server, demonstrating 2--10x and 9x improvements in web-server and DNS throughput, lower CPU usage, linear multicore scaling, and saturated NIC hardware.",

This directly leads to the rapid growth of the global Forwarding Information Base (FIB) size, which raises serious concerns for ISPs as the FIB memory in line cards is much more expensive than regular memory modules and it is very costly to increase this memory capacity frequently for all the routers in an ISP. One potential solution is to install only the most popular FIB entries into the fast memory (i.e., a FIB cache), while storing the complete FIB in slow memory. In this paper, we propose an effective FIB caching scheme that achieves a considerably higher hit ratio than previous approaches while preventing the cache-hiding problem. Our experimental results show that with only 20K prefixes in the cache (5.36% of the actual FIB size), the hit ratio of our scheme is higher than 99.95%. Our scheme can also handle cache misses, cache replacement and routing updates efficiently.",

First, we adopt the state-of-the-art in compressed data structures, yielding a static entropy-compressed FIB representation with asymptotically optimal lookup. Then, we re-design the venerable prefix tree, used commonly for IP lookup for at least 20 years in IP routers, to also admit entropy bounds and support lookup in optimal time and update in nearly optimal time. Evaluations on a Linux kernel prototype indicate that our compressors encode a FIB comprising more than 440K prefixes to just about 100--400 KBytes of memory, with a threefold increase in lookup throughput and no penalty on FIB updates.",

CDNs must meet users' demands for fast join times, high bitrates, and low buffering ratios, while minimizing their own cost of delivery and responding to issues in real-time. Wide-area latency, loss, and failures, as well as varied workloads (\"mega-events\" to long-tail), make meeting these demands challenging. An analysis of video sessions concluded that a centralized controller could improve user experience, but CDN systems have shied away from such designs due to the difficulty of quickly handling failures, a requirement of both operators and users. We introduce VDN, a practical approach to a video delivery network that uses a centralized algorithm for live video optimization. VDN provides CDN operators with real-time, fine-grained control. It does this in spite of challenges resulting from the wide-area (e.g., state inconsistency, partitions, failures) by using a hybrid centralized+distributed control plane, increasing average bitrate by 1.7x and decreasing cost by 2x in different scenarios.",

To improve the tail latency of such services, we use a few building blocks: reissuing laggards elsewhere in the cluster, new policies to return incomplete results and speeding up laggards by giving them more resources. Combining these building blocks to reduce the overall latency is non-trivial because for the same amount of resource (e.g., number of reissues), different stages improve their latency by different amounts. We present Kwiken, a framework that takes an end-to-end view of latency improvements and costs. It decomposes the problem of minimizing latency over a general processing DAG into a manageable optimization over individual stages. Through simulations with production traces, we show sizable gains; the 99th percentile of latency improves by over 50% when just 0.1% of the responses are allowed to have partial results and by over 40% for 25% of the services when just 5% extra resources are used for reissues.",

We then design a novel hybrid link adaptation scheme termed SampleLite that adapts all 802.11n features while being efficient compared to sampling-based open-loop schemes and practical relative to closed loop schemes. SampleLite uses sender-side RSSI measurements to significantly lower the sampling overhead, by exploiting the monotonic relationship between best settings for each feature and the RSSI.

    "abstract": "Network middleboxes must offer high availability, with automatic failover when a device fails. Achieving high availability is challenging because failover must correctly restore lost state (e.g., activity logs, port mappings) but must do so quickly (e.g., in less than typical transport timeout values to minimize disruption to applications) and with little overhead to failure-free operation (e.g., additional per-packet latencies of 10-100s of us). No existing middlebox design provides failover that is correct, fast to recover, and imposes little increased latency on failure-free operations. We present a new design for fault-tolerance in middleboxes that achieves these three goals. Our system, FTMB (for Fault-Tolerant MiddleBox), adopts the classical approach of \"rollback recovery\" in which a system uses information logged during normal operation to correctly reconstruct state after a failure. However, traditional rollback recovery cannot maintain high throughput given the frequent output rate of middleboxes. Hence, we design a novel solution to record middlebox state which relies on two mechanisms: (1) 'ordered logging', which provides lightweight logging of the information needed after recovery, and (2) a `parallel release' algorithm which, when coupled with ordered logging, ensures that recovery is always correct. We implement ordered logging and parallel release in Click and show that for our test applications our design adds only 30$\\mu$s of latency to median per packet latencies. Our system introduces moderate throughput overheads (5-30%) and can reconstruct lost state in 40-275ms for practical systems.",

    "abstract": "Backscatter provides dual-benefits of energy harvesting and low-power communication, making it attractive to a broad class of wireless sensors. But the design of a protocol that enables extremely power-efficient radios for harvesting-based sensors as well as high-rate data transfer for data-rich sensors presents a conundrum. In this paper, we present a new fully asymmetric backscatter communication protocol where nodes blindly transmit data as and when they sense. This model enables fully flexible node designs, from extraordinarily power-efficient backscatter radios that consume barely a few micro-watts to high-throughput radios that can stream at hundreds of Kbps while consuming a paltry tens of micro-watts. The challenge, however, lies in decoding concurrent streams at the reader, which we achieve using a novel combination of time-domain separation of interleaved signal edges, and phase-domain separation of colliding transmissions. We provide an implementation of our protocol, LF-Backscatter, and show that it can achieve an order of magnitude or more improvement in throughput, latency and power over state-of-art alternatives.",

Network virtualization has been successfully developed commercially using SDN techniques. This paper describes our experience in developing production-ready, multi-vendor implementations of a complex network virtualization system. Having struggled with a traditional network protocol approach (based on OpenFlow) to achieving interoperability among vendors, we adopted a new approach. We focused first on defining the control information content and then used a generic database protocol to synchronize state between the elements. Within less than nine months of starting the design, we had achieved basic interoperability between our network virtualization controller and the hardware switches of six vendors. This was a qualitative improvement on our decidedly mixed experience using OpenFlow. We found a number of benefits to the database approach, such as speed of implementation, greater hardware diversity, the ability to abstract away implementation details of the hardware, clarified state consistency model, and extensibility of the overall system.",

    "abstract": "After several IPv4 address exhaustion milestones in the last three years, it is becoming apparent that the world is running out of IPv4 addresses, and the adoption of the next generation Internet protocol, IPv6, though nascent, is accelerating. In order to better understand this unique and disruptive transition, we explore twelve metrics using ten global-scale datasets to create the longest and broadest measurement of IPv6 adoption to date. Using this perspective, we find that adoption, relative to IPv4, varies by two orders of magnitude depending on the measure examined and that care must be taken when evaluating adoption metrics in isolation. Further, we find that regional adoption is not uniform. Finally, and perhaps most surprisingly, we find that over the last three years, the nature of IPv6 utilization-in terms of traffic, content, reliance on transition technology, and performance-has shifted dramatically from prior findings, indicating a maturing of the protocol into production mode. We believe IPv6's recent growth and this changing utilization signal a true quantum leap.",

However, the interpretation of such responses, or lack of them, is nuanced and depends on multiple factors, including: how we probed, how different protocols in the network stack interact, the presence of filtering policies near the target, and temporal churn in IP responsiveness. Although often neglected, these factors can significantly affect the results of active measurement studies. We develop a taxonomy of liveness which we employ to develop a method to perform concurrent IPv4 scans using ICMP, five TCP-based, and two UDP-based protocols, comprehensively capturing all responses to our probes, including negative and cross-layer responses. Leveraging our methodology, we present a systematic analysis of liveness and how it manifests in active scanning campaigns, yielding practical insights and methodological improvements for the design and the execution of active Internet measurement studies.",

    "abstract": "A proposal to improve routing security---Route Origin Authorization (ROA)---has been standardized. A ROA specifies which network is allowed to announce a set of Internet destinations. While some networks now specify ROAs, little is known about whether other networks check routes they receive against these ROAs, a process known as Route Origin Validation (ROV). Which networks blindly accept invalid routes? Which reject them outright? Which de-preference them if alternatives exist? Recent analysis attempts to use uncontrolled experiments to characterize ROV adoption by comparing valid routes and invalid routes. However, we argue that gaining a solid understanding of ROV adoption is impossible using currently available data sets and techniques. Our measurements suggest that, although some ISPs are not observed using invalid routes in uncontrolled experiments, they are actually using different routes for (non-security) traffic engineering purposes, without performing ROV. We conclude with a description of a controlled, verifiable methodology for measuring ROV and present three ASes that do implement ROV, confirmed by operators.",

A key component of a CDN is the mapping system that uses the DNS protocol to route each client's request to a ``proximal'' server that serves the requested content. While traditional mapping systems identify a client using the IP of its name server, we describe our experience in building and rolling-out a novel system called end-user mapping that identifies the client directly by using a prefix of the client's IP address. Using measurements from Akamai's production network during the roll-out, we show that end-user mapping provides significant performance benefits for clients who use public resolvers, including an eight-fold decrease in mapping distance, a two-fold decrease in RTT and content download time, and a 30% improvement in the time-to-first byte. We also quantify the scaling challenges in implementing end-user mapping such as the 8-fold increase in DNS queries. Finally, we show that a CDN with a larger number of deployment locations is likely to benefit more from end-user mapping than a CDN with a smaller number of deployments.",

We identify three key requirements for such predictability: guaranteed network bandwidth, guaranteed packet delay and guaranteed burst allowance. We present Silo, a system that offers these guarantees in multi-tenant datacenters. Silo leverages the tight coupling between bandwidth and delay: controlling tenant bandwidth leads to deterministic bounds on network queuing delay. Silo builds upon network calculus to place tenant VMs with competing requirements such that they can coexist. A novel hypervisor-based policing mechanism achieves packet pacing at sub-microsecond granularity, ensuring tenants do not exceed their allowances. We have implemented a Silo prototype comprising a VM placement manager and a Windows filter driver. Silo does not require any changes to applications, guest OSes or network switches. We show that Silo can ensure predictable message latency for cloud applications while imposing low overhead.",

Unfortunately, when distributing live video or large files, some receivers might be unable to join the multicast tree. Applications willing to use multicast for efficiency must also support unicast to reach all their receivers. Given the complexity of mixing unicast and multicast, most popular applications only use unicast protocols. The large deployment of QUIC, a secure and flexible transport protocol that runs above UDP, allows for reconsidering multicast at the transport layer. We design and implement Flexicast QUIC , an extension of Multipath QUIC that enables applications to use multicast where and when it works efficiently and seamlessly fall back on unicast otherwise. Our in-lab performance evaluation shows that a Flexicast QUIC source can sustain up to 1000 receivers for an aggregated traffic of more than 80 Gbps, more than 4 times what we achieve with (unicast) QUIC in the same setup. We also show that Flexicast QUIC can easily distribute a video stream and recover from transient failures on the underlying multicast tree while maintaining excellent quality of experience.",

While it is possible to devise priority or reservation-based schemes that give high-bandwidth traffic preferential treatment at the expense of other connections, we focus on the use of routing algorithms that improve resource allocation while maintaining max-min fair share semantics. In our approach, routing is closely coupled with congestion control in the sense that congestion information, such as the rates allocated to existing connections, is used by the routing algorithm. To reduce the amount of routing information that must be distributed, an abstraction of the congestion information is introduced. Using an extensive set of simulation, we identify a link-cost or cost metric for \"shortest-path\" routing that performs uniformly better than the minimal-hop routing and shortest-widest path routing algorithms. To further improve throughput without reducing the fair share of single-path connections, we propose a novel prioritized multi-path routing algorithm in which low priority paths share the bandwidth left unused by higher priority paths. This leads to a conservative extension of max-min fairness called prioritized multi-level max-min fairness. Simulation results confirm the advantages of our multi-path routing algorithm.",

    "abstract": "In the IP multicast model, a set of hosts can be aggregated into a group of hosts with one address, to which any host can send. However, Internet TV, distance learning, file distribution and other emerging large-scale multicast applications strain the current realization of this model, which lacks a basis for charging, lacks access control, and is difficult to scale.This paper proposes an extension to IP multicast to support the channel model of multicast and describes a specific realization called EXPlicitly REquested Single-Source (EXPRESS) multicast. In this model, a multicast channel has exactly one explicitly designated source, and zero or more channel subscribers . A single protocol supports both channel subscription and efficient collection of channel information such as subscriber count. We argue that EXPRESS addresses the aforementioned problems, justifying this multicast service model in the Internet.",

We analyze its throughput, single server delay, and end-to-end delay guarantee for variable rate Fluctuation Constrained (FC) and Exponentially Bounded Fluctuation (EBF) servers. We show that SFQ is better suited than Weighted Fair Queuing for integrated services networks and it is strictly better than Self Clocked Fair Queuing. To support heterogeneous services and multiple protocol families in integrated services networks, we present a hierarchical SFQ scheduler and derive its performance bounds. Our analysis demonstrates that SFQ is suitable for integrated services networks since it: (1) achieves low average as well as maximum delay for low-throughput applications (e.g., interactive audio, telnet, etc.); (2) provides fairness which is desirable for VBR video; (3) provides fairness, regardless of variation in a server capacity, for throughput-intensive, flow-controlled data applications; (4) enables hierarchical link sharing which is desirable for managing heterogeneity; and (5) is computationally efficient.",

    "abstract": "Multicasting is increasingly used as an efficient communication mechanism for group-oriented applications in the Internet. In order to offer secrecy for multicast applications, the traffic encryption key has to be changed whenever a user joins or leaves the system. Such a change has to be communicated to all the current users. The bandwidth used for such rekeying operation could be high when the group size is large. The proposed solutions to cope with this limitation, commonly called 1 affects n phenomenon, consist of organizing group members into subgroups that use independent traffic encryption keys. This kind of solutions introduce a new challenge which is the requirement of decrypting and reencrypting multicast messages whenever they pass from one subgroup to another. This is a serious drawback for applications that require real-time communication such as video-conferencing. In order to avoid the systematic decryption / reencryption of messages, we propose in this paper an adaptive solution which structures group members into clusters according to the application requirements in term of synchronization and the membership change behavior in the secure session. Simulation results show that our solution is efficient and typically adaptive compared to other schemes.",

Our main objective in the present paper is to improve the efficiency of Paxson's method for synthesizing self-similar network traffic. Paxson's method uses a fast, approximate synthesis for the power spectrum of the FGN and uses the inverse Fourier transform to obtain the time-domain sequences. We demonstrate that a linear approximation can be used to determine the power spectrum of the FGN. This linear approximation reduces the complexity of the computation without compromising the accuracy in synthesizing the power spectrum of the FGN. Our results show that long traces can be generated in much less time. To compare our method with existing ones, we will measure the running time in generating long and short sample paths from the FGN. We will also conduct experiments to show that our method can generate self-similar traffic for specified Hurst parameters with high accuracy.",

To ease the deployment of such services, this paper proposes an overlay-based Internet Indirection Infrastructure ( I3) that offers a rendezvous-based communication abstraction. Instead of explicitly sending a packet to a destination, each packet is associated with an identifier; this identifier is then used by the receiver to obtain delivery of the packet. This level of indirection decouples the act of sending from the act of receiving, and allows I3 to efficiently support a wide variety of fundamental communication services. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we have designed and built a prototype based on the Chord lookup protocol.",

Router and switch mechanisms such as service disciplines and buffer management policies determine the sharing of resources during congestion. We show, using a game-theoretic approach, that all currently proposed mechanisms, either encourage the behaviour that leads to congestion or are oblivious to it.We propose a class of service disciplines called the Diminishing Weight Schedulers (DWS) that punish misbehaving users and reward congestion avoiding well behaved users. We also propose a sample service discipline called the Rate Inverse Scheduling (RIS) from the class of DWS schedulers. With DWS schedulers deployed in the network, max-min fair rates constitute a unique Nash and Stackelberg Equilibrium. We show that RIS solves the problems of excessive congestion due to unresponsive flows, aggressive versions of TCP, multiple parallel connections and is also fair to TCP.",

Second, we provide a compact, light-weight implementation framework that greatly reduces the amount of state required to simulate large-scale network models. Based on the proposed techniques, we provide sample simulation models for two networking protocols: TCP and OSPF. We implement these models in a simulation environment ROSSNet, which is an extension to the previously developed optimistic simulator ROSS. We perform validation experoments for TCP and OSPF and present performance reuslts of our techniques by simulating OSPF and TCP on a large and realistic topology, such as AT&amp;T's US network based on rocketfuel data. The end result of these innovations is that we are able to simulate million node network tolopgies using inexpensive commercial off-the-shelf hyper-threaded multiprocessor systems consuming less than 1.4 GB of RAM in total .",

While previous methods of topology generation have focused on explicit replication of statistical properties, such as node hierarchies and node degree distributions, our approach addresses the economic tradeoffs, such as cost and performance, and the technical constraints faced by a single ISP in its network design. By investigating plausible objectives and constraints in the design of actual networks, observed network properties such as certain hierarchical structures and node degree distributions can be expected to be the natural by-product of an approximately optimal solution chosen by network designers and operators. In short, we advocate here essentially an approach to network topology design, modeling, and generation that is based on the concept of Highly Optimized Tolerance (HOT) . In contrast with purely descriptive topology modeling, this opens up new areas of research that focus on the causal forces at work in network design and aim at identifying the economic and technical drivers responsible for the observed large-scale network behavior. As a result, the proposed approach should have significantly more predictive power than currently pursued efforts and should provide a scientific foundation for the investigation of other important problems, such as pricing, peering, or the dynamics of routing protocols.",

Although feasibility for widespread adoption remains the greatest hurdle for BGP security, there has been little quantitative research into what properties contribute the most to the adoptability of a security scheme. In this paper, we provide a model for assessing the adoptability of a secure BGP routing protocol. We perform this evaluation by simulating incentives compatible adoption decisions of ISPs on the Internet under a variety of assumptions. Our results include: (a) the existence of a sharp threshold, where, if the cost of adoption is below the threshold, complete adoption takes place, while almost no adoption takes place above the threshold; (b) under a strong attacker model, adding a single hop of path authentication to origin authentication yields similar adoptability characteristics as a full path security scheme; (c) under a weaker attacker model, adding full path authentication (e.g., via S-BGP [9]) significantly improves the adoptability of BGP security over weaker path security schemes such as soBGP [16]. These results provide insight into the development of more adoptable secure BGP protocols and demonstrate the importance of studying adoptability of protocols.",

Their hosts are often only intermittently connected to the Internet, due to using multiple access networks, gaps in wireless coverage or explicit user choice. When such hosts communicate using the current Internet protocols, intermittent connectivity can significantly decrease performance and even cause connections to fail altogether. This paper experimentally measures the behavior of Internet communication across a dynamically changing, intermittently connected path. An analysis of the experimental results finds that address changes together with transport-layer timeout and retransmission behaviors are the main limiting factors. Based on these experimental results, this paper proposes a solution that combines the Host Identity Protocol (HIP) with two new protocol enhancements, the TCP User Timeout Option and the TCP Retransmission Trigger. Detailed experiments with HIP and a prototype implementation of these protocol enhancements show that they tolerate address changes and arbitrary-length disconnections while significantly increasing performance under intermittent connectivity to within 86-96% of a scenario with constant connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the Internet's structure through empirical measurements is important in the development of new topology generators, new protocols, traffic engineering, and troubleshooting, among other things. While prior studies of Internet topology have been based on active (traceroute-like) measurements, passive measurements of packet traffic offer the possibility of a greatly expanded perspective of Internet structure with much lower impact and management overhead. In this paper we describe a methodology for inferring network structure from passive measurements of IP packet traffic. We describe algorithms that enable 1) traffic sources that share network paths to be clustered accurately without relying on IP address or autonomous system information, 2) topological structure to be inferred accurately with only a small number of active measurements, 3) missing information to be recovered, which is a serious challenge in the use of passive packet measurements. We demonstrate our techniques using a series of simulated topologies and empirical data sets. Our experiments show that the clusters established by our method closely correspond to sources that actually share paths. We also show the trade-offs between selectively applied active probes and the accuracy of the inferred topology between sources. Finally, we characterize the degree to which missing information can be recovered from passive measurements, which further enhances the accuracy of the inferred topologies.",

In this study, we identify the network's lack of accountability as a fundamental obstacle to correcting this problem: Employing an economic model, we argue that optimal routes and innovation are impossible unless new monitoring capability is introduced and incorporated with the contracting system. Furthermore, we derive the minimum requirements a monitoring system must meet to support first-best routing and innovation characteristics.

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of the Internet over the last decade has been startling. However, efforts to track its growth have often fallen afoul of bad data --- for instance, how much traffic does the Internet now carry? The problem is not that the data is technically hard to obtain, or that it does not exist, but rather that the data is not shared. Obtaining an overall picture requires data from multiple sources, few of whom are open to sharing such data, either because it violates privacy legislation, or exposes business secrets. Likewise, detection of global Internet health problems is hampered by a lack of data sharing. The approaches used so far in the Internet, e.g. trusted third parties, or data anonymization, have been only partially successful, and are not widely adopted.The paper presents a method for performing computations on shared data without any participants revealing their secret data . For example, one can compute the sum of traffic over a set of service providers without any service provider learning the traffic of another. The method is simple, scalable, and flexible enough to perform a wide range of valuable operations on Internet data.",

    "abstract": "60 GHz is considered the most promising technology to deliver gigabit wireless for indoor communications. We propose to integrate 60 GHz radio with the existing Wi-Fi radio in 2.4/5 GHz band to take advantage of the complementary nature of these different bands. This integration presents an opportunity to provide a unified technology for both gigabit Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN) and Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), thus further reinforcing the technology convergence that is already underway with the widespread adoption of Wi-Fi technology. Many open research questions remain to make this unified solution work seamlessly for WPAN and WLAN.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel algorithm, UDmap , to identify dynamically assigned IP addresses and analyze their dynamics pattern. UDmap is fully automatic, and relies only on application-level server logs. We applied UDmap to a month-long Hotmail user-login trace and identified a significant number of dynamic IP addresses - more than 102 million. This suggests that the fraction of IP addresses that are dynamic is by no means negligible. Using this information in combination with a three-month Hotmail email server log, we were able to establish that 95.6% of mail servers setup on the dynamic IP addresses in our trace sent out solely spam emails. Moreover, these mail servers sent out a large amount of spam - amounting to 42.2% of all spam emails received by Hotmail. These results highlight the importance of being able to accurately identify dynamic IP addresses for spam filtering. We expect similar benefits to arise for phishing site identification and botnet detection. To our knowledge, this is the first successful attempt to automatically identify and understand IP address dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The latency between machines on the Internet can dramatically affect users' experience for many distributed applications. Particularly, in multiplayer online games, players seek to cluster themselves so that those in the same session have low latency to each other. A system that predicts latencies between machine pairs allows such matchmaking to consider many more machine pairs than can be probed in a scalable fashion while users are waiting. Using a far-reaching trace of latencies between players on over 3.5 million game consoles, we designed Htrae, a latency prediction system for game matchmaking scenarios. One novel feature of Htrae is its synthesis of geolocation with a network coordinate system. It uses geolocation to select reasonable initial network coordinates for new machines joining the system, allowing it to converge more quickly than standard network coordinate systems and produce substantially lower prediction error than state-of-the-art latency prediction systems. For instance, it produces 90th percentile errors less than half those of iPlane and Pyxida. Our design is general enough to make it a good fit for other latency-sensitive peer-to-peer applications besides game matchmaking.",

    "abstract": "Modern communication technologies are steadily advancing the physical layer (PHY) data rate in wireless LANs, from hundreds of Mbps in current 802.11n to over Gbps in the near future. As PHY data rates increase, however, the overhead of media access control (MAC) progressively degrades data throughput efficiency. This trend reflects a fundamental aspect of the current MAC protocol, which allocates the channel as a single resource at a time. This paper argues that, in a high data rate WLAN, the channel should be divided into separate subchannels whose width is commensurate with PHY data rate and typical frame size. Multiple stations can then contend for and use subchannels simultaneously according to their traffic demands, thereby increasing overall efficiency. We introduce FICA, a fine-grained channel access method that embodies this approach to media access using two novel techniques. First, it proposes a new PHY architecture based on OFDM that retains orthogonality among subchannels while relying solely on the coordination mechanisms in existing WLAN, carrier-sensing and broadcasting. Second, FICA employs a frequency-domain contention method that uses physical layer RTS/CTS signaling and frequency domain backoff to efficiently coordinate subchannel access. We have implemented FICA, both MAC and PHY layers, using a software radio platform, and our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the FICA design. Further, our simulation results suggest FICA can improve the efficiency ratio of WLANs by up to 400% compared to existing 802.11.",

    "abstract": "Unsolicited one-way Internet traffic, also called Internet background radiation (IBR), has been used for years to study malicious activity on the Internet, including worms, DoS attacks, and scanning address space looking for vulnerabilities to exploit. We show how such traffic can also be used to analyze macroscopic Internet events that are unrelated to malware. We examine two phenomena: country-level censorship of Internet communications described in recent work, and natural disasters (two recent earthquakes). We introduce a new metric of local IBR activity based on the number of unique IP addresses per hour contributing to IBR. The advantage of this metric is that it is not affected by bursts of traffic from a few hosts. Although we have only scratched the surface, we are convinced that IBR traffic is an important building block for comprehensive monitoring, analysis, and possibly even detection of events unrelated to the IBR itself. In particular, IBR offers the opportunity to monitor the impact of events such as natural disasters on network infrastructure, and in particular reveals a view of events that is complementary to many existing measurement platforms based on (BGP) control-plane views or targeted active ICMP probing.",

While key-value stores offer significant performance and scalability advantages compared to traditional databases, they achieve these properties through a restricted API that limits object retrieval---an object can only be retrieved by the (primary and only) key under which it was inserted. This paper presents HyperDex, a novel distributed key-value store that provides a unique search primitive that enables queries on secondary attributes. The key insight behind HyperDex is the concept of hyperspace hashing in which objects with multiple attributes are mapped into a multidimensional hyperspace. This mapping leads to efficient implementations not only for retrieval by primary key, but also for partially-specified secondary attribute searches and range queries. A novel chaining protocol enables the system to achieve strong consistency, maintain availability and guarantee fault tolerance. An evaluation of the full system shows that HyperDex is 12-13x faster than Cassandra and MongoDB for finding partially specified objects. Additionally, HyperDex achieves 2-4x higher throughput for get / put operations.",

Based on this insight, we design PASE, a transport framework that synthesizes existing transport strategies, namely, self-adjusting endpoints (used in TCP style protocols), innetwork prioritization (used in pFabric), and arbitration (used in PDQ). PASE is deployment friendly: it does not require any changes to the network fabric; yet, its performance is comparable to, or better than, the state-of-the-art protocols that require changes to network elements (e.g., pFabric). We evaluate PASE using simulations and testbed experiments. Our results show that PASE performs well for a wide range of application workloads and network settings.",

    "abstract": "Multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) is the latest communication technology that promises to linearly increase the wireless capacity by deploying more antennas on access points (APs). However, the large number of MIMO antennas will generate a huge amount of digital signal samples in real time. This imposes a grand challenge on the AP design by multiplying the computation and the I/O requirements to process the digital samples. This paper presents BigStation, a scalable architecture that enables realtime signal processing in large-scale MIMO systems which may have tens or hundreds of antennas. Our strategy to scale is to extensively parallelize the MU-MIMO processing on many simple and low-cost commodity computing devices. Our design can incrementally support more antennas by proportionally adding more computing devices. To reduce the overall processing latency, which is a critical constraint for wireless communication, we parallelize the MU-MIMO processing with a distributed pipeline based on its computation and communication patterns. At each stage of the pipeline, we further use data partitioning and computation partitioning to increase the processing speed. As a proof of concept, we have built a BigStation prototype based on commodity PC servers and standard Ethernet switches. Our prototype employs 15 PC servers and can support real-time processing of 12 software radio antennas. Our results show that the BigStation architecture is able to scale to tens to hundreds of antennas. With 12 antennas, our BigStation prototype can increase wireless capacity by 6.8x with a low mean processing delay of 860μs. While this latency is not yet low enough for the 802.11 MAC, it already satisfies the real-time requirements of many existing wireless standards, e.g., LTE and WCDMA.",

    "abstract": "\"The Internet is for everyone\" claims Vint Cerf, the father of the Internet via RFC 3271. The Internet Society's recent global Internet survey reveals that the Internet should be considered as a basic human birth right. We strongly agree with these and believe that basic access to the Internet should be made free, at least to access the essential services. However the current Internet access model, which is governed by market economics makes it practically infeasible for enabling universal access especially for those with socio-economic barriers. We see enabling benevolence in the Internet (act of sharing resources) as a potential solution to solve the problem of digital exclusion caused due to socio-economic barriers. In this paper, we propose LCD-Net: Lowest Cost Denominator Networking, a new Internet paradigm that architects multi-layer resource pooling Internet technologies to support benevolence in the Internet. LCD-Net proposes to bring together several existing resource pooling Internet technologies to ensure that users and network operators who share their resources are not affected and at the same time are incentivised for sharing. The paper also emphasizes the need to identify and extend the stakeholder value chain to ensure such benevolent access to the Internet is sustainable.",

Because it takes time to detect and react to faults, these conditions can last long---even tens of seconds. We propose forward fault correction (FFC), a proactive approach to handling faults. FFC spreads network traffic such that freedom from congestion is guaranteed under arbitrary combinations of up to k faults. We show how FFC can be practically realized by compactly encoding the constraints that arise from this large number of possible faults and solving them efficiently using sorting networks. Experiments with data from real networks show that, with negligible loss in overall network throughput, FFC can reduce data loss by a factor of 7--130 in well-provisioned networks, and reduce the loss of high-priority traffic to almost zero in well-utilized networks.",

As an initial case study, we examine network congestion in bufferless NoCs. We show that congestion manifests itself differently in a NoC than in traditional networks. Network congestion reduces system throughput in congested workloads for smaller NoCs (16 and 64 nodes), and limits the scalability of larger bufferless NoCs (256 to 4096 nodes) even when traffic has locality (e.g., when an application's required data is mapped nearby to its core in the network). We propose a new source throttling-based congestion control mechanism with application-level awareness that reduces network congestion to improve system performance. Our mechanism improves system performance by up to 28% (15% on average in congested workloads) in smaller NoCs, achieves linear throughput scaling in NoCs up to 4096 cores (attaining similar performance scalability to a NoC with large buffers), and reduces power consumption by up to 20%. Thus, we show an effective application of a network-level concept, congestion control, to a class of networks -- bufferless on-chip networks -- that has not been studied before by the networking community.",

Routing must route packets between any source and destination in the network without incurring unmanageable routing overhead that grows quickly with increasing network size and dynamics. Here we present an addressing scheme and a coupled network topology design scheme that guarantee essentially optimal routing scalability. The FIB sizes are as small as they can be, equal to the number of adjacencies a node has, while the routing control overhead is minimized as nearly zero routing control messages are exchanged even upon catastrophic failures in the network. The key new ingredient is the addressing scheme, which is purely local, based only on geographic coordinates of nodes and a centrality measure, and does not require any sophisticated non-local computations or global network topology knowledge for network embedding. The price paid for these benefits is that network topology cannot be arbitrary but should follow a specific design, resulting in Internet-like topologies. The proposed schemes can be most easily deployed in overlay networks, and also in other network deployments, where geolocation information is available, and where network topology can grow following the design specifications.",

    "abstract": "Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) are core components of the Internet infrastructure where Internet Service Providers (ISPs) meet and exchange traffic. During the last few years, the number and size of IXPs have increased rapidly, driving the flattening and shortening of Internet paths. However, understanding the present status of the IXP ecosystem and its potential role in shaping the future Internet requires rigorous data about IXPs, their presence, status, participants, etc. In this work, we do the first cross-comparison of three well-known publicly available IXP databases, namely of PeeringDB, Euro-IX, and PCH. A key challenge we address is linking IXP identifiers across databases maintained by different organizations. We find different AS-centric versus IXP-centric views provided by the databases as a result of their data collection approaches. In addition, we highlight differences and similarities w.r.t. IXP participants, geographical coverage, and co-location facilities. As a side-product of our linkage heuristics, we make publicly available the union of the three databases, which includes 40.2% more IXPs and 66.3% more IXP participants than the commonly-used PeeringDB. We also publish our analysis code to foster reproducibility of our experiments and shed preliminary insights into the accuracy of the union dataset.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen major innovations in cross-layer wireless designs. Despite demonstrating significant throughput gains, hardly any of these technologies have made it into real networks. Deploying cross-layer innovations requires adoption from Wi-Fi chip manufacturers. Yet, manufacturers hesitate to undertake major investments without a better understanding of how these designs interact with real networks and applications. This paper presents the first step towards breaking this stalemate, by enabling the adoption of cross-layer designs in today's networks with commodity Wi-Fi cards and actual applications. We present OpenRF, a cross-layer architecture for managing MIMO signal processing. OpenRF enables access points on the same channel to cancel their interference at each other's clients, while beamforming their signal to their own clients. OpenRF is self-configuring, so that network administrators need not understand MIMO or physical layer techniques. We patch the iwlwifi driver to support OpenRF on off-the-shelf Intel cards. We deploy OpenRF on a 20-node network, showing how it manages the complex interaction of cross-layer design with a real network stack, TCP, bursty traffic, and real applications. Our results demonstrate an average gain of 1.6x for TCP traffic and a significant reduction in response time for real-time applications, like remote desktop.",

    "abstract": "A significant fraction of Internet traffic is now encrypted and HTTPS will likely be the default in HTTP/2. However, Transport Layer Security (TLS), the standard protocol for encryption in the Internet, assumes that all functionality resides at the endpoints, making it impossible to use in-network services that optimize network resource usage, improve user experience, and protect clients and servers from security threats. Re-introducing in-network functionality into TLS sessions today is done through hacks, often weakening overall security. In this paper we introduce multi-context TLS (mcTLS), which extends TLS to support middleboxes. mcTLS breaks the current \"all-or-nothing\" security model by allowing endpoints and content providers to explicitly introduce middleboxes in secure end-to-end sessions while controlling which parts of the data they can read or write. We evaluate a prototype mcTLS implementation in both controlled and \"live\" experiments, showing that its benefits come at the cost of minimal overhead. More importantly, we show that mcTLS can be incrementally deployed and requires only small changes to client, server, and middlebox software.",

    "abstract": "Free Basics is a Facebook initiative to provide zero-rated web services in developing countries. The program has grown rapidly to 60+ countries in the past two years. But it has also seen strong opposition from Internet activists and has been banned in some countries like India. Facebook highlights the societal benefits of providing low-income populations with free Internet access, while detractors point to concerns about privacy and network neutrality. In this paper, we provide the first independent analysis of such claims regarding the Free Basics service, using both the perspective of a Free Basics service provider and of web clients visiting the service via cellular phones providing access to Free Basics in Pakistan and South Africa. Specifically, with control of both endpoints, we not only provide a more detailed view of how the Free Basics service is architected, but also can isolate the likely causes of network performance impairments. Our analysis reveals that Free Basics services experience 4 to 12 times worse network performance than their paid counterparts. We isolate the root causes using factors such as network path inflation and throttling policies by Facebook and telecom service providers. The Free Basics service and its restrictions are designed with assumptions about users' device capabilities (e.g., lack of JavaScript support). To evaluate such assumptions, we infer the types of mobile devices that generated 47K unique visitors to our Free Basics services between Sep 2016 and Jan 2017. We find that there are large numbers of requests from constrained WAP browsers, but also large fractions of high-capability mobile phones that send Free Basics requests. We discuss the implications of our observations, with the hope to aid more informed debates on such telecom policies.",

    "abstract": "Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks continue to pose a serious threat to the availability of Internet services. The Domain Name System (DNS) is part of the core of the Internet and a crucial factor in the successful delivery of Internet services. Because of the importance of DNS, specialist service providers have sprung up in the market, that provide managed DNS services. One of their key selling points is that they protect DNS for a domain against DDoS attacks. But what if such a service becomes the target of a DDoS attack, and that attack succeeds? In this paper we analyse two such events, an attack on NS1 in May 2016, and an attack on Dyn in October 2016. We do this by analysing the change in the behaviour of the service's customers. For our analysis we leverage data from the OpenINTEL active DNS measurement system, which covers large parts of the global DNS over time. Our results show an almost immediate and statistically significant change in the behaviour of domains that use NS1 or Dyn as a DNS service provider. We observe a decline in the number of domains that exclusively use NS1 or Dyn as a managed DNS service provider, and see a shift toward risk spreading by using multiple providers. While a large managed DNS provider may be better equipped to protect against attacks, these two case studies show they are not impervious to them. This calls into question the wisdom of using a single provider for managed DNS. Our results show that spreading risk by using multiple providers is an effective countermeasure, albeit probably at a higher cost.",

We claimed that for long-lived TCP flows, it could be reduced by √ N , where N is the number of active flows, potentially reducing the required buffers by well over 90% in Internet backbone routers. One might reasonably expect that such a result, which supports cheaper routers with smaller buffers, would be embraced by the ISP community.

    "abstract": "Telecommunication operators are massively moving their network functions in small data centers at the edge of the network, which are becoming increasingly common. However, the high performance provided by commonly used technologies for data plane processing such as DPDK, based on kernel-bypass primitives, comes at the cost of rigid resource partitioning. This is unsuitable for edge data centers, in which efficiency demands both general-purpose applications and data-plane telco workloads to be executed on the same (shared) physical machines. In this respect, eBPF/XDP looks a more appealing solution, thanks to its capability to process packets in the kernel, achieving a higher level of integration with non-data plane applications albeit with lower performance than DPDK. In this paper we leverage the recent introduction of AF_XDP, an XDP-based technology that allows to efficiently steer packets in user space, to provide a thorough comparison of user space vs in-kernel packet processing in typical scenarios of a data center at the edge of the network. Our results provide useful insights on how to select and combine these technologies in order to improve overall throughput and optimize resource usage.",

    "abstract": "To mitigate IPv4 exhaustion, IPv6 provides expanded address space, and NAT allows a single public IPv4 address to suffice for many devices assigned private IPv4 address space. Even though NAT has greatly extended the shelf-life of IPv4, some networks need more private IPv4 space than what is officially allocated by IANA due to their size and/or network management practices. Some of these networks resort to using squat space , a term the network operations community uses for large public IPv4 address blocks allocated to organizations but historically never announced to the Internet. While squatting of IP addresses is an open secret, it introduces ethical, legal, and technical problems. In this work we examine billions of traceroutes to identify thousands of organizations squatting. We examine how they are using it and what happened when the US Department of Defense suddenly started announcing what had traditionally been squat space. In addition to shining light on a dirty secret of operational practices, our paper shows that squatting distorts common Internet measurement methodologies, which we argue have to be re-examined to account for squat space.",

    "abstract": "Streaming audio and video applications are becoming increasingly popular on the Internet, and the lack of effective congestion control in such applications is now a cause for significant concern. The problem is one of adapting the compression without requiring video-servers to re-encode the data, and fitting the resulting stream into the rapidly varying available bandwidth. At the same time, rapid fluctuations in quality will be disturbing to the users and should be avoided.In this paper we present a mechanism for using layered video in the context of unicast congestion control. This quality adaptation mechanism adds and drops layers of the video stream to perform long-term coarse-grain adaptation, while using a TCP-friendly congestion control mechanism to react to congestion on very short timescales. The mismatches between the two timescales are absorbed using buffering at the receiver. We present an efficient-scheme for the distribution of buffering among the active layers. Our scheme allows the server to trade short-term improvement for long-term smoothing of quality. We discuss the issues involved in implementing and tuning such a mechanism, and present our simulation results.",

We illustrate how variability of both user aspects and network environments (i) causes self-similar scaling behavior over large time scales, (ii) determines a more or less pronounced change in scaling behavior around a specific time scale, and (iii) sets the stage for the emergence of surprisingly rich scaling dynamics over small time scales; i.e., multifractal scaling. Moreover, our scaling analyses indicate whether or not open-loop controls such as UDP or closed-loop controls such as TCP impact the local or small-scale behavior of the traffic and how they contribute to the observed multifractal nature of measured Internet traffic. In fact, our findings suggest an initial physical explanation for why measured Internet traffic over small time scales is highly complex and suggest novel ways for detecting and identifying, for example, performance bottlenecks.This paper focuses on the qualitative aspects of a wavelet-based scaling analysis rather than on the quantitative use for which it was originally designed. We demonstrate how the presented techniques can be used for analyzing a wide range of different kinds of network-related measurements in ways that were not previously feasible. We show that scaling analysis has the ability to extract relevant information about the time-scale dynamics of Internet traffic, thereby, we hope, making these techniques available to a larger segment of the networking research community.",

As Internet link speeds higher, we seek a scalable solution whose speed scales with memory speeds while allowing large prefix databases. In this paper we show that providing such a solution requires careful attention to memory allocation and pipelining . This is because fast lookups require on-chip or off-chip SRAM which is limited by either expense or manufacturing process. We show that doing so while providing guarantees on the number of prefixes supported requires new algorithms and the breaking down of traditional abstraction boundaries between hardware and software. We introduce new problem-specific memory allocators that have provable memory utilization guarantees that can reach 100%; this is contrast to all standard allocators that can only guarantee 20% utilization when the requests can come in the range [1 ... 32]. An optimal version of our algorithm requires a new (but feasible) SRAM memory design that allows shifted access in addition to normal word access. Our techniques generalize to other IP lookup schemes and to other state lookups besides prefix lookup.",

Internet routing instability, or the rapid fluctuation of network reachability information, is an important problem currently facing the Internet engineering community. High levels of network instability can lead to packet loss, increased network latency and time to convergence. At the extreme, high levels of routing instability have lead to the loss of internal connectivity in wide-area, national networks. In this paper, we describe several unexpected trends in routing instability, and examine a number of anomalies and pathologies observed in the exchange of inter-domain routing information. The analysis in this paper is based on data collected from BGP routing messages generated by border routers at five of the Internet core's public exchange points during a nine month period. We show that the volume of these routing updates is several orders of magnitude more than expected and that the majority of this routing information is redundant, or pathological. Furthermore, our analysis reveals several unexpected trends and ill-behaved systematic properties in Internet routing. We finally posit a number of explanations for these anomalies and evaluate their potential impact on the Internet infrastructure.",

This family is called link vector algorithms (LVA), and is based on the selective diffusion of link-state information based on the distributed computation of preferred paths, rather than on the flooding of complete link-state information based on the distributed computation of preferred paths, rather than on the flooding of complete link-state information to all routers. According to LVA, each router maintains a subset of the topology that corresponds to the links used by its neighbor routers in their preferred paths to known destinations. Based on that subset of topology information, the router derives its own preferred paths and communicates the corresponding link-state information to its neighbors. An update message contains a vector of updates; each such update specifies a link and its parameters. LVAs can be used for different types of routing. The correctness of LVA is verified for arbitrary types of routing when correct and deterministic algorithms are used to select preferred paths at each router. LVA is shown to have smaller complexity than link-state and distance-vector algorithms, and to have better average performance than the ideal topology-broadcast algorithm and the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm.",

A simple test setup is used to verify HTTP/1.1's design and understand HTTP/1.1 implementation strategies. We present TCP and real time performance data between the libwww robot [27] and both the W3C's Jigsaw [28] and Apache [29] HTTP servers using HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1 with persistent connections, HTTP/1.1 with pipelined requests, and HTTP/1.1 with pipelined requests and deflate data compression [22]. We also investigate whether the TCP Nagle algorithm has an effect on HTTP/1.1 performance. While somewhat artificial and possibly overstating the benefits of HTTP/1.1, we believe the tests and results approximate some common behavior seen in browsers. The results confirm that HTTP/1.1 is meeting its major design goals. Our experience has been that implementation details are very important to achieve all of the benefits of HTTP/1.1.For all our tests, a pipelined HTTP/1.1 implementation outperformed HTTP/1.0, even when the HTTP/1.0 implementation used multiple connections in parallel, under all network environments tested. The savings were at least a factor of two, and sometimes as much as a factor of ten, in terms of packets transmitted. Elapsed time improvement is less dramatic, and strongly depends on your network connection.Some data is presented showing further savings possible by changes in Web content, specifically by the use of CSS style sheets [10], and the more compact PNG [20] image representation, both recent recommendations of W3C. Time did not allow full end to end data collection on these cases. The results show that HTTP/1.1 and changes in Web content will have dramatic results in Internet and Web performance as HTTP/1.1 and related technologies deploy over the near future. Universal use of style sheets, even without deployment of HTTP/1.1, would cause a very significant reduction in network traffic.This paper does not investigate further performance and network savings enabled by the improved caching facilities provided by the HTTP/1.1 protocol, or by sophisticated use of range requests.",

    "abstract": "Most of the traffic in today's Internet is controlled by the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Hence, the performance of TCP has a significant impact on the performance of the overall Internet. TCP is a complex protocol with many user-configurable parameters and a range of different implementations. In addition, research continues to produce new developments in congestion control mechanisms and TCP options, and it is useful to trace the deployment of these new mechanisms in the Internet. As a final concern, the stability and fairness of the current Internet relies on the voluntary use of congestion control mechanisms by end hosts. Therefore it is important to test TCP implementations for conformant end-to-end congestion control. Since web traffic forms the majority of the TCP traffic, TCP implementations in today's web servers are of particular interest. We have developed a tool called TCP Behavior Inference Tool (TBIT) to characterize the TCP behavior of a remote web server. In this paper, we describe TBIT, and present results about the TCP behaviors of major web servers, obtained using this tool. We also describe the use of TBIT to detect bugs and non-compliance in TCP implementations deployed in public web servers.",

We demonstrate that, for all the applications and traces considered, run-time adaptation can reduce energy consumption by 70--80% and processor provisioning level by 40--50%. The adaptation benefits are maximized if processor allocations can be adapted at fine time-scales and if the total available processing power can be allocated to packet types in small granularities. We show that, of these two factors, allocating processing power to packet types is small granularity is more important---if the allocation granularity is large, then even a very fine adaptation time-scale yields meager benefits.",

The basic idea in SLoPS is that the one-way delays of a periodic packet stream show an increasing trend when the stream's rate is higher than the avail-bw. We implemented SLoPS in a tool called pathload. The accuracy of the tool has been evaluated with both simulations and experiments over real-world Internet paths. Pathload is non-intrusive, meaning that it does not cause significant increases in the network utilization, delays, or losses. We used pathload to evaluate the variability ('dynamics') of the avail-bw in some paths that cross USA and Europe. The avail-bw becomes significantly more variable in heavily utilized paths, as well as in paths with limited capacity (probably due to a lower degree of statistical multiplexing). We finally examine the relation between avail-bw and TCP throughput. A persistent TCP connection can be used to roughly measure the avail-bw in a path, but TCP saturates the path, and increases significantly the path delays and jitter.",

In the network setting, we show that networks belonging to a broad class of GPS assignments, the so-called Consistent Relative Session Treatment (CRST) GPS assignments, are stable in a stochastic sense.

However, existing work has concentrated on extending single-domain techniques to wide-area networks, rather than providing mechanisms to realize inter-domain multicast on a global scale in the Internet.We describe an architecture for inter-domain multicast routing that consists of two complementary protocols. The Multicast Address-Set Claim (MASC) protocol forms the basis for a hierarchical address allocation architecture. It dynamically allocates to domains multicast address ranges from which groups initiated in the domain get their multicast addresses. The Border-Gateway Multicast Protocol (BGMP), run by the border routers of a domain, constructs inter-domain bidirectional shared trees, while allowing any existing multicast routing protocol to be used within individual domains. The resulting shared tree for a group is rooted at the domain whose address range covers the group's address; this domain is typically the group initiator's domain. We demonstrate the feasibility and performance of these complementary protocols through simulation.This architecture, together with existing protocols operating within each domain, is intended as a framework in which to solve the problems facing the current multicast addressing and routing infrastructure.",

Understanding the topology of such large scale networks is essential to the procurement of good architectural design decisions, particularly with respect to address allocation and distribution schemes.A number of techniques for IPv4 network topology already exist. Of these ICMP-based probing has shown to be most useful in determining router-level topologies of public networks. However, many of these techniques cannot be readily applied to IPv6 because of changes in the addressing scheme and ICMP behaviour. Furthermore, increases in the proliferation of equal-cost multi-path routing, and other forms of transient routing, indicate that traditional traceroute-based topology discovery approaches are becoming less effective in the Internet.This paper presents Atlas, a system that faciliates the automated capture of IPv6 network topology information from a single probing host. It describes the Atlas infrastructure and its data collection processes and discusses IPv6 network phenomena that must to be taken into account by the probing scheme. We also present some initial results from our probing of the 6Bone, currently the largest public IPv6 network. The results illustrate the effectiveness of the probing algorithm and also identify some trends in prefix allocation and routing policy.",

For example, a traffic workload model can either completely ignore the empirically observed high variability at the TCP connection level (i.e., assume \"infinite sources\") or explicitly account for it with the help of heavy-tailed distributions for TCP connection sizes or durations. Based on detailed ns-2 simulation results, we illustrate that these two commonly-used traffic workload scenarios can give rise to fundamentally different buffer dynamics in IP routers. Using a second set of ns-2 simulation experiments, we also illustrate a qualitatively very different queueing behavior within IP routers depending on whether the traffic arriving at the router is assumed to be endogenous in nature (i.e., a result of the \"closed loop\" nature of the feedback-based congestion control algorithm of TCP) or exogenously determined (i.e., given by some conventional traffic model --- a fixed \"open loop\" description of the traffic as seen by the router).",

The Domain Name System (DNS) used on the Internet, however, is slow, vulnerable to denial of service attacks, and does not support fast updates. These problems stem fundamentally from the structure of the legacy DNS.This paper describes the design and implementation of the Cooperative Domain Name System (CoDoNS), a novel name service, which provides high lookup performance through proactive caching, resilience to denial of service attacks through automatic load-balancing, and fast propagation of updates. CoDoNS derives its scalability, decentralization, self-organization, and failure resilience from peer-to-peer overlays, while it achieves high performance using the Beehive replication framework. Cryptographic delegation, instead of host-based physical delegation, limits potential malfeasance by namespace operators and creates a competitive market for namespace management. Backwards compatibility with existing protocols and wire formats enables CoDoNS to serve as a backup for legacy DNS, as well as a complete replacement. Performance measurements from a real-life deployment of the system in PlanetLab shows that CoDoNS provides fast lookups, automatically reconfigures around faults without manual involvement and thwarts distributed denial of service attacks by promptly redistributing load across nodes.",

The origin of such a routing instability is deduced by examining and correlating BGP updates for many prefixes gathered at many observation points. Although interpreting BGP updates can be perplexing, we find that we can pinpoint the origin to either a single AS or a session between two ASes in most cases. We verify our methodology in two phases. First, we perform simulations on an AS topology derived from actual BGP updates using routing policies that are compatible with inferred peering/customer/provider relationships. In these simulations, in which network and router behavior are \"ideal\", we inject inter-AS link failures and demonstrate that our methodology can effectively identify most origins of instability. We then develop several heuristics to cope with the limitations of the actual BGP update propagation process and monitoring infrastructure, and apply our methodology and evaluation techniques to actual BGP updates gathered at hundreds of observation points. This approach of relying on data from BGP simulations as well as from measurements enables us to evaluate the inference quality achieved by our approach under ideal situations and how it is correlated with the actual quality and the number of observation points.",

The growth of P2P applications presents appealing new uses for IP anycast. Unfortunately, IP anycast suffers from serious problems: it is very hard to deploy globally, it scales poorly by the number of anycast groups, and it lacks important features like load-balancing. As a result, its use is limited to a few critical infrastructure services such as DNS root servers. The primary contribution of this paper is a new IP anycast architecture, PIAS, that overcomes these problems while largely maintaining the strengths of IP anycast. PIAS makes use of a proxy overlay that advertises IP anycast addresses on behalf of group members and tunnels anycast packets to those members. The paper presents a detailed design of PIAS and evaluates its scalability and efficiency through simulation. We also present preliminary measurement results on anycasted DNS root servers that suggest that IP anycast provides good affinity. Finally, we describe how PIAS supports two important P2P and overlay applications.",

    "abstract": "Most high performance routers today use combined input and output queueing (CIOQ). The CIOQ router is also frequently used as an abstract model for routers: at one extreme is input queueing, at the other extreme is output queueing, and in-between there is a continuum of performance as the speedup is increased from 1 to N (where N is the number of linecards). The model includes architectures in which a switch fabric is sandwiched between two stages of buffering. There is a rich and growing theory for CIOQ routers, including algorithms, throughput results and conditions under which delays can be guaranteed. But there is a broad class of architectures that are not captured by the CIOQ model, including routers with centralized shared memory, and load-balanced routers. In this paper we propose an abstract model called Single-Buffered (SB) routers that includes these architectures. We describe a method called Constraint Sets to analyze a number of SB router architectures. The model helped identify previously unstudied architectures, in particular the Distributed Shared Memory router. Although commercially deployed, its performance is not widely known. We find conditions under which it can emulate an ideal shared memory router, and believe it to be a promising architecture. Questions remain about its complexity, but we find that the memory bandwidth, and potentially the power consumption of the router is lower than for a CIOQ router.",

This paper explores one important reality that surrounds the Internet today: different stakeholders that are part of the Internet milieu have interests that may be adverse to each other, and these parties each vie to favor their particular interests. We call this process \"the tussle\". Our position is that accommodating this tussle is crucial to the evolution of the network's technical architecture. We discuss some examples of tussle, and offer some technical design principles that take it into account.",

To serve as a basic building block, a SDIMS should have four properties: scalability to many nodes and attributes, flexibility to accommodate a broad range of applications, administrative isolation for security and availability, and robustness to node and network failures. We design, implement and evaluate a SDIMS that (1) leverages Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) to create scalable aggregation trees, (2) provides flexibility through a simple API that lets applications control propagation of reads and writes, (3) provides administrative isolation through simple extensions to current DHT algorithms, and (4) achieves robustness to node and network reconfigurations through lazy reaggregation, on-demand reaggregation, and tunable spatial replication. Through extensive simulations and micro-benchmark experiments, we observe that our system is an order of magnitude more scalable than existing approaches, achieves isolation properties at the cost of modestly increased read latency in comparison to flat DHTs, and gracefully handles failures.",

We also compared CapProbe with two previous well-known techniques, pathchar and pathrate.

The inputs from both interfaces are merged into a single set I and the outputs from both interfaces are merged into a single set O. The implementation is assumed to be a black box. The key idea in this procedure is to tour all states and state transitions and to check a unique signature for each state, called the Unique Input/Output (UIO) sequence.

    "abstract": "This work focuses on capacity overprovisioning (CO) as an alternative to admission control (AC) to implement quality of service (QoS) in packet-switched communication networks. CO prevents potential overload while AC protects the QoS of the traffic during overload situations. Overload may be caused, e. g., by uctuations of the traffic rate on a link due to its normal stochastic behavior (a), by traffic shifts within the network due to popular contents (b), or by redirected traffic due to network failures (c). Capacity dimensioning methods for CO need to take into account all potential sources of overload while AC can block excess traffic caused by (a) and (b) if the capacity does not suffice. The contributions of this paper are (1) the presentation of a capacity dimensioning method for networks with resilience requirements and changing traffic matrices, (2) the investigation of the impact of the mentioned sources of overload (a-c) on the required capacity for CO in networks with and without resilience requirements, and (3) a comparison of this equired capacity with the one for AC. Our results show that in the presence of strong traffic shifts CO requires more capacity than AC. However, if resilience against network failures is required, both CO and AC need additional backup capacity for the redirected traffic. In this case, CO can use the backup capacity to absorb other types of overload. As a consequence, CO and AC have similar bandwidth requirements. These findings are robust against the network size.",

This has led to BGP being pressed into service as an IGP, despite its lack of convergence guarantees. The development, standardization, and deployment of routing protocols, or even minor changes to existing protocols, are very difficult tasks. We present an approach called Metarouting that defines routing protocols using a high-level and declarative language. Once an interpreter for a metarouting language is implemented on a router, a network operator would have the freedom to implement and use any routing protocol definable in the language. We enforce a clean separation of protocol mechanisms (link-state, path-vector, adjacency maintenance, and so on) from routing policy (how routes are described and compared). The Routing Algebra framework of Sobrinho [25] is used as the theoretical basis for routing policy languages. We define the Routing Algebra Meta-Language (RAML) that allows for the construction of a large family of routing algebras and has the key property that correctness conditions --- guarantees of convergence with respect to the chosen mechanisms --- can be derived automatically for each expression defining a new routing algebra.",

In principle any network that has been engineered without taking its presence into account might experience troubles during periods of massive exposure to unwanted traffic, e.g. during large-scale infections. A concrete example was provided by the spreading of Code-Red-II in 2001, which caused several routers crashes worldwide. Similar events might take place in 3G networks as well, with further potential complications arising from their high functional complexity and the scarcity of radio resources. For example, under certain hypothetical network con guration settings unwanted traffic, and specifically scanning traffic from infected Mobile Stations, can cause large-scale wastage of logical resources, and in extreme cases even starvation. Unwanted traffic is present nowdays also in GPRS/UMTS, mainly due to the widespread use of 3G connect cards for laptops. We urge the research community and network operators to consider the issue of 3G robustness to unwanted traffic as a prominent research area.",

A major issue is that we need to find ways to share full-payload data sets, or, if that does not prove to be feasible, at least anonymized traces with complete application layer meta-data. A relatively minor issue refers to finding an agreement on which metric should be used to evaluate the performance of the classifiers. In this note we argue that these are two important issues that the community should address, and sketch a few solutions to foster the discussion on these topics.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we analyze protocols for transmitting large amounts of data over a local area network. The data transfers analyzed in this paper are different from most other forms of large-scale data transfer protocols for three reasons: (1) The definition of the protocol requires the recipient to have sufficient buffers available to receive the data before the transfer takes place; (2) We assume that the source and the destination machine are more or less matched in speed; (3) The protocol is implemented at the network interrupt level and therefore not slowed down by process scheduling delays. We consider three classes of protocols: stop-and-wait, sliding window and blast protocols. We show that the expected time of blast and sliding window protocols is significantly lower than the expected time for the stop-and-wait protocol, with blast outperforming sliding window by some small amount. Although the network error rate is sufficiently low for blast with full retransmission on error to be acceptable, the frequency of errors in the network interfaces makes it desirable to use a more sophisticated retransmission protocol. A go-back-n strategy is shown to be only marginally inferior to selective retransmission and is, given its simplicity, the retransmission strategy of choice. Our results are based on measurements collected on SUN workstations connected to a 10 megabit Ethernet network using 3-Com interfaces. The derivation of the elapsed time in terms of the network packet error rate is based on the assumption of statistically independent errors.",

We have examined traces of Auckland traffic for 2000, 2003 and 2006, and analyzed their one-way and two-way flows. We observed several behaviors and the changes in flow sizes and their lifetimes over time. In our traces, we observe that one-way flows are mostly malicious, re-transmissions, and some are long-lived. Two-way flows are mostly normal end-to-end transmissions with their lifetimes/RTTs decreasing, their sizes increasing, and many short-lived flows mostly depict errors in TCP. Also, we observe similarity between one-way and two-way flow sizes for their lifetimes.",

    "abstract": "The user experience for networked applications is becoming a key benchmark for customers and network providers. Perceived user experience is largely determined by the frequency, duration and severity of network events that impact a service. While today's networks implement sophisticated infrastructure that issues alarms for most failures, there remains a class of silent outages (e.g., caused by configuration errors) that are not detected. Further, existing alarms provide little information to help operators understand the impact of network events on services. Attempts to address this through infrastructure that monitors end-to-end performance for customers have been hampered by the cost of deployment and by the volume of data generated by these solutions. We present an alternative approach that pushes monitoring to applications on end systems and uses their collective view to detect network events and their impact on services - an approach we call Crowdsourcing Event Monitoring (CEM). This paper presents a general framework for CEM systems and demonstrates its effectiveness for a P2P application using a large dataset gathered from BitTorrent users and confirmed network events from two ISPs. We discuss how we designed and deployed a prototype CEM implementation as an extension to BitTorrent. This system performs online service-level network event detection through passive monitoring and correlation of performance in end-users' applications.",

    "abstract": "Although there is an increasing trend for attacks against popular Web browsers, only little is known about the actual patch level of daily used Web browsers on a global scale. We conjecture that users in large part do not actually patch their Web browsers based on recommendations, perceived threats, or any security warnings. Based on HTTP useragent header information stored in anonymized logs from Google's web servers, we measured the patch dynamics of about 75% of the world's Internet users for over a year. Our focus was on the Web browsers Firefox and Opera. We found that the patch level achieved is mainly determined by the ergonomics and default settings of built-in auto-update mechanisms. Firefox' auto-update is very effective: most users installed a new version within three days. However, the maximum share of the latest, most secure version never exceeded 80% for Firefox users and 46% for Opera users at any day in 2007. This makes about 50 million Firefox users with outdated browsers an easy target for attacks. Our study is the result of the first global scale measurement of the patch dynamics of a popular browser.",

    "abstract": "In response to high-profile Internet outages, BGP security variants have been proposed to prevent the propagation of bogus routing information. To inform discussions of which variant should be deployed in the Internet, we quantify the ability of the main protocols (origin authentication, soBGP, S-BGP, and data-plane verification) to blunt traffic-attraction attacks; i.e., an attacker that deliberately attracts traffic to drop, tamper, or eavesdrop on packets. Intuition suggests that an attacker can maximize the traffic he attracts by widely announcing a short path that is not flagged as bogus by the secure protocol. Through simulations on an empirically-determined AS-level topology, we show that this strategy is surprisingly effective, even when the network uses an advanced security solution like S-BGP or data-plane verification. Worse yet, we show that these results underestimate the severity of attacks. We prove that finding the most damaging strategy is NP-hard, and show how counterintuitive strategies, like announcing longer paths, announcing to fewer neighbors, or triggering BGP loop-detection, can be used to attract even more traffic than the strategy above. These counterintuitive examples are not merely hypothetical; we searched the empirical AS topology to identify specific ASes that can launch them. Finally, we find that a clever export policy can often attract almost as much traffic as a bogus path announcement. Thus, our work implies that mechanisms that police export policies (e.g., defensive filtering) are crucial, even if S-BGP is fully deployed.",

    "abstract": "IPTV is increasingly being deployed and offered as a commercial service to residential broadband customers. Compared with traditional ISP networks, an IPTV distribution network (i) typically adopts a hierarchical instead of mesh-like structure, (ii) imposes more stringent requirements on both reliability and performance, (iii) has different distribution protocols (which make heavy use of IP multicast) and traffic patterns, and (iv) faces more serious scalability challenges in managing millions of network elements. These unique characteristics impose tremendous challenges in the effective management of IPTV network and service. In this paper, we focus on characterizing and troubleshooting performance issues in one of the largest IPTV networks in North America. We collect a large amount of measurement data from a wide range of sources, including device usage and error logs, user activity logs, video quality alarms, and customer trouble tickets. We develop a novel diagnosis tool called Giza that is specifically tailored to the enormous scale and hierarchical structure of the IPTV network. Giza applies multi-resolution data analysis to quickly detect and localize regions in the IPTV distribution hierarchy that are experiencing serious performance problems. Giza then uses several statistical data mining techniques to troubleshoot the identified problems and diagnose their root causes. Validation against operational experiences demonstrates the effectiveness of Giza in detecting important performance issues and identifying interesting dependencies. The methodology and algorithms in Giza promise to be of great use in IPTV network operations.",

Much attention has focused on virtualizing the network control plane, but, ultimately, a limiting factor in the deployment of these virtual networks is data-plane performance: Virtual networks must ultimately forward packets at rates that are comparable to native, hardware-based approaches. Aside from proprietary solutions from vendors, hardware support for virtualized data planes is limited. The advent of open, programmable network hardware promises flexibility, speed, and resource isolation, but, unfortunately, hardware does not naturally lend itself to virtualization. We leverage emerging trends in programmable hardware to design a flexible, hardware-based data plane for virtual networks. We present the design, implementation, and preliminary evaluation of this hardware-based data plane and show how the proposed design can support many virtual networks without compromising performance or isolation.",

We describe Trinocular, an outage detection system that uses active probing to understand reliability of edge networks. Trinocular is principled: deriving a simple model of the Internet that captures the information pertinent to outages, and populating that model through long-term data, and learning current network state through ICMP probes. It is parsimonious, using Bayesian inference to determine how many probes are needed. On average, each Trinocular instance sends fewer than 20 probes per hour to each /24 network block under study, increasing Internet \"background radiation\" by less than 0.7%. Trinocular is also predictable and precise: we provide known precision in outage timing and duration. Probing in rounds of 11 minutes, we detect 100% of outages one round or longer, and estimate outage duration within one-half round. Since we require little traffic, a single machine can track 3.4M /24 IPv4 blocks, all of the Internet currently suitable for analysis. We show that our approach is significantly more accurate than the best current methods, with about one-third fewer false conclusions, and about 30% greater coverage at constant accuracy. We validate our approach using controlled experiments, use Trinocular to analyze two days of Internet outages observed from three sites, and re-analyze three years of existing data to develop trends for the Internet.",

We show how this capability provides a general and clean abstraction to exploit fragmented spectrum in WiFi networks, handle coexistence in dense deployments as well as many other applications. We prototype Picasso, and demonstrate experimentally that a Picasso radio partitioned into four slices, each concurrently operating four standard WiFi OFDM PHY and CSMA MAC stacks, can achieve the same sum throughput as four physically separate radios individually configured to operate on the spectrum fragments.

While ad networks take active measures to block click-spam today, the effectiveness of these measures is largely unknown. Moreover, advertisers and third parties have no way of independently estimating or defending against click-spam. In this paper, we take the first systematic look at click-spam. We propose the first methodology for advertisers to independently measure click-spam rates on their ads. We also develop an automated methodology for ad networks to proactively detect different simultaneous click-spam attacks. We validate both methodologies using data from major ad networks. We then conduct a large-scale measurement study of click-spam across ten major ad networks and four types of ads. In the process, we identify and perform in-depth analysis on seven ongoing click-spam attacks not blocked by major ad networks at the time of this writing.

Instead, we appeal to ISPs' interest in increasing revenue-generating traffic. We propose a strategy that governments and industry groups can use to harness ISPs' local business objectives and drive global S*BGP deployment. We evaluate our deployment strategy using theoretical analysis and large-scale simulations on empirical data.

One splitting is along the dimension of the lookup process, namely finding the prefix length and finding the next hop, and another splitting is along the dimension of prefix length, namely IP lookup on prefixes of length less than or equal to 24 and IP lookup on prefixes of length longer than 24. Second, we propose a suite of algorithms for IP lookup based on our SAIL framework. Third, we implemented our algorithms on four platforms: CPU, FPGA, GPU, and many-core. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our algorithms using real FIBs and real traffic from a major ISP in China. Experimental results show that our SAIL algorithms are several times or even two orders of magnitude faster than well known IP lookup algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Network failures are frequent and disruptive, and can significantly reduce the throughput even in highly connected and regular networks such as datacenters. While many modern networks support some kind of local fast failover to quickly reroute flows encountering link failures to new paths, employing such mechanisms is known to be non-trivial, as conditional failover rules can only depend on local failure information. While over the last years, important insights have been gained on how to design failover schemes providing high resiliency, existing approaches have the shortcoming that the resulting failover routes may be unnecessarily long, i.e., they have a large stretch compared to the original route length. This is a serious drawback, as long routes entail higher latencies and introduce loads, which may cause the rerouted flows to interfere with existing flows and harm throughput. This paper presents the first deterministic local fast failover algorithms providing provable resiliency and failover route lengths, even in the presence of many concurrent failures. We present stretch-optimal failover algorithms for different network topologies, including multi-dimensional grids, hypercubes and Clos networks, as they are frequently deployed in the context of HPC clusters and datacenters. We show that the computed failover routes are optimal in the sense that no failover algorithm can provide shorter paths for a given number of link failures.",

    "abstract": "Prefix hijacking has always been a big concern in the Internet. Some events made it into the international world-news, but most of them remain unreported or even unnoticed. The scale of the problem can only be estimated. The Resource Publication Infrastructure (RPKI) is an effort by the IETF to secure the inter-domain routing system. It includes a formally verifiable way of identifying who owns legitimately which portion of the IP address space. The RPKI has been standardized and prototype implementations are tested by Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Currently the system holds already about 2% of the Internet routing table. Therefore, in theory, it should be easy to detect hijacking of prefixes within that address space. We take an early look at BGP update data and check those updates against the RPKI---in the same way a router would do, once the system goes operational. We find many interesting dynamics, not all can be easily explained as hijacking, but a significant number are likely operational testing or misconfigurations.",

    "abstract": "We consider a system of compute and storage resources geographically distributed over a large number of locations connected via a wide-area network. By distributing the resources, latency to users can be decreased, bandwidth costs reduced and availablility increased. The challenge is to distribute services with varying characteristics among the data centers optimally. Some services are very latency sensitive, others need vast amounts of storage, and yet others are computationally complex but do not require hard deadlines on execution. We propose efficient algorithms for the placement of services to get the maximum benefit from a distributed cloud systems. The algorithms need input on the status of the network, compute resources and data resources, which are matched to application requirements. This demonstration shows how a network-aware cloud can combine all three resource types - computation, storage, and network connectivity - in distributed cloud environments. Our dynamic service placement algorithm monitors the network and data center resources in real-time. Our prototype uses the information gathered to place or migrate services to provide the best user experience for a service.",

    "abstract": "InKeV is a network virtualization platform based on eBPF, an in-kernel execution engine recently upstreamed into linux kernel. InKeV's key contribution is that it enables in-kernel programmability and configuration of virtualized network functions, allowing to create a distributed virtual network across all edges hosting tenant workloads. Despite high performance demands of production environments, existing virtualization solutions have largely static in-kernel components due to the difficulty of developing and maintaining kernel modules and their years-long feature delivery time. The resulting compromise is either in programmability of network functions that rely on the data plane, such as payload processing, or in performance, due to expensive user-/kernel-space context switching. InKeV addresses these concerns: The use of eBPF allows it to dynamically insert programmable network functions into a running kernel, requiring neither to package a custom-kernel nor to hope for acceptance in mainline kernel. Its novel stitching feature allows to flexibly configure complete virtual networks by creating a graph of network functions inside the kernel. Our evaluation reports on the flexibility of InKeV, and in-kernel implementation benefits such as low-latency and impressive flow creation rate.",

    "abstract": "By enhancing the traditional static network (e.g., based on electric switches) with a dynamic topology (e.g., based on reconfigurable optical switches), emerging reconfigurable data centers introduce unprecedented flexibilities in how networks can be optimized toward the workload they serve. However, such hybrid data centers are currently limited by a restrictive routing policy enforcing artificial segregation: each network flow can only use either the static or the flexible topology, but not a combination of the two. This paper explores the algorithmic problem of supporting more general routing policies, which are not limited by segregation. While the potential benefits of non-segregated routing have been demonstrated in recent work, the underlying algorithmic complexity is not well-understood. We present a range of novel results on the algorithmic complexity of non-segregated routing. In particular, we show that in certain specific scenarios, optimal data center topologies with nonsegregated routing policies can be computed in polynomial-time. In many variants of the problem, however, introducing a more flexible routing comes at a price of complexity: we prove several important variants to be NP-hard.",

Poptrie outperforms the state-of-the-art technologies, Tree BitMap, DXR and SAIL, in all of the evaluations using random and real destination queries on 35 routing tables, including the real global tier-1 ISP's full-route routing table. Poptrie peaks between 174 and over 240 Million lookups per second (Mlps) with a single core and tables with 500--800k routes, consistently 4--578% faster than all competing algorithms in all the tests we ran. We provide the comprehensive performance evaluation, remarkably with the CPU cycle analysis. This paper shows the suitability of Poptrie in the future Internet including IPv6, where a larger route table is expected with longer prefixes.",

    "abstract": "WAN bandwidth remains a constrained resource that is economically infeasible to substantially overprovision. Hence, it is important to allocate capacity according to service priority and based on the incremental value of additional allocation. For example, it may be the highest priority for one service to receive 10Gb/s of bandwidth but upon reaching such an allocation, incremental priority may drop sharply favoring allocation to other services. Motivated by the observation that individual flows with fixed priority may not be the ideal basis for bandwidth allocation, we present the design and implementation of Bandwidth Enforcer (BwE), a global, hierarchical bandwidth allocation infrastructure. BwE supports: i) service-level bandwidth allocation following prioritized bandwidth functions where a service can represent an arbitrary collection of flows, ii)independent allocation and delegation policies according to user-defined hierarchy, all accounting for a global view of bandwidth and failure conditions, iii) multi-path forwarding common in traffic-engineered networks, and iv) a central administrative point to override (perhaps faulty) policy during exceptional conditions. BwE has delivered more service efficient bandwidth utilization and simpler management in production for multiple years.",

However, there is significant heterogeneity in switch survival rates with respect to their hardware and software: the switches of one vendor are twice as likely to fail compared to the others. We attribute the majority of switch failures to hardware impairments and unplanned power losses. We find that the in-house switch operating system, SONiC, boosts the survival likelihood of switches in datacenters by 1% by eliminating switch failures caused by software bugs in vendor switch OSes.",

Unfortunately, we find that the privacy of a substantial fraction of end-users is still at risk, despite the efforts by ISPs and electronic vendors to improve end-user security, e.g., by adopting prefix rotation and IPv6 privacy extensions. By analyzing passive data from a large ISP, we find that around 19% of end-users' privacy can be at risk. When we investigate the root causes, we notice that a single device at home that encodes its MAC address into the IPv6 address can be utilized as a tracking identifier for the entire end-user prefix---even if other devices use IPv6 privacy extensions. Our results show that IoT devices contribute the most to this privacy leakage and, to a lesser extent, personal computers and mobile devices. To our surprise, some of the most popular IoT manufacturers have not yet adopted privacy extensions that could otherwise mitigate this privacy risk.

    "abstract": "\"Soft state\" is an often cited yet vague concept in network protocol design in which two or more network entities intercommunicate in a loosely coupled, often anonymous fashion. Researchers often define this concept operationally (if at all) rather than analytically: a source of soft state transmits periodic \"refresh messages\" over a (lossy) communication channel to one or more receivers that maintain a copy of that state, which in turn \"expires\" if the periodic updates cease. Though a number of crucial Internet protocol building blocks are rooted in soft state-based designs --- e.g., RSVP refresh messages, PIM membership updates, various routing protocol updates, RTCP control messages, directory services like SAP, and so forth --- controversy is building as to whether the performance overhead of soft state refresh messages justify their qualitative benefit of enhanced system \"robustness\". We believe that this controversy has risen not from fundamental performance tradeoffs but rather from our lack of a comprehensive understanding of soft state. To better understand these tradeoffs, we propose herein a formal model for soft state communication based on a probabilistic delivery model with relaxed reliability. Using this model, we conduct queueing analysis and simulation to characterize the data consistency and performance tradeoffs under a range of workloads and network loss rates. We then extend our model with feedback and show, through simulation, that adding feedback dramatically improves data consistency (by up to 55%) without increasing network resource consumption. Our model not only provides a foundation for understanding soft state, but also induces a new fundamental transport protocol based on probabilistic delivery. Toward this end, we sketch our design of the \"Soft State Transport Protocol\" (SSTP), which enjoys the robustness of soft state while retaining the performance benefit of hard state protocols like TCP through its judicious use of feedback.",

Besides, in packet cellular networks, the base station typically performs the task of packet scheduling for both downlink and uplink flows in a cell; however a base station has only a limited knowledge of the arrival processes of uplink flows.In this paper, we propose a new model for wireless fair scheduling based on an adaptation of fluid fair queueing to handle location-dependent error bursts. We describe an ideal wireless fair scheduling algorithm which provides a packetized implementation of the fluid model while assuming full knowledge of the current channel conditions. For this algorithm, we derive the worst-case throughput and delay bounds. Finally, we describe a practical wireless scheduling algorithm which approximates the ideal algorithm. Through simulations, we show that the algorithm achieves the desirable properties identified in the wireless fluid fair queueing model.",

In particular, we focus on anomalies that can cause the protocol to diverge, and those that can cause a router's chosen forwarding path to an egress point to be deflected by another router on that path. Deflections can greatly complicate the debugging of routing problems, and in the worst case multiple deflections can combine to form persistent forwarding loops. We define a correct IBGP configuration to be one that is anomaly free for every possible set of routes sent by neighboring autonomous systems.

    "abstract": "Application level multicast schemes have traditionally been evaluated with respect to the efficiency penalties incurred in migrating the multicast functionality from the network layer to the application layer. We argue that the current performance measures, and therefore design strategies, are incomplete as they do not consider transience of peers. The routers in application level multicast systems are participant clients, and not infrastructure units. As such, the assumptions on the behavior of these application routers are significantly different from the infrastructure routing units that traditional research has dealt with, especially in a peer-to-peer setting where peers are multi-use and the management is decentralized. we argue that the transience in peer behavior has implications on end-performance enabled . We outline a design philosophy that seeks to separate policy decisions in handling peer behavior from the end-application at a basic infrastructural peering layer. As a proof of concept, we have implemented a peering layer prototype, which is available for download.",

During the course of its evolution, the Internet has gone from being a simple and small network to one that is run at its core by large service providers constantly battling with bigger and bigger topologies forcing the routing community to invent ways of scaling both interior and exterior routing protocols. Route-reflectors and confederations have turned out to be the weapons of choice in scaling BGP to these large topologies. This paper takes a close look at these two mechanisms and seeks to compare them.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of the World Wide Web has caused serious performance degradation on the Internet. This paper offers an end-to-end approach to improving Web performance by collectively examining the Web components --- clients, proxies, servers, and the network. Our goal is to reduce user-perceived latency and the number of TCP connections, improve cache coherency and cache replacement, and enable prefetching of resources that are likely to be accessed in the near future. In our scheme, server response messages include piggybacked information customized to the requesting proxy. Our enhancement to the existing request-response protocol does not require per-proxy state at a server, and a very small amount of transient per-server state at the proxy, and can be implemented without changes to HTTP 1.1. The server groups related resources into volumes (based on access patterns and the file system's directory structure) and applies a proxy-generated filter (indicating the type of information of interest to the proxy) to tailor the piggyback information. We present efficient data structures for constructing server volumes and applying proxy filters, and a transparent way to perform volume maintenance and piggyback generation at a router along the path between the proxy and the server. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our end-to-end approach by evaluating various volume construction and filtering techniques across a collection of large client and server logs.",

    "abstract": "Conventional implementations of communication middleware (such as CORBA and traditional RPC toolkits) incur considerable over-head when used for performance-sensitive applications over high-speed networks. As gigabit networks become pervasive, inefficient middleware will force programmers to use lower-level mechanisms to achieve the necessary transfer rates. This is a serious problem for mission/life-critical applications (such as satellite surveillance and medical imaging).This paper compares the performance of several widely used communication middleware mechanisms on a high-speed ATM network. The middleware ranged from lower-level mechanisms (such as socket-based C interfaces and C++ wrappers for sockets) to higher-level mechanisms (such as RPC, hand-optimized RPC and two implementations of CORBA - Orbix and ORBeline). These measurements reveal that the lower-level C and C++ implementations outperform the CORBA implementations significantly (the best CORBA throughput for remote transfer was roughly 75 to 80 percent of the best C/C++ throughput for sending scalar data types and only around 33 percent for sending structs containing binary fields), and the hand-optimized RPC code performs slightly better than the CORBA implementations. Our goal in precisely pinpointing the sources of overhead for communication middleware is to develop scalable and flexible CORBA implementations that can deliver gigabit data rates to applications.",

In this paper, we propose a scheme called RAFT (Resource Aggregation for Fault Tolerance) that guarantees recovery in a timely and resource-efficient manner. RAFT is presented in the framework of the Reliable Back-bone (RBone), a virtual network layered on top of an integrated services network. Applications can request fault tolerance against RBone link and node failures. The basic idea of RAFT is to setup every fault tolerant flow along a secondary path that serves as a backup in case the primary path fails. The secondary path resource reservations are aggregated whenever possible to reduce the overhead of providing fault tolerance. We show that the RSVP resource reservation protocol can support RAFT with simple extensions.",

    "abstract": "Useful measurement data is badly needed to help monitor and control large networks. Current approaches to solving measurement problems often assume minimal support from routers and protocols (e.g., active measurement) or place the entire burden on the router to support heavy-weight mechanisms (e.g., NetFlow). In this paper we argue that the research agenda in measurement must change to consider measurement solutions which enlist the cooperation of routers, protocols, and tools. We believe that the need is so urgent that the deployment issues associated with such holistic solutions can be finessed by cooperation between a few key ISPs and a few key router vendors. If this agenda is accepted, there is a rich vein of technical problems, hitherto considered only from an active measurement perspective, for which there can be new and effective orchestrated solutions. We illustrate this thesis using two examples. Our major example is that of measuring traffic matrices using class counters and class sampling (as opposed to the implementation cost of per-prefix counters, or the errors inherent in tomography). We also provide a smaller example of measuring route stability by modifying route computation. Beyond specific techniques, we hope the guidelines in this paper can provide a focus for discussion among researchers, router vendors, protocol designers, and network operators---the stakeholders in the measurement enterprise.",

    "abstract": "Modern TCP implementations include a mechanism, known as the Nagle algorithm, which prevents the unnecessary transmission of a large number of small packets. This algorithm has proved useful in protecting the Internet against excessive packet loads. However, many applications suffer performance problems as a result of the traditional implementation of the Nagle algorithm. An interaction between the Nagle algorithm and TCP's delayed acknowledgement policy can create an especially severe problems, through a temporary “deadlock.” These flaws in the Nagle algorithm have prompted many application implementors to disable it, even in cases where this is neither necessary nor wise. We categorize the applications that should and should not disable the Nagle algorithm, and we show that for some applications that often disable the Nagle algorithm, equivalent performance can be obtained through an improved implementation of the algorithm. We describe five possible modifications, including one novel proposal, and analyze their performance on benchmark tests. We also describe a receiver-side modification that can help in some circumstances.",

We propose a scheme for making hop-by-hop flow control resilient and show that it has advantages over schemes proposed by Kung. We also describe a novel method for sharing the available buffers among the flows on a link; our scheme allows us to potentially reduce the memory requirement (or increase the number of flows that can be supported) by an order of magnitude. Most of the work is described in the context of an ATM network that uses credit based flow control.

    "abstract": "In any IP network, routing protocols provide the intelligence that takes a collection of physical links and transforms them into a network that enables packets to travel from one host to another. Though routing design is arguably the single most important design task for large IP networks, there has been very little systematic investigation into how routing protocols are actually used in production networks to implement the goals of network architects. We have developed a methodology for reverse engineering a coherent global view of a network's routing design from the static analysis of dumps of the local configuration state of each router. Starting with a set of 8,035 configuration files, we have applied this method to 31 production networks. In this paper we present a detailed examination of how routing protocols are used in operational networks. In particular, the results show the conventional model of \"interior\" and \"exterior\" gateway protocols is insufficient to describe the diverse set of mechanisms used by architects, and we provide examples of the more unusual designs and examine their trade-offs. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our methodology, and argue that it opens paths towards new understandings of network behavior and design.",

A framework to study the dispersity schemes is presented. The simulations show that the dispersity schemes, by dividing the connection's traffic among multiple paths in the network, have a beneficent effect on the capacity of the network. Thus, for certain classes of dispersity schemes, we obtain a small improvement in fault tolerance as well as an improvement in the number of connections that the network can support. For other classes of dispersity schemes, greater improvement in service may be purchased at the cost of decrease in capacity. The paper explores the tradeoffs available through exhaustive simulations. We conclude that dispersity routing is a flexible approach to increasing the fault tolerance of realtime connections, which can provide a range of improvements in service with a corresponding range of costs.",

With multicast routing, one is interested in the shortest subtree of the network containing a given set of hosts. This is essentially a Steiner Tree problem in graphs and is known to be NP-complete [Karp]. Traditionally, the multicast routing algorithms proposed for packet switched networks like asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks have been aimed at minimising the total link cost of the Steiner tree [Waxman88], [Jaffe83] and do not take the geographical spreading of the connections into account. A dynamic point-to-multipoint routing algorithm is proposed, which takes into account the concept of geographic spread (also defined) of the connections and its performance is evaluated against the KMB near optimal heuristic algorithm for solving the Steiner tree problem [Kou].",

Last year, over eight percent of the packets and four percent of the bytes that traversed the NSFnet were due to DNS. We estimate that a third of this wide-area DNS traffic was destined to seven root name servers. This paper explores the performance of DNS based on two 24-hour traces of traffic destined to one of these root name servers. It considers the effectiveness of name caching and retransmission timeout calculation, shows how algorithms to increase DNS's resiliency lead to disastrous behavior when servers fail or when certain implementation faults are triggered, explains the paradoxically high fraction of wide-area DNS packets, and evaluates the impact of flaws in various implementations of DNS. It shows that negative caching would improve DNS performance only marginally in an internet of correctly implemented name servers. It concludes by calling for a fundamental change in the way we specify and implement future name servers and distributed applications.",

In this position paper, we question some of the folklore surrounding IP and packet switching.

    "abstract": "Achieving efficient and fair bandwidth allocation while minimizing packet loss in high bandwidth-delay product networks has long been a daunting challenge. Existing end-to-end congestion control ( eg TCP) and traditional congestion notification schemes ( eg TCP+AQM/ECN) have significant limitations in achieving this goal. While the recently proposed XCP protocol addresses this challenge, XCP requires multiple bits to encode the congestion-related information exchanged between routers and end-hosts. Unfortunately, there is no space in the IP header for these bits, and solving this problem involves a non-trivial and time-consuming standardization process.In this paper, we design and implement a simple, low-complexity protocol, called Variable-structure congestion Control Protocol (VCP), that leverages only the existing two ECN bits for network congestion feedback, and yet achieves comparable performance to XCP, ie high utilization, low persistent queue length, negligible packet loss rate, and reasonable fairness. On the downside, VCP converges significantly slower to a fair allocation than XCP. We evaluate the performance of VCP using extensive ns2 simulations over a wide range of network scenarios. To gain insight into the behavior of VCP, we analyze a simple fluid model, and prove a global stability result for the case of a single bottleneck link shared by flows with identical round-trip times.",

    "abstract": "If the packet loss rate in a network is higher than the loss rate requested by an application, the transport protocol must make up for the difference in loss rate. In high bandwidth delay-product networks the latency introduced by retransmission-based error recovery schemes may be too high for applications with latency constraints. In this case, Forward Error Correction (FEC) can be used. FEC allows recovery from loss without retransmission. The amount of loss recovered strongly depends on the loss behavior of the network. FEC works best if losses are dispersed in time. We use simulation to study the loss behavior of an output buffered multiplexer for three different traffic scenarios. Our results show how the loss behavior of the multiplexer is affected by the traffic mix and the statistics of the sources. The more bursty the sources, the higher the loss rate and the higher the probability that losses will occur in bursts. Based on simulation results, we develop a mathematical model for the performance of FEC and compute the effectiveness of FEC for the three traffic scenarios. FEC is not effective for the two homogeneous traffic scenarios. However, FEC reduces the loss rate for the video sources by several orders of magnitude for a heterogeneous traffic scenario consisting of video and burst sources.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on \"router-based\" defense mechanisms, and whether they can provide effective solutions to network Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Router-based defenses operate either on traffic aggregates or on individual flows, and have been shown, either alone or in combination with other schemes, e.g., traceback, to be reasonably effective against certain types of basic attacks. Those attacks are, however, relatively brute-force, and usually accompanied by either significant increases in congestion, and/or traffic patterns that are easily identified. It is, therefore, unclear if router-based solutions are viable in the presence of more diverse or sophisticated attacks. As a result, even if incorporating defense mechanisms in the routers themselves has obvious advantages, such schemes have not seen wide deployments. Our ultimate goal is to determine whether it is possible to build router-based defense mechanisms that are effective against a wide range of attacks. This paper describes a first phase of this effort aimed at identifying weaknesses in existing systems. In particular, the paper demonstrates that aggregate defense systems can be readily circumvented, even by a single attacker, through minor modifications of its flooding patterns. Flow-based defenses fare slightly better, but can still be easily fooled by a small number of attackers generating transient flooding patterns. The findings of the paper provide insight into possible approaches for designing better and more robust router-based defense systems.",

By this, we mean annotating a map of the Internet with properties such as: client populations, features and workloads; network ownership, capacity, connectivity, geography and routing policies; patterns of loss, congestion, failure and growth; and so forth. This combination of properties it greater than the sum of its parts, and exposes the attributes of network design easily overlooked by simpler, uncorrelated models. We argue that reverse engineering the Internet is feasible based on continuing improvements in measurement techniques, the potential to infer new properties from external measurements, and an accounting of the resources required to complete the process.",

    "abstract": "Measurement and estimation of packet loss characteristics are challenging due to the relatively rare occurrence and typically short duration of packet loss episodes. While active probe tools are commonly used to measure packet loss on end-to-end paths, there has been little analysis of the accuracy of these tools or their impact on the network. The objective of our study is to understand how to measure packet loss episodes accurately with end-to-end probes. We begin by testing the capability of standard Poisson-modulated end-to-end measurements of loss in a controlled laboratory environment using IP routers and commodity end hosts. Our tests show that loss characteristics reported from such Poisson-modulated probe tools can be quite inaccurate over a range of traffic conditions. Motivated by these observations, we introduce a new algorithm for packet loss measurement that is designed to overcome the deficiencies in standard Poisson-based tools. Specifically, our method creates a probe process that (1) enables an explicit trade-off between accuracy and impact on the network, and (2) enables more accurate measurements than standard Poisson probing at the same rate. We evaluate the capabilities of our methodology experimentally by developing and implementing a prototype tool, called BADABING. The experiments demonstrate the trade-offs between impact on the network and measurement accuracy. We show that BADABING reports loss characteristics far more accurately than traditional loss measurement tools.",

For an overlay network with n end hosts, existing systems either require O ( n 2 ) measurements, and thus lack scalability, or can only estimate the latency but not congestion or failures. Our earlier extended abstract [1] briefly proposes an algebraic approach that selectively monitors k linearly independent paths that can fully describe all the O ( n 2 ) paths. The loss rates and latency of these k paths can be used to estimate the loss rates and latency of all other paths. Our scheme only assumes knowledge of the underlying IP topology, with links dynamically varying between lossy and normal.In this paper, we improve, implement and extensively evaluate such a monitoring system. We further make the following contributions: i) scalability analysis indicating that for reasonably large n ( e.g. , 100), the growth of k is bounded as O ( n log n ), ii) efficient adaptation algorithms for topology changes, such as the addition or removal of end hosts and routing changes, iii) measurement load balancing schemes, and iv) topology measurement error handling. Both simulation and Internet experiments demonstrate we obtain highly accurate path loss rate estimation while adapting to topology changes within seconds and handling topology errors.",

    "abstract": "Ptacek and Newsham [14] showed how to evade signature detection at Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) using TCP and IP Fragmentation. These attacks are implemented in tools like FragRoute, and are institutionalized in IPS product tests. The classic defense is for the IPS to reassemble TCP and IP packets,and to consistently normalize the output stream. Current IPS standards require keeping state for 1 million connections. Both the state and processing requirements of reassembly and normalization are barriers to scalability for an IPS at speeds higher than 10 Gbps.In this paper, we suggest breaking with this paradigm using an approach we call Split-Detect. We focus on the simplest form of signature, an exact string match, and start by splitting the signature into pieces. By doing so the attacker is either forced to include at least one piece completely in a packet, or to display potentially abnormal behavior (e.g., several small TCP fragments or out-of-order packets) that cause the attacker's flow to be diverted to a slow path. We prove that under certain assumptions this scheme can detect all byte-string evasions. We also show using real traces that the processing and storage requirements of this scheme can be 10% of that required by a conventional IPS, allowing reasonable cost implementations at 20 Gbps. While the changes required by Split-Detect may be a barrier to adoption, this paper exposes the assumptions that must be changed to avoid normalization and reassembly in the fast path.",

Using current BGP routing information, we show that HLP, in comparison to BGP, can reduce the churn-rate of route updates by a factor 400 as well as isolate the effect of routing events to a region 100 times smaller than that of BGP. For a majority of Internet routes, HLP guarantees worst-case linear-time convergence. We also describe a prototype implementation of HLP on top of the XORP router platform. HLP is not intended to be a finished and final proposal for a replacement for BGP, but is instead offered as a starting point for debates about the nature of the next-generation inter-domain routing protocol.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a research effort concerned with the design of the next generation of internet architecture, which has been necessitated by two emerging trends. First, there will be at least a few orders of magnitude increase in data rates of communication networks in the next few years. For example, researchers are already prototyping networks with data rates of up to a few hundred Mbps, and are planning networks with data rates up to a few Gbps. Second, researchers from all disciplines of science, engineering, and humanities plan to use the communication infrastructure to access widely distributed resources in order to solve bigger and more complex problems. These trends provide new challenges and opportunities to researchers in the communication field. One such challenge is the design of what we call the very high speed internet (VHSI) abstraction which can help efficiently support guaranteed levels of performance for a variety of applications, and can cope with the ever increasing diversity of underlying networks with rapidly growing user population and needs. Our strategy towards achieving this ambitious goal comprises the following:&amp;bull; Design, specification, and prototype implementation of a novel multipoint congram-oriented service that can work well with connection-oriented and datagram high speed networks, can provide variable grade service on a need basis to its applications, and can provide adequate reconfigurability to deal with survivability requirements due to network failures.&amp;bull; Design and implementation of gateway architectures that can support data rates of a few hundred Mbps, can interface with diverse networks, and can implement the congram-oriented service without becoming a performance bottleneck.&amp;bull; Development of analytical and simulation models to evaluate important tradeoffs associated with the design of a congram-oriented protocol, the resource management on diverse networks, and the design of new gateway architectures.",

Using the model, we analyzed one class of nonuniform traffic pattern referred to as “point-to-point” traffic that has particular significance to mixed voice, data, and video applications. The results obtained indicate that even a single dedicated channel (with point-to-point traffic) can significantly limit the throughput of the background uniform traffic. The paper concludes with several switch design strategies for switching point-to-point traffic using a self-routing switching network.",

The convergence process increases router load, introduces outages and transient loops, and slows reaction to failures. We propose a new routing paradigm where the goal is not to reduce the convergence times but rather to eliminate the convergence process completely. To this end, we propose a technique called Failure-Carrying Packets (FCP) that allows data packets to autonomously discover a working path without requiring completely up-to-date state in routers. Our simulations, performed using real-world failure traces and Rocketfuel topologies, show that: (a) the overhead of FCP is very low, (b) unlike traditional link-state routing (such as OSPF), FCP can provide both low loss-rate as well as low control overhead, (c) compared to prior work in backup path pre-computations, FCP provides better routing guarantees under failures despite maintaining lesser state at the routers.",

We also argue that the Internet architecture is not ossified, as recently claimed, but that its core protocols play the role of \"evolutionary kernels\", meaning that they are conserved so that complexity and diversity can emerge at the lower and higher layers. We then discuss the factors that determine the deployment of new architectures or protocols, and argue, based on the notion of \"auto-catalytic sets\", that successful innovations are those that become synergistic components in closed loops of existing modules.

To better understand the behavior of these applications and predict their performance when deployed on the actual Internet, the generated topologies must closely match real network characteristics, not just in terms of graph structure (node interconnectivity) but also with respect to various node and link annotations. Relevant annotations include link latencies, AS membership and whether a router is a peering or internal router. Finally, it should be possible to rescale a given topology to a variety of sizes while still maintaining its essential characteristics. In this paper, we propose techniques to generate annotated, Internet router graphs of different sizes based on existing observations of Internet characteristics. We find that our generated graphs match a variety of graph properties of observed topologies for a range of target graph sizes. While the best available data of Internet topology currently remains imperfect, the quality of our generated topologies will improve with the fidelity of available measurement techniques or next generation architectures that make Internet structure more transparent.",

Today, topology generators are tightly bound to the observed data used to validate them. Given that the actual properties of the Internet topology are not known, topology generators should strive to reproduce the variability that characterizes the evolution of the Internet topology over time. Future topology generators should be able to express the variations in local connectivity that makes today's Internet: peering relationships, internal AS topology and routing policies each changing over time due to failures, maintenance, upgrades and business strategies of the network. Topology generators should capture those dimensions, by allowing a certain level of randomness in the outcome, rather than enforcing structural assumptions as the truths about Internet's evolving structure, which may never be discovered",

We introduce the implicit packet conservation principle and show that as long as the endpoints uphold this principle, they can only improve their end-to-end performance relative to the exponential backoff case. By conducting large-scale simulations, modeling, and network experiments in Emulab and the Internet using a kernel-level FreeBSD TCP implementation, realistic traffic distributions, and complex network topologies, we demonstrate that TCP's binary exponential backoff mechanism can be safely removed. Moreover, we show that insuitability of TCP's exponential backoff is fundamental, i.e., independent from the currently-dominant Internet traffic properties or bottleneck capacities. Surprisingly, our results indicate that a path to incrementally deploying the change does exist.",

    "abstract": "Denial of Service (DoS) attacks frequently happen on the Internet, paralyzing Internet services and causing millions of dollars of financial loss. This work presents NetFence, a scalable DoS-resistant network architecture. NetFence uses a novel mechanism, secure congestion policing feedback, to enable robust congestion policing inside the network. Bottleneck routers update the feedback in packet headers to signal congestion, and access routers use it to police senders' traffic. Targeted DoS victims can use the secure congestion policing feedback as capability tokens to suppress unwanted traffic. When compromised senders and receivers organize into pairs to congest a network link, NetFence provably guarantees a legitimate sender its fair share of network resources without keeping per-host state at the congested link. We use a Linux implementation, ns-2 simulations, and theoretical analysis to show that NetFence is an effective and scalable DoS solution: it reduces the amount of state maintained by a congested router from per-host to at most per-(Autonomous System).",

    "abstract": "Privacy -- the protection of information from unauthorized disclosure -- is increasingly scarce on the Internet. The lack of privacy is particularly true for popular peer-to-peer data sharing applications such as BitTorrent where user behavior is easily monitored by third parties. Anonymizing overlays such as Tor and Freenet can improve user privacy, but only at a cost of substantially reduced performance. Most users are caught in the middle, unwilling to sacrifice either privacy or performance. In this paper, we explore a new design point in this tradeoff between privacy and performance. We describe the design and implementation of a new P2P data sharing protocol, called OneSwarm, that provides users much better privacy than BitTorrent and much better performance than Tor or Freenet. A key aspect of the OneSwarm design is that users have explicit configurable control over the amount of trust they place in peers and in the sharing model for their data: the same data can be shared publicly, anonymously, or with access control, with both trusted and untrusted peers. OneSwarm's novel lookup and transfer techniques yield a median factor of 3.4 improvement in download times relative to Tor and a factor of 6.9 improvement relative to Freenet. OneSwarm is publicly available and has been downloaded by hundreds of thousands of users since its release.",

We recruited about 100 iPhone users from a metropolitan area and collected statistics on their WiFi connectivity during about a two and half week period in February 2010. We find that a user is in WiFi coverage for 70% of the time on average and the distributions of WiFi connection and disconnection times have a strong heavy-tail tendency with means around 2 hours and 40 minutes, respectively. Using the acquired traces, we run trace-driven simulation to measure offloading efficiency under diverse conditions e.g. traffic types, deadlines and WiFi deployment scenarios. The results indicate that if users can tolerate a two hour delay in data transfer (e.g, video and image up-loads), the network can offload 70% of the total 3G data traffic on average. We also develop a theoretical framework that permits an analytical study of the average performance of offloading. This tool is useful for network providers to obtain a rough estimate on the average performance of offloading for a given inputWiFi deployment condition.",

    "abstract": "Diversity is an intrinsic property of wireless networks. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of many distributed protocols like ExOR, MORE, SOAR, SOFT, and MIXIT that exploit receiver diversity in 802.11-like networks. In contrast, the dual of receiver diversity, sender diversity, has remained largely elusive to such networks. This paper presents SourceSync, a distributed architecture for harnessing sender diversity. SourceSync enables concurrent senders to synchronize their transmissions to symbol boundaries, and cooperate to forward packets at higher data rates than they could have achieved by transmitting separately. The paper shows that SourceSync improves the performance of opportunistic routing protocols. Specifically, SourceSync allows all nodes that overhear a packet in a wireless mesh to simultaneously transmit it to their nexthops, in contrast to existing opportunistic routing protocols that are forced to pick a single forwarder from among the overhearing nodes. Such simultaneous transmission reduces bit errors and improves throughput. The paper also shows that SourceSync increases the throughput of 802.11 last hop diversity protocols by allowing multiple APs to transmit simultaneously to a client, thereby harnessing sender diversity. We have implemented SourceSync on the FPGA of an 802.11-like radio platform. We have also evaluated our system in an indoor wireless testbed, empirically showing its benefits.",

SwitchBlade uses a pipeline-based design that allows individual hardware modules to be enabled or disabled on the fly, integrates software exception handling, and provides support for forwarding based on custom header fields. SwitchBlade's ease of programmability and wire-speed performance enables rapid prototyping of custom data-plane functions that can be directly deployed in a production network. SwitchBlade integrates common packet-processing functions as hardware modules, enabling different protocols to use these functions without having to resynthesize hardware. SwitchBlade's customizable forwarding engine supports both longest-prefix matching in the packet header and exact matching on a hash value. SwitchBlade's software exceptions can be invoked based on either packet or flow-based rules and updated quickly at runtime, thus making it easy to integrate more flexible forwarding function into the pipeline. SwitchBlade also allows multiple custom data planes to operate in parallel on the same physical hardware, while providing complete isolation for protocols running in parallel. We implemented SwitchBlade using NetFPGA board, but SwitchBlade can be implemented with any FPGA. To demonstrate SwitchBlade's flexibility, we use SwitchBlade to implement and evaluate a variety of custom network protocols: we present instances of IPv4, IPv6, Path Splicing, and an OpenFlow switch, all running in parallel while forwarding packets at line rate.",

Clearly, even when network architectures are designed from scratch, they have to evolve as their environment (i.e., technological constraints, service requirements, applications, economic conditions, etc) always changes. A key question then is: what makes a network architecture evolvable? What determines the ability of a network architecture to evolve as its environment changes? In this paper, we review some relevant ideas about evolvability from the biological literature. We examine the role of robustness and modularity in evolution, and their relation with evolvability. We also discuss evolutionary kernels and punctuated equilibria, two important concepts that may be relevant to the so-called ossification of the core Internet protocols. Finally, we examine optimality, a design objective that is often of primary interest in engineering but that does not seem to be abundant in biology.",

However, one major drawback of TCAMs is their high power consumption, which is becoming critical with the boom of data centers, the growing classifiers and the deployment of IPv6. In this paper, we propose a practical and efficient solution which introduces a smart pre-classifier to reduce power consumption of TCAMs for multi-dimensional packet classification. We reduce the dimension of the problem through the pre-classifier which pre-classifies a packet on two header fields, source and destination IP addresses. We then return to the high dimension problem where only a small portion of a TCAM is activated and searched for a given packet. The smart pre-classifier is built in a way such that a given packet matches at most one entry in the pre-classifier, which make commodity TCAMs sufficient to implement the pre-classifier. Furthermore, each rule is stored only once in one of the TCAM blocks, which avoids rule replication. The presented solution uses commodity TCAMs, and the proposed algorithms are easy to implement. Our scheme achieves a median power reduction of 91% and an average power reduction of 88% on real and synthetic classifiers respectively.",

We rather thoroughly analyze the interactions between connections and show that actually ACK compression only arises in a perfectly symmetrical setup and it has little impact on performance. We provide a different explanation of the interactions---data pendulum, a core phenomenon that we analyze in this paper. In the data pendulum effect, data and ACK segments alternately fill only one of the link buffers (on the upload or download side) at a time, but almost never both of them. We analyze the effect in the case in which buffers are structured as arrays of bytes and derive an expression for the ratio between the download and upload throughput. Simulation results and measurements confirm our analysis and show how appropriate buffer sizing alleviates performance degradation. We also consider the case of buffers structured as arrays of packets and show that it amplifies the effects of data pendulum.",

In this work, we propose a joint Hop-by-hop and Receiver-driven Interest Control Protocol (HR-ICP) to regulate user requests (Interests) either at the receiver and at intermediate nodes via Interest shaping. We prove that HR-ICP is stable and converges to an efficient and max-min fair equilibrium. Compared to controlling traffic only at the receiver, HR-ICP accelerates congestion reaction and reduces the loss rate, as we show by means of CCN packet-level simulations.

OpenANFV is seamlessly and efficiently put into Openstack to provide high performance on top of commodity hardware to cope with various virtual function requirements. OpenANFV works as an independent component to manage and virtualize the acceleration resources (e.g. cinder manages block storage resources and nova manages computing resources). Specially, OpenANFV mainly has the following three features. (1)Automated Management. Provisioning for multiple Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) is automated to meet the dynamic requirements of NFV environment. Such automation alleviates the time pressure of the complicated provisioning and configuration as well as reduces the probability of manually induced configuration errors. (2) Elasticity. VNFs are created, migrated, and destroyed on demand in real time. The reconfigurable hardware resources in pool can rapidly and flexibly offload the corresponding services to the accelerator platform in the dynamic NFV environment. (3) Coordinating with Openstack. The design and implementation of the OpenANFV APIs coordinate with the mechanisms in Openstack to support required virtualized MBs for multiple tenants.",

The focus was on update churn (the number of routing protocol messages that are exchanged when the network undergoes routing changes) and whether churn was growing too fast for routers to handle. Recent work somewhat allayed those fears, showing that update churn grows slowly in IPv4, but the question of routing scalability has re-emerged with IPv6. In this work, we develop a model that expresses BGP churn in terms of four measurable properties of the routing system. We show why the number of updates normalized by the size of the topology is constant, and why routing dynamics are qualitatively similar in IPv4 and IPv6. We also show that the exponential growth of IPv6 churn is entirely expected, as the underlying IPv6 topology is also growing exponentially.",

In this paper, we present ReWiFlow, a restricted class of OpenFlow wildcard rules (the fundamental way to control groups of flows in OpenFlow), which allows managing groups of flows with flexibility and without loss of performance. We demonstrate how ReWiFlow can be used to implement applications such as dynamic proactive routing. We also present a generalization of ReWiFlow, called Multi-ReWiFlow, and show how it can be used to efficiently represent access control rules collected from Stanford's backbone network.",

    "abstract": "A secure routing protocol represents a foundational building block of a dependable communication system. Unfortunately, currently no taxonomy exists to assist in the design and analysis of secure routing protocols. Based on the Dagstuhl Seminar 15102, this paper initiates the study of more structured approaches to describe secure routing protocols and the corresponding attacker models, in an effort to better understand existing secure routing protocols, and to provide a framework for designing new protocols. We decompose the routing system into its key components based on a functional model of routing. This allows us to classify possible attacks on secure routing protocols. Using our taxonomy, we observe that the most eective attacks target the information in the control plane. Accordingly, unlike classic attackers whose capabilities are often described in terms of computation complexity we propose to classify the power of an attacker with respect to the reach, that is, the extent to which the attacker can influence the routing information indirectly, beyond the locations under its direct control.",

The key elements of the architecture include leveraging human social behavior for efficient opportunistic interaction between a variety of sensors, personal communication devices and resources embedded in the local environment.

Our analysis shows that replacing high port-count core switches with Quartz can significantly reduce switching delays, and replacing groups of top-of-rack and aggregation switches with Quartz can significantly reduce congestion-related delays from cross-traffic. We overcome the complexity of wiring a complete mesh using low-cost optical multiplexers that enable us to efficiently implement a logical mesh as a physical ring. We evaluate our performance using both simulations and a small working prototype. Our evaluation results confirm our analysis, and demonstrate that it is possible to build low-latency DCNs using inexpensive commodity elements without significant concessions to cost, scalability, or wiring complexity.",

Onion routing schemes like Tor deliver low latency and high bandwidth, but are not designed to withstand traffic analysis. Designs based on DC-nets or broadcast channels resist traffic analysis and provide low latency, but are limited to low bandwidth communication. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of Aqua, a high-bandwidth anonymity system that resists traffic analysis. We focus on providing strong anonymity for BitTorrent, and evaluate the performance of Aqua using traces from hundreds of thousands of actual BitTorrent users. We show that Aqua achieves latency low enough for efficient bulk TCP flows, bandwidth sufficient to carry BitTorrent traffic with reasonable efficiency, and resistance to traffic analysis within anonymity sets of hundreds of clients.

Second, we present a denial-of-service (DoS) attack that allows an off-path attacker to prevent a broadcast client from ever updating its system clock; to do this, the attacker sends the client a single malformed broadcast packet per query interval. Our DoS attack also applies to all other NTP modes that are `ephemeral' or `preemptable' (including manycast, pool, etc). We then use network measurements to give evidence that NTP's broadcast and other ephemeral/preemptable modes are being used in the wild. We conclude by discussing why NTP's current implementation of symmetric-key cryptographic authentication does not provide security in broadcast mode, and make some recommendations to improve the current state of affairs.",

Experimental investigations show that, when only GCC flows are considered, the end-to-end algorithm is able to contain queuing delays without AQMs. Moreover the interplay of GCC flows with PIE or CoDel leads to higher packet losses with respect to the case of a DropTail queue. In the presence of concurrent TCP traffic, PIE and CoDel reduce the queuing delays with respect to DropTail at the cost of increased packet losses. In this scenario flow queuing schedulers offer a better solution.",

Our goal is to develop techniques to synthesize traffic matrices for researchers who wish to test new network applications or protocols. The paucity of available data, and the desire to build a general framework for synthesis that could work in various settings requires a new look at this problem. We show how the principle of maximum entropy can be used to generate a wide variety of traffic matrices constrained by the needs of a particular task, and the available information, but otherwise avoiding hidden assumptions about the data.

Traditional multi-field classification approaches, in both software and ternary content-addressable memory (TCAMs), entail tradeoffs between (memory) space and (lookup) time. TCAMs cannot efficiently represent range rules, a common class of classification rules confining values of packet fields to given ranges. The exponential space growth of TCAM entries relative to the number of fields is exacerbated when multiple fields contain ranges. In this work, we present a novel approach which identifies properties of many classifiers which can be implemented in linear space and with worst-case guaranteed logarithmic time \\emph{and} allows the addition of more fields including range constraints without impacting space and time complexities. On real-life classifiers from Cisco Systems and additional classifiers from ClassBench (with real parameters), 90-95% of rules are thus handled, and the other 5-10% of rules can be stored in TCAM to be processed in parallel.",

In this paper, we argue that the end hosts are a natural enforcement point for these functions and we present Eden, an architecture for implementing network functions at datacenter end hosts with minimal network support. Eden comprises three components, a centralized controller, an enclave at each end host, and Eden-compliant applications called stages. To implement network functions, the controller configures stages to classify their data into messages and the enclaves to apply action functions based on a packet's class. Our Eden prototype includes enclaves implemented both in the OS kernel and on programmable NICs. Through case studies, we show how application-level classification and the ability to run actual programs on the data-path allows Eden to efficiently support a broad range of network functions at the network's edge.",

More secure algorithms, colloquially referred to as Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), are under active development. These new algorithms differ significantly from current ones. They can have larger signatures or keys, and often require more computational power. This means we cannot just replace existing algorithms by PQC alternatives, but need to evaluate if they meet the requirements of the Internet protocols that rely on them. In this paper we provide a case study, analyzing the impact of PQC on the Domain Name System (DNS) and its Security Extensions (DNSSEC). In its main role, DNS translates human-readable domain names to IP addresses and DNSSEC guarantees message integrity and authenticity. DNSSEC is particularly challenging to transition to PQC, since DNSSEC and its underlying transport protocols require small signatures and keys and efficient validation. We evaluate current candidate PQC signature algorithms in the third round of the NIST competition on their suitability for use in DNSSEC. We show that three algorithms, partially, meet DNSSEC's requirements but also show where and how we would still need to adapt DNSSEC. Thus, our research lays the foundation for making DNSSEC, and protocols with similar constraints ready for PQC.",

    "abstract": "The Domain Name System (DNS) is one of the most crucial parts of the Internet. Although the original standard defined the usage of DNS over UDP (DoUDP) as well as DNS over TCP (DoTCP), UDP has become the predominant protocol used in the DNS. With the introduction of new Resource Records (RRs), the sizes of DNS responses have increased considerably. Since this can lead to truncation or IP fragmentation , the fallback to DoTCP as required by the standard ensures successful DNS responses by overcoming the size limitations of DoUDP. However, the effects of the usage of DoTCP by stub resolvers are not extensively studied to this date. We close this gap by presenting a view at DoTCP from the Edge, issuing 12.1M DNS requests from 2,500 probes toward Public as well as Probe DNS recursive resolvers. In our measurement study, we observe that DoTCP is generally slower than DoUDP, where the relative increase in Response Time is less than 37% for most resolvers. While optimizations to DoTCP can be leveraged to further reduce the response times, we show that support on Public resolvers is still missing, hence leaving room for optimizations in the future. Moreover, we also find that Public resolvers generally have comparable reliability for DoTCP and DoUDP. However, Probe resolvers show a significantly different behavior: DoTCP queries targeting Probe resolvers fail in 3 out of 4 cases, and, therefore, do not comply with the standard. This problem will only aggravate in the future: As DNS response sizes will continue to grow, the need for DoTCP will solidify.",

    "abstract": "A packet filter is a programmable selection criterion for classifying or selecting packets from a packet stream in a generic, reusable fashion. Previous work on packet filters falls roughly into two categories, namely those efforts that investigate flexible and extensible filter abstractions but sacrifice performance, and those that focus on low-level, optimized filtering representations but sacrifice flexibility. Applications like network monitoring and intrusion detection, however, require both high-level expressiveness and raw performance. In this paper, we propose a fully general packet filter framework that affords both a high degree of flexibility and good performance. In our framework, a packet filter is expressed in a high-level language that is compiled into a highly efficient native implementation. The optimization phase of the compiler uses a flowgraph set relation called edge dominators and the novel application of an optimization technique that we call \"redundant predicate elimination,\" in which we interleave partial redundancy elimination, predicate assertion propagation, and flowgraph edge elimination to carry out the filter predicate optimization. Our resulting packet-filtering framework, which we call BPF+, derives from the BSD packet filter (BPF), and includes a filter program translator, a byte code optimizer, a byte code safety verifier to allow code to migrate across protection boundaries, and a just-in-time assembler to convert byte codes to efficient native code. Despite the high degree of flexibility afforded by our generalized framework, our performance measurements show that our system achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art packet filter architectures and better than hand-coded filters written in C.",

    "abstract": "Current work in the IETF aims at providing service differentiation on the Internet. One proposal is to provide loss differentiation by assigning levels of drop procedence to IP packets. In this paper, we evaluate the active queue management (AQM) mechanisms RED In and Out (RIO) and Weighted RED (WRED) in providing levels of drop precedence under different loads. For low drop precedence traffic, FIO and WRED can be configured to offer sheltering (i.e., low drop precedence traffic is protected from losses caused by higher drop precedence traffic). However, if traffic control fails or is inaccurate, such configurations can cause starvation of traffic at high drop precedence levels. Configuring WRED to instead offer relative differentiation can eliminate the risk of starvation. However, WRED cannot, without reconfiguration, both offer sheltering when low drop precedence traffic is properly controlled and avoid starvation at overload of low drop precedence traffic. To achieve this, we propose a new AQM mechanism, WRED with Thresholds (WRT). The benefit of WRT is that, without reconfiguration, it offers sheltering when low drop precedence traffic is properly controlled and relative differentiation otherwise. We present simulations showing that WRT has these properties.",

    "abstract": "Computer networks are undergoing a remarkable transformation. The widespread use of optical fiber to transmit data has made tremendous increases in network bandwidth. Furthermore, greater CPU power, increasing disk capacity, and support for digital audio and video are creating demand for a new class of network services. For example, video-on-demand, distant learning, distant diagnosis, video conferences, and many others applications have popped up one after another in recent years. Many of these services have one thing in common. They all require that the same piece of data be sent to multiple recipients. Even in traditional networks, this operation, called multicasting, can not be handled easily and cheaply. When scaled up to high speed ATM-based networks, the situation could be worse. Multiple streams of data travel around ATM networks. Each tries to send to many different destinations simultaneously. Therefore, designing economical ATM network switches which can support multicasting operations easily is very important in the future generation high speed networks. In the past twelve years or so, many designs for multicasting ATM switches are proposed. It seems about time to do a historical survey. It is hoped that by learning from the wisdom of the previous authors, new spark or angle can be found and exploited to design new multicasting ATM switches. Without easy and inexpensive multicasting, all the exciting services may become unaffordable. This will in turn lead to the diminishing of customer bases and finally will hinder the full-scale deployment of high speed networks.",

To provide bounded delay service, networks must use admission control to regulate their load. Previous work on admission control mainly focused on algorithms that compute the worst case theoretical queueing delay to guarantee an absolute delay bound for all packets. In this paper we describe a measurement-based admission control algorithm for predictive service, which allows occasional delay violations. We have tested our algorithm through simulations on a wide variety of network topologies and driven with various source models, including some that exhibit long-range dependence, both in themselves and in their aggregation. Our simulation results suggest that, at least for the scenarios studied here, the measurement-based approach combined with the relaxed service commitment of predictive service enables us to achieve a high level of network utilization while still reliably meeting the delay bound.",

    "abstract": "The conventional approach to routing in computer networks consists of using a heuristic to compute a single shortest path from a source to a destination. Single-path routing is very responsive to topological and link-cost changes; however, except under light traffic loads, the delays obtained with this type of routing are far from optimal. Furthermore, if link costs are associated with delays, single-path routing exhibits oscillatory behavior and becomes unstable as traffic loads increase. On the other hand, minimum-delay routing approaches can minimize delays only when traffic is stationary or very slowly changing.We present a \"near-optimal\" routing framework that offers delays comparable to those of optimal routing and that is as flexible and responsive as single-path routing protocols proposed to date. First, an approximation to the Gallager's minimum-delay routing problem is derived, and then algorithms that implement the approximation scheme are presented and verified. We introduce the first routing algorithm based on link-state information that provides multiple paths of unequal cost to each destination that are loop-free at every instant. We show through simulations that the delays obtained in our framework are comparable to those obtained using the Gallager's minimum-delay routing. Also, we show that our framework renders far smaller delays and makes better use of resources than traditional single-path routing.",

Previous algorithms could guarantee only that the schedules were bounded by a length no worse than the maximum node degree, the algorithms presented here represent a considerable theoretical improvement.

    "abstract": "The Internet architecture can be characterized as having a rather coarse grained and imperative style of network packet handling: confronted with an IP packet and its source and destination addresses, the infrastructure almost blindly and unalterably executes hundreds of resolution, routing and forwarding decisions. There are numerous attempts that try to \"extend\" the Internet in order to either reduce the immediate impact an arbitrary packet can have (e.g., NAT), or to insert diversions from the normal processing paths in order to better use the existing resources (e.g., content delivery). In this paper we argue that we need a more fine grained control, in the hands of end nodes, over how packets are handled. The basic abstraction presented here is that of networking pointers, which we show to relate to low level concepts like ARP caches, but also high level routing decisions for terminal mobility, content delivery networks, or peer-to-peer overlay forming. We report on first implementation experiences of an \"underlay\" networking approach which uses pointer tricks underneath IP in order to provide new network layer services.",

    "abstract": "Route flap damping is considered to be a widely deployed mechanism in core routers that limits the widespread propagation of unstable BGP routing information. Originally designed to suppress route changes caused by link flaps, flap damping attempts to distinguish persistently unstable routes from routes that occasionally fail. It is considered to be a major contributor to the stability of the Internet routing system.We show in this paper that, surprisingly, route flap damping can significantly exacerbate the convergence times of relatively stable routes. For example, a route to a prefix that is withdrawn exactly once and re-announced can be suppressed for up to an hour (using the current RIPE recommended damping parameters). We show that such abnormal behavior fundamentally arises from the interaction of flap damping with BGP path exploration during route withdrawal. We study this interaction using a simple analytical model and understand the impact of various BGP parameters on its occurrence using simulations. Finally, we outline a preliminary proposal to modify route flap damping scheme that removes the undesired interaction in all the topologies we studied. .",

Our scheme is characterized by two fundamental features. First, it does not rely on any additional procedure in internal network routers other than the capability to apply different service priorities to probing and data packets. Second, the connection admission decision is based on the analysis of the probing flow delay variation statistics. Simulation results, which focus on a IP telephony scenario, show that, despite the lack of core routers cooperation, toll-quality performance figures (99th delay percentiles not greater than few ms per router) can be obtained even in severe overload conditions. Finally, a comparison with an EAC scheme driven by probe losses only, shows that the use of delay variation statistics as endpoint decision criterion is a key factor for EAC effectiveness.",

This paper describes specific improvements developed for NTP Version 3 which have resulted in increased accuracy, stability and reliability in both local-area and wide-area networks. These include engineered refinements of several algorithms used to measure time differences between a local clock and a number of peer clocks in the network, as well as to select the best ensemble from among a set of peer clocks and combine their differences to produce a clock accuracy better than any in the ensemble. This paper also describes engineered refinements of the algorithms used to adjust the time and frequency of the local clock, which functions as a disciplined oscillator. The refinements provide automatic adjustment of message-exchange intervals in order to minimize network traffic between clients and busy servers while maintaining the best accuracy. Finally, this paper describes certain enhancements to the Unix operating system software in order to realize submillisecond accuracies with fast workstations and networks.",

    "abstract": "For decades there has been a search for a multiple access protocol for a broadcast channel that would provide a performance that approached that of the ideal M/D/1 queue. This ideal performance would provide immediate access at light loads and then seamlessly move to a reservation system at high offered loads. DQRAP (distributed queueing random access protocol) provides a performance which approaches this ideal. Furthermore it is accomplished using as few as three control minislots which suggests that, aside from establishing new theoretical bounds, DQRAP will be of great practical value.DQRAP requires that channel time be divided into slots each of which consists of one data slot and m control minislots, and that each station maintain two common distributed queues. One queue is called the data transmission queue, or simply TQ, used to organize the order of data transmission, the other queue is the collision resolution queue, or simply RQ, which is used to resolve the collisions and to prevent collisions by new arrivals. The protocol includes data transmission rules, request transmission rules and queuing discipline rules. Modelling and simulation indicate that DQRAP, using as few as 3 minislots, achieves a performance level which approaches that of a hypothetical perfect scheduling protocol, i.e., the M/D/1 system, with respect to throughput and delay. DQRAP could prove useful in packet radio, satellite, broadband cable, cellular voice, WAN, and passive optical networks.",

For example, knowing where bottleneck links are, network operators can apply traffic engineering either at the interdomain or intradomain level to improve routing. Existing tools either fail to identify the location of bottlenecks, or generate a large amount of probing packets. In addition, they often require access to both end points. In this paper we present Pathneck , a tool that allows end users to efficiently and accurately locate the bottleneck link on an Internet path. Pathneck is based on a novel probing technique called Recursive Packet Train (RPT) and does not require access to the destination. We evaluate Pathneck using wide area Internet experiments and trace-driven emulation. In addition, we present the results of an extensive study on bottlenecks in the Internet using carefully selected, geographically diverse probing sources and destinations. We found that Pathneck can successfully detect bottlenecks for almost 80% of the Internet paths we probed. We also report our success in using the bottleneck location and bandwidth bounds provided by Pathneck to infer bottlenecks and to avoid bottlenecks in multihoming and overlay routing.",

    "abstract": "We propose 4+4, a simple address extension architecture for Internet that provides an evolutionary approach to extending the existing IPv4 address space in comparison to more complex and disruptive approaches best exemplified by IPv6 deployment. The 4+4 architecture leverages the existence of Network Address Translators (NATs) and private address realms, and importantly, enables the return to end-to-end address transparency as the incremental deployment of 4+4 progresses. During the transition to 4+4, only NATs and end-hosts need to be updated and not the network routers. The 4+4 architecture retains the existing semantics of Internet names and addresses, and only proposes simple changes to the network layer that focus entirely on address extension. Encapsulation is used as the main tool to maintain backward compatibility. We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of the 4+4 architecture and discuss our implementation experiences and results from local and wide-area Internet experimentation. The 4+4 source code is freely available from the Web (comet.columbia.edu/ipv44) for experimentation.",

    "abstract": "Today, most multi-connected autonomous systems (AS) need to control the flow of their interdomain traffic for both performance and economical reasons. This is usually done by manually tweaking the BGP configurations of the routers on an error-prone trial-and-error basis. In this paper, we demonstrate that designing systematic BGP-based traffic engineering techniques for stub ASes are possible. Our approach to solve this traffic engineering problem is to allow the network operator to define objective functions on the interdomain traffic. Those objective functions are used by an optimization box placed inside the AS that controls the interdomain traffic by tuning the iBGP messages distributed inside the AS. We show that the utilization of an efficient evolutionary algorithm allows to both optimize the objective function and limit the number of iBGP messages. By keeping a lifetime on the tweaked routes, we also show that providing stability to the interdomain path followed by the traffic is possible. We evaluate the performance of solution based on traffic traces from two stub ASes of different sizes. Our simulations show that the interdomain traffic can be efficiently engineered by using not more than a few iBGP advertisements per minute.Our contribution in this paper is to demonstrate that by carefully thinking the design of the interdomain traffic engineering technique, stub ASes can engineer their outbound traffic over relatively short timescales, by exclusively tweaking their BGP routes, and with a minimal burden on BGP. Systematic BGP-based traffic engineering for stub ASes is thus possible at a very limited cost in terms of iBGP messages.",

    "abstract": "The success of a P2P file-sharing network highly depends on the scalability and versatility of its search mechanism. Two particularly desirable search features are scope (ability to find infrequent items) and support for partial-match queries (queries that contain typos or include a subset of keywords). While centralized-index architectures (such as Napster) can support both these features, existing decentralized architectures seem to support at most one: prevailing protocols (such as Gnutella and FastTrack) support partial-match queries, but since search is unrelated to the query, they have limited scope. Distributed Hash Tables (such as CAN and CHORD) constitute another class of P2P architectures promoted by the research community. DHTs couple index location with the item's hash value and are able to provide scope but can not effectively support partial-match queries; another hurdle in DHT deployment is their tight control the overlay structure and data placement which makes them more sensitive to failures.Associative overlays are a new class of decentralized P2P architectures. They are designed as a collection of unstructured P2P networks (based on popular architectures such as gnutella or FastTrack), and the design retains many of their appealing properties including support for partial match queries, and relative resilience to peer failures. Yet, the search process is orders of magnitude more effective in locating rare items. Our design exploits associations inherent in human selections to steer the search process to peers that are more likely to have an answer to the query.",

    "abstract": "For years, the conventional wisdom [7, 22] has been that the continued stability of the Internet depends on the widespread deployment of \"socially responsible\" congestion control. In this paper, we seek to answer the following fundamental question: If network end-points behaved in a selfish manner, would the stability of the Internet be endangered?.We evaluate the impact of greedy end-point behavior through a game-theoretic analysis of TCP. In this \"TCP Game\" each flowattempts to maximize the throughput it achieves by modifying its congestion control behavior. We use a combination of analysis and simulation to determine the Nash Equilibrium of this game. Our question then reduces to whether the network operates efficiently at these Nash equilibria.Our findings are twofold. First, in more traditional environments -- where end-points use TCP Reno-style loss recovery and routers use drop-tail queues -- the Nash Equilibria are reasonably efficient. However, when endpoints use more recent variations of TCP (e.g., SACK) and routers employ either RED or drop-tail queues, the Nash equilibria are very inefficient. This suggests that the Internet of the past could remain stable in the face of greedy end-user behavior, but the Internet of today is vulnerable to such behavior. Second, we find that restoring the efficiency of the Nash equilibria in these settings does not require heavy-weight packet scheduling techniques (e.g., Fair Queuing) but instead can be done with a very simple stateless mechanism based on CHOKe [21].",

    "abstract": "Software patching has not been effective as a first-line defense against large-scale worm attacks, even when patches have long been available for their corresponding vulnerabilities. Generally, people have been reluctant to patch their systems immediately, because patches are perceived to be unreliable and disruptive to apply. To address this problem, we propose a first-line worm defense in the network stack, using shields -- vulnerability-specific, exploit-generic network filters installed in end systems once a vulnerability is discovered, but before a patch is applied. These filters examine the incoming or outgoing traffic of vulnerable applications, and correct traffic that exploits vulnerabilities. Shields are less disruptive to install and uninstall, easier to test for bad side effects, and hence more reliable than traditional software patches. Further, shields are resilient to polymorphic or metamorphic variations of exploits [43].In this paper, we show that this concept is feasible by describing a prototype Shield framework implementation that filters traffic above the transport layer. We have designed a safe and restrictive language to describe vulnerabilities as partial state machines of the vulnerable application. The expressiveness of the language has been verified by encoding the signatures of several known vulnerabilites. Our evaluation provides evidence of Shield's low false positive rate and small impact on application throughput. An examination of a sample set of known vulnerabilities suggests that Shield could be used to prevent exploitation of a substantial fraction of the most dangerous ones.",

This paper presents an empirical study of bogon route announcements, as observed at eight vantage points on the Internet. On average, we observe several bogon routes leaked every few days; a small number of ASes also temporarily leak hundreds of bogon routes. About 40% of these bogon routes are not withdrawn for at least a day. We observed 110 different ASes originating routes for bogon prefixes and a few ASes that were responsible for advertising a disproportionate number of these routes. We also find that some ASes that do filter unallocated prefixes continue to filter them for as long as five months after they have been allocated, mistakenly filtering valid routes. Both of these types of delinquencies have serious implications: the failure to filter valid prefixes can could make nefarious activities such as denial of service attacks difficult to trace; failure to update filters when new prefixes are allocated prevents legitimate routes from being globally visible.",

XCP, however, requires that each queue controller in a path knows the exact capacity of its link. In shared access media, e.g. IEEE 802.11, knowing the actual capacity of the channel is a difficult task.In this paper we propose modifications to the XCP algorithm that enable the utilization of XCP even when the capacity of a link is unknown. These modifications are validated through simulation.We also present the results of a comparison between the performance of the modified XCP and TCP, where XCP controlled flows result more stable, fairness increases, and the network delay becomes lower. In addition, as the bandwidth delay product increases, XCP is able to maintain near-maximum utilization while TCP decreases utilization.",

In this paper, we explore a new point in this design space that aims to strike a better balance between the extensibility and robustness of a routing infrastructure. The basic idea of our solution, which we call declarative routing , is to express routing protocols using a database query language. We show that our query language is a natural fit for routing, and can express a variety of well-known routing protocols in a compact and clean fashion. We discuss the security of our proposal in terms of its computational expressive power and language design. Via simulation, and deployment on PlanetLab, we demonstrate that our system imposes no fundamental limits relative to traditional protocols, is amenable to query optimizations, and can sustain long-lived routes under network churn and congestion.",

    "abstract": "Protocol and system designers use verification techniques to analyze a system's correctness properties. Network operators need verification techniques to ensure the \"correct\" operation of BGP. BGP's distributed dependencies cause small configuration mistakes or oversights to spur complex errors, which sometimes have devastating effects on global connectivity. These errors are often difficult to debug because they are sometimes only exposed by a specific message arrival pattern or failure scenario.This paper presents an approach to BGP verification that is primarily based on static analysis of router configuration. We argue that: (1) because BGP's a configuration affects its fundamental behavior, verification is a program analysis problem, (2) BGP's complex, dynamic interactions are difficult to abstract and impossible to enumerate, which precludes existing verification techniques, (3) because of BGP's flexible, policy-based configuration, some aspects of BGP configuration must be checked against a higher-level specification of intended policy, and (4) although static analysis can catch many configuration errors, simulation and emulation are also necessary to determine the precise scenarios that could expose errors at runtime. Based on these observations, we propose the design of a BGP verification tool, discuss how it could be applied in practice, and describe future research challenges.",

These additional levels of naming and resolution (1) allow services and data to be first class Internet objects (in that they can be directly and persistently named), (2) seamlessly accommodate mobility and multi-homing and (3) integrate middleboxes (such as NATs and firewalls) into the Internet architecture.

In the UIO approach, when UIO sequences and signatures are not unique in an implementation, they may not be able to detect erroneous states in the implementation. The UIO approach is revised here with the addition of a verification procedure to ensure that the UIO sequences are all unique in an implementation. Since signatures are generally not unique, this revision requires substituting the use of a signature for a state, S, with a set of input/output sequences, IO(S,K)s, unique to S, each of which distinguishes S from at least one other state, K. Verification is then applied to the IO(S,K)s. Fault coverage in the revised UIO, UIOv, approach is better than that in the original approach. A uniqueness criterion is discussed here to capture a desirable fault coverage for finite-state machine, FSM, test sequences. This criterion ensures the detection of any faulty FSM implementation provided that its set of states does not exceed that in the specified FSM. It is shown that test sequences generated by the UIOv approach and the DS approach always satisfy the uniqueness criterion. In fact, the DS approach is a special case of the UIOv approach; however, the UIOv approach has wider applicability and is generally applicable to k-distinguishable FSMs.",

    "abstract": "Enterprise network architecture and management have followed the Internet's design principles despite different requirements and characteristics: enterprise hosts are administered by a single authority, which intrinsically assigns different values to traffic from different business applications. We advocate a new approach where hosts are no longer relegated to the network's periphery, but actively participate in network-related decisions. To enable host participation, network information, such as dynamic network topology and per-link characteristics and costs, is exposed to the hosts, and network administrators specify conditions on the propagated network information that trigger actions to be performed while a condition holds. The combination of a condition and its actions embodies the concept of the network exception handler, defined analogous to a program exception handler. Conceptually, network exception handlers execute on hosts with actions parameterized by network and host state. Network exception handlers allow hosts to participate in network management, traffic engineering and other operational decisions by explicitly controlling host traffic under predefined conditions. This flexibility improves overall performance by allowing efficient use of network resources. We outline several sample network exception handlers, present an architecture to support them, and evaluate them using data collected from our own enterprise network.",

    "abstract": "When data transfers to or from a host happen in parallel, users do not always consider them to have the same importance. Ideally, a transport protocol should therefore allow its users to manipulate the fairness among flows in an almost arbitrary fashion. Since data transfers can also include real-time media streams which need to keep delay | and hence buffers | small, the protocol should also have a smooth sending rate. In an effort to satisfy the above requirements, we present MulTFRC, a congestion control mechanism which is based on the TCP-friendly Rate Control (TFRC) protocol. It emulates the behavior of a number of TFRC flows while maintaining a smooth sending rate. Our simulations and a real-life test demonstrate that MulTFRC performs significantly better than its competitors, potentially making it applicable in a broader range of settings than what TFRC is normally associated with.",

    "abstract": "Delayed acknowledgments were introduced to conserve network and host resources. Further reduction of the acknowledgment frequency can be motivated in the same way. However, reducing the dependency on frequent acknowledgments in TCP is difficult because acknowledgments support reliable delivery, loss recovery, clock out new segments, and serve as input when determining an appropriate sending rate. Our results show that in scenarios where there are no obvious advantages of reducing the acknowledgment frequency, performance can be maintained although fewer acknowledgments are sent. Hence, there is a potential for reducing the acknowledgment frequency more than is done through delayed acknowledgments today. Advancements in TCP loss recovery is one of the key reasons that the dependence on frequent acknowledgments has decreased. We propose and evaluate an end-to-end solution, where four acknowledgments per send window are sent. The sender compensates for the reduced acknowledgment frequency using a form of Appropriate Byte Counting. The proposal also includes a modification of fast loss recovery to avoid frequent timeouts.",

    "abstract": "Planetary-scale network testbeds like PlanetLab and RON have become indispensable for evaluating prototypes of distributed systems under realistic Internet conditions. However, current testbeds lack the heterogeneity that characterizes the commercial Internet. For example, most testbed nodes are connected to well-provisioned research networks, whereas most Internet nodes are in edge networks. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of SatelliteLab, a testbed that includes nodes from a diverse set of Internet edge networks. SatelliteLab has a two-tier architecture, in which well-provisioned nodes called planets form the core, and lightweight nodes called satellites connect to the planets from the periphery. The application code of an experiment runs on the planets, whereas the satellites only forward network traffic. Thus, the traffic is subjected to the network conditions of the satellites, which greatly improves the testbed's network heterogeneity. The separation of code execution and traffic forwarding enables satellites to remain lightweight, which lowers the barrier to entry for Internet edge nodes. Our prototype of SatelliteLab uses PlanetLab nodes as planets and a set of 32 volunteered satellites with diverse network characteristics. These satellites consist of desktops, laptops, and handhelds connected to the Internet via cable, DSL, ISDN, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular links. We evaluate SatelliteLab's design, and we demonstrate the benefits of evaluating applications on SatelliteLab.",

    "abstract": "An aggregate congestion control mechanism, namely Probe-Aided MulTCP (PA-MulTCP), is proposed in this paper. It is based on MulTCP,a proposal for enabling an aggregate to emulate the behavior of multiple concurrent TCP connections. The objective of PA-MulTCP is to ensure the fair sharing of the bottleneck bandwidth between the aggregate and other TCP or TCP-friendly flows while keeping lightweightness and responsiveness. Unlike MulTCP, there are two congestion window loops in PA-MulTCP, namely the probe window loop and the adjusting window loop.The probe window loop constantly probes the congestion situation and the adjusting window loop dynamically adjusts the congestion window size for the arriving and departing flows within the aggregate Our simulations demonstrate that PA-MulTCP is more stable and fairer than MulTCP over a wide range of the weight N in steady conditions as well as in varying congestion conditions. PA-MulTCP is also responsive to flow arrival/departure and thus reduces the latency of short-lived transfers. Furthermore, PA-MulTCP is lightweight, since it enjoys above advantages at the cost of only an extra probe window loop, which has a marginal influence on the implementation complexity. Finally, the design of PA-MulTCP decouples the congestion management from the other functionalities in the aggregate flow management. As a result, PA-MulTCP could be potentially applied to a wider range of scenarios, e.g. wireless TCP proxies, edge-to-edge overlays, QoS provisioning and mass data transport.

The failure of these innovative architectures to gain wide deployment is primarily due to economic and legacy issues, rather than technical shortcomings. We propose a new paradigm for network service differentiation where design principles account explicitly for the multiplicity of Internet service providers and users as well as their economic interests in environments with partly deployed new services. Our key idea is to base the service differentiation on performance itself, rather than price. The proposed RD (Rate-Delay) services enable a user to choose between a higher transmission rate or low queuing delay at a congested network link. An RD router supports the two services by maintaining two queues per output link and achieves the intended rate-delay differentiation through simple link scheduling and dynamic buffer sizing. After analytically deriving specific rules for RD router operation, we conduct extensive simulations that confirm effectiveness of the RD services geared for incremental deployment in the Internet.",

    "abstract": "Network protocol designers, both at the physical and network level, have long considered interference and simultaneous transmission in wireless protocols as a problem to be avoided. This, coupled with a tendency to emulate wired network protocols in the wireless domain, has led to artificial limitations in wireless networks. In this paper, we argue that wireless protocols can exploit simultaneous transmission to reduce the cost of reliable multicast by orders of magnitude. With an appropriate application interface, simultaneous transmission can also greatly speed up common group communication primitives, such as anycast, broadcast, leader election and others. The proposed method precisely fits into the domain of directly reachable nodes where many group communication mechanisms are commonly used in routing protocols and other physical-layer mechanisms. We demonstrate how simultaneous transmission can be used to implement a reliable broadcast for an infrastructure and peer-to-peer network using a prototype reconfigurable hardware. We also validate the notion of using simple spectrum sensing techniques to distinguish multiple transmissions. We then describe how the mechanism can be extended to solve group communication problems and the challenges inherent to build innovative protocols which are faster and reliable at the same time.",

    "abstract": "Real-time Anomaly Detection Systems (ADSs) use packet sampling to realize traffic analysis at wire speeds. While recent studies have shown that a considerable loss of anomaly detection accuracy is incurred due to sampling, solutions to mitigate this loss are largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a Progressive Security-Aware Packet Sampling (PSAS) algorithm which enables a real-time inline anomaly detector to achieve higher accuracy by sampling larger volumes of malicious traffic than random sampling, while adhering to a given sampling budget. High malicious sampling rates are achieved by deploying inline ADSs progressively on a packet's path. Each ADS encodes a binary score (malicious or benign) of a sampled packet into the packet before forwarding it to the next hop node. The next hop node then samples packets marked as malicious with a higher probability. We analytically prove that under certain realistic conditions, irrespective of the intrusion detection algorithm used to formulate the packet score, PSAS always provides higher malicious packet sampling rates. To empirically evaluate the proposed PSAS algorithm, we simultaneously collect an Internet traffic dataset containing DoS and portscan attacks at three different deployment points in our university's network. Experimental results using four existing anomaly detectors show that PSAS, while having no extra communication overhead and extremely low complexity, allows these detectors to achieve significantly higher accuracies than those operating on random packet samples.",

    "abstract": "Data collected using traceroute-based algorithms underpins research into the Internet's router-level topology, though it is possible to infer false links from this data. One source of false inference is the combination of per-flow load-balancing, in which more than one path is active from a given source to destination, and classic traceroute, which varies the UDP destination port number or ICMP checksum of successive probe packets, which can cause per-flow load-balancers to treat successive packets as distinct flows and forward them along different paths. Consequently, successive probe packets can solicit responses from unconnected routers, leading to the inference of false links. This paper examines the inaccuracies induced from such false inferences, both on macroscopic and ISP topology mapping. We collected macroscopic topology data to 365k destinations, with techniques that both do and do not try to capture load balancing phenomena. We then use alias resolution techniques to infer if a measurement artifact of classic traceroute induces a false router-level link. This technique detected that 2.71% and 0.76% of the links in our UDP and ICMP graphs were falsely inferred due to the presence of load-balancing. We conclude that most per-flow load-balancing does not induce false links when macroscopic topology is inferred using classic traceroute. The effect of false links on ISP topology mapping is possibly much worse, because the degrees of a tier-1 ISP's routers derived from classic traceroute were inflated by a median factor of 2.9 as compared to those inferred with Paris traceroute.",

This equilibrium property holds if the flows are nearly independent, and it is violated by traffic changes caused by several, potentially small, correlated flows. Many traffic anomalies (both malicious and benign) fit this description. Based on this observation, we exploit equilibrium to design a computationally simple detection method for correlated anomalous flows. We compare our new method to two well known techniques on three network links. We manually classify the anomalies detected by the three methods, and discover that our method uncovers a different class of anomalies than previous techniques do.",

    "abstract": "Access networks include modems, home gateways, and DSL Access Multiplexers (DSLAMs), and are responsible for 70-80% of total network-based energy consumption. In this paper, we take an in-depth look at the problem of greening access networks, identify root problems, and propose practical solutions for their user- and ISP-parts. On the user side, the combination of continuous light traffic and lack of alternative paths condemns gateways to being powered most of the time despite having Sleep-on-Idle (SoI) capabilities. To address this, we introduce Broadband Hitch-Hiking (BH 2 ), that takes advantage of the overlap of wireless networks to aggregate user traffic in as few gateways as possible. In current urban settings BH 2 can power off 65-90% of gateways. Powering off gateways permits the remaining ones to synchronize at higher speeds due to reduced crosstalk from having fewer active lines. Our tests reveal speedup up to 25%. On the ISP side, we propose introducing simple inexpensive switches at the distribution frame for batching active lines to a subset of cards letting the remaining ones sleep. Overall, our results show an 80% energy savings margin in access networks. The combination of B 2 and switching gets close to this margin, saving 66% on average.",

One of these schemes is based on the notion of traffic carrying capabilities that grant access to a network and/or end host. However, leveraging capabilities results in added complexity and additional steps in the communication process: Before communication starts a remote host must be vetted and given a capability to use in the subsequent communication. In this paper, we propose a lightweight mechanism that turns the answers provided by DNS name resolution - which Internet communication broadly depends on anyway - into capabilities.

Until today, this fact makes the Internet vulnerable to hijacking attacks that intercept or blackhole Internet traffic. So far, significant effort has been put into the detection of IP prefix hijacking, while AS hijacking has received little attention. AS hijacking is more sophisticated than IP prefix hijacking, and is aimed at a long-term benefit such as over a duration of months. In this paper, we study a malicious case of AS hijacking, carried out in order to send spam from the victim's network. We thoroughly investigate this AS hijacking incident using live data from both the control and the data plane. Our analysis yields insights into how an attacker proceeded in order to covertly hijack a whole autonomous system, how he misled an upstream provider, and how he used an unallocated address space. We further show that state of the art techniques to prevent hijacking are not fully capable of dealing with this kind of attack. We also derive guidelines on how to conduct future forensic studies of AS hijacking. Our findings show that there is a need for preventive measures that would allow to anticipate AS hijacking and we outline the design of an early warning system.",

Alternative cryptosystems, based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECDSA and EdDSA), exist but are rarely used in DNSSEC. We show that these are highly attractive for use in DNSSEC, although they also have disadvantages. To address these, we have initiated research that aims to investigate the viability of deploying ECC at a large scale in DNSSEC.",

However, the pervasive misuses of domain names, e.g., the domains of ``one-time-use'' pattern, have negative impact on the effectiveness of DNS caching as the cache has been filled with those entries that are highly unlikely to be retrieved. In this paper, we investigate such misuse and identify domain name-based features to characterize those one-time domains. By leveraging the features that are explicitly available from the domain name itself, we build a classifier to combine these features, propose simple policy modifications on caching resolvers for improving DNS cache performance, and validate their efficacy using real traces.",

    "abstract": "When debugging a distributed system, it is sometimes necessary to explain the absence of an event - for instance, why a certain route is not available, or why a certain packet did not arrive. Existing debuggers offer some support for explaining the presence of events, usually by providing the equivalent of a backtrace in conventional debuggers, but they are not very good at answering 'Why not?' questions: there is simply no starting point for a possible backtrace. In this paper, we show that the concept of negative provenance can be used to explain the absence of events in distributed systems. Negative provenance relies on counterfactual reasoning to identify the conditions under which the missing event could have occurred. We define a formal model of negative provenance for distributed systems, and we present the design of a system called Y! that tracks both positive and negative provenance and can use them to answer diagnostic queries. We describe how we have used Y! to debug several realistic problems in two application domains: software-defined networks and BGP interdomain routing. Results from our experimental evaluation show that the overhead of Y! is moderate.",

However, the existing Internet architecture is seriously challenged to ensure universal service provisioning at economically sustainable price points, largely due to the costs associated with providing services in a perceived always-on manner. This paper puts forth our vision to provide global access to the Internet through a universal communication architecture that combines two emerging paradigms, namely that of Information Centric Networking (ICN) and Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN). The decoupling in space and time, achieved through these underlying paradigms, is key to aggressively widen the connectivity options and provide flexible service models beyond what is currently pursued in the game around universal service provisioning. In this paper, we provide an outlook on the main concepts underlying our universal architecture and the opportunities arising from it. We also offer some insight into ongoing work to realize our vision in a concrete test bed and trial setting.",

We show that DSL deployments not only tend to enable interleaving on the last-mile, but also employ multiple depth levels that change over time. We also witness that last-mile latency is considerably stable over time and not affected by diurnal load patterns. Unlike observations from prior studies, we show that cable providers in the US do not generally exhibit lower last-mile latencies when compared to that of DSL. We instead identify that last-mile latencies vary by subscriber location and show that last-mile latencies of cable providers in the US are considerably different across the US east and west coast. We further show that last-mile latencies vary depending on the access technology used by the DSL modem wherein VDSL deployments show last-mile latencies lower than ADSL1/ADSL2+ broadband speeds.

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen a slew of papers on datacenter congestion control mechanisms. In this editorial, we ask whether the bulk of this research is needed for the common case where congestion control involves hosts responding to simple congestion signals from the network and the performance goal is reducing some average measure of flow completion time. We raise this question because we find that, out of all the possible variations one could make in congestion control algorithms, the most essential feature is the switch scheduling algorithm. More specifically, we find that congestion control mechanisms that use Shortest-Remaining-Processing-Time (SRPT) achieve superior performance as long as the rate-setting algorithm at the host is reasonable. We further find that while SRPT's performance is quite robust to host behaviors, the performance of schemes that use scheduling algorithms like FIFO or Fair Queuing depend far more crucially on the rate-setting algorithm, and their performance is typically worse than what can be achieved with SRPT. Given these findings, we then ask whether it is practical to realize SRPT in switches without requiring custom hardware. We observe that approximate and deployable SRPT (ADS) designs exist, which leverage the small number of priority queues supported in almost all commodity switches, and require only software changes in the host and the switches. Our evaluations with one very simple ADS design shows that it can achieve performance close to true SRPT and is significantly better than FIFO. Thus, the answer to our basic question - whether the bulk of recent research on datacenter congestion control algorithms is needed for the common case - is no.",

    "abstract": "A commonly held belief is that traffic engineering and routing changes are infrequent. However, based on our measurements over a number of years of traffic between data centers in one of the largest cloud provider's networks, we found that it is common for flows to change paths at ten-second intervals or even faster. These frequent path and, consequently, latency variations can negatively impact the performance of cloud applications, specifically, latency-sensitive and geo-distributed applications. Our recent measurements and analysis focused on observing path changes and latency variations between different Amazon aws regions. To this end, we devised a path change detector that we validated using both ad hoc experiments and feedback from cloud networking experts. The results provide three main insights: (1) Traffic Engineering (TE) frequently moves (TCP and UDP) flows among network paths of different latency, (2) Flows experience unfair performance, where a subset of flows between two machines can suffer large latency penalties (up to 32% at the 95th percentile) or excessive number of latency changes, and (3) Tenants may have incentives to selfishly move traffic to low latency classes (to boost the performance of their applications). We showcase this third insight with an example using rsync synchronization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to reveal the high frequency of TE activity within a large cloud provider's network. Based on these observations, we expect our paper to spur discussions and future research on how cloud providers and their tenants can ultimately reconcile their independent and possibly conflicting objectives.

In this paper, we show that an attacker able to observe users' traffic relying on plain-text DNS can uncover the domain names of users relying on eSNI or DoH. By relying on large-scale network traces, we show that simplistic features and off-the-shelf machine learning models are sufficient to achieve surprisingly high precision and recall when recovering encrypted domain names.

In observed state, it maintains an up-to-date view of the actual network state. Applications read this state and propose state changes based on their individual goals. Using a model of dependencies among state variables, Statesman merges these proposed states into a target state that is guaranteed to maintain the safety and performance invariants. It then updates the network to the target state. Statesman has been deployed in ten Microsoft Azure datacenters for several months, and three distinct applications have been built on it.

Internet exchange points (IXPs) are a compelling place to start, given their central role in interconnecting many networks and their growing importance in bringing popular content closer to end users. To realize a Software Defined IXP (an \"SDX\"), we need new programming abstractions that allow participating networks to create and run these applications and a runtime that both behaves correctly when interacting with BGP and ensures that applications do not interfere with each other. We must also ensure that the system scales, both in rule-table size and computational overhead.

A crucial roadblock to achieving predictable performance is stragglers, i.e., tasks that take significantly longer than expected to run. At this point, speculative execution has been widely adopted to mitigate the impact of stragglers. However, speculation mechanisms are designed and operated independently of job scheduling when, in fact, scheduling a speculative copy of a task has a direct impact on the resources available for other jobs. In this work, we present Hopper, a job scheduler that is speculation-aware, i.e., that integrates the tradeoffs associated with speculation into job scheduling decisions. We implement both centralized and decentralized prototypes of the Hopper scheduler and show that 50% (66%) improvements over state-of-the-art centralized (decentralized) schedulers and speculation strategies can be achieved through the coordination of scheduling and speculation.",

The protocol is resource-efficient, robust, flexible, and scalable. In addition, our protocol is provably loop-free.Our protocol starts with a resources-saving tree (Shared Tree) and individual receivers switch to a QoS-competitive tree (Source-Based Tree) when necessary. In both trees, the new destination is able to choose the most promising among several paths. An innovation is that we use dynamic routing information without relying on a link state exchange protocol to provide it. Our protocol limits the effect of pre-configuration decisions drastically, by separating the management from the data transfer functions; administrative routers are not necessarily part of the tree. This separation increases the robustness, and flexibility of the protocol. Furthermore, QoSMIC is able to adapt dynamically to the conditions of the network.The QoSMIC protocol introduces several new ideas that make it more flexible than other protocols proposed to date. In fact, many of the other protocols, (such as YAM, PIMSM, BGMP, CBT) can be seen as special cases of QoSMIC. This paper presents the motivation behind, and the design of QoSMIC, and provides both analytical and experimental results to support our claims.",

However, web caching has the disadvantage that the pages returned to clients by caches may be stale , in that they may not be consistent with the version currently on the server. In this paper we describe a scalable web cache consistency architecture that provides fairly tight bounds on the staleness of pages. Our architecture borrows heavily from the literature, and can best be described as an invalidation approach made scalable by using a caching hierarchy and application-level multicast routing to convey the invalidations. We evaluate this design with calculations and simulations, and compare it to several other approaches.",

First, we consider the impact of reshaping traffic within the network on the end-to-end delay, the end-to-end jitter, as well as per-hop buffer requirements. This leads us to examine a class of traffic disciplines that use reshaping at each hop, namely rate-controlled disciplines. In this case, it is known that it is advantageous to use the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling policy at the link scheduler [8]. For this service discipline, we determine the appropriate values of the parameters that have to be exported, as specified in [16]. Subsequently, with the help of an example, we illustrate how the G service traffic will typically underutilize the network, regardless of the scheduling policy used. We then define a Guaranteed Rate (GR) service, that is synergetic with the G service framework and makes use of this unutilized bandwidth to provide rate guarantees to flows. We outline some of the details of the GR service and explain how it can be supported in conjunction with the G service in an efficient manner.",

Guaranteeing QoS typically translates to reserving resources for the duration of a call. We propose a state-dependent routing scheme that builds on any base state-independent routing scheme, by routing flows which are blocked on their primary paths (as selected by the state-independent scheme) onto alternate paths in a manner that is guaranteed—under certain Poisson assumptions— to improve on the performance of the base state-independent scheme. Our scheme only requires each node to have state information of those links that are incident on it. Such a scheme is of value when either the base state-independent scheme is already in place and a complete overhaul of the routing algorithm is undesirable, or when the state (reserved flows) of a link changes fast enough that the timely update of state information is infeasible to all possible call-originators. The performance improvements due to our controlled alternate routing scheme are borne out from simulations conducted on a fully-connected 4-node network, as well as on a sparsely-connected 12-node network modeled on the NSFNet T3 Backbone.",

Our analysis does not yield a definitive answer to the question we pose, since it would necessarily depend on unknowable factors such as the future cost of network bandwidth and the nature of the future traffic load. However, our model does reveal some interesting phenomena. First, in some circumstances, the amount of incremental bandwidth needed to make a best-effort-only network perform as well as a reservation capable one diverges as capacity increases. Second, in some circumstances reservation-capable networks retain significant advantages over best-effort-only networks, no matter how cheap bandwidth becomes. Lastly, we find bounds on the maximum performance advantage a reservation-capable network can achieve over best-effort architectures.",

In this paper, we describe our proposed solution ACE (Acknowledgement Based on Cwnd Estimation). In comparison to other solutions, ACE requires only modification of the TCP stack at terminals attached to an asymmetric network. We evaluated the performance of ACE over a cable modem network by simulation. We have also implemented ACE on the Linux platform and tested it on a small testbed network with an emulated asymmetric link. The performance improvement was significant especially when there is a high degree of asymmetry.",

We present experiments that demonstrate this problem and our analysis of how two-way traffic results in reduced fairness. This analysis led us to develop an effective modification to the congestion avoidance algorithms to maintain fairness with two-way traffic.Our analysis of experimental results also points to undesirable interactions between two-way traffic dynamics and a sending strategy that times data transmissions, by the receipt of acknowledgements.

    "abstract": "One very important metric in evaluation of IP mobility protocols is handover performance. Handover occurs when a mobile node changes its network point-of-attachment. If not performed efficiently, handover delays, jitters and packet loss directly impact applications and services. With the Internet growth and heterogeneity, it becomes crucial to design efficient handover protocols that are scalable, robust and incrementally deployable. Mobile IP (MIP) has been shown to exhibit poor handover performance during micro-mobility. We propose a new architecture for providing efficient and smooth handover, while being able to coexist and inter-operate with other technologies. Specifically, we propose an intra-domain multicast-based mobility architecture, where a visiting mobile is assigned a multicast address to use while moving within a domain. Efficient handover is achieved using standard multicast join/prune mechanisms.Two approaches are proposed and contrasted. The first introduces the concept of proxy-based mobility, while the other uses algorithmic mapping to obtain the multicast address of visiting mobiles. We show that the algorithmic mapping approach has several advantages over the proxy approach, and provide mechanisms to support it.Simulations used to evaluate our scheme and compare it to other micro-mobility schemes - CIP and HAWAII. The proactive handover results show that both M&amp;M and CIP show low handoff delay and packet reordering depth as compared to HAWAII. The reason for M&amp;M's comparable performance with CIP is that both use bi-cast in proactive handover. M&amp;M, however, handles multiple border routers in a domain, where CIP fails. Also using a proactive path setup mechanism, we show that M&amp;M clearly outperforms CIP in case of reactive handover.",

The general aim is to illustrate universal aspects of theoretical and methodological research that can be applied to network design and verification. The issues focused on will include the choice of models, including the relationship between flow and packet level descriptions, the need to account for uncertainty generated by modelling abstractions, and the challenges of dealing with network scale. The rigorous comparison of proposed schemes will be illustrated using various abstractions. While standard tools from robust control theory have been applied in this area, we will also illustrate how network-specific challenges can drive the development of new mathematics that expand their range of applicability, and how many enormous challenges remain.",

In an environment where the bottleneck resource is packet processing, this is the correct behavior. However, if the bottleneck resource is bandwidth, and flows may use packets of different size, resource sharing depends on packet size and is no longer fair. For some applications, such as Internet telephony, it is more natural to adjust the packet size, while keeping the packet rate as constant as possible. In this paper we study the impact of variations in packet size on equation-based congestion control and propose methods to remove the resulting throughput bias. We investigate the design space in detail and propose a number of possible designs. We evaluate these designs through simulation and conclude with some concrete proposals. Our findings can be used to design a TCP-friendly congestion control mechanism for applications that adjust packet size rather than packet rate, or applications that are forced to use a small packet size.",

    "abstract": "While application end-point architectures have proven to be viable solutions for large-scale distributed applications such as distributed computing and file-sharing, there is little known about its feasibility for more bandwidth-demanding applications such as live streaming. Heterogeneity in bandwidth resources and dynamic group membership, inherent properties of application end-points, may adversely affect the construction of a usable and efficient overlay. At large scales, the problems become even more challenging. In this paper, we study one of the most prominent architectural issues in overlay multicast: the feasibility of supporting large-scale groups using an application end-point architecture. We look at three key requirements for feasibility: (i) are there enough resources to construct an overlay, (ii) can a stable and connected overlay be maintained in the presence of group dynamics, and (iii) can an efficient overlay be constructed? Using traces from a large content delivery network, we characterize the behavior of users watching live audio and video streams. We show that in many common real-world scenarios, all three requirements are satisfied. In addition, we evaluate the performance of several design alternatives and show that simple algorithms have the potential to meet these requirements in practice. Overall, our results argue for the feasibility of supporting large-scale live streaming using an application end-point architecture.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has shown that one can use Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) to build scalable, robust and efficient applications. One question that is often left unanswered is that of simplicity of implementation and deployment. In this paper, we explore a case study of building an application for which ease of deployment dominated the need for high performance. The application we focus on is Place Lab, an end-user positioning system. We evaluate whether it is feasible to use DHTs as an application-independent building block to implement a key component of Place Lab: its \"mapping infrastructure.\" We present Prefix Hash Trees, a data structure used by Place Lab for geographic range queries that is built entire on top of a standard DHT. By strictly layering Place Lab's data structures on top of a generic DHT service, we were able to decouple the deployment and management of Place Lab from that of the underlying DHT. We identify the characteristics of Place Lab that made it amenable for deploying in this layered manner, and comment on its effect on performance.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the design of a reliable multicast transport protocol. The aim of the protocol is to provide a service equivalent to a sequence of reliable sequential unicasts between a client and a number of servers, whilst using the broadcast nature of some networks to reduce both the number of packets transmitted and the overall time needed to collect replies. The service interface of the protocol offers several types of service, ranging from the collection of a single reply from any one of a set of servers to the collection of all replies from all known servers. The messages may be of effectively arbitrary size, and the number of servers may be quite large. To support this service over real networks, special flow control mechanisms are used to avoid multiple replies overrunning the client. Reliable delivery is ensured using timeouts and a distributed acknowledgement scheme. The protocol is implemented over a network layer which support multicast destination addressing and packet delivery. The behaviour of the protocol over both LANs and LANs interconnected by WAN lines is discussed. We also include some notions for possible future support from network interface hardware.",

    "abstract": "Network anomalies such as packet reordering and delay spikes can result in spurious retransmissions and degrade performance of reliable transport protocols such as TCP and SCTP. Past research showed that in certain networks or paths, such anomalies were fairly common. The result was a series of proposals (Eifel, DSACK-based, F-RTO) targeted towards making a transport robust to such events. Most of the proposals focused on TCP and assumed applicability to SCTP. This paper focuses on SCTP and makes three contributions. First, the effect of spurious retransmissions in SCTP is shown to be more aggravated than in TCP, leading to a problem of congestion window overgrowth. Second, it is shown that most but not all of the solution space is shared between TCP and SCTP. An extension to the Eifel algorithm is proposed. Third, a microscopic as well as macroscopic comparison of the Eifel algorithm and the DSACK-based algorithm is presented. Such a comparison will provide implementers and vendors a clearer view of the applicability and tradeoffs involved in different algorithms.",

Recent misconfigurations and attacks have demonstrated the brittleness of BGP. Securing BGP has become a priority.In this paper, we focus on a viable deployment path to secure BGP. We analyze security requirements, and consider tradeoffs of mechanisms that achieve the requirements. In particular, we study how to secure BGP update messages against attacks. We design an efficient cryptographic mechanism that relies only on symmetric cryptographic primitives to guard an ASPATH from alteration, and propose the Secure Path Vector (SPV) protocol. In contrast to the previously proposed S-BGP protocol, SPV is around 22 times faster. With the current effort to secure BGP, we anticipate that SPV will contribute several alternative mechanisms to secure BGP, especially for the case of incremental deployments.",

We argue that the difficulty of network management can partly be attributed to a fundamental flaw in the existing architecture: protocols expose all their internal details and hence, the complexity of the ever-evolving data plane encumbers the management plane. Guided by this observation, in this paper we explore an alternative approach and propose Complexity Oblivious Network Management (CONMan), a network architecture in which the management interface of data-plane protocols includes minimal protocol-specific information. This restricts the operational complexity of protocols to their implementation and allows the management plane to achieve high level policies in a structured fashion. We built the CONMan interface of a few protocols and a management tool that can achieve high-level configuration goals based on this interface. Our preliminary experience with applying this tool to real world VPN configuration indicates the architecture's potential to alleviate the difficulty of configuration management.",

These applications often store weakly structured data, requiring sophisticated search algorithms. To simplify the search problem, most scalable algorithms introduce structure to the network. However, churn or violent disruption may break this structure, compromising search guarantees. This paper proposes a simple probabilistic search system, BubbleStorm, built on random multigraphs. Our primary contribution is a flexible and reliable strategy for performing exhaustive search. BubbleStorm also exploits the heterogeneous bandwidth of peers. However, we sacrifice some of this bandwidth for high parallelism and low latency. The provided search guarantees are tunable, with success probability adjustable well into the realm of reliable systems. For validation, we simulate a network with one million low-end peers and show BubbleStorm handles up to 90% simultaneous peer departure and 50% simultaneous crash.",

The key issues for an SCTP NAT are SCTP's control chunk multiplexing and multi-homing features. Control chunk multiplexing can expose an SCTP NAT to possible Denial of Service attacks. These can be mitigated through the use of chunk and parameter processing limits. Multiple and changing IP addresses during an SCTP association, mean that SCTP NATs cannot operate in the way conventional UDP/TCP NATs operate. Tracking these multiple global IP addresses can help in avoiding lookup table conflicts, however, it can also result in circumstances that can lead to NAT state inconsistencies. Our analysis shows that tracking global IP addresses is not necessary in most expected practical installations. We use our FreeBSD SCTP NAT implementation, alias_sctp to examine the performance implications of tracking global IP addresses. We find that typical memory usage doubles and that the processing requirements are significant for installations that experience high association arrival rates. In conclusion we provide practical recommendations for a secure stable SCTP NAT installation.",

We argue that evaluating anomaly detectors on manually labeled traces is both important and unavoidable. In particular, it is important to evaluate detectors on traces from operational networks because it is in this setting that the detectors must ultimately succeed. In addition, manual labeling of such traces is unavoidable because new anomalies will be identified and characterized from manual inspection long before there are realistic models for them. It is well known, however, that manual labeling is slow and error-prone. In order to mitigate these challenges, we present WebClass, a web-based infrastructure that adds rigor to the manual labeling process. WebClass allows researchers to share, inspect, and label traffic time-series through a common graphical user interface. We are releasing WebClass to the research community in the hope that it will foster greater collaboration in creating labeled traces and that the traces will be of higher quality because the entire community has access to all the information that led to a given label",

    "abstract": "Many network applications have stringent end-to-end latency requirements, including VoIP and interactive video conferencing, automated trading, and high-performance computing---where even microsecond variations may be intolerable. The resulting fine-grain measurement demands cannot be met effectively by existing technologies, such as SNMP, NetFlow, or active probing. We propose instrumenting routers with a hash-based primitive that we call a Lossy Difference Aggregator (LDA) to measure latencies down to tens of microseconds and losses as infrequent as one in a million. Such measurement can be viewed abstractly as what we refer to as a coordinated streaming problem, which is fundamentally harder than standard streaming problems due to the need to coordinate values between nodes. We describe a compact data structure that efficiently computes the average and standard deviation of latency and loss rate in a coordinated streaming environment. Our theoretical results translate to an efficient hardware implementation at 40 Gbps using less than 1% of a typical 65-nm 400-MHz networking ASIC. When compared to Poisson-spaced active probing with similar overheads, our LDA mechanism delivers orders of magnitude smaller relative error; active probing requires 50--60 times as much bandwidth to deliver similar levels of accuracy.",

If previously, users consumed content from a central server through their personal computers, nowadays they can reach a wide variety of repositories from virtually everywhere using mobile devices. This results in a considerable time-, location-, and event-based volatility of content popularity. In such a context, it is imperative for CDNs to put in place adaptive content management strategies, thus, improving the quality of services provided to users and decreasing the costs. In this paper, we introduce predictive content distribution strategies inspired by methods developed in the Recommender Systems area. Specifically, we outline different content placement strategies based on the observed user consumption patterns, and advocate their applicability in the state of the art CDNs.",

A critical requirement is the support for fast discovery of packets that satisfy certain criteria within large-scale packet repositories. This work presents the first indexing scheme for network packet traces based on compressed bitmap indexing principles. Our approach supports very fast insertion rates and results in compact index sizes. The proposed indexing methodology builds upon libpcap, the de-facto reference library for accessing packet-trace repositories. Our solution is therefore backward compatible with any solution that uses the original library. We experience impressive speedups on packet-trace search operations: our experiments suggest that the index-enabled libpcap may reduce the packet retrieval time by more than 1100 times.",

    "abstract": "Recent work in network measurements focuses on scaling the performance of monitoring platforms to 10Gb/s and beyond. Concurrently, IT community focuses on scaling the analysis of big-data over a cluster of nodes. So far, combinations of these approaches have targeted flexibility and usability over real-timeliness of results and efficient allocation of resources. In this paper we show how to meet both objectives with BlockMon, a network monitoring platform originally designed to work on a single node, which we extended to run distributed stream-data analytics tasks. We compare its performance against Storm and Apache S4, the state-of-the-art open-source stream-processing platforms, by implementing a phone call anomaly detection system and a Twitter trending algorithm: our enhanced BlockMon has a gain in performance of over 2.5x and 23x, respectively. Given the different nature of those applications and the performance of BlockMon as single-node network monitor [1], we expect our results to hold for a broad range of applications, making distributed BlockMon a good candidate for the convergence of network-measurement and IT-analysis platforms.",

    "abstract": "Measurement has become fundamental to the operation of networks and at-scale services---whether for management, security, diagnostics, optimization, or simply enhancing our collective understanding of the Internet as a complex system. Further, measurements are useful across points of view---from end hosts to enterprise networks and data centers to the wide area Internet. We observe that many measurements are decoupled from the protocols and applications they are designed to illuminate. Worse, current measurement practice often involves the exploitation of side-effects and unintended features of the network; or, in other words, the artful piling of hacks atop one another. This state of affairs is a direct result of the relative paucity of diagnostic and measurement capabilities built into today's network stack. Given our modern dependence on ubiquitous measurement, we propose \\emph{measurability} as an explicit low-level goal of current protocol design, and argue that measurements should be available to all network protocols throughout the stack. We seek to generalize the idea of measurement \\emph{within} protocols, e.g., the way in which TCP relies on measurement to drive its end-to-end behavior. Rhetorically, we pose the question: \\textit{what if the stack had been built with measurability and diagnostic support in mind?} We start from a set of principles for explicit measurability, and define primitives that, were they supported by the stack, would not only provide a solid foundation for protocol design going forward, but also reduce the cost and increase the accuracy of measuring the network.",

Although these systems have been shown to provide orders of magnitude higher performance than solutions using software-based routers, straightforward reconfiguration of hardware-based virtual networks over time is a challenge. In this paper, we present the implementation of a reconfigurable network virtualization substrate that combines several partially-reconfigurable hardware virtual routers with software virtual routers. The update of hardware-based virtual networks in our system is supported via real-time partial FPGA reconfiguration. Hardware virtual networks can be dynamically reconfigured in a fraction of a second without affecting other virtual networks operating in the same FPGA. A heuristic has been developed to allocate virtual networks with diverse bandwidth requirements and network characteristics on this heterogeneous virtualization substrate. Experimental results show that the reconfigurable virtual routers can forward packets at line rate. Partial reconfiguration allows for 20x faster hardware reconfiguration than a previous approach which migrated hardware virtual networks to software.",

    "abstract": "Network-wide migrations of a running network, such as the replacement of a routing protocol or the modification of its configuration, can improve the performance, scalability, manageability, and security of the entire network. However, such migrations are an important source of concerns for network operators as the reconfiguration campaign can lead to long and service-affecting outages. In this paper, we propose a methodology which addresses the problem of seamlessly modifying the configuration of commonly used link-state Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP). We illustrate the benefits of our methodology by considering several migration scenarios, including the addition or the removal of routing hierarchy in an existing IGP and the replacement of one IGP with another. We prove that a strict operational ordering can guarantee that the migration will not create IP transit service outages. Although finding a safe ordering is NP complete, we describe techniques which efficiently find such an ordering and evaluate them using both real-world and inferred ISP topologies. Finally, we describe the implementation of a provisioning system which automatically performs the migration by pushing the configurations on the routers in the appropriate order, while monitoring the entire migration process.",

    "abstract": "With the proliferation of online social networking (OSN) and mobile devices, preserving user privacy has become a great challenge. While prior studies have directly focused on OSN services, we call attention to the privacy leakage in mobile network data . This concern is motivated by two factors. First, the prevalence of OSN usage leaves identifiable digital footprints that can be traced back to users in the real-world. Second, the association between users and their mobile devices makes it easier to associate traffic to its owners. These pose a serious threat to user privacy as they enable an adversary to attribute significant portions of data traffic including the ones with NO identity leaks to network users' true identities. To demonstrate its feasibility, we develop the Tessellation methodology. By applying Tessellation on traffic from a cellular service provider (CSP), we show that up to 50% of the traffic can be attributed to the names of users. In addition to revealing the user identity, the reconstructed profile, dubbed as \"mosaic,\" associates personal information such as political views, browsing habits, and favorite apps to the users. We conclude by discussing approaches for preventing and mitigating the alarming leakage of sensitive user information.",

It created an immediate media buzz, mainly because of the unorthodox and unethical data collection methodology (i.e., exploiting default passwords to form the Carna botnet), but also because of the alleged unprecedented large scale of this census (even though legitimate census studies of similar and even larger sizes have been performed in the past). Given the unknown source of this released data set, little is known about it. For example, can it be ruled out that the data is faked? Or if it is indeed real, what is the quality of the released data? The purpose of this paper is to shed light on these and related questions and put the contributions of this anonymous Internet census study into perspective. Indeed, our findings suggest that the released data set is real and not faked, but that the measurements suffer from a number of methodological flaws and also lack adequate meta-data information. As a result, we have not been able to verify several claims that the anonymous author(s) made in the published report. In the process, we use this study as an educational example for illustrating how to deal with a large data set of unknown quality, hint at pitfalls in Internet-scale measurement studies, and discuss ethical considerations concerning third-party use of this released data set for publications.",

In particular, we comment on these different parties' current attitudes with respect to public and private peering and discuss some of the economic arguments that will ultimately determine whether or not the currently pursued strategy by OIX will succeed in achieving the main OIX-articulated goal -- a more level playing field for private and public peering in the US such that the actual demand and supply for the different peering opportunities will be reflected in the cost structure.",

    "abstract": "Several traffic monitoring applications may benefit from the availability of efficient mechanisms for approximately tracking smoothed time averages rather than raw counts. This paper provides two contributions in this direction. First, our analysis of Time-decaying Bloom filters, formerly proposed data structures devised to perform approximate Exponentially Weighted Moving Averages on streaming data, reveals two major shortcomings: biased estimation when measurements are read in arbitrary time instants, and slow operation resulting from the need to periodically update all the filter's counters at once. We thus propose a new construction, called On-demand Time-decaying Bloom filter, which relies on a continuous-time operation to overcome the accuracy/performance limitations of the original window-based approach. Second, we show how this new technique can be exploited in thedesign of high performance stream-based monitoring applications, by developing VoIPSTREAM, a proof-of-concept real-time analysis version of a formerly proposed system for telemarketing call detection. Our validation results, carried out over real telephony data, show how VoIPSTREAM closely mimics the feature extraction process and traffic analysis techniques implemented in the offline system, at a significantly higher processing speed, and without requiring any storage of per-user call detail records.",

The former finds code paths that are likely vulnerable, and the latter emulates adversarial actions that lead to effective attacks. Our method is precise (i.e., no false positives) and we show that it scales to complex protocol implementations. We apply it to four diverse protocols, including TCP, the 802.11 MAC, ECN, and SCTP, and show that it is able to find all manipulation attacks that have been previously reported for these protocols. We also find a previously unreported attack for SCTP.

    "abstract": "Electronic toll collection transponders, e.g., E-ZPass, are a widely-used wireless technology. About 70% to 89% of the cars in US have these devices, and some states plan to make them mandatory. As wireless devices however, they lack a basic function: a MAC protocol that prevents collisions. Hence, today, they can be queried only with directional antennas in isolated spots. However, if one could interact with e-toll transponders anywhere in the city despite collisions, it would enable many smart applications. For example, the city can query the transponders to estimate the vehicle flow at every intersection. It can also localize the cars using their wireless signals, and detect those that run a red-light. The same infrastructure can also deliver smart street-parking, where a user parks anywhere on the street, the city localizes his car, and automatically charges his account. This paper presents Caraoke, a networked system for delivering smart services using e-toll transponders. Our design operates with existing unmodified transponders, allowing for applications that communicate with, localize, and count transponders, despite wireless collisions. To do so, Caraoke exploits the structure of the transponders' signal and its properties in the frequency domain. We built Caraoke reader into a small PCB that harvests solar energy and can be easily deployed on street lamps. We also evaluated Caraoke on four streets on our campus and demonstrated its capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Rack-scale computers, comprising a large number of micro-servers connected by a direct-connect topology, are expected to replace servers as the building block in data centers. We focus on the problem of routing and congestion control across the rack's network, and find that high path diversity in rack topologies, in combination with workload diversity across it, means that traditional solutions are inadequate. We introduce R2C2, a network stack for rack-scale computers that provides flexible and efficient routing and congestion control. R2C2 leverages the fact that the scale of rack topologies allows for low-overhead broadcasting to ensure that all nodes in the rack are aware of all network flows. We thus achieve rate-based congestion control without any probing; each node independently determines the sending rate for its flows while respecting the provider's allocation policies. For routing, nodes dynamically choose the routing protocol for each flow in order to maximize overall utility. Through a prototype deployed across a rack emulation platform and a packet-level simulator, we show that R2C2 achieves very low queuing and high throughput for diverse and bursty workloads, and that routing flexibility can provide significant throughput gains.",

In this paper, we show that the slow path is set to become a new key bottleneck in Software-Defined Networks (SDNs). This is due to the growth in physical network bandwidth (200 Gbps is becoming common in data centers) and topological complexity (e.g., virtual switches now span hundreds of physical machines). We present our vision of a new Domain Specific Accelerator (DSA) for the slow path at the end host that sits between the hardware-offloaded data plane and the logically-centralized control plane.

    "abstract": "Distributed optimal traffic engineering in the presence of multiple paths has been found to be a difficult problem to solve. In this paper, we introduce a new approach in an attempt to tackle this problem. This approach has its basis in nonlinear control theory. More precisely, it relies on the concept of Sliding Modes. We develop a family of control laws, each of them having the property that the steady-state network resource allocation yields the maximum of the given utility function, subject to the network resource constraints. These control laws not only allow each ingress node to independently adjust its traffic sending rate but also provide a scheme for optimal traffic load redistribution among multiple paths. The only nonlocal information needed is binary feedback from each congested node in the path. Moreover, the algorithms presented are applicable to a large class of utility functions, namely, utility functions that can be expressed as the sum of concave functions of the sending rates. We show that the technique can be applied not only to rate adaptive traffic with multiple paths, but also to assured service traffic with multiple paths. Preliminary case studies show that this technique is potentially very useful for optimal traffic engineering in a multiple-class-of-service and multiple-path enabled Internet, e.g., differentiated services enabled multi-protocol label switching networks.",

    "abstract": "Present day routers typically employ monolithic operating systems which are not easily upgradable and extensible. With the rapid rate of protocol development it is becoming increasingly important to dynamically upgrade router software in an incremental fashion. We have designed and implemented a high performance, modular, extended integrated services router software architecture in the NetBSD operating system kernel. This architecture allows code modules, called plugins , to be dynamically added and configured at run time. One of the novel features of our design is the ability to bind different plugins to individual flows; this allows for distinct plugin implementations to seamlessly coexist in the same runtime environment. High performance is achieved through a carefully designed modular architecture; an innovative packet classification algorithm that is both powerful and highly efficient; and by caching that exploits the flow-like characteristics of Internet traffic. Compared to a monolithic best-effort kernel, our implementation requires an average increase in packet processing overhead of only 8%, or 500 cycles/2.1ms per packet when running on a P6/233.",

A major contribution is the feedback mechanism, the key component of end-to-end multicast congestion control schemes. We improve upon the well-known approach of using exponentially weighted random timers by biasing feedback in favor of low-rate receivers while still preventing a response implosion. We evaluate the design using simulation, and demonstrate that TFMCC is both TCP-friendly and scales well to multicast groups with thousands of receivers. We also investigate TFMCC's weaknesses and scaling limits to provide guidance as to application domains for which it is well suited.",

Over the last decade, the Internet has been subject to widespread security attacks.

In fact in some of its components, security was consciously traded for easiness in sharing. Although the advent of electronic commerce has pushed for \"real security\" in the Internet, there are still a large number of users (including computer scientists) that are very vulnerable to attacks, mostly because they are not aware of the nature (and ease) of the attacks and still believe that a \"good\" password is all they need to be concerned about.Aiming for a better understanding of the subject, we wrote a first paper [1] in which we discussed several threats and attacks related to TCP/IP . The present work is an extension of the first one, and its main goal is to include T/TCP in the discussion. Additionally, in an effort to make this paper more comprehensive, we included some sections from the former.Besides the description of each attack (the what ), we also discuss the way they are carried out (the how ) and, when possible, the related means of prevention, detection and/or defense.",

We also investigate the effects that different flow classifiers and various timer values have on performance, and note that some choices can result in a large VC space requirement.

We study how to optimize throughput of large transfers across richly connected, adaptive overlay networks, focusing on the potential of collaborative transfers between peers to supplement ongoing downloads. First, we make the case for an erasure-resilient encoding of the content. Using the digital fountain encoding approach, end-hosts can efficiently reconstruct the original content of size $n$ from a subset of any $n$ symbols drawn from a large universe of encoded symbols. Such an approach affords reliability and a substantial degree of application-level flexibility, as it seamlessly accommodates connection migration and parallel transfers while providing resilience to packet loss. However, since the sets of encoded symbols acquired by peers during downloads may overlap substantially, care must be taken to enable them to collaborate effectively. Our main contribution is a collection of useful algorithmic tools for efficient estimation, summarization, and approximate reconciliation of sets of symbols between pairs of collaborating peers, all of which keep message complexity and computation to a minimum. Through simulations and experiments on a prototype implementation, we demonstrate the performance benefits of our informed content delivery mechanisms and how they complement existing overlay network architectures.",

The analysis indicates that MD5 software currently runs at 85 Mbps on a 190 Mhz RISC architecture, a rate that cannot be improved more than 20-40%. Because MD5 processes the entire body of a packet, this data rate is insufficient for current high bandwidth networks, including HiPPI and FiberChannel. Further analysis indicates that a 300 Mhz custom VLSI CMOS hardware implementation of MD5 may run as fast as 256 Mbps. The hardware rate cannot support existing IPv4 data rates on high bandwidth links (800 Mbps HiPPI). The use of MD5 as the default required authentication algorithm in IPv6 should therefore be reconsidered, and an alternative should be proposed.

    "abstract": "Recently there has been renewed interest in circuit switching because of the ease of building very high capacity optical circuit switches. This poster studies the performance, as seen by the end user, of an Internet that uses circuit switching instead of, or in addition to, packet switching. TCP represents over 90% of current Internet traffic, which makes our usage of the network very connection oriented. Therefore, the key performance metric for the end user is the completion time for each connection, which we refer to as response time.On the face of it, simply considering circuit switching as an alternative would seem a pointless exercise; the Internet is packet switched, and was deliberately built that way to enable the efficiencies afforded by statistical multiplexing, and thus it should provide a response time that is faster than that of circuit switching. However, link utilization is low, and falling, particularly at the core of the Internet, which means that statistical multiplexing is less important than it once was.In this poster, we explore the performance of a network where a new circuit is created for each application flow, with particular emphasis on the response time experienced by users. We use simple M/G/1 and M/G/N queues to model application flows in both packet switched and circuit switched networks, as well as ns-2 simulations to validate the results. We conclude that because of high-bandwidth long-lived flows, it does not make sense to use circuit switching in shared access or local area networks. At the same time, our results suggest that in the core of the network, where access links limit the maximum flow rate, and where high capacity is needed most, there is little or no difference in performance between circuit switching and packet switching. Given that circuit switches can be built to have higher capacity than packet switches, this suggests that a circuit switched core warrants further investigation.There are other performance metrics that are also very important when deciding whether circuit switching is a good technology for the Internet, such as scalability, simplicity, cost, reliability and availability, Quality of Service (QoS), or traffic engineering. We have used such criteria in other studies, but they will not be discussed in the poster with great detail given the space constraints. The end result is that we greatly benefit from the use of circuit switching in the backbone of the Internet.Our current use of the network is very connection oriented, and, thus, it fits well with a network core that is circuit switched, while the edges use packet switching. We may just use a gateway that maps packet switched flows (e.g. TCP connections) to circuits. This gateway creates and destroys circuits as flows come and go. Then the deployment of circuit switching in the core does not require any change in existing end hosts and routers, which will continue to use IP the same way as today, as the gateways will hide the existence of circuits in the core. With this network architecture, circuit switched clouds can be inserted gradually, without requiring a flag day in the Internet.",

In the new algorithm, each node maintains a data base describing the delay on each network line. A shortest-path computation is run in each node which explicitly computes the minimum-delay paths (based on the delay entries in the data base) from that node to all other nodes in the network. The average delay on each network line is measured periodically by the nodes attached to the lines. These measured delays are broadcast to all network nodes, so that all nodes use the same data base for performing their shortest-path computations. The new routing algorithm was extensively tested on the ARPANET before being released. This paper describes the algorithm and summarizes the results of these tests.",

Consisting of a large collection of small wireless, low-power, unattended sensors and/or actuators, wireless sensor network technology poses its unique design challenges. Given their unattended nature and their complexity, it is critical that the users be given continuously updated indications of the sensor network health, i.e., explicit knowledge of the overall state of the sensor network after deployment. We call such indications of network health scans. Such macroscopic view of resources or activities in large sensor networks can provide users early warning of system failure, aid in incremental deployment of sensors, or tuning sensor collaboration algorithms.Monitoring wireless sensor networks leads to different challenges compared to existing diagnosis protocols for the Internet, or monitoring systems in other domains such as telecommunication networks, or power generation systems. The monitoring system should introduce minimal impact on network lifetime, scale with network size, yet preserve the fidelity of the overall picture. We propose Sensor Network Tomography to construct abstracted scans of sensor network health by applying localized algorithms in sensor networks for energy-efficient in-network aggregation of local representations of scans. Rather than collect detailed state information from each individual sensor node and then process centrally, this technique builds a composite scan by combining local scans piecewise on their way towards a collecting point. When local scans are aggregated, detailed information at an individual node may be lost. However, the compactness of such an abstracted representation can reduce the communication and processing cost significantly.",

The interesting challenge for the scheme is to use a minimal amount of feedback (one bit in each packet) from the network to adjust the amount of traffic allowed into the network. The servers in the network detect congestion and set a congestion indication bit on packets flowing in the forward direction. The congestion indication is communicated back to the users through the transport level acknowledgement. The scheme is distributed, adapts to the dynamic state of the networks, converges to the optimal operating point, is quite simple to implement, and has low overhead while operational. The scheme also addresses a very important aspect of fairness in the service provided to the various sources utilizing the network. The scheme attempts to maintain fairness in service provided to multiple sources. This paper presents the scheme and the analysis that went into the choice of the various decision mechanisms. We also address the performance of the scheme under transient changes in the network and for pathological conditions.",

Self-similarity, long-range dependence, multifractal behavior and finally cascades have been studied and convincingly matched to real traffic. The first purpose of this paper is to provide a methodology to go beyond the naive analysis of the second-order wavelet-based estimators of scaling, by performing non-stationarity checks and relying on the information contained in the high-order properties of the wavelet coefficients. Then, we apply this methodology to study the scaling properties of the TCP flow arrivals based on several traffic traces spanning the years from 1993 to early 2002. Our study reveals that the second-order scaling properties of this process describe its dynamics quite well. However, our analysis also provides evidence that high-order scaling in this process appears due to pathological behaviors like rate limitation and non-stationarity.",

It ensures metrics in data headers such as time to live and congestion notification will arrive at each relay carrying a truthful prediction of the remainder of their path. We propose mechanisms at the network edge that ensure the dominant selfish strategy of both network domains and end-points will be to set these headers honestly and to respond correctly to path congestion and delay, despite conflicting interests. Although these mechanisms influence incentives, they don't involve tampering with end-user pricing. We describe a TCP rate policer as a specific example of this new capability. We show it can be generalised to police various qualities of service. We also sketch how a limited form of re-feedback could be deployed incrementally around unmodified routers without changing IP.",

The properties of these building blocks and their interaction define the overall behavior of the protocol. In this paper, we aim to identify the major research challenges and questions in the building block approach. By addressing some of those questions, we point out potential directions to analyze and understand the behavior of networking protocols systematically.

One of the crucial factors that limits the accuracy of prior tools is that these do not incorporate variations across TCP implementations (for different operating systems) that have different parameters (e.g., timer granularity, minimum RTO, duplicate ACK thresholds, etc.) or algorithms that influence what can be inferred about out-of-sequence segments. Our tool explicitly accounts for implementation-specific details in four prominent TCP stacks (Windows, Linux, FreeBSD/Mac OS-X, and Solaris). We validate our tool through several controlled experiments with instances of all four OS-specific implementations used in the analysis. We then run this tool on packet traces of 52 million Internet TCP connections collected from 5 different locations and present the results.

    "abstract": "Consider the problem of providing a logical channel for message exchange between two user processes in a network environment. When is protocol conversion needed? To answer this question, we first define a model of layered architectures. Specifically, three stepwise refinement rules are given. Any architecture that can be obtained by a sequence of applications of the stepwise refinement rules is said to be well-structured. We show that this class of well-structured architectures has several correctness properties. It is also very general and includes many well-known networking and internetworking architectures in the literature. Logical connectivity in such an architecture is defined recursively. As a result, to determine if a logical channel can be provided between two user processes, it is sufficient to examine peer protocols specified for each level of the architecture's hierarchy of processes one at a time. Thus the original problem reduces to the problem of determining if a set of processes will interoperate. When protocol conversion is needed to achieve interoperability between processes that implement different protocols, how should it be done? How does one prove that a conversion is correct? What is meant by a correct conversion? We propose the use of projections and image protocols (previously developed by Lam and Shankar for protocol verification [10]) for specifying conversions and for reasoning about the correctness of conversions. Given two processes implementing different protocols P and Q, our objective is to find the largest protocol that is an image protocol of P as well as Q. The correctness of the conversion is a consequence of the correctness properties of image protocols. There are several open problems. Most importantly, heuristics are used for finding the necessary image protocol for conversion. Although, an image protocol common to both P and Q can always be found, it may not be easy to find one with useful functionality. There are also some implementation and design issues to be addressed, such as: the construction of converters that are transparent and converters that add functionality to an image protocol common to P and Q.",

    "abstract": "The demand for wireless bandwidth in indoor environments such as homes and offices continues to increase rapidly. Although wireless technologies such as MIMO can reach link throughputs of 100s of Mbps (802.11n) for a single link, the question of how we can deliver high throughput to a large number of densely-packed devices remains an open problem. Directional antennas have been shown to be an effective way to increase spatial reuse, but past work has focused largely on outdoor environments where the interactions between wireless links can usually be ignored. This assumption is not acceptable in dense indoor wireless networks since indoor deployments need to deal with rich scattering and multipath effects. In this paper we introduce DIRC, a wireless network design whose access points use phased array antennas to achieve high throughput in dense, indoor environments. The core of DIRC is an algorithm that increases spatial reuse and maximizes overall network capacity by optimizing the orientations of a network of directional antennas. We implemented DIRC and evaluated it on a nine node network in an enterprise setting. Our results show that DIRC improves overall network capacity in indoor environments, while being flexible enough to adapt to node mobility and changing traffic workloads.",

The changes are made to the network in the form of upgrades such as software or hardware upgrades, new network or service features and network configuration changes. It is crucial to monitor the network when upgrades are made because they can have a significant impact on network performance and if not monitored may lead to unexpected consequences in operational networks. This can be achieved manually for a small number of devices, but does not scale to large networks with hundreds or thousands of routers and extremely large number of different upgrades made on a regular basis. In this paper, we design and implement a novel infrastructure MERCURY for detecting the impact of network upgrades (or triggers) on performance. MERCURY extracts interesting triggers from a large number of network maintenance activities. It then identifies behavior changes in network performance caused by the triggers. It uses statistical rule mining and network configuration to identify commonality across the behavior changes. We systematically evaluate MERCURY using data collected at a large tier-1 ISP network. By comparing to operational practice, we show that MERCURY is able to capture the interesting triggers and behavior changes induced by the triggers. In some cases, MERCURY also discovers previously unknown network behaviors demonstrating the effectiveness in identifying network conditions flying under the radar.",

Each neighboring node has artificial forces to repel other nodes to perform tasks at different time phases. Nodes with closer time phases have stronger forces to repel each other in the time domain. Each node adjusts its time phase proportionally to its received forces. Once the received forces are balanced, nodes are desynchronized. We evaluate our implementation of DWARF on TOSSIM, a simulator for wireless sensor networks. The simulation results indicate that DWARF incurs significantly lower desynchronization error and scales much better than existing approaches.",

Moreover, we propose an attribute-based routing scheme that offers interest confidentiality. A prototype system is implemented based on CCNx, a popular open source version of ICN, to showcase privacy preservation in Smart Neighborhood and Smart City applications.",

    "abstract": "A thorough understanding of the network impact of emerging large-scale distributed systems -- where traffic flows and what it costs -- must encompass users' behavior, the traffic they generate and the topology over which that traffic flows. In the case of BitTorrent, however, previous studies have been limited by narrow perspectives that restrict such analysis. This paper presents a comprehensive view of BitTorrent, using data from a representative set of 500,000 users sampled over a two year period, located in 169 countries and 3,150 networks. This unique perspective captures unseen trends and reveals several unexpected features of the largest peer-to-peer system. For instance, over the past year total BitTorrent traffic has increased by 12% , driven by 25% increases in per-peer hourly download volume despite a 10% decrease in the average number of online peers. We also observe stronger diurnal usage patterns and, surprisingly given the bandwidth-intensive nature of the application, a close alignment between these patterns and overall traffic. Considering the aggregated traffic across access links, this has potential implications on BitTorrent-associated costs for Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Using data from a transit ISP, we find a disproportionately large impact on a commonly used burstable (95th-percentile) billing model. Last, when examining BitTorrent traffic's paths, we find that for over half its users, most network traffic never reaches large transit networks, but is instead carried by small transit ISPs. This raises questions on the effectiveness of most in-network monitoring systems to capture trends on peer-to-peer traffic and further motivates our approach.",

    "abstract": "The ability to detect what unlicensed radios are operating in a neigh borhood, their spectrum occupancies and the spatial directions their signals are traversing is a fundamental primitive needed by many applications, ranging from smart radios to coexistence to network management to security. In this paper we present DOF, a detector that in a single framework accurately estimates all three parameters. DOF builds on the insight that in most wireless protocols, there are hidden repeating patterns in the signals that can be used to construct unique signatures, and accurately estimate signal types and their spectral and spatial parameters. We show via experimental evaluation in an indoor testbed that DOF is robust and accurate , it achieves greater than 85% accuracy even when the SNRs of the detected signals are as low as 0 dB, and even when there are multiple interfering signals present. To demonstrate the benefits of DOF, we design and implement a preliminary prototype of a smart radio that operates on top of DOF, and show experimentally that it provides a 80% increase in throughput over Jello, the best known prior implementation, while causing less than 10% performance drop for co-existing WiFi and Zigbee radios.",

    "abstract": "Driven by the soaring demands for always-on and fast-response online services, modern datacenter networks have recently undergone tremendous growth. These networks often rely on commodity hardware to reach immense scale while keeping capital expenses under check. The downside is that commodity devices are prone to failures, raising a formidable challenge for network operators to promptly handle these failures with minimal disruptions to the hosted services. Recent research efforts have focused on automatic failure localization. Yet, resolving failures still requires significant human interventions, resulting in prolonged failure recovery time. Unlike previous work, NetPilot aims to quickly mitigate rather than resolve failures. NetPilot mitigates failures in much the same way operators do -- by deactivating or restarting suspected offending components. NetPilot circumvents the need for knowing the exact root cause of a failure by taking an intelligent trial-and-error approach. The core of NetPilot is comprised of an Impact Estimator that helps guard against overly disruptive mitigation actions and a failure-specific mitigation planner that minimizes the number of trials. We demonstrate that NetPilot can effectively mitigate several types of critical failures commonly encountered in production datacenter networks.",

    "abstract": "Internet services are often deployed in multiple (tens to hundreds) of geographically distributed data centers. They rely on Global Traffic Management (GTM) solutions to direct clients to the optimal data center based on a number of criteria like network performance, geographic location, availability, etc. The GTM solutions, however, have a fundamental design limitation in their ability to accurately map clients to data centers - they use the IP address of the local DNS resolver (LDNS) used by a client as a proxy for the true client identity, which in some cases causes suboptimal performance. This issue is known as the client-LDNS mismatch problem. We argue that recent proposals to address the problem suffer from serious limitations. We then propose a simple new solution, named ``FQDN extension'', which can solve the client-LDNS mismatch problem completely. We build a prototype system and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Using JavaScript, the solution can be deployed immediately for some online services, such as Web search, without modifying either client or local resolver.",

While the benefits and technological challenges of providing such routing models have been articulated and studied intensively over the last years, less is known about the underlying algorithmic traffic routing problems. The goal of this paper is to provide the network community with an overview of algorithmic techniques for waypoint routing and also inform about limitations due to computational hardness. In particular, we put the waypoint routing problem into perspective with respect to classic graph theoretical problems. For example, we find that while computing a shortest path from a source s to a destination t is simple (e.g., using Dijkstra’s algorithm), the problem of finding a shortest route from s to t via a single waypoint already features a deep combinatorial structure.",

    "abstract": "Anycast has been widely adopted by today's Internet services, including DNS, CDN, and DDoS protection, in which the same IP address is announced from distributed locations and clients are directed to the topologically-nearest service replica. Prior research has focused on various aspects of anycast, either its usage in particular services such as DNS or characterizing its adoption by Internet-wide active probing methods. In this paper, we first explore an alternative approach to characterize anycast based on previously collected global BGP routing information. Leveraging state-of-the-art active measurement results as near-ground-truth, our passive method without requiring any Internet-wide probes can achieve 90% accuracy in detecting anycast prefixes. More importantly, our approach uncovers anycast prefixes that have been missed by prior datasets based on active measurements. While investigating the root causes of inaccuracy, we reveal that anycast routing has been entangled with the increased adoption of remote peering, a type of layer-2 interconnection where an IP network may peer at an IXP remotely without being physically present at the IXP. The invisibility of remote peering from layer-3 breaks the assumption of the shortest AS paths on BGP and causes an unintended impact on anycast performance. We identify such cases from BGP routing information and observe that at least 19.2% of anycast prefixes have been potentially impacted by remote peering.",

Origin authentication already does much to improve routing security. Moreover, the transition to S*BGP is expected to be long and slow, with S*BGP coexisting in \"partial deployment\" alongside BGP for a long time. We therefore use theoretical and experimental approach to study the security benefits provided by partially-deployed S*BGP, vis-a-vis those already provided by origin authentication. Because routing policies have a profound impact on routing security, we use a survey of 100 network operators to find the policies that are likely to be most popular during partial S*BGP deployment. We find that S*BGP provides only meagre benefits over origin authentication when these popular policies are used. We also study the security benefits of other routing policies, provide prescriptive guidelines for partially-deployed S*BGP, and show how interactions between S*BGP and BGP can introduce new vulnerabilities into the routing system.",

This little-known fact is due to a few hundreds of member ASes exchanging traffic with one another over the IXP's infrastructure. This paper reports on a first-of-its-kind and in-depth analysis of one of the largest IXPs worldwide based on nine months' worth of sFlow records collected at that IXP in 2011. A main finding of our study is that the number of actual peering links at this single IXP exceeds the number of total AS links of the peer-peer type in the entire Internet known as of 2010! To explain such a surprisingly rich peering fabric, we examine in detail this IXP's ecosystem and highlight the diversity of networks that are members at this IXP and connect there with other member ASes for reasons that are similarly diverse, but can be partially inferred from their business types and observed traffic patterns. In the process, we investigate this IXP's traffic matrix and illustrate what its temporal and structural properties can tell us about the member ASes that generated the traffic in the first place. While our results suggest that these large IXPs can be viewed as a microcosm of the Internet ecosystem itself, they also argue for a re-assessment of the mental picture that our community has about this ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "A large volume of research has been conducted in the cognitive radio (CR) area the last decade. However, the deployment of a commercial CR network is yet to emerge. A large portion of the existing literature does not build on real world scenarios, hence, neglecting various important aspects of commercial telecommunication networks. For instance, a lot of attention has been paid to spectrum sensing as the front line functionality that needs to be completed in an efficient and accurate manner to enable an opportunistic CR network architecture. While on the one hand it is necessary to detect the existence of spectrum holes, on the other hand, simply sensing (cooperatively or not) the energy emitted from a primary transmitter cannot enable correct dynamic spectrum access. For example, the presence of a primary transmitter's signal does not mean that CR network users cannot access the spectrum since there might not be any primary receiver in the vicinity. Despite the existing solutions to the DSA problem no robust, implementable scheme has emerged. The set of assumptions that these schemes are built upon do not always hold in realistic, wireless environments. Specific settings are assumed, which differ significantly from how existing telecommunication networks work. In this paper, we challenge the basic premises of the proposed schemes. We further argue that addressing the technical challenges we face in deploying robust CR networks can only be achieved if we radically change the way we design their basic functionalities. In support of our argument, we present a set of real-world scenarios, inspired by realistic settings in commercial telecommunications networks, namely TV and cellular, focusing on spectrum sensing as a basic and critical functionality in the deployment of CRs. We use these scenarios to show why existing DSA paradigms are not amenable to realistic deployment in complex wireless environments. The proposed study extends beyond cognitive radio networks, and further highlights the often existing gap between research and commercialization, paving the way to new thinking about how to accelerate commercialization and adoption of new networking technologies and services.",

Using a 34-months long (Aug 2014-Jun 2017) dataset, we show that success rates of streaming a stall-free version of a video over IPv6 have improved over time. We show that a Happy Eyeballs (HE) race during initial TCP connection establishment leads to a strong (more than 97%) preference over IPv6. However, even though clients prefer streaming videos over IPv6, we observe worse performance over IPv6 than over IPv4. We witness consistently higher TCP connection establishment times and startup delays (∼100 ms or more) over IPv6. We also observe consistently lower achieved throughput both for audio and video over IPv6. We observe less than 1% stall rates over both address families. Due to lower stall rates, bitrates that can be reliably streamed over both address families are comparable. However, in situations, where a stall does occur, 80% of the samples experience higher stall durations that are at least 1s longer over IPv6 and have not reduced over time. The worse performance over IPv6 is due to the disparity in the availability of Google Global Caches (GGC) over IPv6. The measurements performed in this work using the youtube test and the entire dataset is made available to the measurement community.",

However, unbounded end-to-end (e2e) latency of Service Function Chains (SFCs) resulting from distributed Virtualized Network Function (VNF) deployments can severely degrade performance. In particular, SFC instantiations with inter-data center links can incur high e2e latencies and Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations. These latencies can trigger timeouts and protocol errors with latency-sensitive operations. Traditional solutions to reduce e2e latency involve physical deployment of service elements in close proximity. These solutions are, however, no longer viable in the NFV era. In this paper, we present our solution that bounds the e2e latency in SFCs and inter-VNF control message exchanges by creating micro-service aggregates based on the affinity between VNFs. Our system, Contain-ed, dynamically creates and manages affinity aggregates using light-weight virtualization technologies like containers, allowing them to be placed in close proximity and hence bounding the e2e latency. We have applied Contain-ed to the Clearwater IP Multimedia Subsystem and built a proof-of-concept. Our results demonstrate that, by utilizing application and protocol specific knowledge, affinity aggregates can effectively bound SFC delays and significantly reduce protocol errors and service disruptions.",

    "abstract": "Major cloud providers offer networks of virtual machines with private IP addresses as a service on the cloud. To isolate the address space of different customers, customers are required to tunnel their traffic to a Virtual Private Network (VPN) gateway, which is typically a middlebox inside the cloud that internally tunnels each packet to the correct destination. To improve performance, an increasing number of enterprises connect directly to the cloud provider's network at the edge, to a device we call the provider's edge (PE). PE is a chokepoint for customer's traffic to the cloud, and therefore a natural candidate for implementing network functions concerning customers' virtual networks, including the VPN gateway, to avoid a detour to middleboxes inside the cloud. At the scale of today's cloud providers, VPN gateways need to maintain information for around a million internal tunnels. We argue that no single commodity device can handle these many tunnels while providing a high enough port density to connect to hundreds of cloud customers at the edge. Thus, in this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture for the PE, consisting of a commodity switch, connected to a commodity server which uses Data-Plane Development Kit (DPDK) for fast packet processing. This architecture enables a variety of network functions at the edge by offering the benefits of both hardware and software data planes. We implement a scalable VPN gateway on our proposed PE and show that it matches the scale requirements of today's cloud providers while processing packets close to line rate.",

    "abstract": "Researchers depend on public BGP data to understand the structure and evolution of the AS topology, as well as the operational security and resiliency of BGP. BGP data is provided voluntarily by network operators who establish BGP sessions with route collectors that record this data. In this paper, we show how trivial it is for a single vantage point (VP) to introduce thousands of spurious routes into the collection by providing examples of five VPs that did so. We explore the impact these misbehaving VPs had on AS relationship inference, showing these misbehaving VPs introduced thousands of AS links that did not exist, and caused relationship inferences for links that did exist to be corrupted. We evaluate methods to automatically identify misbehaving VPs, although we find the result unsatisfying because the limitations of real-world BGP practices and AS relationship inference algorithms produce signatures similar to those created by misbehaving VPs. The most recent misbehaving VP we discovered added thousands of spurious routes for nine consecutive months until 8 November 2012. This misbehaving VP barely impacts (0.1%) our validation of our AS relationship inferences, but this number may be misleading since most of our validation data relies on BGP and RPSL which validates only existing links, rather than asserting the non-existence of links. We have only a few assertions of non-existent routes, all received via our public-facing website that allows operators to provide validation data through our interactive feedback mechanism. We only discovered this misbehavior because two independent operators corrected some inferences, and we noticed that the spurious routes all came from the same VP. This event highlights the limitations of even the best available topology data, and provides additional evidence that comprehensive ground truth validation from operators is essential to scientific research on Internet topology.",

    "abstract": "The ever-increasing Internet traffic poses challenges to network operators and administrators that have to analyze large network datasets in a timely manner to make decisions regarding network routing, dimensioning, accountability and security. Network datasets collected at large networks such as Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) can be in the order of Terabytes per hour. Unfortunately, most of the current network analysis approaches are ad-hoc and centralized, and thus not scalable. In this paper, we present Datix, a fully decentralized, open-source analytics system for network traffic data that relies on smart partitioning storage schemes to support fast join algorithms and efficient execution of filtering queries. We outline the architecture and design of Datix and we present the evaluation of Datix using real traces from an operational IXP. Datix is a system that deals with an important problem in the intersection of data management and network monitoring while utilizing state-of-the-art distributed processing engines. In brief, Datix manages to efficiently answer queries within minutes compared to more than 24 hours processing when executing existing Python based code in single node setups. Datix also achieves nearly 70% speedup compared to baseline query implementations of popular big data analytics engines such as Hive and Shark.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the rapid emergence of programmable switches, programmable network interface cards, and software packet processing, this paper asks: given a network task (e.g., virtualization or measurement) in a programmable network, should we implement it at the network's end hosts (the edge) or its switches (the core)? To answer this question, we analyze a range of common network tasks spanning virtualization, deep packet inspection, measurement, application acceleration, and resource management. We conclude that, while the edge is better or even required for certain network tasks (e.g., virtualization, deep packet inspection, and access control), implementing other tasks (e.g., measurement, congestion control, and scheduling) in the network's core has significant benefits---especially as we raise the bar for the performance we demand from our networks. More generally, we extract two primary properties that govern where a network task should be implemented: (1) time scales , or how quickly a task needs to respond to changes, and (2) data locality , or the placement of tasks close to the data that they must access. For instance, we find that the core is preferable when implementing tasks that need to run at short time scales, e.g., detecting fleeting and infrequent microbursts or rapid convergence to fair shares in congestion control. Similarly, we observe that tasks should be placed close to the state that they need to access, e.g., at the edge for deep packet inspection that requires private keys, and in the core for congestion control and measurement that needs to access queue depth information at switches.",

    "abstract": "Understanding web co-location is essential for various reasons. For instance, it can help one to assess the collateral damage that denial-of-service attacks or IP-based blocking can cause to the availability of co-located web sites. However, it has been more than a decade since the first study was conducted in 2007. The Internet infrastructure has changed drastically since then, necessitating a renewed study to comprehend the nature of web co-location. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to revisit web co-location using datasets collected from active DNS measurements. Our results show that the web is still small and centralized to a handful of hosting providers. More specifically, we find that more than 60% of web sites are co-located with at least ten other web sites---a group comprising less popular web sites. In contrast, 17.5% of mostly popular web sites are served from their own servers. Although a high degree of web co-location could make co-hosted sites vulnerable to DoS attacks, our findings show that it is an increasing trend to co-host many web sites and serve them from well-provisioned content delivery networks (CDN) of major providers that provide advanced DoS protection benefits. Regardless of the high degree of web co-location, our analyses of popular block lists indicate that IP-based blocking does not cause severe collateral damage as previously thought.",

    "abstract": "Despite the pervasiveness of Internet censorship, we have scant data on its extent, mechanisms, and evolution. Measuring censorship is challenging: it requires continual measurement of reachability to many target sites from diverse vantage points. Amassing suitable vantage points for longitudinal measurement is difficult; existing systems have achieved only small, short-lived deployments. We observe, however, that most Internet users access content via Web browsers, and the very nature of Web site design allows browsers to make requests to domains with different origins than the main Web page. We present Encore, a system that harnesses cross-origin requests to measure Web filtering from a diverse set of vantage points without requiring users to install custom software, enabling longitudinal measurements from many vantage points. We explain how Encore induces Web clients to perform cross-origin requests that measure Web filtering, design a distributed platform for scheduling and collecting these measurements, show the feasibility of a global-scale deployment with a pilot study and an analysis of potentially censored Web content, identify several cases of filtering in six months of measurements, and discuss ethical concerns that would arise with widespread deployment.",

    "abstract": "Software data planes running on commodity servers are very popular in real deployments. However, to attain top class performance, the software approach requires the adoption of accelerated network I/O frameworks, each of them characterized by its own programming model and API. As a result, network applications are often closely tied to the underlying technology, with obvious issues of portability over different systems. This is especially true in cloud scenarios where different I/O frameworks could be installed depending on the configuration of the physical servers in the infrastructure. The nethuns library proposes a unified programming abstraction to access and manage network operations over different I/O frameworks. The library is freely available to the community under the BSD license and currently supports AF_XDP and netmap for fast packet handling along with the classic AF_PACKET and the pcap library. Network applications based on nethuns need only to be re-compiled to run over a different network API. The experiments prove that the overhead introduced by nethuns is negligible, hence making it a convenient programming platform that eases the coding process while guaranteeing high performance and portability. As proofs of concept, a handy traffic generator as well as the popular Open vSwitch application have been successfully ported and tested over nethuns.",

Large companies can take advantage of a deluge of data, typically withhold from the research community due to privacy or business sensitivity concerns, and this is particularly true for networking data. Therefore, the lack of high quality data is often recognized as one of the main factors currently limiting networking research from fully leveraging AI methodologies potential. Following numerous requests we received from the scientific community, we release AppClassNet, a commercial-grade dataset for benchmarking traffic classification and management methodologies. AppClassNet is significantly larger than the datasets generally available to the academic community in terms of both the number of samples and classes, and reaches scales similar to the popular ImageNet dataset commonly used in computer vision literature. To avoid leaking user- and business-sensitive information, we opportunely anonymized the dataset, while empirically showing that it still represents a relevant benchmark for algorithmic research. In this paper, we describe the public dataset and our anonymization process. We hope that AppClassNet can be instrumental for other researchers to address more complex commercial-grade problems in the broad field of traffic classification and management.",

    "abstract": "Domain lists are a key ingredient for representative censuses of the Web. Unfortunately, such censuses typically lack a view on domains under country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs). This introduces unwanted bias: many countries have a rich local Web that remains hidden if their ccTLDs are not considered. The reason ccTLDs are rarely considered is that gaining access - if possible at all - is often laborious. To tackle this, we ask: what can we learn about ccTLDs from public sources? We extract domain names under ccTLDs from 6 years of public data from Certificate Transparency logs and Common Crawl. We compare this against ground truth for 19 ccTLDs for which we have the full DNS zone. We find that public data covers 43%-80% of these ccTLDs, and that coverage grows over time. By also comparing port scan data we then show that these public sources reveal a significant part of the Web presence under a ccTLD. We conclude that in the absence of full access to ccTLDs, domain names learned from public sources can be a good proxy when performing Web censuses.",

However, they cannot be easily deployed in a backbone environment with thousands of sessions, as their complexity increases with the number of sessions. In this paper, we propose and analyze an approach that uses a simple buffer management scheme to provide rate guarantees to individual flows (or to a set of flows) multiplexed into a common FIFO queue. We establish the buffer allocation requirements to achieve these rate guarantees and study the trade-off between the achievable link utilization and the buffer size required with the proposed scheme. The aspect of fair access to excess bandwidth is also addressed, and its mapping onto a buffer allocation rule is investigated. Numerical examples are provided that illustrate the performance of the proposed schemes. Finally, a scalable architecture for QoS provisioning is presented that integrates the proposed buffer management scheme with WFQ scheduling that uses a small number of queues.",

In this paper, we reveal how handovers of multicast connections can be achieved in a manner irrespective of whether these multicast trees are source-, server- or core-based. More importantly, we demonstrate how the enhanced hybrid handover protocol incorporating crossover switch discovery can be used to support handovers of heterogeneous (i.e., unicast and multicast) connections in a uniform and unified manner, for Wireless ATM LANs employing either the centralised or distributed connection management scheme.",

    "abstract": "Robustness has long been a central design goal of the Internet. Much of the initial effort towards robustness focusedon the \"fail-stop\" model, where node failures are complete and easily detectable by other nodes. The Internet is quite robust against such failures, routinely surviving various catastrophes with only limited outages. This robustness is largely due to the widespread belief in a set of guidelines for critical design decisions such as where to initiate recovery and how to maintain state.However, the Internet remains extremely vulnerable to more arbitrary failures where, through either error or malice, a node issues syntactically correct responses that are not semantically correct. Such failures, some as simple as misconfigured routing state, can seriously undemnine the functioning of the Internet. With the Internet playing such a central role in the global telecommunications infrastructure, this level of vulnerability is no longer acceptable.In this paper we argue that to make the Internet more robust to these kinds of arbitrary failures, we need to change the way we design network protocols. To this end, we propose a set of six design guidelines for improving the network protocol design. These guidelines emerged from a study of past examples of failures, and determining what could have been done to prevent the problem from occurring in the first place. The unifying theme behind the various guidelines is that we need to design protocols more defensively, expecting malicious attack, misimplementation, and misconfiguration at every turn.",

Ethernet has been the dominant local area network architecture in the last decade, and we believe that it will remain popular because of its cost-effectiveness and the availability of higher-bandwidth Ethernets. We present the design, implementation and evaluation of a software-based timed-token protocol called RETHER that provides real-time performance guarantees to multimedia applications without requiring any modifications to existing Ethernet hardware. RETHER features a hybrid mode of operation to reduce the performance impact on non-real-time network traffic, a race-condition-free distributed admission control mechanism, and an efficient token-passing scheme that protects the network against token loss due to node failures or otherwise. To our knowledge, this is the first software implementation of a real-time protocol over existing Ethernet hardware. Performance measurements from experiments on a 10 Mbps Ethernet indicate that up to 60% of the raw bandwidth can be reserved without deteriorating the performance of non-real-time traffic. Additional simulations for high bandwidth networks and faster workstation hardware indicate that the protocol allows reservation of a greater percentage of the available bandwidth.",

This paper proposes HBH (Hop-By-Hop multicast routing protocol). HBH adopts the source-specific channel abstraction to simplify address allocation and implements data distribution using recursive unicast trees, which allow the transparent support of unicast-only routers. Additionally, HBH is original because its tree construction algorithm takes into account the unicast routing asymmetries. As most multicast routing protocols rely on the unicast infrastructure, these asymmetries impact the structure of the multicast trees. We show through simulation that HBH outperforms other multicast routing protocols in terms of the delay experienced by the receivers and the bandwidth consumption of the multicast trees.",

    "abstract": "Routing is a black art in today's Internet. End users and ISPs alike have little control over how their packets are handled outside of their networks, stemming in part from limitations of the current wide-area routing protocol, BGP. We believe that many of these constraints are due to policy-based restrictions on route-exportation. Separating forwarding policy from route discovery would allow users to select among the possibly many inter-AS paths available to them and enable ISPs to more effectively manage the end-to-end behavior of their customers' traffic.As a concrete mechanism for enforcing forwarding policy, we purpose the concept of a network capability that binds together a path request, an accountable resource principal, and an authorizing agent. Network capabilities are central to Platypus, a loose source routing protocol we are designing, which composes network capabilities authorized by multiple ISPs to construct alternative inter-AS routes that can be independently validated and accounted for on the fly.",

    "abstract": "Current congestion control algorithms treat packet loss as an indication of network congestion, under the assumption that most losses are caused by router queues overflowing. In response to losses (congestion), a sender reduces its sending rate in an effort to reduce contention for shared network resources. In network paths where a non-negligible portion of loss is caused by packet corruption, performance can suffer due to needless reductions of the sending rate (in response to \"perceived congestion\" that is not really happening). This paper explores a technique, called Cumulative Explicit Transport Error Notification (CETEN), that uses information provided by the network to bring the transport's long-term average sending rate closer to that dictated by only congestion-based losses. We discuss several ways that information about the cumulative rates of packet loss due to congestion and corruption might be obtained from the network or through fairly generic transport layer instrumentation. We then explore two ways to use this information to develop a more appropriate congestion control response (CETEN). The work in this paper is done in terms of TCP. Since numerous transport protocols use TCP-like congestion control schemes, the CETEN techniques we present are applicable to other transports as well. In this paper, we present early simulation results that show CETEN to be a promising technique. In addition, this paper discusses a number of practical and thorny implementation issues associated with CETEN.",

This latter mode, using minipackets, enables BID to be used for those applications having real-time response requirements. In describing BID this report defines the basic concepts of the implicit token, token carrier, token generator, and token wait time. It also describes a new preemption technique which reduces the walk time normally associated with token and polling systems. A GPSS computer simulation was made of the BID system to determine the average delay times experienced by the various priority classes of messages. An analytical model using a single priority class of messages is presented, and the results of the computer simulation are compared with this. The simulation results also indicate the uniformity of the average delays experienced by the Bus Interface Units across the bus resulting from the use of bidirectional flow of tokens.",

    "abstract": "Wireless mesh networks (WMN) have attracted considerable interest in recent years as a convenient, flexible and low-cost alternative to wired communication infrastructures in many contexts. However, the great majority of research on metropolitan-scale WMN has been centered around maximization of available bandwidth, suitable for non-real-time applications such as Internet access for the general public. On the other hand, the suitability of WMN for mission-critical infrastructure applications remains by and large unknown, as protocols typically employed in WMN are, for the most part, not designed for real-time communications. In this paper, we describe the Smart Transport and Roads Communications (STaRComm) project at National ICT Australia (NICTA), which sets a goal of designing a wireless mesh network architecture to solve the communication needs of the traffic control system in Sydney, Australia. This system, known as SCATS (Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System)and used in over 100 cities around the world, connects a hierarchy of several thousand devices -- from individual traffic light controllers to regional computers and the central Traffic Management Centre (TMC)-- and places stringent requirements on the reliability and latency of the data exchanges. We discuss our experience in the deployment of an initial testbed consisting of 7 mesh nodes placed at intersections with traffic lights, and share the results and insights learned from our measurements and initial trials in the process.",

    "abstract": "The available bandwidth of a path directly impacts the performance of throughput sensitive applications, e.g., p2p content replication or podcasting. Several tools have been devised to estimate the available bandwidth. The vast majority of these tools follow either the Probe Rate Model (PRM) or the Probe Gap Model (PGM). Lao et al. [6] and Liu et al. [7] have identified biases in the PGM approach that lead to consistent underestimations of the available bandwidth. Those results were obtained under the ideal assumption of stationary cross traffic. In this note, we confirm the existence of these biases experimentally, i.e., for the case of non stationary cross traffic. To do so, we compare one representative of the PRM family, namely Pathload, and one representative of the PGM family, namely Spruce, using long term (several day long) traces collected on an example path. We first propose a methodology to compare operational results of two available bandwidth measurement tools. Based on the sanitized data obtained using the previous methodology, we next show that the biases identified by previous works are clearly observable on the long term, even with non stationary cross traffic. We further uncover the formal link that exists between the work by Liu et al. and the one by Lao et al.",

Nowhere is this problem more apparent than in the 802.11-based wireless access networks now ubiquitous in the enterprise. In addition to the myriad complexities of the wired network, wireless networks face the additional challenges of shared spectrum, user mobility and authentication management. Not surprisingly, few organizations have the expertise, data or tools to decompose the underlying problems and interactions responsible for transient outages or performance degradations. In this paper, we present a set of modeling techniques for automatically characterizing the source of such problems. In particular, we focus on data transfer delays unique to 802.11 networks - media access dynamics and mobility management latency. Through a combination of measurement, inference and modeling we reconstruct sources of delay - from the physical layer to the transport - layer as well as the interactions among them. We demonstrate our approach using comprehensive traces of wireless activity in the UCSD Computer Science building.",

However, all such schemes suffer from a relatively low speed of convergence and exhibit a biased fairness behavior in moderate bandwidth high delay networks due to utilizing an insufficient amount of congestion feedback. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed ECN-based congestion control protocol to which we refer as Multi Packet Congestion Control Protocol (MPCP). In contrast to other alternatives, MPCP is able to relay a more precise congestion feedback yet preserve the utilization of the two ECN bits. MPCP distributes (extracts) congestion related information into (from) a series of n packets, thus allowing for a 2n-bit quantization of congestion measures with each packet carrying two of 2n bits in its ECN bits. We describe the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of MPCP through both simulations and experimental studies.",

Different software base-bands can easily communicate and coordinate with one another. Thus, it also provides better coexistence among heterogenous wireless standards.

We use web-based measurements to investigate the (latent) Teredo capability of Internet clients, and the delay introduced by Teredo. We compare this with native IPv6 and 6to4 tunnelling capability and delay. We find that only 6--7% of connections are from fully IPv6-capable clients, but an additional 15--16% of connections are from clients that would be IPv6-capable if Windows Teredo was not constrained. However, Teredo increases the median latency to fetch objects by 1--1.5 seconds compared to IPv4 or native IPv6, even with an optimally located Teredo relay.

    "abstract": "Motivated by recent emerging systems that can leverage partially correct packets in wireless networks, this paper investigates the novel concept of error estimating codes (EEC). Without correcting the errors in the packet, EEC enables the receiver of the packet to estimate the packet's bit error rate, which is perhaps the most important meta-information of a partially correct packet. Our EEC algorithm provides provable estimation quality, with rather low redundancy and computational overhead. To demonstrate the utility of EEC, we exploit and implement EEC in two wireless network applications, Wi-Fi rate adaptation and real-time video streaming. Our real-world experiments show that these applications can significantly benefit from EEC.",

    "abstract": "Unlike their cellular counterparts, Wi-Fi networks do not have the luxury of a dedicated control plane that is decoupled from the data plane. Consequently, Wi-Fi struggles to provide many of the capabilities that are taken for granted in cellular networks, including efficient and fair resource allocation, QoS and handoffs. The reason for the lack of a control plane with designated spectrum is that it would impose significant overhead. This is at odds with Wi-Fi's goal of providing a simple, plug-and-play network. In this paper we present Flashback, a novel technique that provides a decoupled low overhead control plane for wireless networks that retains the simplicity of Wi-Fi's distributed asynchronous operation. Flashback allows nodes to reliably send short control messages concurrently with data transmissions, while ensuring that data packets are decoded correctly without harming throughput. We utilize Flashback's novel messaging capability to design, implement and experimentally evaluate a reliable control plane for Wi-Fi with rates from 175Kbps to 400Kbps depending on the environment. Moreover, to demonstrate its broad applicability, we design and implement a novel resource allocation mechanism that utilizes Flashback to provide efficient, QoS-aware and fair medium access, while eliminating control overheads including data plane contention, RTS/CTS and random back offs.",

    "abstract": "In this article I will first argue that a {\\em Service-Infrastructure Cycle} is fundamental to networking evolution. Networks are built to accommodate certain services at an expected scale. New applications and/or a significant increase in scale require a rethinking of network mechanisms which results in new deployments. Four decades-worth of iterations of this process have yielded the Internet as we know it today, a common and shared global networking infrastructure that delivers almost all services. I will further argue, using brief historical case studies, that success of network mechanism deployments often hinges on whether or not mechanism evolution follows the iterations of this Cycle. Many have observed that this network, the Internet, has become ossified and unable to change in response to new demands. In other words, after decades of operation, the Service-Infrastructure Cycle has become stuck. However, novel service requirements and scale increases continue to exert significant pressure on this ossified infrastructure. The result, I will conjecture, will be a fragmentation, the beginnings of which are evident today, that will ultimately fundamentally change the character of the network infrastructure. By ushering in a ManyNets world, this fragmentation will lubricate the Service-Infrastructure Cycle so that it can continue to govern the evolution of networking. I conclude this article with a brief discussion of the possible implications of this emerging ManyNets world on networking research.",

    "abstract": "Over the last few years, we have witnessed the deployment of large measurement platforms that enable measurements from many vantage points. Examples of these platforms include SamKnows and RIPE ATLAS. All told, there are tens of thousands of measurement agents. Most of these measurement agents are located in the end-user premises; these can run measurements against other user agents located in strategic locations, according to the measurements to be performed. Thanks to the large number of measurement agents, these platforms can provide data about key network performance indicators from the end-user perspective. This data is useful to network operators to improve their operations, as well to regulators and to end users themselves. Currently deployed platforms use proprietary protocols to exchange information between the different parts. As these platforms grow to become an important tool to understand network performance, it is important to standardize the protocols between the different elements of the platform. In this paper, we present ongoing standardization efforts in this area as well as the main challenges that these efforts are facing.",

In particular, wireless technology unfetters developing communities from the constraints of infrastructure providing a great opportunity to leapfrog years of neglect and technological waywardness. In this paper, we highlight the role of resource pooling for wireless networks in the developing world. Resource pooling involves (i) abstracting a collection of networked resources to behave like a single unified resource pool and (ii) developing mechanisms for shifting load between the various parts of the unified resource pool. The popularity of resource pooling stems from its ability to provide resilience, high utilization, and flexibility at an acceptable cost. We show that ``resource pooling'', which is very popular in its various manifestations, is the key unifying principle underlying a diverse number of successful wireless technologies (such as white space networking, community networks, etc.). We discuss various applications of resource pooled wireless technologies and provide a discussion on open issues.",

CliMB provides a full-fledged modular TCP layer supporting TCP options, congestion control, both blocking and nonblocking I/O, as well as socket and zero-copy APIs to applications. As a result, any TCP network function may now be realized in Click using a modular L2-L7 design.

    "abstract": "In recent years, Information-centric Networking (ICN) has received much attention from both academic and industry participants. ICN offers data-centric inter-networking that is radically different from today's host-based IP networks. Security and privacy features on today's Internet were originally not present and have been incrementally retrofitted over the last 35 years. As such, these issues have become increasingly important as ICN technology gradually matures towards real-world deployment. Thus, while ICN-based architectures (e.g., NDN, CCNx, etc.) are still evolving, it is both timely and important to explore ICN security and privacy issues as well as devise and assess possible mitigation techniques. This report documents the highlights and outcomes of the Dagstuhl Seminar 16251 on ``Information-centric Networking and Security.'' The goal of which was to bring together researchers to discuss and address security and privacy issues particular to ICN-based architectures. Upon finishing the three-day workshop, the outlook of ICN is still unclear. Many unsolved and ill-addressed problems remain, such as namespace and identity management, object security and forward secrecy, and privacy. Regardless of the fate of ICN, one thing is certain: much more research and practical experience with these systems is needed to make progress towards solving these arduous problems.",

    "abstract": "Understanding, measuring, and debugging IP networks, particularly across administrative domains, is challenging. One particularly daunting aspect of the challenge is the presence of transparent middleboxes---which are now common in today's Internet. In-path middleboxes that modify packet headers are typically transparent to a TCP, yet can impact end-to-end performance or cause blackholes. We develop TCP HICCUPS to reveal packet header manipulation to both endpoints of a TCP connection. HICCUPS permits endpoints to cooperate with currently opaque middleboxes without prior knowledge of their behavior. For example, with visibility into end-to-end behavior, a TCP can selectively enable or disable performance enhancing options. This cooperation enables protocol innovation by allowing new IP or TCP functionality (e.g., ECN, SACK, Multipath TCP, Tcpcrypt) to be deployed without fear of such functionality being misconstrued, modified, or blocked along a path. HICCUPS is incrementally deployable and introduces no new options. We implement and deploy TCP HICCUPS across thousands of disparate Internet paths, highlighting the breadth and scope of subtle and hard to detect middlebox behaviors encountered. We then show how path diagnostic capabilities provided by HICCUPS can benefit applications and the network.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the design and implementation of Geosphere, a physical- and link-layer design for access point-based MIMO wireless networks that consistently improves network throughput. To send multiple streams of data in a MIMO system, prior designs rely on a technique called zero-forcing, a way of \"nulling\" the interference between data streams by mathematically inverting the wireless channel matrix. In general, zero-forcing is highly effective, significantly improving throughput. But in certain physical situations, the MIMO channel matrix can become \"poorly conditioned,\" harming performance. With these situations in mind, Geosphere uses sphere decoding, a more computationally demanding technique that can achieve higher throughput in such channels. To overcome the sphere decoder's computational complexity when sending dense wireless constellations at a high rate, Geosphere introduces search and pruning techniques that incorporate novel geometric reasoning about the wireless constellation. These techniques reduce computational complexity of 256-QAM systems by almost one order of magnitude, bringing computational demands in line with current 16- and 64-QAM systems already realized in ASIC. Geosphere thus makes the sphere decoder practical for the first time in a 4 × 4 MIMO, 256-QAM system. Results from our WARP testbed show that Geosphere achieves throughput gains over multi-user MIMO of 2× in 4 × 4 systems and 47% in 2 × 2 MIMO systems.",

    "abstract": "Though most would agree that accountability and privacy are both valuable, today's Internet provides little support for either. Previous efforts have explored ways to offer stronger guarantees for one of the two, typically at the expense of the other; indeed, at first glance accountability and privacy appear mutually exclusive. At the center of the tussle is the source address: in an accountable Internet, source addresses undeniably link packets and senders so hosts can be punished for bad behavior. In a privacy-preserving Internet, source addresses are hidden as much as possible. In this paper, we argue that a balance is possible. We introduce the Accountable and Private Internet Protocol (APIP), which splits source addresses into two separate fields --- an accountability address and a return address --- and introduces independent mechanisms for managing each. Accountability addresses, rather than pointing to hosts, point to accountability delegates, which agree to vouch for packets on their clients' behalves, taking appropriate action when misbehavior is reported. With accountability handled by delegates, senders are now free to mask their return addresses; we discuss a few techniques for doing so.",

Our approach is empirical and is based on real Internet topologies, routing tables from real routers, and a measured workload of the mobility of devices and content across network addresses today. We measure the extent of network mobility exhibited by mobile devices with a home-brewn Android app deployed on hundreds of smartphones, and measure the network mobility of Internet content from distributed vantage points. We combine this measured data with our quantitative methodology to analyze the different cost-benefit tradeoffs struck by location-independent network architectures with respect to routing update cost, path stretch, and forwarding table size. We find that more than 20% of users change over 10 IP addresses a day, suggesting that mobility is the norm rather than the exception, so intrinsic and efficient network support for mobility is critical. We also find that with purely name-based routing approaches, each event involving the mobility of a device or popular content may result in an update at up to 14% of Internet routers; but, the fraction of impacted routers is much smaller for the long tail of unpopular content. These results suggest that recent proposals for pure name-based networking are suitable for highly aggregateable content that does not move frequently but may need to be augmented with addressing-assisted approaches to handle device mobility.",

The study is thorough, and the paper is well-written, with a clear outline of the study's limitations. It effectively separates the measurement results from discussions and assumptions that go beyond what the data can support. Strengths include a clear and structured study process, an insightful presentation of results in Table 1, and the open-sourcing of both tools and data. The paper makes significant progress by addressing earlier concerns, such as clarifying its focus on HTTP3+QUIC, reducing the emphasis on connections without SNI, and ensuring that speculation is clearly separated from concrete results. While there are still some challenges, such as the study of certain QUIC parameters and the simplified handshake diagram in Figure 1, the paper provides a strong foundation for future research. It offers valuable insights into the current state of QUIC migration deployment and sets the stage for further work in this area.",

    "abstract": "Internet speed tests are an important tool to enable consumers and regulators to monitor the quality of Internet access. However, increased Internet speeds to the home and an increased demand for speed testing pose scaling challenges to providers of speed tests, who must maintain costly infrastructure to keep up with this demand. In recent years, this has led the popular NDT speed test to limit data transfer to a total of 250MB, which comes at the cost of accuracy for high bandwidth speed test clients. In this paper, we observe that the NDT speed test server's congestion control algorithm (BBRv1) is also trying to estimate the capacity of the connection. We leverage this observation and signals from BBR to improve the accuracy and efficiency of speed tests. We first show how leveraging signals from BBR can more than double the accuracy of a 10MB test—from 17% to 43%—for clients with speeds over 400Mbps. We then show how using BBR signals to adaptively end the speed test reduces data transfer by 36% and increased accuracy by 13% for high bandwidth clients, relative to a 100MB fixed length test. Even accounting for clients that never observe enough samples to utilize the BBR signal, this adaptive approach still uses 25% less data than a fixed 100MB test with 37-44% higher accuracy.",

It is intended for use within a large single Internet domain network with a very large number of multicast groups with a small number of receivers. Such a case occurs, for example, when multicast addresses are allocated to mobile hosts, as a mechanism to manage Internet host mobility or in large distributed simulations. For such cases, existing dense or sparse mode multicast routing algorithms do not scale well with the number of multicast groups. DCM is based on an extension of the centre-based tree approach. It uses several core routers, called Distributed Core Routers (DCRs) and a special control protocol among them. DCM aims: (1) avoiding multicast group state information in backbone routers, (2) avoiding triangular routing across expensive backbone links, (3) scaling well with the number of multicast groups. We evaluate the performance of DCM and compare it to an existing sparse mode routing protocol when there is a large number of small multicast groups. We also analyse the behaviour of DCM when the number of receivers per group is not a small number.",

These definitions do not account for multi-rate approaches, such as layering, that permit receiving rates within a session to be chosen independently. We identify four desirable fairness properties for multicast networks, derived from properties that hold within the max-min fair allocations of unicast networks. We extend the definition of multicast max-min fairness to networks that contain multi-rate sessions, and show that all four fairness properties hold in a multi-rate max-min fair allocation, but need not hold in a single-rate max-min fair allocation. We then show that multi-rate max-min fair rate allocations can be achieved via intra-session coordinated joins and leaves of multicast groups. However, in the absence of coordination, the resulting max-min fair rate allocation uses link bandwidth inefficiently, and does not exhibit some of the desirable fairness properties. We evaluate this inefficiency for several layered multi-rate congestion control schemes, and find that, in a protocol where the sender coordinates joins, this inefficiency has minimal impact on desirable fairness properties. Our results indicate that sender-coordinated layered protocols show promise for achieving desirable fairness properties for allocations in large-scale multicast networks.",

Our approach to Ethernet topology discovery can determine the connection between a pair of the bridges that share forwarding entries for only three hosts. This minimal knowledge requirement significantly expands the size of the network that can be discovered.

As BGP enhancements are explored to address this convergence problem, controlled simulation experiments offer the most convenient and feasible mechanism to compare the efficacy of enhanced BGP procedures with respect to the current protocol mechanisms. Since the convergence behavior can be significantly influenced by network topology, it is desirable to use large Internet like topologies in such controlled simulations.In this paper, we present first steps towards realizing a large scale BGP simulation environment for reasoning about current BGP procedures and also for evaluating the efficacy of BGP protocol enhancements.",

The tasks and procedures defined for, e.g., setting-up an ATM connection, are often very different concerning the rrelevant specifications of various working bodies (such as ITU-T or ATM-Forum) or certain vendors, although the basis to be done for maintaining ATM connections are always principally the same. The reason for this situation is, that the intentions of working bodies are different and each one of them follows specific strategies for certain scenarios (such as for point-to-point unicast or point-to-multipoint multicast). Nevertheless, various types of characteristics (such as addressing, multicast, or interworking) are requested from applications residing on top of ATM networks. Therefore, this survey of signaling systems and protocols for ATM networks identifies for several of selected approaches (such as Q.2931, UNI 3.1, or CMAP) important characteristics and relevant scenarios. Furthermore, a table-based comparison of some approaches has been added",

SSCOP is a new type of protocol, embodying several design principles for high speed link and transport layer protocols. In this paper, the basic operation of SSCOP is described and the SSCOP design is compared with other similar protocols. Next, the relationships between key protocol parameters (protocol window, control message transmission interval) and maximum achievable throughput effieiency are explored. In particular, approximate performance equations are derived for predicting the maximum throughput efficiency of SSCOP basedon the selected environment and parameter eettings. The equations can be used to determine how much buffer capacity and/or what protocol timer settings allow SSCOP to operate at high performance. The analytical results are confirmed through comparison with simulation results. In addition, simulation results illustrate the high throughput performance achievable when using SSCOP in a highly errored or loosy environment.",

    "abstract": "If the packet loss rate in a network is higher than the loss rate requested by an application, the transport protocol must make up for the difference in loss rate. In high bandwidth delay-product networks the latency introduced by retransmission-based error recovery schemes may be too high for applications with latency constraints. In this case, Forward Error Correction (FEC) can be used. FEC allows recovery from loss without retransmission. The amount of loss recovered strongly depends on the loss behavior of the network. FEC works best if losses are dispersed.We use simulation to study the loss behavior of an output buffered multiplexer for three different traffic scenarios. Our results show how the loss behavior of the multiplexer is affected by the traffic mix and the statistics of the sources. The more bursty the sources are the larger the loss rate and the higher the probability that losses will occur in bursts. We then investigate the effectiveness of an FEC scheme that can recover a fixed number of lost packets within a block of consecutive packets. For a heterogeneous traffic scenario consisting of video and burst sources, this scheme reduces the loss rate for the video sources by several orders of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "The flow/congestion control scheme of TCP is based on the sliding window mechanism. As we demonstrate in this paper, the performance of this and other similar end-to-end flow control schemes deteriorates as networks move to the gigabit range. This has been the motivation for our search for a new flow and congestion control scheme. In this paper, we propose as an alternative, a hop-by-hop rate-based mechanism for congestion control. Due to the increasing sophistication in switch architectures, to provide “quality of service” guarantees for real-time as well as bursty data traffic, the implementation of hop-by-hop controls has become relatively inexpensive. A cost-effective implementation of the proposed scheme for a multi-gigabit packet switch is described in [2]. In this paper, we present results of a simulation study comparing the performance of this hop-by-hop flow control scheme to two end-to-end flow control schemes. The results indicate that the proposed scheme displays stable behavior for a wide range of traffic conditions and diverse network topologies. More importantly, the performance of the scheme, measured in terms of the average number of occupied buffers, the end-to-end throughput, the network delay, and the link utilization at the bottleneck, is better than that of the end-to-end control schemes studied here. These results present a convincing case against popular myths about hop-by-hop control mechanisms.",

The shortest hop-count routing scheme, used in current Internet, turns out to be no longer sufficient in DiffServ networks. This paper studies the problem of finding optimal routes for the premium-class traffic in a DiffServ domain, such that (1) no forwarding loop exists in the entire network in the context of hop-by-hop routing; and (2) the residual bandwidth on bottleneck links is maximized. This problem is called the Optimal Premium-class Routing (OPR) problem. We prove in this paper that the OPR problem is NP-hard.To handle the OPR problem, first, we analyze the strength and weaknesses of two existing algorithms (Widest-Shortest-Path algorithm and Bandwidth-inversion Shortest-Path algorithm). Second, we propose a novel heuristic algorithm, called the Enhanced Bandwidth-inversion Shortest-Path (EBSP) algorithm . We prove theoretically the correctness of the EBSP algorithm, i.e., we show that it is consistent and loop-free. Our extensive simulations in different network environments show clearly that the EBSP algorithm performs better when routing the premium traffic in complex, heterogeneous networks.",

One reason for this is that the specifications are typically informal, and hence inevitably contain ambiguities. Conformance testing against such specifications is challenging.In this paper we present a practical technique for rigorous protocol specification that supports specification-based testing. We have applied it to TCP, UDP, and the Sockets API, developing a detailed 'post-hoc' specification that accurately reflects the behaviour of several existing implementations (FreeBSD 4.6, Linux 2.4.20-8, and Windows XP SP1). The development process uncovered a number of differences between and infelicities in these implementations.Our experience shows for the first time that rigorous specification is feasible for protocols as complex as TCP@. We argue that the technique is also applicable 'pre-hoc', in the design phase of new protocols. We discuss how such a design-for-test approach should influence protocol development, leading to protocol specifications that are both unambiguous and clear, and to high-quality implementations that can be tested directly against those specifications.",

    "abstract": "One weakness of DiffServ is the lack of granularity for QoS guaranteed services, which makes it difficult to cost-effectively support end-to-end (e2e) QoS according to the e2e situation (e.g., path lengths) of applications. With the conventional packet-level QoS mechanisms for the regulated traffic, i.e., buffer admission control plus output schedulers in general, increasing service granularity may inevitably complicate implementation and/or impact scalability since sophisticated output schedulers seem necessary in this case. In this paper, a new structure, Differentiated Queueing Services (DQS), is discussed to handle the above issue. DQS tries to provide granular and scalable QoS guaranteed services to be selected by users according to their QoS requirements and e2e situation. Its basic idea is to convert packet delay guarantee into packet loss ratio guarantee with either dropping or marking the packets whose e2e delays are perceived unable to be guaranteed. Packets are queued according to their e2e delay requirements so that various delay bounds can be guaranteed without using sophisticated output schedulers while different packet loss ratios are mainly controlled by call admission control (CAC). To this end, the e2e QoS requirement is carried by each packet to avoid storing such information in network units for scalability. On the other hand, differentiated services should also be accomplished with a differentiated cost model for pricing, not only for the profits of both the service provider and the user, but also to prevent good services from being abused. So, a cost model for differentiated QoS services provided by DQS is also discussed with a possible CAC based on the exponentially bounded burstiness traffic.",

We seek to understand when, why, and to what extent this can be of benefit, and equally important, whether these benefits can be realized with as little of an added cost as possible. In that context, our main contribution is not so much in identifying optimal policies for leveraging channel diversity, but in introducing the concept of channel \"equivalence\" and demonstrating that channel diversity yields substantial benefits mostly when channels are approximately equivalent. We build on this finding to investigate the robustness of these improvements against errors in the characterization of the available channels or changes in their characteristics. We also explore the sensitivity of the results as the number of available channels varies. The findings of the paper demonstrate that by allowing packet transmissions from multiple users to intelligently share channels, it is possible to improve overall performance and robustness through simple and portable user-level mechanisms.",

Unfortunately, it is known that the reality of routing policies[2] and peering relationships is far more complex than those few classes[1,3]. We take the next step of searching for the appropriate granularity at which policies should be modeled. For this purpose, we study how and where to configure per-prefix policies in an AS-level model of the Internet, such that the selected paths in the model are consistent with those observed in BGP data from multiple vantage points. By comparing business relationships with per-prefix filters, we investigate the role and limitations of business relationships as a model for policies. We observe that popular locations for filtering correspond to valleys where no path should be propagated according to inferred business relationships. This result reinforces the validity of the valley-free property used for business relationships inference. However, given the sometimes large path diversity ASs have, business relationships do not contain enough information to decide which path will be chosen as the best. To model how individual ASs choose their best paths, we introduce a new abstraction: next-hop atoms . Next-hop atoms capture the different sets of neighboring ASs an AS uses for its best routes. We show that a large fraction of next-hop atoms correspond to per-neighbor path choices. A non-negligible fraction of path choices, however, correspond to hot-potato routing and tie-breaking within the BGP decision process, very detailed aspects of Internet routing.",

    "abstract": "BGP routing data collected by RouteViews and RIPE RIS have become an essential asset to both the network research and operation communities. However, it has long been speculated that the BGP monitoring sessions between operational routers and the data collectors fail from time to time. Such session failures lead to missing update messages as well as duplicate updates during session re-establishment, making analysis results derived from such data inaccurate. Since there is no complete record of these monitoring session failures, data users either have to sanitize the data discretionarily with respect to their specific needs or, more commonly, assume that session failures are infrequent enough and simply ignore them. In this paper, we present the first systematic assessment and documentary on BGP session failures of RouteViews and RIPE data collectors over the past eight years. Our results show that monitoring session failures are rather frequent, more than 30% of BGP monitoring sessions experienced at least one failure every month. Furthermore, we observed failures that happen to multiple peer sessions on the same collector around the same time, suggesting that the collector's local problems are a major factor in the session instability. We also developed a web site as a community resource to publish all session failures detected for RouteViews and RIPE RIS data collectors to help users select and clean up BGP data before performing their analysis.",

    "abstract": "In double-blind reviewing (DBR), both reviewers and authors are unaware of each others' identities and affiliations. DBR is said to increase review fairness. However, DBR may only be marginally effective in combating the randomness of the typical conference review process for highly-selective conferences. DBR may also make it more difficult to adequately review conference submissions that build on earlier work of the authors and have been partially published in workshops. I believe that DBR mainly increases the perceived fairness of the reviewing process, but that may be an important benefit. Rather than waiting until the final stages, the reviewing process needs to explicitly address the issue of workshop publications early on.",

    "abstract": "Managing a home network is challenging because the underlying infrastructure is so complex. Existing interfaces either hide or expose the network's underlying complexity, but in both cases, the information that is shown does not necessarily allow a user to complete desired tasks. Recent advances in software defined networking, however, permit a redesign of the underlying network and protocols, potentially allowing designers to move complexity further from the user and, in some cases, eliminating it entirely. In this paper, we explore whether the choices of what to make visible to the user in the design of today's home network infrastructure, performance, and policies make sense. We also examine whether new capabilities for refactoring the network infrastructure - changing the underlying system without compromising existing functionality - should cause us to revisit some of these choices. Our work represents a case study of how co-designing an interface and its underlying infrastructure could ultimately improve interfaces for that infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "Should a new \"platform\" target a functionality-rich but complex and expensive design or instead opt for a bare-bone but cheaper one? This is a fundamental question with profound implications for the eventual success of any platform. A general answer is, however, elusive as it involves a complex trade-off between benefits and costs. The intent of this paper is to introduce an approach based on standard tools from the field of economics, which can offer some insight into this difficult question. We demonstrate its applicability by developing and solving a generic model that incorporates key interactions between platform stakeholders. The solution confirms that the \"optimal\" number of features a platform should offer strongly depends on variations in cost factors. More interestingly, it reveals a high sensitivity to small relative changes in those costs. The paper's contribution and motivation are in establishing the potential of such a cross-disciplinary approach for providing qualitative and quantitative insights into the complex question of platform design.",

Although predicting path changes is not very accurate, we show that it can be used to improve probe targeting. Our path tracking method, called DTrack, detects up to two times more path changes than traditional probing, with lower detection delay, as well as providing complete load-balancer information.",

One typical solution of this problem would be to use MPLS-like tunneling, but this approach spoils the advantage of flow-by-flow path selection for load-balancing or QoS. We demonstrate a method named \"Source Flow\" that allows us to handle a huge amount of flows without changing the granularity of flows. By using our method, expensive and power consuming search engine devices can be removed from the core nodes, and the network can grow pretty scalable. In our demo, we construct a small network that consists of small number of OpenFlow switches, a single OpenFlow controller, and end-hosts. The hosts generate more than one million flows simultaneously and the flows are controlled on a per-flow-basis. All active flows are monitored and visualized on a user interface and the user interface allows audiences to confirm if our method is feasible and deployable.",

On top of these findings, we propose NextMe --- a novel scheme to enhance the location prediction accuracy by leveraging the social interplay revealed in the cellular calls. To identify when the social interplay will affect user mobility, we introduce the concepts of the Critical Call Pattern (CCP), and the Critical Call (CC).

    "abstract": "The Internet was designed to always find a route if there is a policy-compliant path. However, in many cases, connectivity is disrupted despite the existence of an underlying valid path. The research community has focused on short-term outages that occur during route convergence. There has been less progress on addressing avoidable long-lasting outages. Our measurements show that long-lasting events contribute significantly to overall unavailability. To address these problems, we develop LIFEGUARD , a system for automatic failure localization and remediation. LIFEGUARD uses active measurements and a historical path atlas to locate faults, even in the presence of asymmetric paths and failures. Given the ability to locate faults, we argue that the Internet protocols should allow edge ISPs to steer traffic to them around failures, without requiring the involvement of the network causing the failure. Although the Internet does not explicitly support this functionality today, we show how to approximate it using carefully crafted BGP messages. LIFEGUARD employs a set of techniques to reroute around failures with low impact on working routes. Deploying LIFEGUARD on the Internet, we find that it can effectively route traffic around an AS without causing widespread disruption.",

Network operators today lack sufficient fine-grain measurement tools to detect, localize and repair performance anomalies and delay spikes that cause application SLA violations. A recently proposed solution called LDA provides a scalable way to obtain latency, but only provides aggregate measurements. However, debugging application-specific problems requires per-flow measurements, since different flows may exhibit significantly different characteristics even when they are traversing the same link. To enable fine-grained per-flow measurements in routers, we propose a new scalable architecture called reference latency interpolation (RLI) that is based on our observation that packets potentially belonging to different flows that are closely spaced to each other exhibit similar delay properties. In our evaluation using simulations over real traces, we show that RLI achieves a median relative error of 12% and one to two orders of magnitude higher accuracy than previous per-flow measurement solutions with small overhead.",

Considering the BGP and IRR practices, we propose a methodology to match the (IP prefix, origin AS) pairs between the IRR and BGP. We observe that the practice of registering IP prefi xes and origin ASes with the IRR is prevalent. However, the quality of the IRR data can vary substantially depending on routing registries, regional Internet registries (to which ASes belong), and AS types.

With one misbehavior, the worst case could result in a data sender receiving a SACK for data that was transmitted but never received. This paper presents a methodology and its application to test a wide range of operating systems using TBIT to fingerprint which ones misbehave in each of the seven ways. Measuring the performance loss due to these misbehaviors is outside the scope of this study; the goal is to document the misbehaviors so they may be corrected.

We argue that there is a class of traffic for which broadcast is overkill: periodic redundant transmissions of semi-static information that is already known to all neighbors, such as neighbor and router advertisements. Our experiments show that such traffic can account for as much as 20% of the network power consumption. We argue that this calls for a new commu- nication primitive and present politecast, a communication primitive that allows messages to be sent without explicitly waking neighbors up. We have built two systems based on politecast: a low-power wireless mobile toy and a full-scale low-power wireless network deployment in an art gallery and our experimental results show that politecast can provide up to a four-fold lifetime improvement over broadcast.",

However, this sensor data can also be used by applications to extract private information about users. Applications and users are thus in a tussle over access to private data. Tussles occur in operating systems when stakeholders with competing interests try to access shared resources such as sensor data, CPU time, or network bandwidth. Unfortunately, existing operating systems lack a principled approach for identifying, tracking, and resolving such tussles. Moreover, users typically have little control over how tussles are resolved. Controls for sensor data tussles, for example, often fail to address trade-offs between functionality and privacy. Therefore, we propose a framework to explicitly recognize and manage tussles. Using sensor data as an example resource, we investigate the design of mechanisms for detecting and resolving privacy tussles in a cyber-physical system, enabling privacy and functionality to be negotiated between users and applications. In doing so, we identify shortcomings of existing research and present directions for future work.",

    "abstract": "The strict low-latency requirements of applications such as virtual reality, online gaming, etc., can not be satisfied by the current Internet. This is due to the characteristics of classic TCP such as Reno and TCP Cubic which induce high queuing delays when used for capacity-seeking traffic, which in turn results in unpredictable latency. The Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable throughput (L4S) architecture addresses this problem by combining scalable congestion controls such as DCTCP and TCP Prague with early congestion signaling from the network. It defines a Dual Queue Coupled (DQC) AQM that isolates low-latency traffic from the queuing delay of classic traffic while ensuring the safe co-existence of scalable and classic flows on the global Internet. In this paper, we benchmark the DualPI2 scheduler, a reference implementation of DQC AQM, to validate some of the experimental result(s) reported in the previous works that demonstrate the co-existence of scalable and classic congestion controls and its low-latency service. Our results validate the co-existence of scalable and classic flows using DualPI2 Single queue (SingleQ) AQM, and queue latency isolation of scalable flows using DualPI2 Dual queue (DualQ) AQM. However, the rate or window fairness between DCTCP without fair-queuing (FQ) pacing and TCP Cubic using DualPI2 DualQ AQM deviates from the original results. We attribute the difference in our results and the original results to the sensitivity of the L4S architecture to traffic bursts and the burst sending pattern of the Linux kernel.",

    "abstract": "HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol) was originally primarily used for human-initiated client-server communications launched from web browsers, traditional computers and laptops. However, today it has become the protocol of choice for a bewildering range of applications from a wide array of emerging devices like smart TVs and gaming consoles. This paper presents an initial study characterizing the non-traditional sources of HTTP traffic such as consumer devices and automated updates in the overall HTTP traffic for residential Internet users. Among our findings,13% of all HTTP traffic in terms of bytes is due to non-traditional sources, with 5% being from consumer devices such as WiFi enabled smartphones and 8% generated from automated software updates and background processes. Our findings show that 11% of all HTTP requests are caused by communications with advertising servers from as many as 190 countries worldwide, suggesting the widespread prevalence of such activities. Overall, our findings start to answer questions about what is the state of traffic generated in these smart homes.",

    "abstract": "During the last decade, we have seen the rise of discussions regarding the emergence of a Future Internet. One of the proposed approaches leverages on the separation of the identifier and the locator roles of IP addresses, leading to the LISP (Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol) protocol, currently under development at the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). Up to now, researches made on LISP have been rather theoretical, i.e., based on simulations/emulations often using Internet traffic traces. There is no work in the literature attempting to assess the state of its deployment and how this has evolved in recent years. This paper aims at bridging this gap by presenting a first measurement study on the existing worldwide LISP network ( lisp4.net ). Early results indicate that there is a steady growth of the LISP network but also that network manageability might receive a higher priority than performance in a large scale deployment.",

In this paper we seek to understand the extent to which the users in this network are in fact making use of the provided bi-directional 1 Gbps capacity. We find that even when given virtually unlimited capacity the majority of the time users do not retrieve information from the Internet in excess of commercially available data rates and transmit at only modestly higher rates than commodity networks support.

Although NDN's emphasizes content distribution, it must also support other types of traffic, such as conferencing (audio, video) as well as more historical applications, such as remote login and file transfer.

In this paper, we explore NDN in the context of a class of applications that involve lowlatency bi-directional (point-to-point) communication.

    "abstract": "IoT deployments targeting different application domains are being unfolded at various administrative levels such as countries, states, corporations, or even individual households. Facilitating data transfers between deployed sensors and back-end cloud services is an important aspect of IoT deployments. These data transfers are usually done using Low Power WAN technologies (LPWANs) that have low power consumption and support longer transmission ranges. LoRa (Long Range) is one such technology that has recently gained significant popularity due to its ease of deployment. In this paper, we present LoRadar , a passive packet sniffing framework for LoRa's Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol, LoRaWAN. LoRadar is built using commodity hardware. By carrying out passive measurements at a given location, LoRadar provides key insights of LoRa deployments such as available LoRa networks, deployed sensors, their make, and transmission patterns. Since LoRa deployments are becoming more pervasive, these information are pivotal in characterizing network performance, comparing different LoRa operators, and in emergencies or tactical operations to quickly assess available sensing infrastructure at a given geographical location. We validate the performance of LoRadar in both laboratory and real network settings and conduct a measurement study at eight key locations distributed over a large city-wide geographical area to provide an in-depth analysis of the landscape of commercial IoT deployments. Furthermore, we show the usage of LoRadar in improving the network such as potential collision and jamming detection, device localization, as well as spectrum policing to identify devices that violate the daily duty-cycle quota. Our results show that most of the devices transmitting over the SF12 data rate at one of the survey location were violating the network provider's quota.",

    "abstract": "The complexity and enormous costs of installing new long-haul fiber-optic infrastructure has led to a significant amount of infrastructure sharing in previously installed conduits. In this paper, we study the characteristics and implications of infrastructure sharing by analyzing the long-haul fiber-optic network in the US. We start by using fiber maps provided by tier-1 ISPs and major cable providers to construct a map of the long-haul US fiber-optic infrastructure. We also rely on previously under-utilized data sources in the form of public records from federal, state, and municipal agencies to improve the fidelity of our map. We quantify the resulting map's connectivity characteristics and confirm a clear correspondence between long-haul fiber-optic, roadway, and railway infrastructures. Next, we examine the prevalence of high-risk links by mapping end-to-end paths resulting from large-scale traceroute campaigns onto our fiber-optic infrastructure map. We show how both risk and latency (i.e., propagation delay) can be reduced by deploying new links along previously unused transportation corridors and rights-of-way. In particular, focusing on a subset of high-risk links is sufficient to improve the overall robustness of the network to failures. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings on issues related to performance, net neutrality, and policy decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Transport protocols must accommodate diverse application and network requirements. As a result, TCP has evolved over time with new congestion control algorithms such as support for generalized AIMD, background flows, and multipath. On the other hand, explicit congestion control algorithms have been shown to be more efficient. However, they are inherently more rigid because they rely on in-network components. Therefore, it is not clear whether they can be made flexible enough to support diverse application requirements. This paper presents a flexible framework for network resource allocation, called FCP, that accommodates diversity by exposing a simple abstraction for resource allocation. FCP incorporates novel primitives for end-point flexibility ( aggregation and preloading ) into a single framework and makes economics-based congestion control practical by explicitly handling load variations and by decoupling it from actual billing. We show that FCP allows evolution by accommodating diversity and ensuring coexistence, while being as efficient as existing explicit congestion control algorithms.",

In this work, we take a closer look at those \"hyper-specific\" prefixes (HSPs). In particular, we analyze their prevalence, use cases, and whether operators use them intentionally or accidentally. While their total number increases over time, most HSPs can only be seen by route collector peers. Nonetheless, some HSPs can be seen constantly throughout an entire year and propagate widely. We find that most HSPs represent (internal) routes to peering infrastructure or are related to address block relocations or blackholing.

We extend the service curve based QoS model, which defines both delay and bandwidth requirements of a class, to include fairness, which is important for the integration of real-time and hierarchical link-sharing services. The resulting Fair Service Curve link-sharing model formalizes the goals of link-sharing and real-time services and exposes the fundamental tradeoffs between these goals. In particular, with decoupled delay and band-width allocation, it is impossible to simultaneously provide guaranteed real-time service and achieve perfect link-sharing. We propose a novel scheduling algorithm called Hierarchical Fair Service Curve (H-FSC) that approximates the model closely and efficiently. The algorithm always guarantees the performance for leaf classes, thus ensures real-time services, while minimizing the discrepancy between the actual services provided to the interior classes and the services defined by the Fair Service Curve link-sharing model. We have implemented the H-FSC scheduler in the NetBSD environment. By performing simulation and measurement experiments, we evaluate the link-sharing and real-time performances of H-FSC, and determine the computation over-head.",

We also propose a window-based Random Listening Algorithm (RLA) for multicast congestion control. The algorithm is proven to be essentially fair to TCP connections under a restricted topology with equal round-trip times and with phase effects eliminated. The algorithm is also fair to multiple multicast sessions. This paper provides the theoretical proofs and some simulation results to demonstrate that the RLA achieves good performance under various network topologies. These include the performance of a generalization of the RLA algorithm for topologies with different round-trip times.",

    "abstract": "The two most compelling problems facing the IP Internet are IP address depletion and scaling in routing. This paper discusses the characteristics of one of the proposed solutions---address reuse. The solution is to place Network Address Translators (Nat) at the borders of stub domains. Each Nat box has a small pool of globally unique IP addresses that are dynamically assigned to IP flows going through Nat. The dynamic assignment is coordinated with Domain Name Server operation. The IP addresses inside the stub domain are not globally unique---they are reused in other domains, thus solving the address depletion problem. The pool of IP addresses in Nat is from a subnet administered by the regional backbone, thus solving the scaling problem. The main advantage of Nat is that it can be installed without changes to any existing systems, although FTP will fail in some but not all cases. This paper presents a preliminary design for Nat, and discusses its pros and cons.",

    "abstract": "A new retransmission-based error control technique is presented that does not incur any additional latency in frame playout times, and hence are suitable for interactive applications. It takes advantage of the motion prediction loop employed in most motion compensation-based codecs. By correcting errors in a reference frame caused by earlier packet loss, it prevents error propagation. The technique rearranges the temporal dependency of frames so that a displayed frame is referenced for the decoding of its succeeding dependent frames much later than its display time. Thus, the delay in repairing lost packets can be effectively masked out. The developed technique is combined with layered video coding to maintain consistently good video quality even under heavy packet loss. Through the results of extensive Internet experiments, the paper shows that layered coding can be very effective when combined with the retransmission-based error control technique for low-bit rate transmission over best effort networks where no network-level mechanism exists for protecting high priority data from packet loss.",

    "abstract": "In secure group communications, users of a group share a common group key. A key server sends the group key to authorized new users as well as performs group rekeying for group users whenever the key changes. In this paper, we investigate scalability issues of reliable group rekeying, and provide a performance analysis of our group key management system (called keygem) based upon the use of key trees. Instead of rekeying after each join or leave, we use periodic batch rekeying to improve scalability and alleviate out-of-sync problems among rekey messages as well as between rekey and data messages. Our analyses show that batch rekeying can achieve large performance gains. We then investigate reliable multicast of rekey messages using proactive FEC. We observe that rekey transport has an eventual reliability and a soft real-time requirement, and that the rekey workload has a sparseness property, that is, each group user only needs to receive a small fraction of the packets that carry a rekey message sent by the key server. We also investigate tradeoffs between server and receiver bandwidth requirements versus group rekey interval, and show how to determine the maximum number of group users a key server can support.",

Ordinary round robin schedulers are well known for their burstiness in the scheduling output. In order to overcome this problem, SRR codes the weights of the flows into binary vectors to form a Weight Matrix, then uses a Weight Spread Sequence (WSS), which is specially designed to distribute the output more evenly, to schedule packets by scanning the Weight Matrix. By using the WSS and the Weight Matrix, SRR can emulate the Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) well. It possesses better short-term fairness and schedule delay properties in comparison with various round robin schedulers. At the same time, it preserves O (1) time complexity by avoiding the time-stamp maintenance employed in various Fair Queueing schedulers. Simulation and implementation experiments show that SRR can provide good average end-to-end delay for soft real-time services. SRR can also be implemented in high-speed networks to provide QoS for its simplicity and low time complexity.",

Such source rate modulation techniques have been used in the past in designing video encoders used to generate data at a fixed rate. In such constant bit rate encoders, the source rate modulation is done using feedback information about the occupancy of a local buffer. Since the buffer is local, the feedback information is available instantaneously to the encoder. In the proposed scheme, the feedback information is delayed because it comes from within a packet-switching network. The feedback provides information about the traffic at switches along the path of the video connection. We show that the proposed scheme performs well, even though the information is delayed for relatively large intervals of time. We believe that the use of such schemes will simplify the architecture used for supporting real-time services in future nationwide gigabit networks.",

Like EXPRESS, BCFS utilizes explicit-source group join and like PGM, enhances the network forwarding architecture with finer-grained group control. In this paper, we detail BCFS service model and router mechanisms to support the service. To demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of BCFS, we describe the application examples built on this service model, which can accommodate not only PGM and also a novel reliable multicast transport protocol.",

    "abstract": "The recently developed notion of TCP-compatibility has led to a number of proposals for alternative congestion control algorithms whose long-term throughput as a function of a steady-state loss rate is similar to that of TCP. Motivated by the needs of some streaming and multicast applications, these algorithms seem poised to take the current TCP-dominated Internet to an Internet where many congestion control algorithms co-exist. An important characteristic of these alternative algorithms is that they are slowly-responsive , refraining from reacting as drastically as TCP to a single packet loss.However, the TCP-compatibility criteria explored so far in the literature considers only the static condition of a fixed loss rate. This paper investigates the behavior of slowly-responsive, TCP-compatible congestion control algorithms under more realistic dynamic network conditions, addressing the fundamental question of whether these algorithms are safe to deploy in the public Internet. We study persistent loss rates, long- and short-term fairness properties, bottleneck link utilization, and smoothness of transmission rates.",

    "abstract": "A new methodology for specifying and implementing communication protocols is presented. This methodology is based on a formalism called “Real-Time Asynchronous Grammars” (RTAG), which uses a syntax similar to that of attribute grammars to specify allowable message sequences. In addition RTAG provides mechanisms for specifying data-dependent protocol activities, real-time constraints, and concurrent activities within a protocol entity. RTAG encourages a top-down approach to protocol design that can be of significant benefit in expressing and reasoning about highly complex protocols. As an example, an RTAG specification is given for part of the Class 4 ISO Transport Protocol (TP-4). Because RTAG allows protocols to be specified at a highly detailed level, major parts of an implementation can be automatically generated from a specification. An RTAG parser can be written which, when combined with an RTAG specification of a protocol and a set of interface and utility routines, constitutes an implementation of the protocol. To demonstrate the viability of RTAG for implementation generation, an RTAG parser has been integrated into the kernel of the 4.2 BSD UNIX operating system, and has been used in conjunction with the RTAG TP-4 specification to obtain an RTAG-based TP-4 implementation in the DoD Internet domain.",

This can a priori be done by adopting by the two standards proposed by ISO: the Abstract Syntax Notation 1 (ASN-1) and the ASN-1 basic encoding rules (ASN1-BER). However, the ASN1-BER conversion procedures are highly CPU consuming, which is not acceptable for several \"high speed\" applications. We propose to use the presentation layer negotiation to select faster transfer syntax. We have experimented with a first \"light weight\" syntax since 1988, and have just completed the definition a new \"flat tree light weight syntax\", which can be orders of magnitude faster than the ASN1-BER.",

    "abstract": "QoS-aware multicasting is becoming more and more desirable with the expanding usage of group-based applications, especially those involving multimedia objects. Until now, most of the proposed QoS-aware multicasting routing protocols adopt per-flow based resource reservation. Although these schemes can be adopted in integrated services (IntServ) Internet, they are not suitable for more scalable Differentiated Services (DiffServ) Internet. A new QoS-aware multicast routing protocol called QMD is proposed for DiffServ environments in this paper. Based on the design philosophy of DiffServ, the complex multicasting control plane functionalities are removed from the core routers. In addition, for each multicast group, only a limited set of on-tree routers (termed as key nodes) maintain multicast routing states and forward multicast data traffic. The key nodes of a multicast group uniquely identify a QoS-satisfied multicast tree connecting the group members. Although the other on-tree routers between any two key nodes do not maintain any multicast routing states and QoS reservation information, the group members' QoS requirements can still be satisfied. Through simulation experiments based on both random and real intra-domain topologies, we have also demonstrated that QMD can provide higher QoS-satisfaction rate while maintaining the simplicity of core routers.",

While the general perception of email is that it \"just works,\" surprisingly little data is available to substantiate this claim. While SMTP is a mature technology of over twenty years, the architecture is increasingly strained by both normal and unsolicited load. In this paper we seek to provide a greater understanding of the behavior of Internet email as a system using active measurement.In order to survey a significant, diverse, and representative set of Internet SMTP servers, to which we have no administrative access, we develop a testing methodology that provides an email \"traceroute\" mechanism. Using this mechanism, we measure email loss, latency, and errors over the course of a month to popular, random, and Fortune 500 domains. Our initial results are quite unexpected and include non-trivial loss rates, latencies longer than days, and significant and surprising errors. While we present plausible explanations for some of these phenomena, there are several that we cannot, as of yet, explain. By better understanding Internet protocols which lack explicit end-to-end connection semantics, our eventual hope is to derive guidelines for designing future networks and more reliable email systems.",

    "abstract": "Despite the fact that Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) demonstrated a clear potential to substantially improve network performance, recent network measurements reveal an extremely poor usage of this option in today's Internet. In this paper, we analyze the roots of this phenomenon and develop a set of novel incentives to encourage network providers, end-hosts, and web servers to apply ECN.Initially, we examine a fundamental drawback of the current ECN specification, and demonstrate that the absence of ECN indications in TCP control packets can dramatically hinder system performance. While security reasons primarily prevent the usage of ECN bits in TCP SYN packets, we show that applying ECN to TCP SYN ACK packets can significantly improve system performance without introducing any novel security or stability side-effects. Our network experiments on a cluster of web servers show a dramatic performance improvement over the existing ECN specification: throughput increases by more than 40%, while the average web response-time simultaneously decreases by nearly an order of magnitude.In light of the above finding, using large-scale simulations, modeling, and network experiments, we re-investigate the relevance of ECN, and provide a set of practical recommendations and insights: (i) ECN systematically improves the performance of all investigated AQM schemes; contrary to common belief, this particularly holds for RED. (ii) The impact of ECN is highest for web-only traffic mixes such that even a generic AQM algorithm with ECN support outperforms all non-ECN-enabled AQM schemes that we investigated. (iii) Primarily due to moderate queuing levels, the superiority of ECN over other AQM mechanisms largely holds for high-speed backbone routers, even in more general traffic scenarios. (iv) End-hosts that apply ECN can exercise the above performance benefits instantly, without waiting for the entire Internet community to support the option.",

However, the original design focused mainly on system robustness against physical failures, and neglected the impact of operational errors such as misconfigurations. Our recent measurement effort revealed three specific types of misconfigurations in DNS today: lame delegation, diminished server redundancy, and cyclic zone dependency. Zones with configuration errors suffer from reduced availability and increased query delays up to an order of magnitude. Furthermore, while the original DNS design assumed that redundant DNS servers fail independently, our measurements show that operational choices made at individual zones can severely affect the availability of other zones. We found that, left unchecked, DNS configuration errors are widespread, with lame delegation affecting 15% of the DNS zones, diminished server redundancy being even more prevalent, and cyclic dependency appearing in 2% of the zones. We also noted that the degrees of misconfiguration vary from zone to zone, with most popular zones having the lowest percentage of errors. Our results indicate that DNS, as well as any other truly robust large-scale system, must include systematic checking mechanisms to cope with operational errors.",

    "abstract": "Internet end users and ISPs alike have little control over how packets are routed outside of their own AS, restricting their ability to achieve levels of performance, reliability, and utility that might otherwise be attained. While researchers have proposed a number of source-routing techniques to combat this limitation, there has thus far been no way for independent ASes to ensure that such traffic does not circumvent local traffic policies, nor to accurately determine the correct party to charge for forwarding the traffic.We present Platypus, an authenticated source routing system built around the concept of network capabilities. Network capabilities allow for accountable, fine-grained path selection by cryptographically attesting to policy compliance at each hop along a source route. Capabilities can be composed to construct routes through multiple ASes and can be delegated to third parties. Platypus caters to the needs of both end users and ISPs: users gain the ability to pool their resources and select routes other than the default, while ISPs maintain control over where, when, and whose packets traverse their networks. We describe how Platypus can be used to address several well-known issues in wide-area routing at both the edge and the core, and evaluate its performance, security, and interactions with existing protocols. Our results show that incremental deployment of Platypus can achieve immediate gains.",

    "abstract": "The current model for flow establishment in the Internet: DNS Names, IP addresses, and transport ports, is inadequate. Not all of the problem is due to the small IPv4 address space and resulting NAT boxes. Even where global addresses exist, firewalls cannot glean enough information about a flow from packet headers, and so often err, typically by being over-conservative: disallowing flows that might otherwise be allowed. This paper presents a novel architecture, protocol design, and implementation, for flow establishment in the Internet. The architecture, called NUTSS, takes into account the combined policies of endpoints and network providers. While NUTSS borrows liberally from other proposals (URI-like naming, signaling to manage ephemeral IPv4 or IPv6 data flows), NUTSS is unique in that it couples overlay signaling with data-path signaling. NUTSS requires no changes to existing protocol stacks, and combined with recent NAT traversal techniques, works with IPv4 and existing NAT/firewalls. This paper describes NUTSS and shows how it satisfies a wide range of \"end-middle-end\"network requirements, including access control, middlebox steering, multi-homing, mobility, and protocol negotiation.",

    "abstract": "Flow records gathered by routers provide valuable coarse-granularity traffic information for several measurement-related network applications. However, due to high volumes of traffic, flow records need to be sampled before they are gathered. Current techniques for producing sampled flow records are either focused on selecting flows from which statistical estimates of traffic volume can be inferred, or have simplistic models for applications. Such sampled flow records are not suitable for many applications with more specific needs, such as ones that make decisions across flows As a first step towards tailoring the sampling algorithm to an application's needs, we design a generic language in which any particular application can express the classes of traffic of its interest. Our evaluation investigates the expressive power of our language, and whether flow records have sufficient information to enable sampling of records of relevance to applications. We use templates written in our custom language to instrument sampling tailored to three different applications--BLINC, Snort, and Bro. Our study, based on month-long datasets gathered at two different network locations, shows that by learning local traffic characteristics we can sample relevant flow records near-optimally with low false negatives in diverse applications",

    "abstract": "Internet applications currently have a choice between stream and datagram transport abstractions. Datagrams efficiently support small transactions and streams are suited for long-running conversations, but neither abstraction adequately supports applications like HTTP that exhibit a mixture of transaction sizes, or applications like FTP and SIP that use multiple transport instances. Structured Stream Transport (SST) enhances the traditional stream abstraction with a hierarchical hereditary structure , allowing applications to create lightweight child streams from any existing stream. Unlike TCP streams, these lightweight streams incur neither 3-way handshaking delays on startup nor TIME-WAIT periods on close. Each stream offers independent data transfer and flow control, allowing different transactions to proceed in parallel without head-of-line blocking, but all streams share one congestion control context. SST supports both reliable and best-effort delivery in a way that semantically unifies datagrams with streams and solves the classic \"large datagram\" problem, where a datagram's loss probability increases exponentially with fragment count. Finally, an application can prioritize its streams relative to each other and adjust priorities dynamically through out-of-band signaling. A user-space prototype shows that SST is TCP-friendly to within 2%, and performs comparably to a user-space TCP and to within 10% of kernel TCP on a WiFi network.",

The size of the BGP4 routing table, the number of active BGP4 Autonomous Systems, and a lower bound on the total size of the Internet, appear to have fairly simple relationships despite the Internet's growth by two orders of magnitude. In particular, it is observed that the size of the BGP4 system appears to have grown approximately in proportion to the square root of the lower-bound size of the globally addressable Internet. A simple model that partially explains this square law is described. It is not suggested that this observation and model have predictive value, since they cannot predict qualitative changes in the Internet topology. However, they do offer a new way to understand and monitor the scaling of the BGP4 system.",

    "abstract": "Measuring the global Internet is a perpetually challenging task for technical, economic and policy reasons, which leaves scientists as well as policymakers navigating critical questions in their field with little if any empirical grounding. On February 12-13, 2009, CAIDA hosted the Workshop on Active Internet Measurements (AIMS) as part of our series of Internet Statistics and Metrics Analysis (ISMA) workshops which provide a venue for researchers, operators, and policymakers to exchange ideas and perspectives. The two-day workshop included presentations, discussion after each presentation, and breakout sessions focused on how to increase potential and mitigate limitations of active measurements in the wide area Internet. We identified relevant stakeholders who may support and/or oppose measurement, and explored how collaborative solutions might maximize the benefit of research at minimal cost. This report describes the findings of the workshop, outlines open research problems identified by participants, and concludes with recommendations that can benefit both Internet science and communications policy.

    "abstract": "Accuracy and speed are the two most important metrics for Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (NIDS/NIPSes). Due to emerging polymorphic attacks and the fact that in many cases regular expressions (regexes) cannot capture the vulnerability conditions accurately, the accuracy of existing regex-based NIDS/NIPS systems has become a serious problem. In contrast, the recently-proposed vulnerability signatures (a.k.a data patches) can exactly describe the vulnerability conditions and achieve better accuracy. However, how to efficiently apply vulnerability signatures to high speed NIDS/NIPS with a large ruleset remains an untouched but challenging issue. This paper presents the first systematic design of vulnerability signature based parsing and matching engine, NetShield, which achieves multi-gigabit throughput while offering much better accuracy. Particularly, we made the following contributions: (i) we proposed a candidate selection algorithm which efficiently matches thousands of vulnerability signatures simultaneously requiring a small amount of memory; (ii) we proposed an automatic lightweight parsing state machine achieving fast protocol parsing. Experimental results show that the core engine of NetShield achieves at least 1.9+Gbps signature matching throughput on a 3.8GHz single-core PC, and can scale-up to at least 11+Gbps under a 8-core machine for 794 HTTP vulnerability signatures.",

    "abstract": "Cellular radio communication is a significant contributor to battery energy drain on smartphones, in some cases inflating the energy cost by a factor of 5 or more compared to the energy cost of the base device. Stratus is a system to reduce this energy consumption by leveraging cloud resources to make data communication on smartphones more efficient. Using a cloud-based proxy, Stratus employs optimizations that adapt an application's incoming and outgoing traffic to better match the energy characteristics of the radio interface. The optimizations include (a) aggregation to bunch up sporadic transmissions, (b) asymmetric dictionary-based compression to reduce the number of bits transmitted over the air, and (c) opportunistic scheduling to avoid communication during periods of poor signal reception. These optimizations can be used individually, or in combination, subject to an application's delay tolerance. For example, using our Stratus prototype, the aggregation and compression optimizations together achieve up to 50% energy savings for web browsing, while the aggregation and scheduling optimizations together achieve up to 35% energy savings for a media streaming application.",

    "abstract": "ADSL and cable connections are the prevalent technologies available from Internet Service Providers (ISPs) for residential Internet access. Asymmetric access technologies such as these offer high download capacity, but moderate upload capacity. When the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is used on such access networks, performance degradation can occur. In particular, sharing a bottleneck link with different upstream and downstream capacities among competing TCP flows in opposite directions can degrade the throughput of the higher speed link. Despite many research efforts to solve this problem in the past, there is no solution that is both highly effective and easily deployable in residential networks. In this paper, we propose an Asymmetric Queueing (AQ) mechanism that enables full utilization of the bottleneck access link in residential networks with asymmetric capacities. The extensive simulation evaluation of our design shows its effectiveness and robustness in a variety of network conditions. Furthermore, our solution is easy to deploy and configure in residential networks.",

    "abstract": "In many wireless systems, it is desirable to precede a data transmission with a handshake between the sender and the receiver. For example, RTS-CTS is a handshake that prevents collisions due to hidden terminals. Past work, however, has shown that the overhead of such handshake is too high for practical deployments. We present a new approach to wireless handshake that is almost overhead free. The key idea underlying the design is to separate a packet's PLCP header and MAC header from its body and have the sender and receiver first exchange the data and ACK headers, then exchange the bodies of the data and ACK packets without additional headers. The header exchange provides a natural handshake at almost no extra cost. We empirically evaluate the feasibility of such lightweight handshake and some of its applications. Our testbed evaluation shows that header-payload separation does not hamper packet decodabilty. It also shows that a light handshake enables hidden terminals, i.e., nodes that interfere with each other without RTS/CTS, to experience less than 4% of collisions. Furthermore, it improves the accuracy of bit rate selection in bursty and mobile environments producing a throughput gain of about 2x.",

    "abstract": "The vast majority of research in wireless and mobile (WAM) networking falls in the MANET (Mobile Ad Hoc Network) category, where end-to-end paths are the norm. More recently, research has focused on a different Disruption Tolerant Network (DTN) paradigm, where end-to-end paths are the exception and intermediate nodes may store data while waiting for transfer opportunities towards the destination. Protocols developed for MANETs are generally not appropriate for DTNs and vice versa, since the connectivity assumptions are so different. We make the simple but powerful observation that MANETs and DTNs fit into a continuum that generalizes these two previously distinct categories. In this paper, building on this observation, we develop a WAM continuum framework that goes further to scope the entire space of Wireless and Mobile networks so that a network can be characterized by its position in this continuum. Certain network equivalence classes can be defined over subsets of this WAM continuum. We instantiate our framework that allows network connectivity classification and show how that classification relates to routing. We illustrate our approach by applying it to networks described by traces and by mobility models. We also outline how our framework can be used to guide network design and operation.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer an opportunity for the adoption of self-driving networks. However, network operators or home-network users still do not have the right tools to exploit these new advancements in AI, since they have to rely on low-level languages to specify network policies. Intent-based networking (IBN) allows operators to specify high-level policies that dictate how the network should behave without worrying how they are translated into configuration commands in the network devices. However, the existing research proposals for IBN fail to exploit the knowledge and feedback from the network operator to validate or improve the translation of intents. In this paper, we introduce a novel intent-refinement process that uses machine learning and feedback from the operator to translate the operator's utterances into network configurations. Our refinement process uses a sequence-to-sequence learning model to extract intents from natural language and the feedback from the operator to improve learning. The key insight of our process is an intermediate representation that resembles natural language that is suitable to collect feedback from the operator but is structured enough to facilitate precise translations. Our prototype interacts with a network operator using natural language and translates the operator input to the intermediate representation before translating to SDN rules. Our experimental results show that our process achieves a correlation coefficient squared (i.e., R-squared) of 0.99 for a dataset with 5000 entries and the operator feedback significantly improves the accuracy of our model.",

The second part is an end-to-end load control algorithm that intelligently throttles excessive traffic at the edge of the network. We show that, by combining optimal load balancing and end-to-end load control, Bassoon effectively controls overload in SIP networks and outperforms existing schemes in terms of goodput, fairness and responsiveness.",

In this paper, we first examine the fundamental components of management operations and argue that the lack of automation is due to a lack of programmability at the right level of abstraction. To address this challenge, we present DECOR, a database-oriented, declarative framework towards automated network management. DECOR models router configuration and any generic network status as relational data in a conceptually centralized database. As such, network management operations can be represented as a series of transactional database queries, which provide the benefit of atomicity, consistency and isolation. The rule-based language in DECOR provides the flexible programmability to specify and enforce network-wide management constraints, and achieve high-level task scheduling. We describe the design rationale and architecture of DECOR and present some preliminary examples applying our approach to common network management tasks.",

    "abstract": "This paper reports on a workshop convened to develop an action plan to reduce Internet latency. Internet latency has become a focus of attention at the leading edge of the industry as the desire to make Internet applications more responsive outgrows the ability of increased bandwidth to address this problem. There are fundamental limits to the extent to which latency can be reduced, but there is considerable capacity for improvement throughout the system, making Internet latency a multifaceted challenge. Perhaps the greatest challenge of all is to re-educate the mainstream of the industry to understand that bandwidth is not the panacea, and other optimizations, such as reducing packet loss, are at odds with latency reduction. For Internet applications, reducing the latency impact of sharing the communications medium with other users and applications is key. Current Internet network devices were often designed with a belief that additional buffering would reduce packet loss. In practice, this additional buffering leads to intermittently excessive latency and even greater packet loss under saturating load. For this reason, getting smarter queue management techniques more widely deployed is a high priority. We can reduce these intermittent increases in delay, sometimes by up to two orders of magnitude, by shifting the focus from packet loss avoidance to delay avoidance using technology that we already have developed, tested, implemented and deployed today. There is also plenty of scope for removing other major sources of delay. For instance, connecting to a website could be completed in one roundtrip (the time it takes for packets to travel from source to destination and back again) rather than three or four, by folding two or three rounds of flow and security set-up into the first data exchange, without compromising security or efficiency. Motivating the industry to deploy these advances needs to be aided by the availability of mass-market latency testing tools that could give consumers the information they need to gravitate towards low latency services, providers and products. There is no single network latency metric but several alternatives have been identified that compactly express aggregate delay (e.g. as relationships or a constellation), and tools that make use of these will give greater insight into the impact of changes and the diversity of Internet connections around the world. In many developing countries (and in rural regions of developed countries), aside from Internet access itself, there are significant structural issues, such as trombone routes through the developed world and a lack of content distribution networks (CDNs), that need to be addressed with more urgency than Active Queue Management (AQM) deployment, but the `blank slate' of new deployments provides an opportunity to consider latency now. More widespread use of Internet exchange points for hosting local content and fostering local interconnections is key to addressing some of these structural challenges.",

    "abstract": "With only access billing no longer ensuring profits, an ISP's growth now relies on rolling out new and differentiated services. However, ISPs currently do not have a well-defined architecture for rapid, cost-effective, and scalable dissemination of new services. We present iSDF, a new SDN-enabled framework that can meet an ISP's service delivery constraints concerning cost, scalability, deployment flexibility, and operational ease. We show that meeting these constraints necessitates an SDN philosophy for a centralized management plane, a decoupled (from data) control plane, and a programmable data plane at customer premises. We present an ISP service delivery framework (iSDF) that provides ISPs a domain-specific API for network function virtualization by leveraging a programmable middlebox built from commodity home-routers. It also includes an application server to disseminate, configure, and update ISP services. We develop and report results for three diverse ISP applications that demonstrate the practicality and flexibility of iSDF, namely distributed VPN (control plane decisions), pay-per-site (rapid deployment), and BitTorrent blocking (data plane processing).",

    "abstract": "Integrating optical circuit switches in data-centers is an on-going research challenge. In recent years, state-of-the-art solutions introduce hybrid packet/circuit architectures for different optical circuit switch technologies, control techniques, and traffic rerouting methods. These solutions are based on separated packet and circuit planes which do not have the ability to utilize an optical circuit with flows that do not arrive from or delivered to switches directly connected to the circuit's end-points. Moreover, current SDN-based elephant flow rerouting methods require a forwarding rule for each flow, which raise scalability issues. In this paper, we present C-Share -- a practical, scalable SDN-based circuit sharing solution for data center networks. C-Share inherently enable elephant flows to share optical circuits by exploiting a flat upper tier network topology. C-Share is based on a scalable and decoupled SDN-based elephant flow rerouting method comprised of elephant flow detection, tagging and identification, which is utilized by using a prevalent network sampling method (e.g., sFlow). C-Share requires only a single OpenFlow rule for each optical circuit, and therefore significantly reduces the required OpenFlow rule entry footprint and setup rule rate. It also mitigates the OpenFlow outbound latency for subsequent elephant flows. We implement a proof-of-concept system for C-Share based on Mininet, and test the scalability of C-Share by using an event driven simulation. Our results show a consistent increase in the mice/elephant flow separation in the network which, in turn, improves both network throughput and flow completion time.",

These findings motivate government agencies such as the FCC in the US to provide incentives to services providers to deploy broadband infrastructure in unserved or underserved areas. In this paper, we describe a framework for identifying target areas for network infrastructure deployment. Our approach considers (i) infrastructure availability, (ii) user demographics, and (iii) deployment costs. We use multi-objective optimization to identify geographic areas that have the highest concentrations of un/underserved users and that can be upgraded at the lowest cost. To demonstrate the efficacy of our framework, we consider physical infrastructure and demographic data from the US and two different deployment cost models. Our results identify a list of counties that would be attractive targets for broadband deployment from both cost and impact perspectives. We conclude with discussion on the implications and broader applications of our framework.",

    "abstract": "A longstanding problem with the Internet is that it is vulnerable to outages, black holes, hijacking and denial of service. Although architectural solutions have been proposed to address many of these issues, they have had difficulty being adopted due to the need for widespread adoption before most users would see any benefit. This is especially relevant as the Internet is increasingly used for applications where correct and continuous operation is essential. In this paper, we study whether a simple, easy to implement model is sufficient for addressing the aforementioned Internet vulnerabilities. Our model, called ARROW (Advertised Reliable Routing Over Waypoints), is designed to allow users to configure reliable and secure end to end paths through participating providers. With ARROW, a highly reliable ISP offers tunneled transit through its network, along with packet transformation at the ingress, as a service to remote paying customers. Those customers can stitch together reliable end to end paths through a combination of participating and non-participating ISPs in order to improve the fault-tolerance, robustness, and security of mission critical transmissions. Unlike efforts to redesign the Internet from scratch, we show that ARROW can address a set of well-known Internet vulnerabilities, for most users, with the adoption of only a single transit ISP. To demonstrate ARROW, we have added it to a small-scale wide-area ISP we control. We evaluate its performance and failure recovery properties in both simulation and live settings.",

    "abstract": "ISPs are increasingly offering a variety of network-based services such as VPN, VPLS, VoIP, Virtual-Wire and DDoS protection. Although both enterprise and residential networks are rapidly adopting these services, there is little systematic work on the design challenges and trade-offs ISPs face in providing them. The goal of our paper is to understand the complexity underlying the layer-3 design of services and to highlight potential factors that hinder their introduction, evolution and management. Using daily snapshots of configuration and device metadata collected from a tier-1 ISP, we examine the logical dependencies and special cases in device configurations for five different network-based services. We find: (1) the design of the core data-plane is usually service-agnostic and simple, but the control-planes for different services become more complex as services evolve; (2) more crucially, the configuration at the service edge inevitably becomes more complex over time, potentially hindering key management issues such as service upgrades and troubleshooting; and (3) there are key service-specific issues that also contribute significantly to the overall design complexity. Thus, the high prevalent complexity could impede the adoption and growth of network-based services. We show initial evidence that some of the complexity can be mitigated systematically.",

    "abstract": "Recent papers have shown that wire-speed packet processing is feasible in software even at 10~Gbit/s, but the result has been achieved taking direct control of the network controllers to cut down OS and device driver overheads. In this paper we show how to achieve similar performance in safer conditions on standard operating systems. As in some other proposals, our framework, called netmap, maps packet buffers into the process' memory space; but unlike other proposals, any operation that may affect the state of the hardware is filtered by the OS. This protects the system from crashes induced by misbehaving programs, and simplifies the use of the API. Our tests show that netmap takes as little as 90 clock cycles to move one packet between the wire and the application, almost one order of magnitude less than using the standard OS path. A single core at 1.33~GHz can send or receive packets at wire speed on 10~Gbit/s links (14.8~Mpps), with very good scalability in the number of cores and clock speed. At least three factors contribute to this performance: i) no overhead for encapsulation and metadata management; ii) no per-packet system calls and data copying (ioctl()s are still required, but involve no copying and their cost is amortized over a batch of packets); iii) much simpler device driver operation, because buffers have a plain and simple format that requires",

A common approach is to store user data at users' devices, and to query the data in such a way that a differentially private noisy result is produced without exposing individual user data to any system component. A particular challenge is to design a system that scales well while limiting how much the malicious users can distort the result. This paper presents SplitX , a high-performance analytics system for making differentially private queries over distributed user data. SplitX is typically two to three orders of magnitude more efficient in bandwidth, and from three to five orders of magnitude more efficient in computation than previous comparable systems, while operating under a similar trust model. SplitX accomplishes this performance by replacing public-key operations with exclusive-or operations.

    "abstract": "Legacy congestion controls including TCP and its variants are known to perform poorly over cellular networks due to highly variable capacities over short time scales, self-inflicted packet delays, and packet losses unrelated to congestion. To cope with these challenges, we present Verus, an end-to-end congestion control protocol that uses delay measurements to react quickly to the capacity changes in cellular networks without explicitly attempting to predict the cellular channel dynamics. The key idea of Verus is to continuously learn a delay profile that captures the relationship between end-to-end packet delay and outstanding window size over short epochs and uses this relationship to increment or decrement the window size based on the observed short-term packet delay variations. While the delay-based control is primarily for congestion avoidance, Verus uses standard TCP features including multiplicative decrease upon packet loss and slow start. Through a combination of simulations, empirical evaluations using cellular network traces, and real-world evaluations against standard TCP flavors and state of the art protocols like Sprout, we show that Verus outperforms these protocols in cellular channels. In comparison to TCP Cubic, Verus achieves an order of magnitude (&gt; 10x) reduction in delay over 3G and LTE networks while achieving comparable throughput (sometimes marginally higher). In comparison to Sprout, Verus achieves up to 30% higher throughput in rapidly changing cellular networks.",

    "abstract": "Global synchronization across time and frequency domains significantly benefits wireless communications. Multi-Cell (Network) MIMO, interference alignment solutions, opportunistic routing techniques in ad-hoc networks, OFDMA etc. all necessitate synchronization in either time or frequency domain or both. This paper presents sysname, a system that exploits the easily accessible and ubiquitous power line infrastructure to achieve synchronization in time and frequency domains across nodes distributed beyond a single-collision domain. sysname uses the power lines to transmit a reference frequency tone to which each node locks its frequency. sysname exploits the steady periodicity of delivered power signal itself to synchronize distributed nodes in time. We validate the extent of sysname's synchronization and evaluate its effectiveness. We verify sysname's suitability for wireless applications such as OFDMA and multi-cell MIMO by validating the benefits of global synchronization in an enterprise wireless network. Our experiments show a throughput gain of 8.2x over MegaMIMO, 7x over NemoX and 2.5x over OFDMA systems. Enterprise wireless networks are supported by an Ethernet backbone. Researchers have been exploring techniques over the backbone to enable and assist in improving the performance of the wireless networks. Recent work also showed the benefit of sharing information in the air between the nodes to enable higher performance of the network. Even sharing information as little as synchronization information has been demonstrated to open new avenues (such as MU-MIMO, Physical Network Coding, Opportunistic routing, etc.) for the wireless networks to enhance its performance. However, another medium shared by majority of the nodes in the enterprise network - the power line infrastructure - has been largely left untapped to assist the wireless network. While the power lines are noisy and have a frequency selective transmission characteristic, its uniqueness is that its range can extend beyond that over air while it is unburdened by switching and other responsibilities of the Ethernet backbone. This paper poses the following question: How best to exploit the opportunity presented by the power lines to further enhance enterprise wireless networks? The key contributions of this paper are the following: Identify and demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing power lines as a medium to achieve synchronization (in time and frequency domains) between nodes in the network; Demonstrate the scalability of this technique by achieving synchronization between nodes beyond the transmission range of any of the individual nodes. The paper presents empirical results pertaining to the accuracy of synchronization and the benefit of the proposed synchronization method to existing distributed wireless techniques by virtue of extension across multiple collision domains.",

    "abstract": "In most network models for quality of service support, the communication links interconnecting the switches and gateways are assumed to have fixed bandwidth and zero error rate. This assumption of steadiness, especially in a heterogeneous internet-working environment, might be invalid owing to subnetwork multiple-access mechanism, link-level flow/error control, and user mobility. Techniques are presented in this paper to characterize and analyze work-conserving communication nodes with varying output rate. In the deterministic approach, the notion of \"fluctuation constraint,\" analogous to the \"burstiness constraint\" for traffic characterization, is introduced to characterize the node. In the statistical approach, the variable-rate output is modelled as an \"exponentially bounded fluctuation\" process in a way similar to the \"exponentially bounded burstiness\" method for traffic modelling. Based on these concepts, deterministic and statistical bounds on queue size and packet delay in isolated variable-rate communication server-nodes are derived, including cases of single-input and multiple-input under first-come-first-serve queueing. Queue size bounds are shown to be useful for buffer requirement and packet loss probability estimation at individual nodes. Our formulations also facilitate the computation of end-to-end performance bounds across a feedforward network of variable-rate server-nodes. Several numerical examples of interest are given in the discussion.",

    "abstract": "Active networks accelerate network evolution by permitting the network infrastructure to be programmable, on a per-user, per-packet, or other basis. This programmability must be balanced against the safety and security needs inherent in shared resources.This paper describes the design, implementation, and performance of a new type of network element, an Active Bridge. The active bridge can be reprogrammed \"on the fly\", with loadable modules called switchlets. To demonstrate the use of the active property, we incrementally extend what is initially a programmable buffered repeater with switchlets into a self-learning bridge, and then a bridge supporting spanning tree algorithms. To demonstrate the agility that active networking gives, we show how it is possible to upgrade a network from an \"old\" protocol to a \"new\" protocol on-the-fly. Moreover, we are able to take advantage of information unavailable to the implementors of either protocol to validate the new protocol and fall back to the old protocol if an error is detected. This shows that the Active Bridge can protect itself from some algorithmic failures in loadable modules.Our approach to safety and security favors static checking and prevention over dynamic checks when possible. We rely on strong type checking in the Caml language for the loadable module infrastructure, and achieve respectable performance. The prototype implementation on a Pentium-based HP Netserver LS running Linux with 100 Mbps Ethernet LANS achieves ttcp throughput of 16 Mbps between two PCs running Linux, compared with 76 Mbps unbridged.

We use large deviation theory to study this problem and to motivate the design of Renegotiated Constant Bit Rate Service (RCBR), that adds renegotiation and buffer monitoring to traditional CBR service. We argue the the load placed on signalling by RCBR can be handled by current technology. We present a) an algorithm to compute the optimal renegotiation schedule for stored (off-line) traffic, and b) a heuristic to approximate the optimal schedule for online traffic. Simulation experiments show that RCBR is able to extract almost all of the statistical multiplexing gain available by exploiting slow time-scale variations in traffic. In more general terms, we believe that a clean system design must match control time-scales to the time scales over which the workload varies. RCBR works well because it makes intelligent use of this time-scale separation.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present a new technique called Optimised Batch Patching with Classes of Service(OBP with CoS) which can be used to leverage the benefits of multicast within the context of 'near' video-on-demand systems in IP networks. OBP with CoS builds on an earlier scheme, known as Optimised Patching, but is different in two respects. Firstly, in OBP with CoS, the server artificially delays requests in order to increase the probability of accumulating duplicates, thereby allowing greater exploitation of multicast compared to Optimised Patching albeit at the expense of higher latency until commencement of service. Secondly, the client is able to request a latency class of service which reflects how long the client is prepared to wait until playout of the video. The server scheduling algorithm attempts to minimise network bandwidth consumption within the constraints imposed by the class of each request. We present analysis and simulations of our scheme in order to validate its effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "&lt;i&gt;IP Paging&lt;/i&gt; has received considerable attention recently. The IETF has decided to develop an IP Paging protocol and some IP Paging protocols have been proposed by researchers [13, 12]. However all of these proposals use static and manually configured paging areas. We argue that the size and the shape of paging areas are very critical for the performance of a paging system. A system that allows each host to use a paging area that adapts to its mobility and communication patterns will perform better. This paper proposes to extend the IETF IP Paging functional architecture to support &lt;i&gt;adaptive and per-host&lt;/i&gt; paging areas. We introduce a new functional module, the &lt;i&gt;Paging Area Configuration Agent&lt;/i&gt; (PACA), that automatically configures the paging area relative to each cell of a cellular domain.",

    "abstract": "Connection acceptance control is a mechanism which can be used to moderate the load placed on a network by turning away connection requests during times of overload. Traditionally these mechanisms have been implemented by setting up state within a network using signalling protocols, such as the IETF's Resource Reservation Protocol. There have been recent proposals for admission control based on end-systems probing the network to infer network load. These distributed algorithms often have less router state and hence scale more easily. This paper discusses an ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) probe-based admission control protocol that is fast, scalable and robust. The protocol's performance is then studied through simulation. It is concluded that probe-based admission control is viable in both partitioned and integrated networks, but more research is needed to understand the implications for network policy control.",

The Flexible Intra-AS Routing Environment (FIRE) is a link-state, intra-domain routing protocol that decouples these components. FIRE supports run-time-pro- grammable algorithms and metrics over a secure link-state distribution protocol. By allowing the network operator to dynamically reprogram both the information being advertised and the routing algorithm used to construct forwarding tables in Java, FIRE enables the development and deployment of novel routing algorithms without the need for a new protocol to distribute state. FIRE supports multiple concurrent routing algorithms and metrics, each constructing separate forwarding tables. By using operator-specified packet filters, separate classes of traffic are routed using completely different routing algorithms, all supported by a single routing protocol.",

The fundamental objective of the scheme is to bridge the gap between routing and congestion control as the network becomes congested. Because propagation delay far out shadows queueing and transmission delay in high speed networks, the proposed routing scheme works as a shortest path (minimum hop) first algorithm under light traffic conditions. However as the shortest path becomes congested, the source node uses multiple paths when and if available in order to distribute the load and reduce packet loss. The scheme is a cross between Alternate Path routing and Trunk Reservation. We compare the performance of the proposed scheme with the Shortest Path Only algorithm, the Alternate Path routing algorithm, the Random Routing algorithm, and the Trunk Reservation scheme. The throughput and packet loss performance are compared via simulations. These have been carried out concentrating on a 5 node network with varying traffic patterns, the intention being to gain insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the various schemes.",

Currently, however, network architects have had to sacrifice one for the other. We present a new packet-filter system, DPF (Dynamic Packet Filters), that provides both the traditional flexibility of packet filters [18] and the speed of hand-crafted demultiplexing routines [3]. DPF filters run 10-50 times faster than the fastest packet filters reported in the literature [1, 17, 18, 27]. DPF's performance is either equivalent to or, when it can exploit runtime information, superior to hand-coded demultiplexors. DPF achieves high performance by using a carefully-designed declarative packet-filter language that is aggressively optimized using dynamic code generation. The contributions of this work are: (1) a detailed description of the DPF design, (2) discussion of the use of dynamic code generation and quantitative results on its performance impact, (3) quantitative results on how DPF is used in the Aegis kernel to export network devices safely and securely to user space so that UDP and TCP can be implemented efficiently as user-level libraries, and (4) the unrestricted release of DPF into the public domain.",

Second, the benefits of expanding the basic computation unit of the OSI checksum algorithm to 16--bits integers is considered. This change can yield an additional performance improvement of up to 50% and greatly extended error detection properties, although it is incompatible with the current standard.

    "abstract": "Today the Internet offers a single path between end-systems even though it intrinsically has a large multiplicity of paths. This paper proposes an evolutionary architectural framework \"BANANAS\" aimed at simplifying the introduction of multipath routing in the Internet. The framework starts with the observation that a path can be encoded as a short hash (\"PathID\") of a sequence of globally known identifiers. The PathID therefore has global significance (unlike MPLS or ATM labels). This property allows multipath capable nodes to autonomously compute PathIDs in a partially upgraded network without requiring an explicit signaling protocol for path setup. We show that this framework allows the introduction of sophisticated explicit routing and multipath capabilities within the context of widely deployed connectionless routing protocols (e.g. OSPF, IS-IS, BGP) or overlay networks. We establish these characteristics through the development of PathID encoding and route-computation schemes. The BANANAS framework also allows considerable flexibility in terms of architectural function placement and complexity management. To illustrate this feature, we develop an efficient variable-length hashing scheme that moves control-plane complexity and state over-heads to network edges, allowing a very simple interior node design. All the schemes have been evaluated using both sizable SSFNet simulations and Linux/Zebra implementation evaluated on Utah's Emulab testbed facility.",

The result is that the addresses of each multihomed node form an unalterable set of intrinsically bound IPv6 addresses. This allows any node that is communicating with the multihomed node to securely verify that all the alternative addresses proposed through the multihoming protocol are associated to the address used for establishing the communication. The verification process is extremely efficient because it only involves hash operations.",

The networks that we wish to investigate here consist of computers at various sites which are linked together by telecommunications circuits. Many of the results of graph theory may be applied to such networks; we will restrict ourselves to the consideration of connectivity. In designing a computer communications network, it is desirable to provide good connectivity among all sites at reasonable cost. For this reason, extremes like the fully-connected network (too expensive) and the star network (only as reliable as its center) are usually not considered. The connectivity constraints or reliability measures can be stated in different ways, and analytic techniques have been developed for some of these measures. Further, procedures for the synthesis of well-connected networks have also been invented. The reliability of communications networks is an important issue in their design and operation. Telecommunications circuits become noisy and unusable, and the communications computers may also fail. This report is a survey of that part of applied graph theory which is useful in the study of the connectivity of communications networks.",

    "abstract": "The Open Network Laboratory (ONL) is a remotely accessible network testbed designed to enable networking faculty, students and researchers to conduct experiments using high performance routers and applications. The system is built around a set of extensible, high-performance routers and has a graphical interface that enables users to easily configure and run experiments remotely. ONL's Remote Laboratory Interface (RLI) allows users to easily configure a network topology, configure routes and packet filters in the routers, assign flows or flow aggregates to separate queues with configurable QoS and attach hardware monitoring points to real-time charts. The remote visualization features of the RLI make it easy to directly view the effects of traffic as it moves through a router, allowing the user to gain better insight into system behavior and create compelling demonstrations. Each port of the router is equipped with an embedded processor that provides a simple environment for software plugins allowing users to extend the system's functionality. This paper describes the general facilties and some networking experiments that can be carried out.

    "abstract": "We study limitations of an equation-based congestion control protocol, called TFRC (TCP Friendly Rate Control). It examines how the three main factors that determine TFRC throughput, namely, the TCP friendly equation, loss event rate estimation and delay estimation, can influence the long-term throughput imbalance between TFRC and TCP. Especially, we show that different sending rates of competing flows cause these flows to experience different loss event rates. There are several fundamental reasons why TFRC and TCP flows have different average sending rates, from the first place. Earlier work shows that the convexity of the TCP friendly equation used in TFRC causes the sending rate difference. We report two additional reasons in this paper: (1) the convexity of 1/ x where x is a loss event period and (2) different RTO (retransmission timeout period) estimations of TCP and TFRC. These factors can be the reasons for TCP and TFRC to experience initially different sending rates. But we find that the loss event rate difference due to the differing sending rates greatly amplifies the initial throughput difference; in some extreme cases, TFRC uses around 20 times more, or sometimes 10 times less, bandwidth than TCP.",

This autonomously exercised policy freedom can cause instability, where unresolvable policy-based disputes in the network result in interdomain route oscillations. Several recent works have established that such instabilities can only be eliminated by enforcing a globally accepted preference ordering on routes (such as shortest path). To resolve this conflict between policy autonomy and system stability, we propose a distributed mechanism that enforces a preference ordering only when disputes resulting in oscillations exist. This preserves policy freedom when possible, and imposes stability when required.",

We present ProgME, a Prog rammable ME asurement architecture based on a novel concept of flowset - arbitrary set of flows defined according to application requirements and/or traffic conditions. Through a simple flowset composition language, ProgME can incorporate application requirements, adapt itself to circumvent the challenges on scalability posed by the large number of flows, and achieve a better application-perceived accuracy.

Previous research has shown promise in tracking energy usage and rationing it to meet device lifetime goals, but such mechanisms and policies are still nascent, especially regarding user interaction. We argue for a new operating system, called Cinder, which builds on top of the HiStar OS. Cinder's energy awareness is based on hierarchical capacitors and task profiles.

Unlike prior measurement services, MGRP transparently piggybacks application packets inside the often significant amounts of empty padding contained in typical probes. Using MGRP thus combines the modularity, flexibility, and accuracy of standalone active measurement tools with the lower overhead of passive measurement techniques. Microbenchmark experiments show that the resulting bandwidth savings makes it possible to measure the network accurately, but faster and more aggressively than without piggybacking, and with few ill effects to piggybacked application or competing traffic. When using MGRP to schedule measurements on behalf of MediaNet, an overlay service that adaptively schedules media streams, we show MediaNet can achieve significantly higher streaming rates under the same network conditions.",

    "abstract": "This is a report on the Workshop on Tracking Quality of Experience in the Internet, held at Princeton, October 21--22, 2015, jointly sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the Federal Communication Commission. The term Quality of Experience (QoE) describes a user's subjective assessment of their experience when using a particular application. In the past, network engineers have typically focused on Quality of Service (QoS): performance metrics such as throughput, delay and jitter, packet loss, and the like. Yet, performance as measured by QoS parameters only matters if it affects the experience of users, as they attempt to use a particular application. Ultimately, the user's experience is determined by QoE impairments (e.g., rebuffering). Although QoE and QoS are related---for example, a video rebuffering event may be caused by high packet-loss rate---QoE metrics ultimately affect a user's experience. Identifying the causes of QoE impairments is complex, since the impairments may arise in one or another region of the network, in the home network, on the user's device, in servers that are part of the application, or in supporting services such as the DNS. Additionally, metrics for QoE continue to evolve, as do the methods for relating QoE impairments to underlying causes that could be measurable using standard network measurement techniques. Finally, as the capabilities of the underlying network infrastructure continues to evolve, researchers should also consider how to design infrastructure and tools can best support measurements that can better identify the locations and causes of QoE impairments. The workshop's aim was to understand the current state of QoE research and to contemplate a community agenda to integrate ongoing threads of QoE research into a collaboration. This summary report describes the topics discussed and summarize the key points of the discussion. Materials related to the workshop are available at http://aqualab.cs.northwestern.edu/NSFWorkshop-InternetQoE.",

    "abstract": "In OpenFlow, multiple switches share the same control plane which is centralized at what is called the OpenFlow controller. A switch only consists of a forwarding plane. Rules for forwarding individual packets (called flow entries in OpenFlow) are pushed from the controller to the switches. In a network with a high arrival rate of new flows, such as in a data center, the control traffic between the switch and controller can become very high. As a consequence, routing of new flows will be slow. One way to reduce control traffic is to use wildcarded flow entries. Wildcard flow entries can be used to create default routes in the network. However, since switches do not keep track of flows covered by a wildcard flow entry, the controller no longer has knowledge about individual flows. To find out about these individual flows we propose an extension to the current OpenFlow standard to enable packet sampling of wildcard flow entries.",

    "abstract": "Reproducibility: the extent to which consistent results are obtained when an experiment is repeated, is important as a means to validate experimental results, promote integrity of research, and accelerate follow up work. Commitment to artifact reviewing and badging seeks to promote reproducibility and rank the quality of submitted artifacts. However, as illustrated in this issue, the current badging scheme, with its focus upon an artifact being reusable, may not identify limitations of architecture, implementation, or evaluation. We propose that to improve the insight into artifact reproducibility, the depth and nature of artifact evaluation must move beyond simply considering if an artifact is reusable. Artifact evaluation should consider the methods of that evaluation alongside the varying of inputs to that evaluation. To achieve this, we suggest an extension to the scope of artifact badging, and describe both approaches and best practice arising in other communities. We seek to promote conversation and make a call to action intended to strengthen the scientific method within our domain.",

Ad exchanges run auctions to sell publishers' inventory-space on Web pages-to advertisers who want to display ads in those spaces. Unfortunately, under the status quo, the parties to an auction cannot check that the auction was carried out correctly, which raises the following more general question: how can we create verifiability in low-latency, high-frequency auctions where the parties do not know each other? We address this question with the design, prototype implementation, and experimental evaluation of VEX. VEX introduces a technique for efficient, privacy-preserving integer comparisons; couples these with careful protocol design; and adds little latency and tolerable overhead.",

    "abstract": "Mobile gaming has become increasingly popular in the past few years with the proliferation of smartphones that have the increased CPU, memory, and network (3.5G etc.) capabilities to support a vast range of interesting games. In addition, these phones also have high quality displays, such as Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLED) displays, that allow the intricate details in games to be shown in vivid detail to end users. Unfortunately, these displays tend to consume a lot of energy - which in turn limits the amount of time that a user can spend actually playing games on these devices. In this paper, we describe a technique that makes use of saliency, with respect to the end user, to reduce the power consumption of OLED displays when they are used for games, by reducing the brightness of game areas that are not of interest currently to the game player. We evaluated our technique with a user study and showed that even for fast-paced shooting games, our solution is able to save a modest amount of power with no impact in the end user gaming experience.",

Most traditional DFL methods have a main drawback that as the pre-obtained Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements (i.e., fingerprint) in one area cannot be directly applied to the new area for localization, and the calibration process of each area will result in the human effort exhausting problem. In this paper, we propose FALE, a fine-grained transferring DFL method that can adaptively work in different areas with little human effort and low energy consumption. FALE employs a rigorously designed transferring function to transfer the fingerprint into a projected space, and reuse it across different areas, thus greatly reduce the human effort. On the other hand, FALE can reduce the data volume and energy consumption by taking advantage of the compressive sensing (CS) theory. Extensive real-word experimental results also illustrate the effectiveness of FALE.",

This paper introduces the problem of finding \"proofs of avoidance\": evidence that the paths taken by a packet and its response avoided a user-specified set of \"forbidden\" geographic regions. Proving that something did not happen is often intractable, but we demonstrate a low-overhead proof structure built around the idea of what we call \"alibis\": relays with particular timing constraints that, when upheld, would make it impossible to traverse both the relay and the forbidden regions. We present Alibi Routing, a peer-to-peer overlay routing system for finding alibis securely and efficiently. One of the primary distinguishing characteristics of Alibi Routing is that it does not require knowledge of--or modifications to--the Internet's routing hardware or policies. Rather, Alibi Routing is able to derive its proofs of avoidance from user-provided GPS coordinates and speed of light propagation delays. Using a PlanetLab deployment and larger-scale simulations, we evaluate Alibi Routing to demonstrate that many source-destination pairs can avoid countries of their choosing with little latency inflation. We also identify when Alibi Routing does not work: it has difficulty avoiding regions that users are very close to (or, of course, inside of).",

    "abstract": "DNS is the canonical protocol for connectionless UDP. Yet DNS today is challenged by eavesdropping that compromises privacy, source-address spoofing that results in denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on the server and third parties, injection attacks that exploit fragmentation, and size limitations that constrain policy and operational choices. We propose T-DNS to address these problems. It uses TCP to smoothly support large payloads and to mitigate spoofing and amplification for DoS. T-DNS uses transport-layer security (TLS) to provide privacy from users to their DNS resolvers and optionally to authoritative servers. Our model shows end-to-end latency from TLS to the recursive resolver is only about 9% slower when UDP is used to the authoritative server, and 22% slower with TCP to the authoritative. With diverse traces we show that frequent connection reuse is possible (60-95% for stub and recursive resolvers, although half that for authoritative servers). Our experiment shows that after connection establishment, TCP and TLS latency is equivalent to UDP. With conservative timeouts (20 s at authoritative servers and 60 s elsewhere) and conservative estimates of connection state memory requirements, we show that server memory requirements well within current, commodity server hardware. We identify the key design and implementation decisions needed to minimize overhead: query pipelining, out-of-order responses, TLS connection resumption, and plausible timeouts.

This paper provides experimental results with two different Multipath QUIC implementations based on NS3 simulations to understand the impact of using one packet number space per path or a single packet number space for the whole connection.

Iris is built around third party free open source software and modern containerization technology, thereby presenting a new model for assembling a resilient and maintainable internet measurement architecture. We show that carefully choosing the destinations to probe from which vantage point matters to optimize topology discovery and that a system can learn which assignment will maximize the overall discovery based on previous measurements. After 10 cycles of probing, Zeph is capable of discovering 2.4M nodes and 10M links in a cycle of 6 hours, when deployed on 5 Iris agents.

Since the model had been published in 1984, this was in accordance with ISO practice of reviewing and revising standards every five years, and there was good reason for considering the task. Over the intervening five years, the groups developing the OSI protocols had raised many questions about the architecture and these had been answered and documented in the Approved Commentaries [1994]. Many of these commentaries contained information that could be usefully incorporated into the Reference Model itself. In addition, the addendum describing connectionless mode, i.e. datagrams, had been completed several years before and needed to be incorporated. There was also considerable demand for interworking connection-mode and connectionless mode communication, something not supported by the Reference Model or any architecture. Also, when the original version of the Reference Model was frozen about 1983 some aspects of OSI such as the upper layers were not well understood and were only described in the most cursory manner. And while connection-mode and connectionless mode had been brought within OSI, there was no indication as to how broadcast and multicast were to be handled. Thus, the revision might be able to provide a more comprehensive description of these areas.This paper describes how the revision was carried out, describes the changes and additions that were made, considers the effect and contribution this revision has made to our understanding, and describes the outstanding issues that were not addressed by this revision.",

    "abstract": "The VBR video traffic exhibits high burstiness and correlation properties that are quite complex to be captured by a single traffic model. Efficient resource management based on few parameters of the source traffic is highly desirable. The real-time VBR video traffic has stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements such as delay (few milliseconds) and cell loss (1 in 10 -5 ) that are difficult to achieve with good utilization (&amp;gt; 0.6) by static bandwidth allocation schemes. In order to satisfy such QoS constraints with good utilization, proper adaptive mechanisms have to be devised. This paper presents a dynamic bandwidth allocation scheme for VBR video traffic based on buffer monitoring and a simple LMS (least mean square) traffic prediction system. The goal is to reduce the frequency of the bandwidth reallocations and at the same time reduce the Cell-loss Ratio (CLR) with increased utilization. Simulation results indicate that utilization up to 0.8 can be achieved by the proposed scheme even under high source alignment [26] for bursty VBR video traffic. It is found that the proposed adaptive scheme outperforms the static FCFS allocation scheme with lower buffer requirements and fewer (&amp;lt; 5%) bandwidth reallocations.",

In particular, we study the synchronization of periodic routing messages. We give examples of the harmful effect of these synchronized updates on other network traffic, and offer guidelines on how to avoid inadvertent synchronization. Using simulations and analysis, we study the process of synchronization and show that the transition from unsynchronized to synchronized traffic is not one of gradual degradation but is instead a very abrupt 'phase transition': in general, the addition of a single router will convert a completely unsynchronized traffic stream into a completely synchronized one. We show that synchronization can be avoided by the addition of randomization to the traffic sources and quantify how much randomization is necessary. In addition, we argue that the inadvertent synchronization of periodic processes is likely to become an increasing problem in computer networks.",

We show that other shared-tree multicast routing protocols are subject to attacks against the multicast routing infrastructure that can isolate receivers or domains or introduce loops into the structure of the multicast routing tree. KHIP changes the multicast routing model so that only trusted members are able to join the multicast tree. This protects the multicast routing against attacks that could form branches to unauthorized receivers, prevents replay attacks and limits the effects of flooding attacks. Untrusted routers that are present on the path between trusted routers cannot change the routing and can mount no denial-of-service attack stronger than simply dropping control messages. KHIP also provides a simple mechanism for distributing data encryption keys while adding little overhead to the protocol.",

    "abstract": "Reliable multicast protocols scale only as well as their ability to localize traffic. This is true for repair requests, repairs, and the session traffic that enables receivers to suppress extraneous requests and repairs. We propose a new reliable multicast traffic localization technique called Scoped Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest with Forward Error Correction (SHARQFEC). SHARQFEC operates in an end-to-end fashion and localizes traffic using a hierarchy of administratively scoped regions. Session traffic is further reduced through the use of a novel method for indirectly determining the distances between session members. For large sessions, this mechanism reduces the amount of session traffic by several orders of magnitude over non-scoped protocols such as Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM). Forward Error Correction is selectively added to regions which are experiencing greater loss, thereby reducing the volume of repair traffic and recovery times. Receivers request additional repairs as necessary. Simulations show that SHARQFEC out performs both SRM and non-scoped hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest / Forward Error Correction protocols. Assuming the widespread deployment of administrative scoping, SHARQFEC could conceivably provide scalable reliable delivery to tens of millions of receivers without huge increases in network bandwidth.",

Non-repudiation services protect the transacting parties against any false denial that a particular event or action has taken place, in which evidence will be generated, collected and maintained to enable the settlement of disputes. Several fair non-repudiation protocols have been proposed, which support non-repudiation of origin and non-repudiation of receipt while neither the originator nor the recipient can gain an advantage by quitting prematurely or otherwise misbehaving during a transaction. However, a critical issue on how to maintain the validity of non-repudiation evidence efficiently during and after a transaction was not considered.

The scheme is based on periodic transmission through the network of time-stamped sampling packets that sense the congestion status of the network. Upon reception, the sampling packet delays are calculated, averaged, and used to determine the state of the network. The information on the state of the network is then used to drive the network adaptive admission control. The major advantage of the proposed scheme over conventional congestion control techniques is that it copes with traffic surges that are shorter than the network round-trip delay. This is achieved by controlling traffic admission with continuous estimate of the network state. The scheme is targeted toward networks that carry aggregated traffic, and can be applied to ATM-based networks.",

In this paper, we present a scheme for restoring real-time channels, each with guaranteed timeliness, from component failures in multi-hop networks. To ensure fast/guaranteed recovery, backup channels are set up a priori in addition to each primary channel . That is, a dependable real-time connection consists of a primary channel and one or more backup channels. If a primary channel fails, one of its backup channels is activated to become a new primary channel. We describe a protocol which provides an integrated solution to the failure-recovery problem (i.e., channel switching, resource re-allocation, ...). We also present a resource sharing method that significantly reduces the overhead of backup channels. The simulation results show that good coverage (in recovering from failures) can be achieved with about 30% degradation in network utilization under a reasonable failure condition. Moreover, the fault-tolerance level of each dependable connection can be controlled, independently of other connections, to reflect its criticality.",

Though the causes of soft failures vary, to the network user such failures are perceived as noticeably degraded or anomalous performance.This work uses anomaly detection as a means to signal performance degradations that are indicative of network soft failures. Detection is done via a signature matching mechanism, call a fault feature vector, which will detect the occurrence of a fault by looking for anomaly conditions particular to the fault. In a two-year study of the Carnegie Mellon University Computer Science Network the fault feature vector mechanism proved effective in detecting faults and discriminating between faults types. This mechanism was also effective at abstracting large amounts of network data to only those events which warranted operator attention; in this two-year study, over 32 million monitored data points were reduced to under a two hundred event matchings.",

Fair Queuing algorithms provide a method for proportionally sharing a single server among competing flows, however, they do not address the problem of sharing multiple servers. Multiserver systems arise in a number of applications including link aggregation, multiprocessors and multi-path storage I/O. In this paper we introduce a new service discipline for multi-server systems that provides guarantees for competing flows. We prove that this new service discipline is a close approximation of the idealized Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) discipline. We calculate its maximum packet delay and service discrepancy with respect to GPS. We also discuss its relevance to several applications, in particular, Ethernet link aggregation.",

    "abstract": "When two or more distinct organizations interconnect their internal computer networks they form an Inter-Organization Network(ION) . IONs support the exchange of cad/cam data between manufacturers and subcontractors, software distribution from vendors to users, customer input to suppliers' order-entry systems, and the shared use of expensive computational resources by research laboratories, as examples. This paper analyzes the technical implications of interconnecting networks across organization boundaries. After analyzing the organization context in which IONs are used, we demonstrate that such interconnections are not satisfied by traditional network design criteria of connectivity and transparency. To the contrary, a primary high-level requirement is access control, and participating organizations must be able to limit connectivity and make network boundaries visible. We describe a scheme based on non-discretionary control which allows interconnecting organizations to combine gateway, network, and system-level mechanisms to enforce cross-boundary control over invocation and information flow, while minimizing interference with internal operations. Access control requirements such as these impose new requirements on the underlying interconnection protocols. We demonstrate such alternative interconnection protocols that support loose coupling across administrative boundaries and that accommodate the necessary control mechanisms. Message-based gateways that support non-real-time invocation of services (e.g., file and print servers, financial transactions, VLSI design tools, etc.) are a promising basis for such loose couplings.",

Virtual routers can be used for both networking research and education. In contrast to simulation, virtual routers process packets in real-time and the virtual router code is similar to code in real routers. In the case of research, larger network test-beds can be built using a relatively small number of computers. New functionalities such as new queuing mechanisms are supported by a modular software architecture and can be tested in a rather safe environment compared to kernel space implementations. Virtual routers can also be used as a tool aiming to allow students to perform virtual experiments within a computer networks course. Students can create and experiment with arbitrary virtual IP network topologies. The web-based user interface allows students to interact remotely with the emulated routers, but simultaneously it is very similar to commonly available configuration interfaces of network devices in reality. This enables students to configure routers like in the real world but also to experiment in a much more robust and safe environment.",

This solution is also demonstrated in the context of a Networked Surface prototype, improving TCP performance for both bulk transfers and interactive traffic.The smart link layer solution is lightweight, requiring little processing and buffering only one packet per TCP connection. It is therefore easily retro-fitted to existing TCP-capable devices, without modifying the internal operation of those devices.",

The lengths of test sequences produced by the four methods tend to be different. The length of a test sequence produced by the T-method (W-method) is the smallest (largest).

Routers and Intrusion Detection Systems that operate at up to OC-768 speeds (40 Gigabits/second) are currently being developed. In this paper we address a basic function common to several security and measurement applications running at line speeds: counting the number of distinct header patterns (flows) seen on a high speed link in a specified time period. For example one can detect port scans by counting the number of connections opened by the suspected port scanner and one can ascertain that a denial of service attack is in progress by counting the number of distinct (fake) source addresses that send packets to the suspected victim. We provide algorithms solving the flow counting problem using extremely small amounts of memory. This can translate into savings of scarce fast memory (SRAM) for hardware implementations. It can also help systems that use cheaper DRAM to allow them to scale to larger instances of the problem. The reduction in memory is particularly important for network security applications such as detecting port scans and DoS attacks that need to run a separate instance of the algorithm for each suspected attacker or victim. Our algorithms can be implemented in hardware at wire speeds (8 nsec per packet for OC-768) using simple CRC based hash functions, multiplexers and SRAM. They access at most one or two memory locations per packet. We expose the behavior of simple building blocks and provide a family of customizable counting algorithms that can be adapted to the requirements of various applications. This allows our algorithms to use less memory than the best known counting algorithm, probabilistic counting, to provide the same accuracy.• Virtual bitmap is well suited for triggers (which need only be accurate around a threshold value) such as detecting DoS attacks, and uses 292 bytes to achieve an error of 2.619% compared to 5,200 bytes for probabilistic counting.• Our \"no assumptions\" counting algorithm, multiresolution bitmap algorithms uses only 2143 bytes to count up to 100 million flows with an average error of 3%. Its accuracy is slightly better when the number of flows is small, while the accuracy of probabilistic counting using the same memory is much worse.• Our adaptive bitmap that exploits stationarity in the number of flows can count the number of distinct flows on a link that contains anywhere from 0 to 100 million flows with an average error of less than 1 % using only 2 Kbytes of memory. Probabilistic counting needs eight times more memory to achieve the same accuracy.• We used our triggered bitmap to replace the port scan detection component of the popular intrusion detection system Snort. Doing so reduced the memory usage from 89 Mbytes to 6.4 Mbytes (with an average error of 13.5%) as measured on a 10 minute trace. Probabilistic counting uses 23 Mbytes.This work was made possible by a grant from NIST for the Sensilla Project.",

This paper discusses a Bell Communications Research facility, the Integrated Media Architecture Laboratory (IMAL), designed to flexibly emulate a wide range of current and future network and CPE environments with a focus on multiple media communications. IMAL combines off-the-shelf technologies to create an easily clonable emulation environment for studying, planning, demonstrating, and checking the feasibility of integrated media communications. The IMAL project has assembled workstations which feature speech-synthesis/sampled-audio/telephony capabilities, local 1 MIP computation capacity, and a high-resolution color display integrating text/graphics/image/video under an expanded X Window display management system. (X Windows is an emerging windowing standard to provide high performance device-independent graphics.) The workstations may be augmented as needed by local image digitizers, video cameras, and color image printers producing paper and viewgraph hardcopies. Also, the workstations are interconnected with switches permitting access to one another as well as shared databases, temporary storage, intelligence, and information processing/conversion resources. Communications services are implemented under a distributed, real-time service primitive control scheme. This multiple-media service primitives scheme employs a threaded/dataflow-type architecture to support user-defined, network-defined, and vendor-defined services while including a wealth of flexible features for the study of network architecture, protocol, network management, and billing functions.",

    "abstract": "CSNET is built on the Department of Defense network (ARPANET), public packet-switched physical networks (Telenet), and a telephone-based relay network (Phonenet). Some CSNET sites have direct connections to ARPANET, some have direct connections to Telenet, and some have connections only to telephone-based relay machines. The chief objective of CSNET is to provide a network interconnection for all groups engaged in Computer Science Research. CSNET has adopted TCP/IP as its standard transport level protocols. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) [POST81] is an end-to-end protocol. It establishes communications between two processes that are running on different machines, detects and corrects errors, controls data flow, and provides reliable communications. Application programs call TCP to transfer data across the network. TCP, in turn, uses the Internet Protocol (IP) [POST81] to send data to the appropriate network. CSNET communications such as file transfer, remote login, and process-to-process communication over the network assume that a TCP interface is available at CSNET sites. Since ARPANET sites are required to support the TCP/IP protocols, CSNET sites connected directly to the ARPANET automatically have access to TCP/IP. Phonenet relays connect directly to the ARPANET; they too have access to TCP to relay mail onto the ARPANET. Telenet does not use the TCP/IP protocols. Consequently, CSNET sites that are connected only to Telenet need additional software before they can communicate on CSNET. That software is described in this paper -- it provides an interface between the public packet - switched protocol X.25 [CCITT78] and TCP/IP. Although the design outlined here is applicable to any vendor's system, our implemention is for a Digital Equipment Corporation VAX running the Western Electric UNIX [UNIX78] operating system as modified by the University of California at Berkeley. This report focuses on the technical issues involved in building software to interface TCP/IP and X.25. The tariff structure for public networks is discussed only to the extent that it influences our design. Other issues such as access control, and protocol selection are beyond the scope of this report.",

This is due to the majority of packets being less than or equal to 100 bytes in addition to network routers not being able to scale well with the increased number of packets. In this paper we present our solution, JumboGen, an approach that will allow for a higher utilization of larger packet sizes on a domain-wise basis. Through simulations and experimentation, we show that the dynamic creation of jumbo packets decreases the number of packets processed by core routers and does not have an adverse impact on link utilization or fairness. The final result of JumboGen is a reduction in the number of packets seen by core routers which directly improves network scalability.",

    "abstract": "It has been recently suggested that uncongested links could be completely ignored when evaluating Internet's performance. In particular, based on the observation that only the congested links along the path of each flow introduce sizable queueing delays and dependencies among flows, it has been shown that one can infer the performance of the larger Internet by creating and observing a suitably scaled-down replica, consisting of the congested links only. Given that the majority of Internet links are uncongested, it has been demonstrated that this approach can be used to greatly simplify and expedite performance prediction. However, an important open problem, directly related to the practicability of such an approach, is whether there exist efficient and scalable ways for identifying uncongested links, in large and complex Internet-like networks. Of course, such a question is not only very important for scaling down Internet's topology, but also in many other contexts, e.g. such as in traffic engineering and capacity planning. In this paper we present simple rules that can be used to efficiently identify uncongested Internet links. In particular, we first identify scenarios under which one can easily deduce whether a link is uncongested by inspecting the network topology. Then, we identify scenarios in which this is not possible, and propose an efficient methodology, based on the large deviations theory and flow-level statistics, to approximate the queue length distribution,and in turn, to deduce the congestion level of a link. We also demonstrate how simple commonly used metrics, such as the link utilization, can be quite misleading in classifying an Internet link.",

    "abstract": "With steady improvement in the reliability and performance of communication devices, routing instabilities now contribute to many of the remaining service degradations and interruptions in modern networks. This has led to a renewed interest in centralized routing systems that, compared to distributed routing, can provide greater control over routing decisions and better visibility of the results. One benefit of centralized control is the opportunity to readily eliminate transient routing loops, which arise frequently after network changes because of inconsistent routing states across devices. Translating this conceptual simplicity into a solution with tolerable message complexity is non-trivial. Addressing this issue is the focus of this paper. We identify when and why avoiding transient loops might require a significant number of messages in a centralized routing system, and demonstrate that this is the case under many common failure scenarios. We also establish that minimizing the number of required messages is NP-hard, and propose a greedy heuristic that we show to perform well under many conditions. The paper's results can facilitate the deployment and evaluation of centralized architectures by leveraging their strengths without incurring unacceptable overhead.",

We first show that the dynamics of a node, in a coordinate system without abnormal or malicious behavior, can be modeled by a Linear State Space model and tracked by a Kalman filter. Then we show, that the obtained model can be generalized in the sense that the parameters of a filtercalibrated at a node can be used effectively to model and predict the dynamic behavior at another node, as long as the two nodes are not too far apart in the network. This leads to the proposal of a Surveyor infrastructure: Surveyor nodes are trusted, honest nodes that use each other exclusively to position themselves in the coordinate space, and are therefore immune to malicious behavior in the system.During their own coordinate embedding, other nodes can thenuse the filter parameters of a nearby Surveyor as a representation of normal, clean system behavior to detect and filter out abnormal or malicious activity. A combination of simulations and PlanetLab experiments are used to demonstrate the validity, generality, and effectiveness of the proposed approach for two representative coordinate embedding systems, namely Vivaldi and NPS.",

At the symbol level such wireless errors have a well-defined structure: when a receiver decodes a symbol erroneously, it is more likely that the decoded symbol is a good \"approximation\" of the transmitted symbol than a randomly chosen symbol among all possible transmitted symbols. Based on this property, we define approximate communication, a method that exploits this error structure to natively provide unequal error protection to data bits. Unlike traditional (FEC-based) mechanisms of unequal error protection that consumes additional network and spectrum resources to encode redundant data, the approximate communication technique achieves this property at the PHY layer without consuming any additional network or spectrum resources (apart from a minimal signaling overhead). Approximate communication is particularly useful to media delivery applications that can benefit significantly from unequal error protection of data bits. We show the usefulness of this method to such applications by designing and implementing an end-to-end media delivery system, called Apex. Our Software Defined Radio (SDR)-based experiments reveal that Apex can improve video quality by 5 to 20 dB (PSNR) across a diverse set of wireless conditions, when compared to traditional approaches. We believe that mechanisms such as Apex can be a cornerstone in designing future wireless media delivery systems under any error-prone channel condition.",

    "abstract": "Although the Internet is widely used today, we have little information about the edge of the network. Decentralized management, firewalls, and sensitivity to probing prevent easy answers and make measurement difficult. Building on frequent ICMP probing of 1% of the Internet address space, we develop clustering and analysis methods to estimate how Internet addresses are used. We show that adjacent addresses often have similar characteristics and are used for similar purposes (61% of addresses we probe are consistent blocks of 64 neighbours or more). We then apply this block-level clustering to provide data to explore several open questions in how networks are managed. First, we provide information about how effectively network address blocks appear to be used, finding that a significant number of blocks are only lightly used (most addresses in about one-fifth of 24 blocks are in use less than 10% of the time), an important issue as the IPv4 address space nears full allocation. Second, we provide new measurements about dynamically managed address space, showing nearly 40% of 24 blocks appear to be dynamically allocated, and dynamic addressing is most widely used in countries more recent to the Internet (more than 80% in China, while less than 30% in the U.S.). Third, we distinguish blocks with low-bitrate last-hops and show that such blocks are often underutilized.",

Instead, we capitalize on recent innovations in edge-link migration that enable seamless rehoming of an edge link to a different internal router in an ISP backbone network---completely transparent to the router in the neighboring domain. We present an optimization framework for traffic engineering with migration and develop algorithms that determine which edge links should migrate, where they should go, and how often they should move. Our experiments with Internet2 traffic and topology data show that edge-link migration allows the network to carry 18.8% more traffic (at the same level of performance) over optimizing routing alone.",

In Phase-1 of our \\emph{SpeedPerception} study using Internet Retailer Top 500 (IR 500) websites, we found that commonly used navigation metrics such as \\emph{onLoad} and \\emph{Time To First Byte (TTFB)} fail (less than 60\\% match) to represent majority human perception when comparing the speed of two webpages. We present a simple 3-variable-based machine learning model that explains the majority end-user choices better (with $87 \\pm 2\\%$ accuracy). In addition, our results suggest that the time needed by end-users to evaluate relative perceived speed of webpage is far less than the time of its \\emph{visualComplete} event.",

Unfortunately, however, research on CPB has only focused on increasing the number of predicted attacks but has not considered the impact on false positives and false negatives. Moreover, sharing alerts is often hindered by confidentiality, trust, and liability issues, which motivates the need for privacy-preserving approaches to the problem. In this paper, we present a measurement study of state-of-the-art CPB techniques, aiming to shed light on the actual impact of collaboration. To this end, we reproduce and measure two systems: a non privacy-friendly one that uses a trusted coordinating party with access to all alerts [12] and a peer-to-peer one using privacy-preserving data sharing [8]. We show that, while collaboration boosts the number of predicted attacks, it also yields high false positives, ultimately leading to poor accuracy. This motivates us to present a hybrid approach, using a semi-trusted central entity, aiming to increase utility from collaboration while, at the same time, limiting information disclosure and false positives. This leads to a better trade-off of true and false positive rates, while at the same time addressing privacy concerns.",

    "abstract": "In the modern era of the mobile apps (part of the era of surveillance capitalism , a famously coined term by Shoshana Zuboff), huge quantities of data about individuals and their activities offer a wave of opportunities for economic and societal value creation. However, the current personal data ecosystem is mostly de-regulated, fragmented, and inefficient. On one hand, end-users are often not able to control access (either technologically, by policy, or psychologically) to their personal data which results in issues related to privacy, personal data ownership, transparency, and value distribution. On the other hand, this puts the burden of managing and protecting user data on profit-driven apps and ad-driven entities (e.g., an ad-network) at a cost of trust and regulatory accountability. Data holders (e.g., apps) may hence take commercial advantage of the individuals' inability to fully anticipate the potential uses of their private information, with detrimental effects for social welfare. As steps to improve social welfare, we comment on the the existence and design of efficient consumer-data releasing ecosystems aimed at achieving a maximum social welfare state amongst competing data holders. In view of (a) the behavioral assumption that humans are 'compromising' beings, (b) privacy not being a well-boundaried good, and (c) the practical inevitability of inappropriate data leakage by data holders upstream in the supply-chain, we showcase the idea of a regulated and radical privacy trading mechanism that preserves the heterogeneous privacy preservation constraints (at an aggregate consumer, i.e., app, level) upto certain compromise levels, and at the same time satisfying commercial requirements of agencies (e.g., advertising organizations) that collect and trade client data for the purpose of behavioral advertising. More specifically, our idea merges supply function economics , introduced by Klemperer and Meyer, with differential privacy, that, together with their powerful theoretical properties, leads to a stable and efficient, i.e., a maximum social welfare, state, and that too in an algorithmically scalable manner. As part of future research, we also discuss interesting additional techno-economic challenges related to realizing effective privacy trading ecosystems.",

Cloud-based TRE needs to apply a judicious use of cloud resources so that the bandwidth cost reduction combined with the additional cost of TRE computation and storage would be optimized. PACK's main advantage is its capability of offloading the cloud-server TRE effort to end-clients, thus minimizing the processing costs induced by the TRE algorithm. Unlike previous solutions, PACK does not require the server to continuously maintain clients' status. This makes PACK very suitable for pervasive computation environments that combine client mobility and server migration to maintain cloud elasticity. PACK is based on a novel TRE technique, which allows the client to use newly received chunks to identify previously received chunk chains, which in turn can be used as reliable predictors to future transmitted chunks. We present a fully functional PACK implementation, transparent to all TCP-based applications and network devices. Finally, we analyze PACK benefits for cloud users, using traffic traces from various sources.",

Also, companies take measures to prevent crawls of their OSNs and refrain from sharing their data with the research community.

In this work, we take an experimental approach to study the characteristics of well-known sampling techniques on a full social graph of Twitter crawled in 2012 [2].

    "abstract": "The Internet use IP addresses to identify and locate network interfaces of connected devices. IPv4 was introduced more than 40 years ago and specifies 32-bit addresses. As the Internet grew, available IPv4 addresses eventually became exhausted more than ten years ago. The IETF designed IPv6 with a much larger addressing space consisting of 128-bit addresses, pushing back the exhaustion problem much further in the future. In this paper, we argue that this large addressing space allows reconsidering how IP addresses are used and enables improving, simplifying and scaling the Internet. By revisiting the IPv6 addressing paradigm, we demonstrate that it opens up several research opportunities that can be investigated today. Hosts can benefit from several IPv6 addresses to improve their privacy, defeat network scanning, improve the use of several mobile access network and their mobility as well as to increase the performance of multicore servers. Network operators can solve the multihoming problem more efficiently and without putting a burden on the BGP RIB, implement Function Chaining with Segment Routing, differentiate routing inside and outside a domain given particular network metrics and offer more fine-grained multicast services.",

    "abstract": "Applications communicating over connectionless networks, such as IP, cannot obtain per-connection Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. In contrast, the connection-oriented nature of the ATM layer and its per-virtual-circuit QoS guarantees are visible to a native-mode ATM application. We describe the design and implementation of operating system and signaling support for native-mode applications, independent of the semantics of the protocol layers or of the signaling protocol. The work was done in the context of a Unix-like operating system and the Xunet 2 wide-area high-speed ATM network. The IPC-based interface between an application and the signaling entity allows processes to request parameterized virtual circuits, and the signaling-kernel interface allows resources to be reclaimed from prematurely terminating processes. We also built a simple encapsulation layer over raw IP that allows any host with IP access to send AAL frames into the wide-area network with little performance degradation. Our design makes it simple to port existing TCP/IP socket applications to a native-mode ATM protocol stack and also enables interoperation of existing IP networks with our ATM network. Our experience has been positive - the design is robust, easily extendible and scales well with the number of open connections.",

Switches need internal buffering, because of output contention; shared buffering is known to perform better than multiple input queues or buffers, and the VLSI implementation of the former is not more expensive than the latter. We present a new organization for a shared buffer with its associated switching and cut-through functions. It is simpler and smaller than wide or interleaved organizations, and it is particularly suitable for VLSI technologies. It is based on multiple memory banks, addressed in a pipelined fashion. The first word of a packet is transferred to/from the first bank, followed by a \"wave\" of similar operations for the remaining words in the remaining banks. An FPGA-based prototype is operational, while standard-cell and full-custom chips are being submitted for fabrication. Simulation of the full-custom version indicates that, even in a conservative 1-micron CMOS technology, a 64 Kbit central buffer for an 8&amp;times;8 switch operates at 1 Gbps/link (worst case) and fits in 45 mm 2 including crossbar and cut-through.",

The results show that it is possible to obtain performance benefits by integrating marshalling, encryption and TCP checksum calculation. They also show that the benefits are smaller than in simple experiments, where ILP effects have not been evaluated in a complete protocol environment. Simulations of memory access and cache hit rate show that the main benefit of ILP is reduced memory accesses rather than an improved cache hit rate. The results further show that data manipulation characteristics may significantly influence the cache behavior and the achievable performance gain of ILP.",

In particular, networks and end-systems rely heavily upon the window mechanisms specified in current transport protocol standards such as TCP and TP4. These responsibilities will increase in future systems. This paper develops a connection model in order to assess the extent to which transport protocol data rates can be controlled using this available mechanism. Under very low delays, window-based flow control is not effective in slowing the rates at which a sender introduces data to the network or internetwork. Therefore, direct rate controls will be needed to enforce policies or to optimize performance across a variety of users and media.",

    "abstract": "Congestion is a longstanding problem in datagram networks. One congestion avoidance technique is feedback flow control, in which sources adjust their transmission rate in response to congestion signals sent (implicitly or explicitly) by network gateways. The goal is to design flow control algorithms which provide time-scale invariant, fair, stable, and robust performance. In this paper we introduce a simple model of feedback flow control, in which sources make synchronous rate adjustments based on the congestion signals and other local information, and apply it to a network of Poisson sources and exponential servers. We investigate two different styles of feedback, aggregate and individual, and two different gateway service disciplines, FIFO and Fair Share. The purpose of this paper is to identify, in the context of our simple model, which flow control design choices allow us to achieve our performance goals . Aggregate feedback flow control, in which congestion signals reflect only the aggregate congestion at the gateways, can provide time-scale invariant and stable performance, but not fair or robust performance. The properties of individual feedback flow control, in which the congestion signals reflect the congestion caused by the individual source, depend on the service discipline used in the gateways. Individual feedback with FIFO gateways can provide time-scale invariant, fair, and stable performance, but not robust performance. Individual feedback with Fair Share gateways can achieve all four performance goals. Furthermore, its stability properties are superior to those of the other two design choices. By making robust and more stable performance possible, gateway service disciplines play a crucial role in realizing effective flow control .",

It uses a timed-token access method and allows up to 500 stations to be connected with a total fiber length of 200 km. We analyze the performance of FDDI using a simple analytical model and a simulation model. The performance metrics of response time, efficiency, and maximum access delay are considered. The efficiency is defined as the ratio of maximum obtainable throughput to the nominal bandwidth of the network. The access delay is defined as the time it takes to receive a usable token. The performance of FDDI depends upon several workload parameters; for example; the arrival pattern, frame size, and configuration parameters, such as the number of stations on the ring, extent of the ring, and number of stations that are waiting to transmit. In addition, the performance is affected by a parameter called the Target Token Rotation Time (TTRT), which can be controlled by the network manager. We considered the effect of TTRT on various performance metrics for different ring configurations, and concluded that a TTRT value of 8 ms provides a good performance over a wide range of configurations and workloads.",

    "abstract": "Multimedia data has special requirements that are hard to be met on mobile hosts due to potentially low bandwidth and disruptions due to host mobility. Such limited communication capabilities of mobile hosts can be offset by the simultaneous use of multiple link layer technologies. MMTP is a member of a suite of protocols that share the novel characteristic of aggregating bandwidth from multiple link-layer channels. The use of multiple channels to transport user data provides five key benefits: (1) a fatter pipe,(2) a fast feedback path, (3) the retransmission of selected lost messages, without delaying the playout of the data stream, (4) less sensitivity to minor bandwidth fluctuations on any one individual channel, and (5) smooth vertical handoffs for active data streams.MMTP is a rate-based protocol designed for transferring multimedia data on mobile systems, and makes simultaneous use of every communication channel available to send data at the required rate. Transmission in MMTP is governed by two mechanisms. The first is a set of rate control protocols associated with each outgoing channel. The second is a scheduling algorithm that places incoming packets on the appropriate channel. MMTP is link-layer aware protocol that uses bandwidth estimation for congestion control, and relays to the application information needed for rate adaptation. In this paper, we show that the quality of data transmission can be improved through the use of MMTP through experimental comparisons with data transmitted via UDP. We also demonstrate the economy of bandwidth: MMTP only sends packets that it estimates will arrive within the packet deadline, thus decreasing the number of late packets that will be discarded at the receiver.",

The time out at the source Host is determined from current estimates - using exponentially weighted moving averages - of the mean and variance of successive acknowledgement delays. We show that when these delays are random variables forming certain stationary or non-stationary stochastic processes, the ensuing timeout gives a near-minimum retransmission delay, subject to some specified limit on the amount of unnecessary retransmission. This property is illustrated for a simulated sequence of acknowledgement delays obtained from loop delay measurements.",

    "abstract": "Today's networking community is becoming increasingly skeptical of the significance of research results founded wholly upon experimental results conducted in simulation. Now, with the availability of wide-area distributed testbeds such as PlanetLab, it is feasible to move beyond evaluation by simulation, and to perform wide-area experiments across the Internet as an alternate. However, while use of a distributed testbed affords much greater realism than a network simulation, there is a significant downside, as tight control over one's experiments is relinquished.We argue that providing services for distributed testbeds that capture aspects of the specifiable, repeatable behavior implicit in simulation and emulation will be an integral component of next-generation textbeds. As a case study, we consider the following problem: given a desired end-system topology consisting of a set of pairwise constraints (such as upper and lower bounds on bandwidth and delay), locate a representative subtopology within a wide-area testbed that satisfies those constraints. Previous work on Netbed addresses wide-area embedding problems of this form using an optimization framework, whereas we employ constraint satisfaction. We discuss the relative merits of these approaches, outline the theoretical foundations of a distributed service that provides a synergy between adaptive network measurements and the embedding process, and report on preliminary experimental results conducted on PlanetLab.",

    "abstract": "All-optical packet switching (AOPS) technology is essential to fully utilize the tremendous bandwidth provided by advanced optical communication techniques through forwarding packets in optical domain for the next generation network. However, long packet headers and other complex operations such as table lookup and packet header re-writing still have to be processed electronically for lack of cost-effective optical processing techniques. This not only increases system complexity but also limits packet forwarding speed due to optical-electronic-optical conversion. Lots of work of improving optical processing techniques to realize AOPS is reported in the literature. Differently, this paper proposes a new networking structure to facilitate AOPS realization and support various existing networks through simplifying networking operations. This structure only requires an AOPS node to process a short packet header to forward packets across it with neither table lookup nor header re-writing. Furthermore, it moves high layer addressing issues from packet forwarding mechanisms of routers. Consequently, any changes in addressing schemes such as address space extension do not require changes in the AOPS nodes. It can also support both connection-oriented and connectionless services to carry various types of traffic such as ATM and IP traffic. This structure is mainly based on the hierarchical source routing approach. The analytical results show that average packet header sizes are still acceptable even for long paths consisting of many nodes each of which has a large number of output ports.",

    "abstract": "Microblogging services, such as Twitter, are among the most important online social networks(OSNs). Different from OSNs such as Facebook, the topology of microblogging service is a directed graph instead of an undirected graph. Recently, due to the explosive increase of population size, graph sampling has started to play a critical role in measurement and characterization studies of such OSNs. However, previous studies have only focused on the unbiased sampling of undirected social graphs. In this paper, we study the unbiased sampling algorithm for directed social graphs. Based on the traditional Metropolis-Hasting Random Walk (MHRW) algorithm, we propose an unbiased sampling method for directed social graphs(USDSG). Using this method, we get the first, to the best of our knowledge, unbiased sample of directed social graphs. Through extensive experiments comparing with the \"ground truth\" (UNI, obtained through uniform sampling of directed graph nodes), we show that our method can achieve excellent performance in directed graph sampling and the error to UNI is less than 10%.",

    "abstract": "Data center networks encode locality and topology information into their server and switch addresses for performance and routing purposes. For this reason, the traditional address configuration protocols such as DHCP require huge amount of manual input, leaving them error-prone. In this paper, we present DAC, a generic and automatic Data center Address Configuration system. With an automatically generated blueprint which defines the connections of servers and switches labeled by logical IDs, e.g., IP addresses, DAC first learns the physical topology labeled by device IDs, e.g., MAC addresses. Then at the core of DAC is its device-to-logical ID mapping and malfunction detection. DAC makes an innovation in abstracting the device-to-logical ID mapping to the graph isomorphism problem, and solves it with low time-complexity by leveraging the attributes of data center network topologies. Its malfunction detection scheme detects errors such as device and link failures and miswirings, including the most difficult case where miswirings do not cause any node degree change. We have evaluated DAC via simulation, implementation and experiments. Our simulation results show that DAC can accurately find all the hardest-to-detect malfunctions and can autoconfigure a large data center with 3.8 million devices in 46 seconds. In our implementation, we successfully autoconfigure a small 64-server BCube network within 300 milliseconds and show that DAC is a viable solution for data center autoconfiguration.",

Specifically, cameras can tune to nearby LCDs and use them for network access. The key feature of these LCD-camera links is that they are highly directional and hence enable a form of interference-free wireless communication. This makes them an attractive technology for dense, high contention scenarios. The main challenge, however, to enable such LCD-camera links is to maximize coverage, that is to deliver multiple Mb/s over multi-meter distances, independent of the view angle. To do so, these links need to address unique types of channel distortions, such as perspective distortion and blur. In this demo, we show how these LCD-camera links can be used to wirelessly transmit information. We present PixNet, an LCD-camera communication system. PixNet generalizes the popular OFDM transmission algorithms to address the unique properties of the LCD-camera link, including perspective distortion and blur. We have built a prototype of PixNet using off-the-shelf LCDs and cameras. In our demo, we will show our prototype communicating data from an LCD to a camera-equipped PC, over multi-meter distances and wide viewing angles.",

Unfortunately, as highlighted recently, a large portion of research results are hardly, if not at all, reproducible, raising reasonable lack of conviction on the research carried out around the world. Recent years have shown an increasing awareness about reproducibility of results as an essential part of research carried out by members of the ACM SIGCOMM community. To address this important issue, ACM has introduced a new policy on results and artifacts review and badging. The policy defines the terminology to be used to assess results and artifacts but does not specify the review process or how to make research reproducible. During SIGCOMM'17 a side workshop has been organized with the specific purpose to tackle this issue. The objective being to trigger discussion and activity in order to craft recommendations on how to introduce incentives for authors to share their artifacts, and the details on how to use them, as well as defining the process to be used.

    "abstract": "Datacenter-networking research requires tools to both generate traffic and accurately measure latency and throughput. While hardware-based tools have long existed commercially, they are primarily used to validate ASICs and lack flexibility, e.g. to study new protocols. They are also too expensive for academics. The recent development of kernel-bypass networking and advanced NIC features such as hardware timestamping have created new opportunities for accurate latency measurements. This paper compares these two approaches, and in particular whether commodity servers and NICs, when properly configured, can measure the latency distributions as precisely as specialized hardware. Our work shows that well-designed commodity solutions can capture subtle differences in the tail latency of stateless UDP traffic. We use hardware devices as the ground truth, both to measure latency and to forward traffic. We compare the ground truth with observations that combine five latency-measuring clients and five different port forwarding solutions and configurations. State-of-the-art software such as MoonGen that uses NIC hardware timestamping provides sufficient visibility into tail latencies to study the effect of subtle operating system configuration changes. We also observe that the kernel-bypass-based TRex software, that only relies on the CPU to timestamp traffic, can also provide solid results when NIC timestamps are not available for a particular protocol or device.",

In the current Internet, the default assumption is that all behavior can be correlated using a variety of identifying information, not the least of which is a user's IP address. Tools like Tor, Privoxy, and even NATs, are located at the opposite end of the spectrum and prevent any behavior from being linked. Instead, our goal is to provide users with more control over linkability---which activites of the user can be correlated at the remote services---not necessarily more anonymity. We design a cross-layer architecture that provides users with a pseudonym abstraction. To the user, a pseudonym represents a set of activities that the user is fine with linking, and to the outside world, a pseudonym gives the illusion of a single machine. We provide this abstraction by associating each pseudonym with a unique, random address drawn from the IPv6 address space, which is large enough to provide each device with multiple globally-routable addresses. We have implemented and evaluated a prototype that is able to provide unlinkable pseudonyms within the Chrome web browser in order to demonstrate the feasibility, efficacy, and expressiveness of our approach.",

In particular, the IP lookup scheme can achieve O (1) time complexity. Our experimental results on real-world route traces show promising 6x gains in IP lookup throughput.",

    "abstract": "Dense 802.11 wireless networks present a pressing capacity challenge: users in proximity contend for limited unlicensed spectrum. Directional antennas promise increased capacity by improving the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiver, potentially allowing successful decoding of packets at higher bit-rates. Many uses of directional antennas to date have directed high gain between two peers, thus maximizing the strength of the sender's signal reaching the receiver. But in an interference-rich environment, as in dense 802.11 deployments, directional antennas only truly come into their own when they explicitly null interference from competing concurrent senders. In this paper, we present Cone of Silence (CoS), a technique that leverages software-steerable directional antennas to improve the capacity of indoor 802.11 wireless networks by adaptively nulling interference. Using in situ signal strength measurements that account for the complex propagation environment, CoS derives custom antenna radiation patterns that maximize the strength of the signal arriving at an access point from a sender while nulling inteference from one or more concurrent interferers. CoS leverages multiple antennas, but requires only a single commodity 802.11 radio, thus avoiding the significant processing requirements of decoding multiple concurrent packets. Experiments in an indoor 802.11 deployment demonstrate that CoS improves throughput under interference.",

    "abstract": "Distributed systems without a central authority, such as peer-to-peer (P2P) systems, employ incentives to encourage nodes to follow the prescribed protocol. Game theoretic analysis is often used to evaluate incentives in such systems. However, most game-theoretic analyses of distributed systems do not adequately model the repeated interactions of nodes inherent in such systems. We present a game-theoretic analysis of a popular P2P protocol, Bit-Torrent, that models the repeated interactions in such protocols. We also note that an analytical approach for modeling incentives is often infeasible given the complicated nature of most deployed protocols. In order to comprehensively model incentives in complex protocols, we propose a simulation-based method, which we call Design Space Analysis (DSA). DSA provides a tractable analysis of competing protocol variants within a detailed design space. We apply DSA to P2P file swarming systems. With extensive simulations we analyze a wide-range of protocol variants and gain insights into their robustness and performance. To validate these results and to demonstrate the efficacy of DSA, we modify an instrumented BitTorrent client and evaluate protocols discovered using DSA. We show that they yield higher system performance and robustness relative to the reference implementation.",

The controller allows users to specify policies about how different people, devices, and applications should consume the usage cap; it implements and enforces these policies via a secure OpenFlow control channel to each gateway device. The demonstration will show various use cases, such as limiting the usage of a particular application, visualizing usage statistics, and allowing users within a single household to \"trade\" caps with one another.",

First, WiFire detects and analyzes packets during their transmission, checking their content against a set of rules. It then relies on reactive jamming techniques to selectively block undesired communication. We show the feasibility and performance of WiFire, which is implemented on the USRP2 software-defined radio platform, in several scenarios with IEEE 802.15.4 radios.

    "abstract": "Existing secure interdomain routing protocols can verify validity properties about individual routes, such as whether they correspond to a real network path. It is often useful to verify more complex properties relating to the route decision procedure - for example, whether the chosen route was the best one available, or whether it was consistent with the network's peering agreements. However, this is difficult to do without knowing a network's routing policy and full routing state, which are not normally disclosed. In this paper, we show how a network can allow its peers to verify a number of nontrivial properties of its interdomain routing decisions without revealing any additional information. If all the properties hold, the peers learn nothing beyond what the interdomain routing protocol already reveals; if a property does not hold, at least one peer can detect this and prove the violation. We present SPIDeR, a practical system that applies this approach to the Border Gateway Protocol, and we report results from an experimental evaluation to demonstrate that SPIDeR has a reasonable overhead.",

    "abstract": "The number of publicly accessible virtual execution environments (VEEs) has been growing steadily in the past few years. To be accessible by clients, such VEEs need either a public IPv4 or a public IPv6 address. However, the pool of available public IPv4 addresses is nearly depleted and the low rate of adoption of IPv6 precludes its use. Therefore, what is needed is a way to share precious IPv4 public addresses among a large pool of VEEs. Our insight is that if an IP address is assigned at the time of a client DNS request for the VEE's name, it is possible to share a single public IP address amongst a set of VEEs whose workloads are not network intensive, such as those hosting personal servers or performing data analytics. We investigate several approaches to multiplexing a pool of global IP addresses among a large number of VEEs, and design a system that overcomes the limitations of current approaches. We perform a qualitative and quantitative comparison of these solutions. We find that upon receiving a DNS request from a client, our solution has a latency as low as 1 ms to allocate a public IP address to a VEE, while keeping the size of the required IP address pool close to the minimum possible.",

These groups are forming explicit measurement federations using perfSONAR to address a wide range of issues. In addition, the emergence and wide-adoption of new paradigms such as software-defined networking are taking shape to aid in traffic management needs of scientific communities and network operators. Consequently, there are new challenges that need to be addressed for extensible and programmable instrumentation, measurement data analysis, visualization and middleware security features in perfSONAR.

We evaluate the potential to leverage passive network traffic measurements in addition to or instead of active probing. Passive traffic measurements introduce no network traffic overhead, do not rely on unfiltered responses to probing, and could potentially apply to IPv6 as well. We investigate two challenges in using passive traffic for address utilization inference: the limited visibility of a single observation point; and the presence of spoofed IP addresses in packets that can distort results by implying faked addresses are active. We propose a methodology for removing such spoofed traf- fic on both darknets and live networks, which yields results comparable to inferences made from active probing.

    "abstract": "Today's enterprises are accepting networked systems as a fundamental part of their information technology strategy. The constant growth in quantity and quality of networked systems and the thereby arising problems concerning complexity, heterogeneity and diversity of components in a multi-vendor environment require a sophisticated management of resources. Increasingly the automation of such management is being demanded.In this paper we introduce an architecture for the integrated management of all resources in a networked system, i.e. application, system and network resources. The architecture uses domains as flexible and pragmatic means of grouping resources and of specifying management responsibility and authority boundaries. It maintains a clear distinction between management objectives and the resources being managed in order to provide an integrated view of the various tasks of management as well as an integrated and uniform view of the distributed and heterogeneous managed environment. The uniform management model on which the architecture is based is expressive enough to capture the full richness of management structures and policies both within enterprises and between them. It allows for recursive and generic structuring, we consider as the basis for management activity automation.As an example, we apply our architectural concepts to structure the management of a high speed multi-network (ATM, DQDB, FDDI). Emphasis lies on an automated Quality of Service management in the FDDI management domain.",

    "abstract": "Masquerading and eavesdropping are major threats to the security of wireless communications. To provide proper protection for the communication of the wireless link, contents of the communication should be enciphered and mutual authentication should be conducted between the subscriber and the serving network. Several protocols have been proposed by standards bodies and independent researchers in recent years to counteract these threats. However, the strength of these protocols is usually weakened in the roaming environment where the security breach of a visited network could lead to persistent damages to subscribers who visit. The subscriber's identity is not well protected in most protocols, and appropriate mechanisms solving disputes on roaming bills are not supported either. To solve these problems, new authentication protocols are proposed in this paper with new security features that have not been fully explored before.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses two issues related to resource reservation establishment in packet switched networks offering real-time services. The first issue arises out of the natural tension between the local nature of reservations (i.e., they control the service provided on a particular link) and the end-to-end nature of application service requirements. How do reservation establishment protocols enable applications to receive their desired end-to-end service? We review the current one-pass and two-pass approaches, and then propose a new hybrid approach called one-pass-with-advertising. The second issue in reservation establishment we consider arises from the inevitable heterogeneity in network router capabilities. Some routers and subnets in the Internet will support real-time services and others, such as ethernets, will not. How can a reservation establishment mechanism enable applications to achieve the end-to-end service they desire in the face of this heterogeneity? We propose an approach involving replacement services and advertising to build end-to-end service out of heterogeneous per-link service offerings.",

A simulation of the OSPF Election Protocol shows three results: (1) The Designated Router (DR) can be elected in constant time. (2) If a router has a limited number of input buffers, a competition for buffers between the Election and the Flooding Protocols increases the election time and causes an oscillatory behavior.At each router, the Router-ID of the DR continuously changes causing instability. (3) In the worst case, when the DR and the BDR fail at the same time, the DR-agreement-time is bounded above by twice the HelloInterval. A simulation of the OSPF Flooding Protocol, using 20, 50 and 80 router point-to-point networks, shows three results: (1) For the 50 router network, as link speed exceeds 4000 Kbps, the probability of overflowing the input buffers increases causing retransmissions. The increase in bootup-convergence-time from retransmissions is bounded by two and three times the RxmtInterval for link speeds of 4000 to 6000 Kbps and above 50 Mbps respectively. The increase in the bootup-convergence-time is due to large number of unacknowledged flooding packets received within RxmtInterval. (2) For 20 and 50 router networks, the input buffer size has little impact on the bootup-convergence-time. For the 80 router network, a small change in the input buffer size drastically changes the bootup-convergence-time. (3) Reducing the value of the RxmtInterval lowers the bootup-convergence-time at high link speeds.",

Adding real-time service and point-to-multipoint multicast routing to the Internet's traditional point-to-point best effort service model will greatly increase the Internet's efficiency in handling point-to-multipoint real-time applications. Recently, the RSVP resource reservation protocol has introduced the concept of “reservation styles”, which control how reservations are aggregated in multipoint-to-multipoint real-time applications. In this paper, which is an extension of [9], we analytically evaluate the efficiency gains offered by this new paradigm on three simple network topologies: linear, m-tree, and star. We compare the resource utilization of more traditional reservation approaches to the RSVP reservation styles in the asymptotic limit of large multipoint applications. We find that in several cases the efficiency improvements scale linearly in the number of hosts.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a \"zero-scan\" mechanism that reduces Internet checksumming overhead from a per-byte scan (or copy) cost, to a small and constant per-message cost. Unlike previous techniques, this mechanism requires no message buffering within the source. This will allow Internet transport protocols to achieve transfer latencies comparable to specialized protocols implemented directly on high-speed LAN (link-layer) services. In addition, this mechanism is transparent to systems outside of the source LAN. Hence, this mechanism affords applications the portability of Internet protocols without sacrificing the high performance of specialized LAN transport protocols.The proposed zero-scan checksumming scheme eliminates the last requirement for an additional data copy/scan, beyond the scan required to transmit or receive from the network channel. If this checksumming mechanism is combined with zero-copy operating system mechanisms that provide low-overhead transfer across application and kernel boundaries, a network interface architecture that provides separate message buffering is no longer required. A consequence is that the network interface may be reduced, essentially, to DMA engines plus link- and physical-layer logic. Taken one step further, the network interface could be integrated with the CPU to create an \"internet microprocessor\". These alternative interface designs are discussed, along with their requirements and effects upon operating system and computer system architectures.",

Hence, context-agile encryption provides enhanced solutions to the secrecy, interoperability, and quality of service issues in high-speed networks. Moreover, having a single context-agile encryptor at an ATM aggregation point (such as a firewall) reduces hardware and administrative costs.

A Leave-in-Time session's guarantees are completely determined by the dynamic traffic behavior of that session, without influence from other sessions. This results in the desirable property that these guarantees are expressed as functions derivable simply from a single fixed-rate server (with rate equal to the session's reserved rate) serving only that session. Leave-in-Time has a non-work-conserving mode of operation for sessions desiring low end-to-end delay jitter. Finally, Leave-in-Time supports the notion of delay shifting , whereby the delay bounds of some sessions may be decreased at the expense of increasing those of other sessions.

In this study, we also considered overheads due to non-data touching operations, such as network buffer manipulation, protocol-specific processing, operating system functions, data structure manipulations (other than network buffers), and error checking. We show that when one considers realistic message size distributions, where the majority of messages are small, the cumulative time consumed by the non-data touching overheads represents the majority of processing time. We assert that it will be difficult to significantly reduce the cumulative processing time due to non-data touching overheads.",

We believe that a hierarchical architecture of whole file caches, modeled after the existing name server's caching architecture, could become a valuable part of any internet.We derived these conclusions by performing trace driven simulations of various file caching architectures, cache sizes, and replacement policies. We collected the traces of file transfer traffic employed in our simulations on a network that connects the NSFNET backbone to a large, regional network. This particular regional network is responsible for about 5 to 7% of NSFNET traffic.While this paper's analysis and discussion focus on caching for FTP file transfer, the proposed caching architecture applies to caching objects from other internetwork services.",

The recently proposed hose model for VPNs allows for greater flexibility since it permits traffic to and from a hose endpoint to be arbitrarily distributed to other endpoints. In this paper, we develop novel algorithms for provisioning VPNs in the hose model. We connect VPN endpoints using a tree structure and our algorithms attempt to optimize the total bandwidth reserved on edges of the VPN tree. We show that even for the simple scenario in which network links are assumed to have infinite capacity, the general problem of computing the optimal VPN tree is NP hard. Fortunately, for the special case when the ingress and egress bandwidths for each VPN endpoint are equal, we can devise an algorithm for computing the optimal tree whose time complexity is O ( mn ), where m and n are the number of links and nodes in the network, respectively. We present a novel integer programming formulation for the general VPN tree computation problem (that is, when ingress and egress bandwidths of VPN endpoints are arbitrary) and develop an algorithm that is based on the primal-dual method. Our experimental results with synthetic network graphs indicate that the VPN trees constructed by our proposed algorithms dramatically reduce bandwidth requirements (in many instances, by more than a factor of 2) compared to scenarios in which Steiner trees are employed to connect VPN endpoints.",

An estimate of the aggregate processing power required for Gbps throughput is developed. It is proposed that a cost effective and practical solution to the processing requirements could be based on a multi-processor system. The opportunities for parallel processing in a typical transport protocol are examined. Several alternate parallel processing approaches are examined and arguments are advanced for selecting a favored approach. A corresponding parallel processing architecture is described. Data structures used to preserve packet ordering and techniques for reducing contention in a multi-processing environment are discussed. An implementation methodology for conventional transport protocols (e.g. TP4) is outlined. Some suggestions are made for improving efficiency by making modifications to the protocol that do not compromise functionality. The performance achievable with this modified architecture is analyzed and some suggestions for further work are presented.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces Wave and Equation Based Rate Control (WEBRC), the first multiple rate multicast congestion control protocol to be equation based. The equation-based approach enforces fairness to TCP with the benefit that fluctuations in the flow rate are small in comparison to TCP.This paper also introduces the multicast round trip time (MRTT), a multicast analogue of the unicast round trip time (RTT). The MRTT is fundamental to the equation-based protocol that each receiver uses to adjust its reception rate. Each receiver independently measures its own MRTT without placing any added messaging burden on the receiver, the sender or the intermediate network elements. Benefits provided by the MRTT include those that the RTT provides to TCP, e.g., reduced reception rates in reaction to buffer filling and fair sharing of bottleneck links. In addition, the use of MRTT is shown to synchronize and equalize the reception rates of proximate receivers and to cause reception rates to increase as the density of receivers increases.Another innovation of WEBRC is the idea of transmitting data with waves: the transmission rate on a channel is periodic, with an exponentially decreasing form during an active period followed by a quiescent period. Benefits of using waves include insensitivity to large IGMP leave latency; a frequency of joins and leaves by each receiver that is small and independent of the receiver reception rate; the use of a small number of multicast channels; fine-grained control over the receiver reception rate; and minimal, at times nonexistent, losses due to buffer overflow.",

We extend the notion of \"TCP-Friendly\" packet marking, proposed recently by us [6], and apply it to improve the performance of traditional best-effort services. The TCP-aware use of deterministic packet marking at the network edge allows us to protect selected TCP packets from suffering loss. This significantly reduces the total number of timeouts and avoids the resulting service degradation. In particular, we protect TCP sessions with very small windows, disperse packet loss across a given window, and protect retransmitted packets from encountering loss. We show baseline results which illustrate that the performance gains are considerable (orders of magnitude) when compared to stateful packet dropping algorithms like FRED [15], and even when TCP SACK [18] implementations are employed. The scheme has been implemented in Linux 2.2.10, and all the results are based upon experimental data.",

    "abstract": "A real-time protocol is usually concerned with the transportation of a real-time data stream over a packet switched network. Among the major issues distinguishing real-time protocols from ordinary transport protocols is the problem of trading delay for loss. That is, if some loss of packets may be acceptable, and usually inevitable, the objective of the protocol is to minimize the delay of packets, subject to constraints on the acceptable loss. This is unlike usual transport protocols, which are designed to guarantee no loss at the expense of increased delays. This paper presents a model for the delay-loss tradeoffs in a family of real-time transport protocols. It is demonstrated that, under very general assumptions, an optimal real-time protocol is a bang-bang protocol: there exists a threshold queue length such that as long as the packet queue length at the sender is less than the threshold the protocol should be an ordinary positive acknowledgement with retransmissions transport protocol. However, as soon as the threshold queue length is exceeded, a newly arriving packet causes the first (or any other) packet in the queue to be discarded. Closed form expressions for the threshold buffer size are obtained and analyzed in terms of the given parameters of the system.",

    "abstract": "Petri net is a powerful model for analyzing communication protocols because they share many common properties. Currently, protocol analysis suffers the state explosion problem especially for error-recoverable protocols and multi-party protocols. Protocol synthesis relieves this problem by generating new and complicated protocols from simple subsets of the protocol models. Reduction analysis provides theoretical ground for correct synthesis or expansion. Thus, reduction is a very important research area. In this paper, we present a general Petri net reduction algorithm that reduces the number of states while preserving all desirable and undesirable properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first general Petri net reduction algorithm for protocol analysis. We first present and extend Dong's [DON 83] definition of WBMs to include more subnets as WBMs. To render the reductions automated, a new concept of simple well-behaved modules (SWBMs) is introduced. Recursively performing reductions of SWBMs, complicated WBMs can be reduced. A main program is written to implement this recursive procedure. The problem is then reduced to finding conditions for SWBMs. We do this by progressing from simpler SWBMs to more complicated ones, i.e., from single-arc ones to multi-arcs ones. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of this algorithm by applying it to the state exploration in protocol synthesis. Other applications such as error detection, performance evaluation, and software engineering will be discussed in future.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies observe that vertex degree in the autonomous systems (AS) graph exhibits a highly variable distribution [14, 21]. The most prominent explanatory model for this phenomenon is the Barabasi-Albert (B-A) model [5, 2]. A central feature of the B-A model is preferential connectivity --- meaning that the likelihood a new node in a growing graph will connect to an existing node is proportional to the existing node's degree. In this paper we ask whether a more general explanation than the B-A model, and absent the assumption of preferential connectivity, is consistent with empirical data. We are motivated by two observations: first, AS degree and AS size are highly correlated [10]; and second, highly variable AS size can arise simply through exponential growth. We construct a model incorporating exponential growth in the size of the Internet and in the number of ASes, and show that it yields a size distribution exhibiting a power-law tail. In such a model, if an AS's link formation is roughly proportional to its size, then AS out-degree will also show high variability. Moreover, our approach is more flexible than previous work, since the choice of which AS to connect to does not impact high variability, thus can be freely specified. We instantiate such a model with empirically derived estimates of historical growth rates and show that the resulting degree distribution is in good agreement with that of real AS graphs.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the design of a new Internet routing architecture (NIRA). In today's Internet, users can pick their own ISPs, but once the packets have entered the network, the users have no control over the overall routes their packets take. NIRA aims at providing end users the ability to choose the sequence of Internet service providers a packet traverses. User choice fosters competition, which imposes an economic discipline on the market, and fosters innovation and the introduction of new services.This paper explores various technical problems that would have to be solved to give users the ability to choose: how a user discovers routes and whether the dynamic conditions of the routes satisfy his requirements, how to efficiently represent routes, and how to properly compensate providers if a user chooses to use them. In particular, NIRA utilizes a hierarchical provider-rooted addressing scheme so that a common type of domain-level route can be efficiently represented by a pair of addresses. In NIRA, each user keeps track of the topology information on domains that provide transit service for him. A source retrieves the topology information of the destination on demand and combines this information with his own to discover end-to-end routes. This route discovery process ensures that each user does not need to know the complete topology of the Internet.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of satellite communication links offers the data communication designer increased throughput, but at the same time forces him to deal with greatly increased signal transmit time which may eliminate all potential throughput increases. Using a mathematical model, this paper compares batch throughput efficiency of two IBM line control methods, Binary Synchronous Communications (BSC) and Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC), along with some hypothetical extensions to SDLC. Although the model treats links of any description, the focus here is on links with long signal transit time and low bit error rate, such as satellite links. Classic analog terrestrial links are included for comparison. The model consists of an information source with an infinite supply of data transmitting to an information sink which transmsits no data but does acknowledge received frames as defined in the various protocols. Throughput efficiency is defined as the ratio of the time spent by the data source transmitting original information bytes (i.e., bytes in the SDLC or BSC Information Field, excluding those bytes retransmitted due to errors) to the time spent transmitting all bytes (i.e., information, control, and error recovery) plus time taken by any gaps in continuous transmission. The comparison applies to steady-state batch transmission, so the link is assumed to be point-to-point. Both full duplex and half duplex protocols are considered in SDLC, but only half duplex protocols are contained in BSC. A hypothetical extension to SDLC, Asynchronous Response Mode (ARM), and SDLC Normal Response Mode (NRM) are included in full duplex. The model shows no difference in throughput efficiency between half duplex NRM and ARM, so only one result is presented for half duplex SDLC. Both SDLC and BSC are data link control architectures; for details concerning a particular implementation, the reader should consult the product description. More detail on SDLC and BSC is available in References 1-4. Two transmission links are considered. The terrestrial analog link consists of traditional analog facilities, while the satellite link consists of only a satellite connection between the end points (i.e., the end points are very close to the satellite earth stations, such that negligible transit time and link errors are introduced in the terminal-to-earth station links). Each link is characterized by its bit error rate (BER) and round trip delay (RTD). Bit error rate is the long-term average of bit errors per bit transmitted, while round trip delay is defined as the amount of time between the last bit of a given SDLC frame or BSC block being transmitted and the first bit of its response being received at the source. RTD includes the time (in seconds) necessary to generate and transmit a line-control response at the receiving end, as well as any delay in equipment between the end points. Results are obtained using a simple bit-independent error model. The next section describes the applicable equations, while the following section discusses results.",

    "abstract": "The limitations of BGP routing in the Internet are often blamed for poor end-to-end performance and prolonged connectivity interruptions. Recent work advocates using overlays to effectively bypass BGP's path selection in order to improve performance and fault tolerance. In this paper, we explore the possibility that intelligent control of BGP routes, coupled with ISP multihoming, can provide competitive end-to-end performance and reliability. Using extensive measurements of paths between nodes in a large content distribution network, we compare the relative benefits of overlay routing and multihoming route control in terms of round-trip latency, TCP connection throughput, and path availability. We observe that the performance achieved by route control together with multihoming to three ISPs (3-multihoming), is within 5-15% of overlay routing employed in conjunction 3-multihoming, in terms of both end-to-end RTT and throughput. We also show that while multihoming cannot offer the nearly perfect resilience of overlays, it can eliminate almost all failures experienced by a singly-homed end-network. Our results demonstrate that, by leveraging the capability of multihoming route control, it is not necessary to circumvent BGP routing to extract good wide-area performance and availability from the existing routing system.",

    "abstract": "A truly scalable IP-lookup scheme must address five challenges of scalability, namely: routing-table size, lookup throughput, implementation cost, power dissipation, and routing-table update cost. Though several IP-lookup schemes have been proposed in the past, none of them do well in all the five scalability requirements. Previous schemes pipeline tries by mapping trie levels to pipeline stages. We make the fundamental observation that because this mapping is static and oblivious of the prefix distribution, the schemes do not scale well when worst-case prefix distributions are considered. This paper is the first to meet all the five requirements in the worst case. We propose scalable dynamic pipelining (SDP) which includes three key innovations: (1) We map trie nodes to pipeline stages based on the node height. Because the node height is directly determined by the prefix distribution, the node height succinctly provides sufficient information about the distribution. Our mapping enables us to prove a worst-case per-stage memory bound which is significantly tighter than those of previous schemes. (2) We exploit our mapping to propose a novel scheme for incremental route-updates. In our scheme a route-update requires exactly and only one write dispatched into the pipeline. This route-update cost is obviously the optimum and our scheme achieves the optimum in the worst case. (3) We achieve scalability in throughput by simultaneously pipelining at the data-structure level and the hardware level. SDP naturally scales in power and implementation cost. We not only present a theoretical analysis but also evaluate SDP and a number of previous schemes using detailed hardware simulation. Compared to previous schemes, we show that SDP is the only scheme that scales well in all the five requirements.",

    "abstract": "The phenomenon that rural residents and people with low incomes lag behind in Internet access is known as the \"digital divide.\" This problem is particularly acute in developing countries, where most of the world's population lives. Bridging this digital divide, especially by attempting to increase the accessibility of broadband connectivity, can be challenging. The improvement of wide-area connectivity is constrained by factors such as how quickly we can dig ditches to bury fibers in the ground; and the cost of furnishing \"last-mile\" wiring can be prohibitively high.In this paper, we explore the use of digital storage media transported by the postal system as a general digital communication mechanism. While some companies have used the postal system to deliver software and movies, none of them has turned the postal system into a truly generic digital communication medium supporting a wide variety of applications. We call such a generic system a Postmanet . Compared to traditional wide-area connectivity options, the Postmanet has several important advantages, including wide global reach, great bandwidth potential and low cost.Manually preparing mobile storage devices for shipment may appear deceptively simple, but with many applications, communicating parties and messages, manual management becomes infeasible, and systems support at several levels becomes necessary. We explore the simultaneous exploitation of the Internet and the Postmanet, so we can combine their latency and bandwidth advantages to enable sophisticated bandwidth-intensive applications.",

    "abstract": "While the Internet is hardly \"broken\", it has proved unable to integrate new ideas, new architectures, and provide paths for future integration of data, voice, rich media and higher reliability. The reason is that the basic concept of the Internet as an end-to-end packet delivery service has made its middle layer, networking services through TCP/IP, untouchable. If we wish to see any disruptive enhancements to security, routing flexibility and reliability, and robust quality of service guarantees in coming years, we will need to move towards an Internet in which networking environments offering differing strengths can coexist on a permanent basis. This view is gaining currency in the US, advocated by the FIND/GENI initiative [7, 6] and in Europe, where it forms the heart of the activities reviewed by ARCADIA. The ARCADIA activity, sponsored by COST [1] has been chartered to look at critical areas in which research on fundamentals in the Internet's architecture and protocols, supported by accurate experiment, can unlock some of the Internet impasses. This paper attempts to describes the insight gained and conclusions drawn from the first ARCADIA workshop on the Future of the Internet, organized around the main themes of Virtualization, Federation and Monitoring/Measurement",

    "abstract": "A major contribution to global warming has been the number of new workshops publishing proceedings with the prefix hot. In this article, I propose that we counter this trend in an attempt to remain carbon neutral with a set of 'anti-workshops' on cold topics. We suggest a number of heuristics for detecting when a topic has gone cold, and give some examples of the application of these heuristics. Of course, some cold topics warm up again, and so there is a risk of over dampening in our heuristic. Over a long period, dynamic equilibrium should be assured, but from time to time, our scheme may prejudice against surprising results in boring areas of communications research. Nevertheless, it may leave room for more surprising results in interesting areas of research, which cannot be a bad thing",

The technology for implementing this already exists, and is none other than the Information Centric Networks (ICN), developed for over a decade in the framework of Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiatives. Beyond named access to personal data, ICN's in-network storage capability can be used as a substrate for retrieving aggregated, anonymized data, or even for executing complex analytics within the network, with no personal data leaking outside. In this opinion article we discuss how ICNs combined with trusted execution environments and digital watermarking, can be combined to build a personal data overlay inter-network in which users will be able to control who gets access to their personal data, know where each copy of said data is, negotiate payments in exchange for data, and even claim ownership, and establish accountability for data leakages due to malfunctions or malice. Of course, coming up with concrete designs about how to achieve all the above will require a huge effort from a dedicated community willing to change how personal data are handled on the Internet. Our hope is that this opinion article can plant some initial seeds towards this direction.",

This paper presents the outcome of a large-scale end-to-end measurement campaign focusing on task-offloading scenarios, showing that moving the computation closer to the end-users, alone, may turn out not to be enough. Indeed, the complexity associated with modern networks, both at the access and in the core, the behavior of the protocols at different levels of the stack, as well as the orchestration platforms used in data-centers hide a set of pitfalls potentially reverting the benefits introduced by low propagation delays. In short, we highlight how ensuring good QoS to latency-sensitive applications is definitely a multi-dimensional problem, requiring to cope with a great deal of customization and cooperation to get the best from the underlying network.",

    "abstract": "Carrier sense is often used to regulate concurrency in wireless medium access control (MAC) protocols, balancing interference protection and spatial reuse. Carrier sense is known to be imperfect, and many improved techniques have been proposed. Is the search for a replacement justified? This paper presents a theoretical model for average case two-sender carrier sense based on radio propagation theory and Shannon capacity. Analysis using the model shows that carrier sense performance is surprisingly close to optimal for radios with adaptive bitrate. The model suggests that hidden and exposed terminals usually cause modest reductions in throughput rather than dramatic decreases. Finally, it is possible to choose a fixed sense threshold which performs well across a wide range of scenarios, in large part due to the role of the noise floor. Experimental results from an indoor 802.11 testbed support these claims.",

This year we first returned to the list of aspirations we surveyed at the 2014 workshop, and described the challenges of mapping them to actions and measurable progress. We then reviewed evolutionary shifts in traffic, topology, business, and regulatory models, and (our best understanding of) the economics of the ecosystem. These discussions inspired an extended thought experiment for the second day of the workshop: outlining a new telecommunications legislative framework, including proposing a set of goals and scope of such regulation, and minimal list of sections required to pursue and measure progress toward those goals. The format was a series of focused sessions, where presenters prepared 10-minute talks on relevant issues, followed by in-depth discussions. This report highlights the discussions and presents relevant open research questions identified by participants.

    "abstract": "Broadband characterization has recently attracted much attention from the research community and the general public. Given this interest and the important business and policy implications of residential Internet service characterization, recent years have brought a variety of approaches to profiling Internet services, ranging from Web-based platforms to dedicated infrastructure inside home networks. We have previously argued that network-intensive applications provide an almost ideal vantage point for broadband service characterization at sufficient scale, nearly continuously and from end users. While we have shown that the approach is indeed effective at characterization and can enable performance comparisons between service providers and geographic regions, a key unanswered question is how well the performance characteristics captured by these network-intensive applications can predict the overall user experience with other applications. In this paper, using BitTorrent as an example network-intensive application, we present initial results that demonstrate how to obtain estimates of bandwidth and latency of a network connection by leveraging passive monitoring and limited active measurements from network intensive applications. We then analyze user experienced web performance under a variety of network conditions and show how estimated metrics from this network intensive application can serve as good web performance predictors.",

    "abstract": "Many technical systems of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector enable, structure and/or constrain social interactions. Thereby, they influence or implement certain values, including human rights, and affect or raise conflicts among values. The ongoing developments toward an \"Internet of everything'' is likely to lead to further value conflicts. This trend illustrates that a better understanding of the relationships between social values and networks is urgently needed because it is largely unknown what values lie behind protocols, design principles, or technical and organizational options of the Internet. This paper focuses on the complex steps of realizing human rights in Internet architectures and protocols as well as in Internet-based products and services. Besides direct implementation of values in Internet protocols, there are several other options that can indirectly contribute to realizing human rights via political processes and market choices. Eventually, a better understanding of what values can be realized by networks in general, what technical measures may affect certain values, and where complementary institutional developments are needed may lead toward a methodology for considering technical and institutional systems together.",

    "abstract": "Content-Centric Networking (CCN) has recently emerged as a clean-slate Future Internet architecture which has a completely different communication pattern compared with exiting IP network. Since the World Wide Web has become one of the most popular and important applications on the Internet, how to effectively support the dominant browser and server based web applications is a key to the success of CCN. However, the existing web browsers and servers are mainly designed for the HTTP protocol over TCP/IP networks and cannot directly support CCN-based web applications. Existing research mainly focuses on plug-in or proxy/gateway approaches at client and server sides, and these schemes seriously impact the service performance due to multiple protocol conversions. To address above problems, we designed and implemented a CCN web browser and a CCN web server to natively support CCN protocol. To facilitate the smooth evolution from IP networks to CCN, CCNBrowser and CCNxTomcat also support the HTTP protocol besides the CCN. Experimental results show that CCNBrowser and CCNxTomcat outperform existing implementations. Finally, a real CCN-based web application is deployed on a CCN experimental testbed, which validates the applicability of CCNBrowser and CCNxTomcat.",

    "abstract": "The quickly growing demand for wireless networks and the numerous application-specific requirements stand in stark contrast to today's inflexible management and operation of WiFi networks. In this paper, we present and evaluate OpenSDWN, a novel WiFi architecture based on an SDN/NFV approach. OpenSDWN exploits datapath programmability to enable service differentiation and fine-grained transmission control, facilitating the prioritization of critical applications. OpenSDWN implements per-client virtual access points and per-client virtual middleboxes, to render network functions more flexible and support mobility and seamless migration. OpenSDWN can also be used to out-source the control over the home network to a participatory interface or to an Internet Service Provider.",

    "abstract": "The time-of-flight of a signal captures the time it takes to propagate from a transmitter to a receiver. Time-of-flight is perhaps the most intuitive method for localization using wireless signals. If one can accurately measure the time-of-flight from a transmitter, one can compute the transmitter's distance simply by multiplying the time-of-flight by the speed of light. Today, GPS, the most widely used outdoor localization system, localizes a device using the time-of-flight of radio signals from satellites. However, applying the same concept to indoor localization has proven difficult. Systems for localization in indoor spaces are expected to deliver high accuracy (e.g., a meter or less) using consumer-oriented technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi on one's cellphone). Unfortunately, past work could not measure time-of-flight at such an accuracy on Wi-Fi devices. As a result, over the years, research on accurate indoor positioning has moved towards more complex alternatives such as employing large multi-antenna arrays to compute the angle-of-arrival of the signal. These new techniques have delivered highly accurate indoor localization systems. Despite these advances, time-of-flight based localization has some of the basic desirable features that state-of-the-art indoor localization systems lack. In particular, measuring time-of-flight does not require more than a single antenna on the receiver. In fact, by measuring time-of-flight of a signal to just two antennas, a receiver can intersect the corresponding distances to locate its source. Thus, a receiver can locate a wireless transmitter with no support from the surrounding infrastructure. This is quite unlike current indoor localization systems, which require multiple access points at known locations, to find the distance between a pair of mobile devices. Furthermore, each of these access points need to have many antennas -- far beyond what is supported in commercial Wi-Fi devices. In this demo, we will present Chronos, a system that combines a set of novel algorithms to measure the time-of-flight to sub-nanosecond accuracy on commercial Wi-Fi cards. In particular, we will measure distance/time-of-flight between two devices equipped with commercial Wi-Fi cards, without any support from the infrastructure or environment fingerprinting.",

    "abstract": "HTTP-based video streaming services have been dominating the global IP traffic over the last few years. Caching of video content reduces the load on the content servers. In the case of Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH), for every video the server needs to host multiple representations of the same video file. These individual representations are further broken down into smaller segments. Hence, for each video the server needs to host thousands of segments out of which, the client downloads a subset of the segments. Also, depending on the network conditions, the adaptation scheme used at the client-end might request a different set of video segments (varying in bitrate) for the same video. The caching of DASH videos presents unique challenges. In order to optimize the cache hits and minimize the misses for DASH video streaming services we propose an Adaptation Aware Cache (AAC) framework to determine the segments that are to be prefetched and retained in the cache. In the current scheme, we use bandwidth estimates at the cache server and the knowledge of the rate adaptation scheme used by the client to estimate the next segment requests, thus improving the prefetching at the cache.",

In this work, we investigate the commonalities between such intra-host networks and classical computer networking.

    "abstract": "Throughput and latency critical applications could often benefit of performing computations close to the client. To enable this, distributed computing paradigms such as edge computing have recently emerged. However, with the advent of programmable data planes, computations cannot only be performed by servers but they can be offloaded to network switches. Languages like P4 enable to flexibly reprogram the entire packet processing pipeline. Though these devices promise high throughput and ultra-low response times, implementing application-layer tasks in the data plane programming language P4 is still challenging for an application developer who is not familiar with networking domain. In this paper, we first identify and examine obstacles and pain points one can experience when offloading server-based computations to the network. Then we present P4rrot, a code generator (in form of a library) which allows to overcome these limitations by providing a user-friendly API to describe computations to be offloaded. After discussing the design choices behind P4rrot, we introduce our proof-of-concept implementation for two P4 targets: Netronome SmartNIC and BMv2. To demonstrate the applicability of P4rrot, we investigate case studies in the context of publish-subscribe sensor data processing and real-time data streaming, supporting, in particular, MQTT-SN and MoldUDP packets.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this short document is to explain why recent developments in the Internet's infrastructure are problematic. As context, we note that the Internet was originally designed to provide a simple universal service - global end-to-end packet delivery - on which a wide variety of end-user applications could be built. The early Internet supported this packet-delivery service via an interconnected collection of commercial Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that we will refer to collectively as the \"public Internet.\" The Internet has fulfilled its packet-delivery mission far beyond all expectations and is now the dominant global communications infrastructure. By providing a level playing field on which new applications could be deployed, the Internet has enabled a degree of innovation that no one could have foreseen. To improve performance for some common applications, \"enhancements\" such as caching (as in content-delivery networks) have been gradually added to the Internet. The resulting performance improvements are so significant that such enhancements are now effectively necessary to meet current content delivery demands. Despite these tangible benefits, this document argues that the way these enhancements are currently deployed seriously undermines the sustainability of the public Internet and could lead to an Internet infrastructure that reaches fewer people and is largely concentrated among only a few large-scale providers. We wrote this document because we fear that these developments are now decidedly tipping the Internet's playing field towards those who can deploy these enhancements at massive scale, which in turn will limit the degree to which the future Internet can support unfettered innovation. This document begins by explaining our concerns but goes on to articulate how this unfortunate fate can be avoided. To provide more depth for those who seek it, we provide a separate addendum with further detail.",

In this paper we study (through simulation) the end-to-end delay distribution seen by individual sessions under simple first-come first-served (FCFS) multiplexing in a network model with two significant features: (1) all traffic is connection-oriented, (2) cross traffic along routes is representative of that seen by calls in a moderately sized wide area network (i.e., less than 100 switches). We compare these delay distributions with the worst case point-valued analytic delay bounds predicted by three different techniques for providing such bounds (two of which require a more sophisticated link-level scheduling policy). We also consider the per-hop delay distributions seen as a session progresses \"deeper\" into the network and determine the sensitivity of these delay distributions to the manner in which the interfering traffic is modeled. Finally, we use our delay distribution results to examine the tradeoff between the QOS requested by a call, the manner in which the QOS guarantee is provided, and the number of calls that are admitted at the requested QOS.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a significant extension of the CSMA network access protocol. The protocol is based on the facts that, at high data rates, networks can contain multiple messages simultaneously over their span, and that in a ring, nodes needs only to detect the presence of a message arriving from the immediate up stream neighbor. When an incoming signal is detected, the node truncates the message it is presently sending instead of aborting it. The system has been named Carrier Sensed Multiple Access Ring Network, CSMA/RN.Analytical studies using three performance factors, wait or access time, service time and response or end-to-end travel time are presented. The service time is basically a function of the network rate; it changes by a factor of 4 between no load and full load. Wait time, which is zero for no load, remains small for load factors up to 70% of full load. Response time, which adds travel time while on the network to wait and service time, is mainly a function of network length, especially for longer distance networks.Simulation results are shown for CSMA/RN where messages are removed at the destination. Destination removal on an average increases network load capacity by a factor of 2, i.e., a 1 Gbps network can handle a 2 Gbps load. A wide range of local and metropolitan area network parameters including variations in message size, network length and node count are studied. In all cases performance is excellent, and message fracture usually remains less than a factor of 4. Throughput, even at overload conditions, remains high for the protocol. The nominal network rate is 1 Gbps; however, performance remains good for data rates as low as 200 Mbps. Finally, a scaling factor based upon the ratio of message to network length demonstrates that the results of this paper, and hence, the CSMA/RN protocol, are applicable to wide area networks.",

The following paper presents an algorithm for queue estimation and measures its accuracy on transmission data taken from an ethernet environment. Results show the algorithm to be fairly accurate despite its simplifying assumption that the arrival process of the data packets is Poisson; for about 2/3 of the queues analyzed, the ratio of the root mean square difference between the real queue and the estimated queue to the average real queue is less than 1/2.",

Recently, a new class of random access protocols called 'tree algorithms' has emerged. Tree algorithms offer several performance advantages over other random access protocols (e.g. ALOHA and CSMA), namely higher capacity and inherently stable operation. However, only synchronous (slotted) tree algorithms have so far been defined. Any practical implementation of a synchronous protocol is complicated by the need for stations to perform the steps of the algorithm synchronously. Thus asynchronous (unslotted) protocols are of greater practical importance, especially for local networks. Here we show how to construct asynchronous versions of several well-known tree algorithms, and describe some of the performance limitations that result from asynchronous operation.",

We introduce a table-driven protocol (BEST) in which routers maintain routing information for all destinations, and an on-demand routing protocol (DST) in which routers maintain routing information for only those destinations to whom they need to forward data. Simulation experiments are used to compare these protocols with DSR, which has been shown to incur less control overhead that other on-demand routing protocols. The simulations show that DST requires far less control packets to achieve comparable or better average delays and percentage of packet delivered than DSR, and that BEST achieves comparable results to DSR while maintaining routing information for all destinations.",

    "abstract": "A new, fully-distributed protocol for integrated voice/data traffic in a local-area, random-access broadcast network is described. The protocol introduces a movable voice-data boundary to framed TDMA/CSMA and eliminates the requirement of system-wide synchronized clocks. The movable boundary is a major advantage in any system where fluctuations in voice and data loads are expected because assignment of idle capacity from one traffic class to the other increases the utilization of the channel. The protocol provides collision-free virtual circuits for voice and periods of non-persistent CSMA/CD for data traffic and call establishment, and can support multi-party calls as well as two-way conversations. The protocol allows variable-size voice packets that have very low overhead and variable-size data packets that may be much longer than voice packets. This is of significant practical advantage over previous work, which has required fixed-size voice and/or data packets, or voice packets with high overhead. A method of dynamically controlling the movable boundary to balance the voice and data traffic is also proposed.",

This technique is called state exploration; and it usually requires large execution time and storage. In this paper, we discuss a more efficient variation of this technique. In particular, we show that the task of generating all reachable states can be divided into two independent subtasks. In each subtask, only the states reachable by allowing maximal progress for one machine are generated. We prove that a given system cannot reach a nonprogress state iff none of the states generated in each subtask is a nonprogress state. Since the two subtasks are completely independent, and since in most cases the time and storage requirements for each subtask are less than those for the origianal task, maximal progress state exploration can save time or storage over conventional state exploration.",

We not only permit but encourage such relationships to be probabilistic, in the interest of efficiency. This model leads to a new formulation of co-operating processes, and thence to the notion of co-operating transactions: co-operating processes whose actions are made atomic for the sake of reliability. We believe that co-operating processes are valuable in a computer network, but essential in a decentralized computer [Jensen 82] where the conceptually singular but physically dispersed global operating system requires a transaction facility in the kernel [Jensen 80]. These ideas are illustrated by examples from our initial experience in applying the model to the Accent network operating system and other system software of the Spice personal computing network. This document is intended to be an overview of the synchronization effort in the Archons project, and future publications will elaborate on many of the individual points touched on here.",

    "abstract": "Connection Admission Control (CAC) is an important function in a computer network that supports Quality of Service (QoS). The function of CAC is to decide whether a new connection can be admitted on the network or a part of the network in such a way that the QoS of the new connection and the already established connections will remain within the requested limits. CAC must also ensure that network resources are used efficiently avoiding unnecessary rejections of candidate connections. Some CAC algorithms attempt to estimate or derive available resources in each hop between the source and the destination. Then they use parameters of the candidate flow and the knowledge about the available resources to make the admission decision. Very often such algorithms use measurements to find out availability of the resources. Hence the name of such algorithms, Measurement-Based CAC (MBCAC). Another class of CAC algorithms assumes that it is the end nodes and not the network that should perform the connection admission. These algorithms use probing packets to probe the path between the end nodes for the requested level of QoS. In this paper a heuristic-based per-hop CAC algorithm is introduced that adapts the average rate of connection admission in response to the measured system performance. In particular, the algorithm decreases the rate of the connection admission when the system is overloaded and increases it when the system is underutilized. The paper uses simulations to show that the algorithm is free from the shortcomings of the current MBCAC algorithms.",

It uses Sun Remote Procedure Call [Sun 88] and External Data Representation [Sun 87] specifications, which can be used on a variety of transport protocols. The original design goal for NFS was to support small clusters of machines on local area networks. Thus a datagram protocol (UDP) was chosen to simplify transport.Using a connection-less transport protocol meant that nothing explicitly needed to be done to handle server or network failures. However, the use of NFS has expanded to cover much larger and more complicated networks than was ever anticipated. This has caused some NFS users to experience the problems of congestion and flow controI that transport protocols have been designed to address. This paper discucsses some alternatives for NFS transport protocols. Other issues such as inter-domain authentication, are not discussed here.",

The increasing complexity of our communications systems requires us to examine existing techniques and make a realistic assessment of which techniques will be applicable to the complex systems of the future. We believe that validation techniques based on an exhaustive reachability analysis will not be effective. Sampling techniques, such as executing a random walk through the reachable state space, are effective in complex systems, since most protocol errors occur in many different states of the system. More than 10 years have elapsed since the first automated validation techniques were first applied to communications protocols [1,2]. In the meantime, considerable advances have been made in validation technology, but more significantly, the scale and nature of the validation problem have changed. The communications systems that we need to validate today are significantly more complex than those of ten years ago. Our methods must evolve in order to address the current challenge. This paper is concerned primarily with the nature of the validation process, and the results that we might reasonably expect to achieve when validating protocols in complex communications systems.",

    "abstract": "As the Internet grows in size, it becomes crucial to understand how the speeds of links in the network must improve in order to sustain the pressure of new end-nodes being added each day. Although the speeds of links in the core and at the edges improve roughly according to Moore's law, this improvement alone might not be enough. Indeed, the structure of the Internet graph and routing in the network might necessitate much faster improvements in the speeds of key links in the network. In this paper, using a combination of analysis and extensive simulations, we show that the worst congestion in the Internet AS-level graph in fact scales poorly with the network size (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1+ω(1)&lt;/sup&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; is the number of nodes), when shortest-path routing is used to route traffic between ASes. We also show, somewhat surprisingly, that policy-based routing &lt;i&gt;does not&lt;/i&gt; exacerbate the maximum congestion when compared to shortest-path routing. Our results show that it is crucial to identify ways to alleviate this congestion to avoid some links from being perpetually congested. To this end, we show that the congestion scaling properties of Internet-like graphs can be improved dramatically by introducing moderate amounts of redundancy in the graph in terms of parallel edges between pairs of adjacent nodes.",

    "abstract": "During the last year recommendation X.25 [1] of the CCITT specifying a packet mode interface between a DTE and a DCE has been the subject of study and discussion. X.25 defines a link access and a packet level protocol the latter of which is of interest here. According to X.25 a number of logical connections, called virtual calls, may share one physical link between DTE and DCE. The sharing is achieved by asynchronous time-division multiplexing of so-called logical channels. For each channel, call setup and clearing, data transfer, and flow control takes place by the exchange of packets. There are different types of packets for the different tasks mentioned. A scheme involving a number of states for logical channels is used in the protocol. In this paper we discuss two aspects of the packet level protocol which we feel are insufficiently or erroneously specified in X.25. First, the insufficient description of the DTE-to-DTE packet level protocol which X.25 implies. Second, some problems relating to the states and state transitions for logical channels as specified by X.25. These problems we consider to be the result of erroneous design, and repair is suggested.",

    "abstract": "Hot-potato routing is a mechanism employed when there are multiple (equally good) interdomain routes available for a given destination. In this scenario, the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) selects the interdomain route associated with the closest egress point based upon intradomain path costs. Consequently, intradomain routing changes can impact interdomain routing and cause abrupt swings of external routes, which we call hot-potato disruptions . Recent work has shown that hot-potato disruptions can have a substantial impact on large ISP backbones and thereby jeopardize the network robustness. As a result, there is a need for guidelines and tools to assist in the design of networks that minimize hot-potato disruptions. However, developing these tools is challenging due to the complex and subtle nature of the interactions between exterior and interior routing. In this paper, we address these challenges using an analytic model of hot-potato routing that incorporates metrics to evaluate network sensitivity to hot-potato disruptions. We then present a methodology for computing these metrics using measurements of real ISP networks. We demonstrate the utility of our model by analyzing the sensitivity of a large AS in a tier~1 ISP network.",

With layering as the only means for functional abstraction, and even this violated by middle-boxes, the diversity of current technologies can barely be expressed, let alone analyzed. As a first step to remedying this problem, we present an axiomatic formulation of fundamental forwarding mechanisms in communication networks. This formulation allows us to express precisely and abstractly the concepts of naming and addressing and to specify a consistent set of control patterns and operational primitives, from which a variety of communication services can be composed. Importantly, this framework can be used to (1) formally analyze network protocols based on structural properties, and also to (2) derive working prototype implementations of these protocols. The prototype is implemented as a universal forwarding engine , a general framework and runtime environment based on the Click router.",

This work is aimed primarily at peer-to-peer systems, in which the decision and effort to install a service falls to individuals rather than to a central planner. This problem is relevant for bootstrapping systems that rely on the network effect, wherein the benefits are not felt until deployment reaches a significant scale, and also for deploying asymmetric systems, wherein the set of contributors is different than the set of beneficiaries. Our solution is the lottery tree (lottree), a mechanism that probabilistically encourages both participation in the system and also solicitation of new participants. We define the lottree mechanism and normally state seven properties that encourage contribution, solicitation, and fair play. We then present the Pachira lottree scheme, which satisfies five of these seven properties, and we prove this to be a maximal satisfiable subset. Using simulation, we determine optimal parameters for the Pachira lottree scheme, and we determine how to configure a lottree system for achieving various deployment scales based on expected installation effort. We also present extensive sensitivity analyses, which bolster the generality of our conclusions.",

    "abstract": "Current network protocols must comply with rigid interfaces and rules of behavior to fit into well defined, vertical protocol stacks. It is difficult for network designers to offer a wide spectrum of alternative protocols suitable for diverse situations, and to make the stack evolve to match new needs. The tendency is to design protocols that can adapt to the widest possible spread of use. However, even the best adaptive protocols cannot possibly cope with all situations. When their adaptivity limits are reached, the ability to switch to other protocols becomes a clear advantage Our aim in this paper is to present Lightweight Autonomous resIlient Networks (LAIN), a framework that exploits the multiplicity of alternative protocol, and exposes the spectrum of choice to the advantage of the applications. The system runs continuous experiments with alternative protocols online, in parallel as well as serially, in order to select automatically those that best match the application's needs under the current network conditions. We report first results on the feasibility of the approach and point out the need for such a system in network and protocol evolution",

    "abstract": "The Internet topology has significantly changed in the past years. Today, it is richly connected and flattened. Such a change has been driven mostly by the fast growth of peering infrastructures and the expansion of Content Delivery Networks as alternatives to reduce interconnection costs and improve traffic delivery performance. While the topology evolution is perceptible, it is unclear whether or not the interconnection process has evolved or if it continues to be an ad-hoc and lengthy process. To shed light on the current practices of the Internet interconnection ecosystem and how these could impact the Internet, we surveyed more than 100 network operators and peering coordinators. We divide our results into two parts: ( i ) the current interconnection practices, including the steps of the process and the reasons to establish new interconnection agreements or to renegotiate existing ones, and the parameters discussed by network operators. In part ( ii ), we report the existing limitations and how the interconnection ecosystem can evolve in the future. We show that despite the changes in the topology, interconnecting continues to be a cumbersome process that usually takes days, weeks, or even months to complete, which is in stark contrast with the desire of most operators in reducing the interconnection setup time. We also identify that even being primary candidates to evolve the interconnection process, emerging on-demand connectivity companies are only fulfilling part of the existing gap between the current interconnection practices and the network operators' desires.",

    "abstract": "New protocols for the data link and network layer are being proposed to address limitations of current protocols in terms of scalability, security, and manageability. High-speed routers and switches that implement these protocols traditionally perform packet processing using ASICs which offer high speed, low chip area, and low power. But with inflexible custom hardware, the deployment of new protocols could happen only through equipment upgrades. While newer routers use more flexible network processors for data plane processing, due to power and area constraints lookups in forwarding tables are done with custom lookup modules. Thus most of the proposed protocols can only be deployed with equipment upgrades. To speed up the deployment of new protocols, we propose a flexible lookup module, PLUG (Pipelined Lookup Grid). We can achieve generality without loosing efficiency because various custom lookup modules have the same fundamental features we retain: area dominated by memories, simple processing, and strict access patterns defined by the data structure. We implemented IPv4, Ethernet, Ethane, and SEATTLE in our dataflow-based programming model for the PLUG and mapped them to the PLUG hardware which consists of a grid of tiles. Throughput, area, power, and latency of PLUGs are close to those of specialized lookup modules.",

Recent prototype deployments have investigated the possibility of using outside air for cooling and have shown large potential savings in energy consumption. In this paper, we push this idea to the extreme, by running servers outside in Finnish winter. Our results show that commercial, off-the-shelf computer equipment can tolerate extreme conditions such as outside air temperatures below --20 C and still function correctly over extended periods of time. Our experiment improves upon the other recent results by confirming their findings and extending them to cover a wider range of intake air temperatures and humidity. This paper presents our experimentation methodology and setup, and our main findings and observations.",

However, there lacks still a robust metric quantifying the perceptual quality of a Skype call. The widely-used PESQ (Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality) falls short of modeling super-wideband calls, which are characteristics of SILK Skype's codec made public in 2011. Towards a robust QoE (Quality of Experience) metric for VoIP call analysis, we propose a model, referred to as WF-Regression model, to capture the call rate and perceptual quality relationship. The model is shown through a user study that it is robust, R-square = 0.9990 and outperform PESQ modeling the quality of Skype calls, error ratio = 3.68% vs. 14.59%.",

The basic idea is to deploy a wide-band radio front-end to receive radio signals from all wireless standards sharing the same spectrum band, and use separate software base-bands to demodulate information stream for each wireless standard. Based on software radio, MPAP consolidates multiple wireless devices into single hardware platform, allowing them to share the common general-purpose computing resource. Different software base-bands can easily communicate and coordinate via a software coordinator and coexist better with one another. As one example, we demonstrate to use non-contiguous OFDM in 802.11g PHY to avoid the mutual interference with narrow-band ZigBee communication.",

    "abstract": "Multi-rooted tree topologies are commonly used to construct high-bandwidth data center network fabrics. In these networks, switches typically rely on equal-cost multipath (ECMP) routing techniques to split traffic across multiple paths, such that packets within a flow traverse the same end-to-end path. Unfortunately, since ECMP splits traffic based on flow-granularity, it can cause load imbalance across paths resulting in poor utilization of network resources. More fine-grained traffic splitting techniques are typically not preferred because they can cause packet reordering that can, according to conventional wisdom, lead to severe TCP throughput degradation. In this work, we revisit this fact in the context of regular data center topologies such as fat-tree architectures. We argue that packet-level traffic splitting, where packets of a flow are sprayed through all available paths, would lead to a better load-balanced network, which in turn leads to significantly more balanced queues and much higher throughput compared to ECMP.",

In such networks, not all administrative domains will generate information that an application can trust and many administrative domains may have restrictive policies on disclosing network information. Thus, both the trustworthiness and accessibility of network information pose obstacles to effective reasoning. NetQuery employs trustworthy computing techniques to facilitate reasoning about the trustworthiness of information contained in the knowledge plane while preserving confidentiality guarantees for operator data. By characterizing information disclosure between operators, NetQuery enables remote verification of advertised claims and contractual stipulations; this enables new applications because network guarantees can span administrative boundaries. We have implemented NetQuery, built several NetQuery-enabled devices, and deployed applications for cloud datacenters, enterprise networks, and the Internet. Simulations, testbed experiments, and a deployment on a departmental network indicate NetQuery can support hundreds of thousands of operations per second and can thus scale to large ISPs.",

    "abstract": "Interdomain path changes occur frequently. Because routing protocols expose insufficient information to reason about all changes, the general problem of identifying the root cause remains unsolved. In this work, we design and evaluate PoiRoot , a real-time system that allows a provider to accurately isolate the root cause (the network responsible) of path changes affecting its prefixes. First, we develop a new model describing path changes and use it to provably identify the set of all potentially responsible networks. Next, we develop a recursive algorithm that accurately isolates the root cause of any path change. We observe that the algorithm requires monitoring paths that are generally not visible using standard measurement tools. To address this limitation, we combine existing measurement tools in new ways to acquire path information required for isolating the root cause of a path change. We evaluate PoiRoot on path changes obtained through controlled Internet experiments, simulations, and \"in-the-wild\" measurements. We demonstrate that PoiRoot is highly accurate, works well even with partial information, and generally narrows down the root cause to a single network or two neighboring ones. On controlled experiments PoiRoot is 100% accurate, as opposed to prior work which is accurate only 61.7% of the time.",

    "abstract": "Virtual LANs (VLANs) permit hosts connected to a LAN switch to be grouped together into logical groups as a function of some management policy rather than simply of their physical location. Commercial LAN switches support a variety of policies based on either physical or logical addresses, protocol types, tagged frames, or user defined rules. The objective of these policies is the same: to reduce the amount of traffic that needs to be routed by grouping together hosts which are likely to communicate with each other into the same virtual LAN. This paper proposes a novel and more direct approach, it shows how VLANs can be created and removed dynamically as a function of the measured traffic patterns across the network. This is both simpler than configuring many static rules and permits the VLAN configuration to adapt to the evolution in the traffic patterns. The latter point is especially important in future LANs supporting peer-to-peer continuous media services, such as IP telephony or video-conferencing, in which clusters of hosts come together to communicate with each other intensively for relatively short periods of time and then form into new clusters.",

Through a sequence of increasingly sophisticated stochastic models, we study the impact of parameter estimation errors, of flow arrival and departure dynamics, and of estimation memory on the performance of an MBAC system.We show that a certainty equivalence assumption, i.e., assuming that the measured parameters are the real ones, can grossly compromise the target performance of the system. We quantify the improvement in performance as a function of the memory size of the estimator and a more conservative choice of the certainty-equivalent parameters. Our results yield valuable new insight into the performance of MBAC schemes, and represent quantitative guidelines for the design of robust schemes.",

The best choice, which may vary on a connection-by-connection or even a packet-by-packet basis, depends on three factors: the characteristics the protocol should optimize, the permissiveness of the networks over which the packets travel and the level of mobile-awareness of the hosts with which the mobile host corresponds.Of the sixteen possible routing choices that we identify, we describe the seven that are most useful and discuss their benefits and limitations. These optimizations range from the most costly, which provides completely transparent mobility in all networks, to the most economical, which does not attempt to conceal location information. In particular, hosts should retain the option to communicate conventionally without using Mobile IP whenever appropriate.Further, we show that all optimizations can be described using a 4&amp;times;4 grid of packet characteristics. This makes it easier for a mobile host, through a series of tests, to determine which of the currently available optimizations is the best to use for any given correspondent host.",

We found that the memory system---which has long been known to dominate network throughput---is also a key factor in protocol latency. As a result, improving instruction cache effectiveness can greatly reduce protocol processing overheads. An important metric in this context is the memory cycles per instructions (mCPI), which is the average number of cycles that an instruction stalls waiting for a memory access to complete. The techniques presented in this paper reduce the mCPI by a factor of 1.35 to 5.8. In analyzing the effectiveness of the techniques, we also present a detailed study of the protocol processing behavior of two protocol stacks---TCP/IP and RPC---on a modern RISC processor.",

    "abstract": "Bandwidth-sensitive multicast delivery controlled by routing criteria pertinent to the actual traffic flow is very costly in terms of router state and control overhead and it scales poorly towards larger, wide-area networks. PIM-SM (Protocol-independent Multicast - Sparse Mode) has been introduced as a simple, flexible and scalable concept for Internet-wide multicasting. Yet, PIM's efficiency potential (like that of alternative wide-area multicast concepts) can only be fully exploited if it is based on Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF), a low-cost mechanism, which however does not select prescribed delivery paths if link parameters or routing policies are asymmetric. This paper presents an extension to protocols like PIM-SM, called Policy Tree Multicast Routing (PTMR). This concept leads to multicast delivery trees which, even under asymmetric conditions, readily comply with imposed macroscopic policies and moreover enable support of shortest path and QoS criteria. PTMR gives no consideration to how the policy-sensitive paths have been established; they may be imposed by the network itself but also by providers, recipients and even sources. PTMR amends the PIM-SM mechanism with a macroscopic control layer which marks (pegs) domain border routers on policy-sensitive forward paths. In a given domain, a pegged ingress border router is then joined by local group members as well as by its child pegs. This results in optimally fusing transit paths into local distribution trees. PTMR performance and policy control potential are restricted primarily: by the congestion of control messages at the multicast sources, introduced by source-originating tree construction; by the possible extent of policy-sensitive path aggregation; and by the intra-domain (transit) delivery conditions. PTMR is a single-layer protocol, appending PIM-SM with a policy dedicated delivery mode. Ist primary design target is to forward multicast traffic in accordance with any underlying multicast-relevant routing, including comprehensive policy routing. In comparison, Border Gateway Multicast Protocol (BGMP) is a proposal for an intra-domain MR protocol based on BGP-type routing, which focuses on fusing heterogenous multicast routing domains and which allows ASs to control multicast transit traffic.",

The paper discusses the modelling of some concepts quite related with the service: service access points and abstract service primitives. Firstly, ISO concepts are explained. Then, a service architectural model is developed as a refinament of the service access point idea using the connection end point concept. A finite state machine approach is shown to specify the behavior of the modules of such architecture. This lead us to consider the service access point represented as a single state automaton that consists of several connection end point automata. Thus, service access points allow the specification of services, and provide an abstraction of interfaces between adjacent layers of the Open System Interconnection model of ISO.",

The approach is targeted at service primitives architectures for enhanced telecommunications networks, but can apply to more general settings such as multi-tasking supercomputers and network operations systems. * Study of the methods presented here was a key motivation in founding the Bell Communications Research Integrated Media Architecture Laboratory (IMAL) [1] . The Threaded/Flow approach uses data-flow constructs to assemble higher level functions from other distributed functions and resources with arbitrary degrees of decentralization. Equivalence between algorithms and hard and virtual resources is accomplished via threaded-interpretive constructs. Function autonomy, concurrency, conditional branching, pipelining, and setup/execution interaction are implicitly supported. Some elementary performance comparisons are argued. This work is motivated by telecommunications applications involving coordinated multiple-media in open architectures supporting large numbers of users and outside service vendors. In such networks it is desired that services may be flexibly constructed by the network, service vendors, or by users themselves from any meaningful combination of elementary primitives and previously defined services. Reliability, billing, call progress, real-time user control, and network management functions must be explicitly supported. These needs are handled with apparent high performance by the approach.",

However, when such support is provided through service-specific mechanisms, the proliferation of one-off solutions tend to decrease the robustness of the network over time. Programmable routers, on the other hand, offer generic support for a variety of end-to-end services, but face a different set of challenges with respect to performance, scalability, security, and robustness. Ideally, router-based support for end-to-end services should exhibit the kind of generality, simplicity, scalability, and performance that made the Internet Protocol (IP) so successful. In this paper we present a router-based building block called ephemeral state processing (ESP), which is designed to have IP-like characteristics. ESP allows packets to create and manipulate small amounts of temporary state at routers via short, predefined computations. We discuss the issues involved in the design of such a service and describe three broad classes of problems for which ESP enables robust solutions. We also present performance measurements from a network-processor-based implementation.",

One of the more recent proposals is the Differentiated Services (Diff-Serv) architecture, and in this paper we explore how the policing actions and associated rate guarantees provided by the Expedited Forwarding (EF) translate into perceived benefits for applications that are the presumed users of such enhancements. Specifically, we focus on video streaming applications that arguably have relatively strong service quality requirements, and which should, therefore, stand to benefit from the availability of some form of enhanced service. Our goal is to gain a better understanding of the relation that exists between application level quality measures and the selection of the network level parameters that govern the delivery of the guarantees that an EF based service would provide. Our investigation, which is experimental in nature, relies on a number of standard streaming video servers and clients that have been modified and instrumented to allow quantification of the perceived quality of the received video stream. Quality assessments are performed using a Video Quality Measurement tool based on the ANSI objective quality standard. Measurements were made over both a local Diff-Serv testbed and across the QBone, a QoS enabled segment of the Internet2 infrastructure. The paper reports and analyzes the results of those measurements.",

The tenets of the original Internet architecture [6] arose as a response to the technical, governmental, and societal environment of internetworking's earliest days, but have remained central to the Internet as it has evolved. In light of the increasing integration of the Internet into the social, economic, and political aspects of our lives, it is worth revisiting the underlying tenets of what is becoming a central element of the world's infrastructure.This paper examines three key tenets that we believe should guide the evolution of the Internet in its next generation and beyond. They are: design for change, controlled transparency, and the centrality of the tussle space. [8] Our purpose is not to present these ideas as new, but rather to propose that they should be elevated to central tenets of the evolving architecture of the Internet, and explore the ramifications of doing so. The paper first examines the tenets somewhat abstractly, and then in more detail by studying their relation to several design choices needed for a complete architecture. We conclude with a discussion of the relationship between the network architecture and the applications it serves.",

One of the hottest topics in this area is the design of discrete congestion control algorithms that are asymptotically stable under heterogeneous feedback delay and whose control equations do not explicitly depend on the RTTs of end-flows. In this paper, we show that max-min fair congestion control methods with a stable symmetric Jacobian remain stable under arbitrary feedback delay (including heterogeneous directional delays) and that the stability condition of such methods does not involve any of the delays. To demonstrate the practicality of the obtained result, we change the original controller in Kelly's work [14] to become robust under random feedback delay and fixed constants of the control equation. We call the resulting framework Max-min Kelly Control (MKC) and show that it offers smooth sending rate, exponential convergence to efficiency, and fast convergence to fairness, all of which make it appealing for future high-speed networks.",

    "abstract": "Per-flow congestion control helps endpoints fairly and efficiently share network resources. Better utilization of network resources can be achieved, however, if congestion management algorithms can determine when two different flows share a congested link. Such knowledge can be used to implement cooperative congestion control or improve the overlay topology of a P2P system. Previous techniques to detect shared congestion either assume a common source or destination node, drop-tail queueing, or a single point of congestion. We propose in this paper a novel technique, applicable to any pair of paths on the Internet, without such limitations. Our technique employs a signal processing method, wavelet denoising, to separate queueing delay caused by network congestion from various other delay variations. Our wavelet-based technique is evaluated through both simulations and Internet experiments. We show that, when detecting shared congestion of paths with a common endpoint, our technique provides faster convergence and higher accuracy while using fewer packets than previous techniques, and that it also accurately determines when there is no shared congestion. Furthermore, we show that our technique is robust and accurate for paths without a common endpoint or synchronized clocks; more specifically, it can tolerate a synchronization offset of up to one second between two packet flows.",

    "abstract": "Thousands of competing autonomous systems must cooperate with each other to provide global Internet connectivity. Each autonomous system (AS) encodes various economic, business, and performance decisions in its routing policy. The current interdomain routing system enables each AS to express policy using rankings that determine how each router inthe AS chooses among different routes to a destination, and filters that determine which routes are hidden from each neighboring AS. Because the Internet is composed of many independent, competing networks, the interdomain routing system should provide autonomy , allowing network operators to set their rankings independently, and to have no constraints on allowed filters. This paper studies routing protocol stability under these conditions. We first demonstrate that certain rankings that are commonly used in practice may not ensure routing stability. We then prove that, when providers can set rankings and filters autonomously, guaranteeing that the routing system will converge to a stable path assignment essentially requires ASes to rank routes based on AS-path lengths. We discuss the implications of these results for the future of interdomain routing.",

    "abstract": "Context-aware applications need quickly access to current context information, in order to adapt their behavior before this context changes. To achieve this, the context distribution mechanism has to timely discover context sources that can provide a particular context type, then acquire and distribute context information from these sources to the applications that requested this type of information. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art context distribution mechanisms according to identified requirements, then introduces a resource list-based subscription/notification mechanism for context sharing. This SIP-based mechanism enables subscriptions to a resource list containing URIs of multiple context sources that can provide the same context type and delivery of aggregated notifications containing context updates from each of these sources. Aggregation of context is thought to be important as it reduces the network traffic between entities involved in context distribution. However, it introduces an additional delay due to waiting for context updates and their aggregation. To investigate if this aggregation actually pays off, we measured and compared the time needed by an application to receive context updates after subscribing to a particular resource list (using RLS) versus after subscribing to each of the individual context sources (using SIMPLE) for different numbers of context sources. Our results show that RLS aggregation outperforms the SIMPLE presence mechanism with 3 or more context sources, regardless of their context updates size. Database performance was identified as a major bottleneck during aggregation, hence we used in-memory tables &amp; prepared statements, leading to up to 57% database time improvement, resulting in a reduction of the aggregation time by up to 34%. With this reduction and an increase in context size, we pushed the aggregation payoff threshold closer to 2 context sources.",

The optimal AP coordination process is calculated by modeling it as a finite horizon discrete Markov decision process, which is efficiently solved by an approximation algorithm. The performance advantages are veried through extensive simulations.",

However, as early as 1998, observations have been made of BGP announcing the same route multiple times, causing router CPU load, memory usage and convergence time higher than expected. In this paper, by performing controlled experiments, we pinpoint multiple causes of duplicates, ranging from the lack of full RIB-Outs to the discrete processing of update messages. To mitigate these duplicates, we insert a cache at the output of the routers. We test it on public BGP traces and discuss the relation of the cache performance with the existence of bursts of updates in the trace.",

Current state-of-the-art solutions are based on a very conservative model that assumes worst-case workloads. This finally limits the programmability of the system, even if actual deployment conditions may be very different from the worst-case scenario. We use trace-based simulations to highlight the benefits of accounting for specific workload characteristics. Furthermore, we show that relatively simple additions to a switching chip design can take advantage of such characteristics. In particular, we argue that introducing stalls in the switching chip pipeline enables stateful functions to be executed in a larger but bounded time without harming the overall forwarding performance. Our results show that, in some cases, the stateful processing of a packet could use 30x the time budget provided by state of the art solutions.",

In this paper, we make a case for slack-aware networking by illustrating slack opportunities that arise for a wide range of applications as they interact with the cloud and its pricing models (e.g., spot pricing).

Recently, as data replication technique developed, increasing systems enforce multi-source transmission to maximize network utilization. However, existing TE approaches fail to deal with multi-source transfers because the optimization becomes a joint problem of bandwidth allocation as well as flow assignment among different sources. In this paper, we present a novel allocation approach for multi-source transfers to achieve global max-min fairness. The joint bandwidth allocation and flow assignment optimization problem poses a major challenge due to nonlinearity and multiple objectives. We cope with this by deriving a novel transformation with simple equivalent canonical linear programming to achieve global optimality efficiently. We conduct data-driven simulations, showing that our approach is more max-min fair than other single-source and multi-source allocation approaches, meanwhile it outperforms others with substantial gains in terms of network throughput and transfer completion time.",

However, iBGP --- the routing protocol used to distribute routes inside a single Autonomous System --- has also been shown to oscillate. Despite the fact that iBGP is configured by a single provider according to apparently straight forward rules, more than eight years of research has not solved the problem of iBGP oscillation. Various solutions have been proposed but they all lack critical features: either they are complicated to implement, restrict routing flexibility, or lack guarantees of stability. In this paper we propose a very simple adaptation to the BGP decision process. Despite its simplicity and negligible cost we prove algebraically that it prevents iBGP oscillation. We extend the idea to provide routing flexibility, such as respecting the MED attribute, without sacrificing network stability.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that the current primitives for connecting multiple routing protocol instances (OSPF 1, OSPF 2, EIGRP 10, etc.) are pervasively deployed in enterprise networks and the Internet. Furthermore, these primitives are extremely vulnerable to routing anomalies (route oscillations, forwarding loops, etc.) and at the same time too rigid to support some of today's operational objectives. In this paper, we propose a new theory to reason about routing properties across multiple routing instances. The theory directly applies to both link-state and vector routing protocols. Each routing protocol still makes independent routing decisions and may consider a combination of routing metrics, including bandwidth, delay, cost, and reliability. While the theory permits a range of solutions, we focus on a design that requires no changes to existing routing protocols. Guided by the theory, we derive a new set of connecting primitives, which are not only provably safe but also more expressive than the current version. We have implemented and validated the new primitives using XORP. The results confirm that our design can support a large range of desirable operational goals, including those not achievable today, safely and with little manual configuration.",

The theme of the challenge was \"Mobile Data Offloading,\" and consisted on developing and comparatively evaluating strategies to offload infrastructure access points via customer ad hoc forwarding using handheld devices. According to the challenge rules, a hop-by-hop bidding contest should decide the path of each data packet towards its destination. Consequently, each team should rely on other teams' willingness to forward packets for them in order to get their traffic across the network. Following these rules, this paper proposes a strategy that is based on the concept of how \"tight\" a node is to successfully deliver a packet to its destination within a given deadline. This \"tightness\" idea relies on a shortest-path analysis of the underlying network graph, and it is used to define three sub-strategies that specify a) how to participate in an auction; b) how to announce an auction; and c) how to decide who wins the announced auction. The proposed strategy seeks to minimize network resource utilization and to promote cooperative behavior among participant nodes.",

The offline planning problem is one where aggregate demands are specified and the objective is to determine whether there is enough capacity in the network to handle the demands. We develop a fast FPTAS for the problem based on segmentation and lazy dual update. In the online routing problem, flow requests are given one at a time and the objective is to steer the flows to maximize the total amount of traffic accepted over time.

    "abstract": "Datacenter networking is currently dominated by two major trends. One aims toward lossless, flat layer-2 fabrics based on Converged Enhanced Ethernet or InfiniBand, with benefits in efficiency and performance. The other targets flexibility based on Software Defined Networking, which enables Overlay Virtual Networking. Although clearly complementary, these trends also exhibit some conflicts: In contrast to physical fabrics, which avoid packet drops by means of flow control, practically all current virtual networks are lossy. We quantify these losses for several common combinations of hypervisors and virtual switches, and show their detrimental effect on application performance. Moreover, we propose a zero-loss Overlay Virtual Network (zOVN) designed to reduce the query and flow completion time of latency-sensitive datacenter applications. We describe its architecture and detail the design of its key component, the zVALE lossless virtual switch. As proof of concept, we implemented a zOVN prototype and benchmark it with Partition-Aggregate in two testbeds, achieving an up to 15-fold reduction of the mean completion time with three widespread TCP versions. For larger-scale validation and deeper introspection into zOVN, we developed an OMNeT++ model for accurate cross-layer simulations of a virtualized datacenter, which confirm the validity of our results.",

    "abstract": "SSL/TLS is a standard protocol for secure Internet communication. Despite its great success, today's SSL deployment is largely limited to security-critical domains. The low adoption rate of SSL is mainly due to high computation overhead on the server side. In this paper, we propose Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) as a new source of computing power to reduce the server-side overhead. We have designed and implemented an SSL proxy that opportunistically offloads cryptographic operations to GPUs. The evaluation results show that our GPU implementation of cryptographic operations, RSA, AES, and HMAC-SHA1, achieves high throughput while keeping the latency low. The SSL proxy significantly boosts the throughput of SSL transactions, handling 21.5K SSL transactions per second, and has comparable response time even when overloaded.",

This workshop series provides a forum for researchers, Internet facilities and service providers, technologists, economists, theorists, policy makers, and other stakeholders to inform current and emerging regulatory and policy debates. The objective for this year's workshop was a structured consideration of whether and how policy-makers should try to shape the future of the Internet. To structure the discussion about policy, we began the workshop with a list of potential aspirations for our future telecommunications infrastructure (a list we had previously collated), and asked participants to articulate an aspiration or fear they had about the future of the Internet, which we summarized and discussed on the second day. The focus on aspirations was motivated by the high-level observation that before discussing regulation, we must agree on the objective of the regulation, and why the intended outcome is justified. In parallel, we used a similar format as in previous years: a series of focused sessions, where 3-4 presenters each prepared 10-minute talks on issues in recent regulatory discourse, followed by in-depth discussions. This report highlights the discussions and presents relevant open research questions identified by participants. Slides presented and a copy of this report are available at http://www.caida.org/workshops/wie/1412/.",

However, the security benefits provided by the RPKI are accomplished via an architecture that empowers centralized authorities to unilaterally revoke any IP prefixes under their control. We propose mechanisms to improve the transparency of the RPKI, in order to mitigate the risk that it will be used for IP address takedowns. First, we present tools that detect and visualize changes to the RPKI that can potentially take down an IP prefix. We use our tools to identify errors and revocations in the production RPKI. Next, we propose modifications to the RPKI's architecture to (1) require any revocation of IP address space to receive consent from all impacted parties, and (2) detect when misbehaving authorities fail to obtain consent. We present a security analysis of our architecture, and estimate its overhead using data-driven analysis.",

Many OSNs view this data as a valuable asset that is at the core of their business model. Both OSN users and OSNs have strong incentives to restrict large scale crawls of this data. OSN users want to protect their privacy and OSNs their business interest. Traditional defenses against crawlers involve rate- limiting browsing activity per user account. These defense schemes, however, are vulnerable to Sybil attacks, where a crawler creates a large number of fake user accounts. In this paper, we propose Genie, a system that can be deployed by OSN operators to defend against Sybil crawlers. Genie is based on a simple yet powerful insight: the social network itself can be leveraged to defend against Sybil crawlers. We first present Genie's design and then discuss how Genie can limit crawlers while allowing browsing of user profiles by normal users.",

    "abstract": "Consider this simple question: how can a network operator identify the set of routes that pass through its network? Answering this question is surprisingly hard: BGP only informs an operator about a limited set of routes. By observing traffic, an operator can only conclude that a particular route passes through its network -- but not that a route does not pass through its network. We approach this problem as one of statistical inference, bringing varying levels of additional information to bear: (1) the existence of traffic, and (2) the limited set of publicly available routing tables. We show that the difficulty depends critically on the position of the network in the overall Internet topology, and that the operators with the greatest incentive to solve this problem are those for which the problem is hardest. Nonetheless, we show that suitable application of nonparametric inference techniques can solve this problem quite accurately. For certain networks, traffic existence information yields good accuracy, while for other networks an accurate approach uses the \"distance\" between prefixes, according to a new network distance metric that we define. We then show how solving this problem leads to improved solutions for a particular application: traffic matrix completion.",

In this paper we present a concrete routing scheme that realizes this: \"push\" as well as \"pull\" communication; anycast as well as multicast; and descriptor-based (as opposed to name-based) addressing. The scheme is founded on multiple tree covers that can be arranged and composed hierarchically following the structure of network domains. On each tree, the scheme combines addresses so as to reduce forwarding state. We demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of the scheme through simulations on Internet-scale workloads in realistic network settings.",

Realizing this vision is challenging though as SDN proposals to date require substantial and expensive changes to the existing network architecture before the benefits can be realized. As a result, the number of SDN deployments has been rather limited in scope. To kickstart a wide-scale SDN deployment, there is a need for low-risk, high return solutions that solve a timely problem. As one possible solution, we show how we can significantly improve the performance of legacy IP routers, i.e. \"supercharge\" them, by combining them with SDN-enabled devices. In this abstract, we supercharge one particular aspect of the router performance: its convergence time after a link or a node failure.",

Unless the packet forwarding pipeline is both simple and static in function, fine-tuning the system for optimal forwarding is a time-consuming and brittle process. Network virtualization and network function virtualization value general purpose CPUs exactly for their flexibility: in such systems, a single x86 forwarding element does not implement a single, static classification step but a sequence of dynamically reconfigurable and potentially complex forwarding operations. This leaves a software developer looking for maximal packet forwarding throughput with few options besides flow caching. In this paper, we consider the problem of flow caching and more specifically, how to cache forwarding decisions that depend on packet fields with high entropy (and therefore, change often); to this end, we arrive at algorithms that allow us to efficiently compute near optimal flow cache entries spanning several transport connections, even if forwarding decisions depend on transport protocol headers.",

ScaleBricks applies a new, compact lookup structure to route packets directly to the appropriate handling node, without incurring the cost of multiple hops across the internal interconnect. Its lookup structure is many times smaller than the alternative approach of fully replicating a forwarding table onto all nodes. As a result, ScaleBricks is able to improve throughput and latency while simultaneously increasing the total number of flows that can be handled by such a cluster. This architecture is effective in practice: Used to optimize packet forwarding in an existing commercial LTE-to-Internet gateway, it increases the throughput of a four-node cluster by 23%, reduces latency by up to 10%, saves memory, and stores up to 5.7x more entries in the forwarding table.",

Condor allows architects to express their requirements as constraints via a Topology Description Language (TDL), rather than having to directly specify network structures. Condor then uses constraint-based synthesis to rapidly generate candidate topologies, which can be analyzed against multiple criteria. We show that TDL supports concise descriptions of topologies such as fat-trees, BCube, and DCell; that we can generate known and novel variants of fat-trees with simple changes to a TDL file; and that we can synthesize large topologies in tens of seconds.

This enables it to handle a variety of data plane and control plane attacks, while being easily implementable in today's ISP.

    "abstract": "This demo presents WiMAC, a general-purpose wireless testbed for researchers to quickly prototype a wide variety of real-time MAC protocols for wireless networks. As the interface between the link layer and the physical layer, MAC protocols are often tightly coupled with the underlying physical layer, and need to have extremely small latencies. Implementing a new MAC requires a long time. In fact, very few MACs have ever been implemented, even though dozens of new MAC protocols have been proposed. To enable quick prototyping, we employ the mechanism vs. policy separation to decompose the functionality in the MAC layer and the PHY layer. Built on the separation framework, WiMAC achieves the independence of the software from the hardware, offering a high degree of function reuse and design flexibility. Hence, our platform not only supports easy cross-layer design but also allows protocol changes on the fly. Following the 802.11-like reference design, we demonstrate that deploying a new MAC protocol is quick and simple on the proposed platform through the implementation of the CSMA/CA and CHAIN protocols.",

We address these questions with the sample selection system Memento, which maintains a training set with the \"most useful\" samples to maximize sample space coverage. Memento particularly benefits rare patterns---the notoriously long \"tail\" in networking---and allows assessing rationally when retraining may help, i.e., when the coverage changes. We deployed Memento on Puffer, the live-TV streaming project, and achieved a 14 % reduction of stall time, 3.5× the improvement of random sample selection. Memento is model-agnostic and can be applied beyond video streaming.",

    "abstract": "The Gigabit Study Group at the University of Illinois is developing a tool that will permit analysis of the network from the application point of view, providing input into the network engineering process and predicting application performance. Phases in this development include the measurement of existing networks, the profiling of application input/output activity, and the integration of the information derived from these into a simulation tool.Maximum throughput ratings on networks continue to rise but our measurements show that the throughput realized by an application is closely tied to the sizes of data ( buffer sizes ) used by the application over the network and the number of buffers that are sent consecutively. Our preliminary study indicates that, while there are applications are specifically designed to take advantage of large network packets, most interactive TCP/IP applications use small (4 bytes to 8k bytes) buffers and do not send large numbers of buffers in a row. For this type of traffic, a 1 Gbps UltraNet provides about the same performance as a 10 Mbps Ethernet. For large volume traffic (32k bytes to 256k bytes), either generated by large packets or sequences of small packets, the UltraNet provides quite satisfactory throughput to the application. The study described herein examines the throughput of four networks as a function of buffer size for sequences of 4 buffers and 128 buffers.Because the maximum rated throughput of a network can be a poor indicator of the throughput that network provides to an application, we believe that a tool that takes into account the characteristics of the application set is needed.",

The investigated models cover considerably more traffic profiles than the usual Markovian counterparts and have reduced state-space requirements. The effective bandwidth, as a function of the asymptotic loss probability decay rate, is implicitly derivable by the requirement that the spectral radius of an appropriate nonnegative matrix be equal to unity. The effective bandwidth function is shown to be, either strictly increasing, or constant and equal to the mean rate. Sources of the second kind, which are characterized, generalize the notion of 'CBR' traffic. Furthermore, a study for the limiting effective bandwidth, towards a loss-less environment, is undertaken; it is shown that the limiting value may, under some fully identified restrictions on the source behavior, be less than the source's peak rate. Under those restrictions, a source may have reduced bandwidth requirements, even if it features a large peak rate.",

    "abstract": "Wormhole routing LANs are emerging as an effective solution for high-bandwidth, low-latency interconnects in distributed computing and cluster computing applications. An important example is the 640 Mb/s crossbar-based Myrinet. A key property of conventional LANs, which is valuable for many distributed applications, is transparent, reliable network-level multicast. It is desirable to retain this property also in wormhole LANs. Unfortunately, efficient, reliable multicasting in wormhole LANs is problematic because of the potential for deadlocks. As a consequence, current multicasting implementations typically consist of repeated unicast or assume a priori buffer reservations. These solutions, however, tend to increase latency and do not scale well.In this paper we address the problem of providing transparent, reliable, efficient network level multicasting in the wormhole LAN. We describe several protocols for achieving deadlock-free, reliable multicasting using restricted routing and fast buffer reservation techniques. Tradeoffs involving complexity and performance of various solutions are discussed, and are illustrated using simulation. A simple multicast implementation for Myrinet has been carried out, and experimental results are presented.",

The photonic network is based on a passive star-coupled WDM–based configuration with high topological connectivity and low complexity. The channels are pre-allocated to the nodes with this approach, where each node has a home channel that it uses either for all data packet transmissions or all data packet receptions. A home channel may be shared if the number of nodes exceeds the number of channels in the system. This approach does not require both tunable transmitters and tunable receivers. The performance of a generalized random access protocol is compared to a protocol based on interleaved time multiplexing. Both protocols are designed to operate in a multiple-channel multiple-access environment and require each node to possess a tunable transmitter and a fixed (or slow tunable) receiver. Semi-markov analytic models are developed to investigate the performance of the two protocols. The analytic models are validated through simulation and performance is evaluated in terms of network throughput and packet delay with variations in system parameters.",

The requirements and definition of this protocol are described, and details are given of how the broadcast satellite channel is used and the implementation of the protocols in the system which provides satellite access from each site. Experimental use of the protocol is also described, in particular its use for file distribution. The paper also aims to show how the protocols could be used for more advanced applications.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of data communication networks, researchers have been looking at the possibility of placing copies of a database at two or more nodes of a network. Such data replication is interesting because it makes the database accessible even when some of the nodes in the system fail. Furthermore, transactions which only read data may get faster access to the data when multiple copies exist. Due to the complex and time consuming update protocols, and due to the additional required hardware, data replication has a definite cost. This cost factor is often overlooked in discussions on replicated data, so in this paper we examine some of the cost issues involved. We argue that the cost of replicating data is so high that only in very special cases will data be replicated at different nodes of a computer communication network and kept in a consistent state. We also discuss some alternate approaches to data replication (like data replication at a single node and shadow copies).",

After discussing end-to-end arguments with respect to several properties of network storage, we describe the Internet Backplane Protocol and the exNode, which are tools that have been designed to create a network storage substrate that adheres to these principles. The name for this approach is Logistical Networking, and we believe its use is fundamental to the future of truly scalable communication.",

    "abstract": "The &lt;i&gt;science&lt;/i&gt; of network service composition has emerged as one of the grand themes of networking research [17] as a direct result of the complexity and sophistication of emerging networked systems and applications. By \"service composition\" we mean that the performance and correctness properties local to the various constituent components of a service can be readily composed into global (end-to-end) properties without re-analyzing any of the constituent components in isolation, or as part of the whole composite service. The set of laws that govern such composition is what will constitute that new science of composition. The heterogeneity and open nature of network systems make composition quite challenging, and thus programming network services has been largely inaccessible to the average user. We identify (and outline) a research agenda in which we aim to develop a &lt;i&gt;specification language&lt;/i&gt; that is expressive enough to describe different components of a network service, and that will include &lt;i&gt;type hierarchies&lt;/i&gt; inspired by type systems in general programming languages that enable the safe composition of software components. We envision this new science of composition to be built upon several theories, possibly including control theory, network calculus, scheduling theory, and game theory. In essence, different theories may provide different &lt;i&gt;languages&lt;/i&gt; by which certain properties of system components can be expressed and composed into larger systems. We then seek to lift these lower-level specifications to a higher level by abstracting away details that are irrelevant for safe composition at the higher level, thus making theories scalable and useful to the average user. In this paper we focus on services built upon an overlay traffic management architecture, and we use control theory and QoS theory as example theories from which we lift up compositional specifications.",

In 6to4, the links between the IPv4 and IPv6 Internets are called relay routers These may be advertised publicly or privately. The number of 6to4 relay routers has been the subject of debate, as additional routers increase the scalability and efficency of the 6to4 system. Counting public relay routers is easy using the global routing table. This paper outlines a technique that can count private relay routers and reports results of applying this method. Our results indicate that there are a significant number of private relays in operation in comparison to the number of public relays. This number has increased over the last two years. The results also indicate that using distributed traceroute facilities to measure the multiplicity of an anycast deployment requires large numbers of nodes to be accurate",

Most workshop attendees provided white papers describing their perspectives, and many participated in short-talks and discussion in two virtual workshops over five days. That discussion produced consensus around several points. First, many aspects of the Internet are characterized by decreasing visibility of important network properties, which is in tension with the Internet's role as critical infrastructure. We discussed three specific research areas that illustrate this tension: security, Internet access; and mobile networking. We discussed visibility challenges at all layers of the networking stack, and the challenge of gathering data and validating inferences. Important data sets require longitudinal (long-term, ongoing) data collection and sharing, support for which is more challenging for Internet research than other fields. We discussed why a combination of technical and policy methods are necessary to safeguard privacy when using or sharing measurement data. Workshop participant proposed several opportunities to accelerate progress, some of which require coordination across government, industry, and academia.",

PIT analyzes the ICMP messages that may scattered to a network telescope as spoofed packets travel from attacker to victim. An Internet route model is then used to help re-construct the attack path. Applying this mechanism to data collected by Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA), we found PIT can construct a trace tree from at least one intermediate router in 55.4% the fiercest packet spoofing attacks, and can construct a tree from at least 10 routers in 23.4% of attacks.

We sketch the design of Wi-Stitch, an architecture that exploits these observations to construct a highly efficient content sharing infrastructure at the very edge and show through analysis of a real workload that it can deliver substantial (up to 70%) savings in network traffic. The Wi-Stitch approach can be used both by clients of fixed-line broadband, as well as mobile devices obtaining indoors access in converged networks.",

    "abstract": "Individuals lack proper means to supervise the services they contact and the information they exchange when surfing the web. This security task has become challenging due to the complexity of the modern web, of the data delivering technology, and even to the adoption of encryption, which, while improving privacy, makes in-network services ineffective. The implications are serious, from a person contacting undesired services or unwillingly exposing private information, to a company being unable to control the flow of its information to the outside world. To empower transparency and the capability of taking informed choices in the web, we propose CROWDSURF, a system for comprehensive and collaborative auditing of data exchanged with Internet services. Similarly to crowdsourced efforts, we enable users to contribute in building awareness, supported by the semi-automatic analysis of data offered by a cloud-based system. The result is the creation of \"suggestions\" that individuals can transform in enforceable \"rules\" to customize their web browsing policy. CROWDSURF provides the core infrastructure to let individuals and enterprises regain visibility and control on their web activity. Preliminary results obtained executing a prototype implementation demonstrate the feasibility and potential of CROWDSURF.",

    "abstract": "In fields like data mining and natural language processing, design contests have been successfully used to advance the state of the art. Such contests offer an opportunity to bring the excitement and challenges of protocol design---one of the core intellectual elements of research and practice in networked systems---to a broader group of potential contributors, whose ideas may prove important. Moreover, it may lead to an increase in the number of students, especially undergraduates or those learning via online courses, interested in pursuing a career in the field. We describe the creation of the infrastructure and our experience with a protocol design contest conducted in MIT's graduate Computer Networks class. This contest involved the design and evaluation of a congestion-control protocol for paths traversing cellular wireless networks. One key to the success of a design contest is an unambiguous, measurable objective to compare protocols. In practice, protocol design is the art of trading off conflicting goals with each other, but in this contest, we specified that the goal was to maximize $\\log(\\mbox{throughput}/\\mbox{delay})$. This goal is a good match for applications such as video streaming or videoconferencing that care about high throughput and low interactive delays. Some students produced protocols whose performance was better than published protocols tackling similar goals. Furthermore, the convex hull of the set of all student protocols traced out a tradeoff curve in the throughput-delay space, providing useful insights into the entire space of possible protocols. We found that student protocols diverged in performance between the training and testing traces, indicating that some students had overtrained (\"overfitted\") their protocols to the training trace. Our conclusion is that, if designed properly, such contests could benefit networking research by making new proposals more easily reproducible and amenable to such \"gamification,\" improve networked systems, and provide an avenue for outreach.",

    "abstract": "BGP, the Internet's interdomain routing protocol, is highly vulnerable to routing failures that result from unintentional misconfigurations or deliberate attacks. To defend against these failures, recent years have seen the adoption of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), which currently authorizes 4% of the Internet's routes. The RPKI is a completely new security infrastructure (requiring new servers, caches, and the design of new protocols), a fact that has given rise to some controversy. Thus, an alternative proposal has emerged: Route Origin Verification (ROVER}, which leverages the existing reverse DNS (rDNS) and DNSSEC to secure the interdomain routing system. Both RPKI and ROVER rely on a hierarchy of authorities to provide trusted information about the routing system. Recently, however, it has been argued that the misconfigured, faulty or compromised RPKI authorities introduce new vulnerabilities in the routing system, which can take IP prefixes offline. Meanwhile, the designers of ROVER claim that it operates in a \"fail-safe mode\", where \"[o]ne could completely unplug a router verification application at any time and Internet routing would continue to work just as it does today\". There has been debate in Internet community mailing lists about the pros and cons of both approaches. This poster therefore compares the impact of ROVER failures to those of the RPKI, in a threat model that covers misconfigurations, faults or compromises of their trusted authorities.",

The platform supports full line-rate traffic generation regardless of packet size across the four card ports, packet capture filtering and packet thinning in hardware and sub-msec time precision in traffic generation and capture, corrected using an external GPS device. Furthermore, it provides a software APIs to test the dataplane performance of multi-10G switches, providing a starting point for a number of different test cases. OSNT flexibility is further demonstrated through the OFLOPS-turbo platform: an integration of OSNT with the OFLOPS OpenFlow switch performance evaluation platform, enabling control and data plane evaluation of 10G switches.

    "abstract": "A common pattern in the architectures of modern interactive web-services is that of large request fan-outs, where even a single end-user request (task) arriving at an application server triggers tens to thousands of data accesses (sub-tasks) to different stateful backend servers. The overall response time of each task is bottlenecked by the completion time of the slowest sub-task, making such workloads highly sensitive to the tail of latency distribution of the backend tier. The large number of decentralized application servers and skewed workload patterns exacerbate the challenge in addressing this problem. We address these challenges through BetteR Batch (BRB). By carefully scheduling requests in a decentralized and task-aware manner, BRB enables low-latency distributed storage systems to deliver predictable performance in the presence of large request fan-outs. Our preliminary simulation results based on production workloads show that our proposed design is at the 99th percentile latency within 38% of an ideal system model while offering latency improvements over the state-of-the-art by a factor of 2.",

It can emulate large SDN deployments by distributing the workload over a cluster of compute nodes. Moreover, DOT can emulate a wider range of network services compared to other publicly available SDN emulators and simulators. Our demonstration will illustrate several features of DOT including: (i) how easy it is to setup the emulator, (ii) how to deploy a topology using a single configuration file, (iii) how to run a connectivity test to ensure that the emulated network is properly deployed, and (iv) how to control and monitor the emulated components from a centralized location.

This technology opened the door for efficient programming in the operating system, especially in its network stack. However, its applicability is not limited to the Linux kernel. Various efforts leveraged the eBPF Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) as the basis of other networking related use cases outside of the Linux kernel. This paper focuses on the pluginized protocols' use case such as PQUIC and xBGP where the eBPF ISA serves as the basis to execute plugins providing per-session protocol behavior. It first quickly describes how the Linux kernel builds around this eBPF ISA to provide enhanced in-kernel network programmability. Then, the paper considers the case of pluginized protocols. Leveraging eBPF outside of the Linux kernel environment requires complementing the eBPF ISA to meet the pluginized protocols' requirements. This paper details these integration efforts. Based on the lessons learned from these, it finally concludes by an applicability discussion of the eBPF ISA to other use cases.",

Its capabilities include monitoring of cell level quality of service in real time and estimation of the schedulable region. The complexity and accuracy of real-time monitoring functionalities is investigated. To provide realistic traffic loads, distributed traffic generation systems both at the cell and call level have been implemented. In order to study the trade-off between the network transport and signalling system we have implemented a virtual path signalling capability. Our experiments show that the ability of a network to admit calls is limited by two distinct factors: the capacity of the network and the processing power of the signalling system. Depending on the bandwidth requirement of calls, the limit of one or the other will be first reached. This is a key observation, unique to broadband networks.",

We compare the two protocols based on implementation and analytical results. Practical aspects concerning: clock precision; computing time; and hard real-time constraints are also discussed. The results show that: (1) the original FIP protocol is fractionally more efficient with respect to its execution time than the modified one; (2) the modifications proposed, however, reduce the jitter and improve the robustness considerably; (3) the slot time of the original FIP protocol has theoretical upper bound but the modified protocol has no such limitations.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, network software has been structured in a monolithic fashion with all protocol stacks executing either within the kernel or in a single trusted user-level server. This organization is motivated by performance and security concerns. However, considerations of code maintenance, ease of debugging, customization, and the simultaneous existence of multiple protocols argue for separating the implementations into more manageable user-level libraries of protocols. This paper describes the design and implementation of transport protocols as user-level libraries.We begin by motivating the need for protocol implementations as user-level libraries and placing our approach in the context of previous work. We then describe our alternative to monolithic protocol organization, which has been implemented on Mach workstations connected not only to traditional Ethernet, but also to a more modern network, the DEC SRC ANI. Based on our experience, we discuss the implications for host-network interface design and for overall system structure to support efficient user-level implementations of network protocols.",

That is, allocating some buffers at the receive client site can smooth intra/inter asynchrony anomalies, which are the side effects of delay jitters. Additionally, the commencement of a multimedia presentation can be smoothly invoked after a pre-defined number of media units has been stored in each medium stream's buffer. To maintain synchronization qualities, video streams can adopt the non-blocking or the restricted blocking synchronization scheme, and audio streams can adopt the blocking synchronization scheme. In this paper, we derive mathematical relationships among associated parameters such that Quality Of Presentations (QOPs), i.e., intra-medium and inter-media asynchrony anomalies, for live continuous multimedia presentations can be analyzed. Using the mathematical analysis, trade-offs between QOPs and networking/system resources can be identified.",

    "abstract": "CCITT Draft Recommendation X.409 [1] defines a manner of encoding information for communication among computer systems. This scheme includes not only an encoding syntax--rules by which communicated bits and octets are assigned meaning--but also a language for describing the form and content of communicated information in a human-readable notation. In this notation one may define the form of a protocol data unit (PDU), specifying how the PDU is composed of individual fields of integer values, bit flags, characters, etc. One may also use the notation to define specific instances of PDUs: a PDU containing the integer value 3, the bit flag \"on\" and the character \"A\", for example. From the notational description of the PDU one may directly infer its encoded representation by applying the rules of the encoding syntax. As a language for documenting the encoding of standard protocols, the notation is intended primarily for human consumption. Being a formal language, however, it is also well suited to automated processing. This paper describes some software tools developed at BBN for processing the notation. The principle purpose of the tools is to permit rapid construction of PDU encoding and decoding software from notational descriptions of PDUs. The next section of this paper contains a brief overview of the X.409 notation and syntax for those not already familiar with the Draft Recommendation. The following section describes the tools and their method of operation. Some notes about the implementation and its performance complete the paper.",

    "abstract": "The increasingly familiar and ubiquitous Reference Model of Open Systems Interconnection, currently being considered by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as a Draft International Standard (DIS), is based on the explicit assumption that a \"connection\" -- an association between two or more communication entities, possessing certain characteristics over and above those possessed by the entities themselves - is required for the transfer of data in an Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) environment. Although the connection-oriented model of communications behavior has proven to be an extremely powerful concept, and has been applied successfully to the design and implementation of protocols and systems covering a wide range of applications, a growing body of research and experience suggests that a complementary concept - connectionless data transmission - is an essential part of the Open Systems Interconnection architecture, and should be embraced as such by the OSI Reference Model. This paper explores the concept of connectionless data transmission and its relationship to the more familiar concepts of connection-oriented data transfer, developing a rationale for the inclusion of the connectionless concept in the Reference Model as an integral part of the standard description of the OSI architecture.",

The algorithms proposed here require each virtual circuit's source to measure the round trip response times of its packets and to use these measurements to dynamically adjust its window. Our design philosophy is quasi-stationary: we first obtain, for a complete range of parameterized stationary conditions, the relation, called the “design equation”, that exists between the window and the mean response time in asymptotically optimal designs; the adaptation algorithm is simply an iterative algorithm for tracking the root of the design equation as conditions change in a non-stationary environment. A report is given of extensive simulations of networks with data rates of 45 Mbps and propagation delays of up to 47 msecs. The simulations generally confirm that the realizations of the adaptive algorithms give stable, efficient performance and are close to theoretical expectations when these exist.",

This paper presents several new results which represent important improvements to the above protocol derivation approach. First the language restriction to finite behaviors is removed by allowing for the definition of procedures which can be called recursively. Secondly, a new derivation algorithm has been developed which is much simpler than the previous one.

Misbehaving flows refer to flows that exceed their stipulated bandwidth limit. Through collaborative aggregate policing at both ingress and egress nodes, DCAP is able to quickly narrow the search to a candidate group that contains the misbehaving flows, and eventually identify the individual culprits. In comparison to per-flow policing, the amount of state maintained at an edge router is reduced from O ( n ) to O (√ n ), where n is the number of admitted flows. Simulation results show that DCAP can successfully detect a majority (64--83%) of the misbehaving flows with almost zero false alarms. Packet losses suffered by innocent flows due to undetected misbehaving activity are insignificant (0.02--0.9%). We also successfully build a prototype that demonstrates how DCAP can be deployed with minimal processing overhead in a soft-QoS architecture.",

In fact, the proposed schemes assume a wire-like medium, although this is not mentioned. New technologies, such as satellite links, or packet switching, present somewhat different characteristics, which are not taken into account in the present proposals for standardization. Since these technologies are on the verge of commercial applications, it seems desirable to investigate whether their specific requirements can be reasonably met by future standards. If it were not, then other standards would become necessary. On the other hand, it seems that procedures applicable to packet switching networks links are also satisfactory when used over wirelike links. Then it would make sense not to miss the opportunity to work out a single set of standards.

    "abstract": "ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review (CCR - www.sigcomm.org/ccr/) fills a unique niche in the spectrum of computer communications literature. It seeks to quickly publish articles containing high-quality research, especially new ideas and visions, in order to allow the community to react and comment. CCR is unique in that its reviewing process turn-over is less than 3 months, which guarantees a timely publication of high quality scientific articles. CCR is a quarterly publication of ACM SIGCOMM, with a broad readership of ACM SIGCOMM members. And indeed, CCR is neither a journal nor a magazine. It is referred to by ACM as a newsletter, which makes it difficult to rank among the multitude of publications whose quality is often not a function of the type of publication. CCR accepts two types of submissions: technical papers and editorial contributions. In broad terms, technical papers are carefully prepared presentations of technical material within the field, while editorial contributions are short, less formal presentations on topics of broad interest to the research community Technical papers published in CCR are subject to a rigorous reviewing process, with an acceptance rate of between 10-25% (median around 15%). Technical papers published in CCR are therefore more stringently reviewed than papers in technical magazines, such as IEEE Computer Networks and IEEE Communications. Furthermore, CCR is different from a magazine in that CCR does not publish tutorial papers; there is a requirement for novelty in order to meet CCR's publication standards. For example, CCR will not publish a paper that is simply a slightly expanded version of a previously published paper. ACM CCR also has important differences with traditional journals such as IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (ToN). CCR favors papers that propose new directions or visions; the focus of CCR is on novelty of ideas. However, while the innovation and timeliness of the content is key for the acceptance of a paper, technical robustness and readability receive high consideration in the review process. Another important difference between CCR and a journal like ToN is the review process used by CCR. While traditional journals have a long review cycle and submissions often go through several revision phases, the CCR review process is modeled like a high-quality ACM conference. Papers are submitted according to 4 pre-defined deadlines per year and each paper is either accepted or rejected. There are no conditional acceptances. Each paper is reviewed by at least three experts in the field and around 15% of submissions are accepted in each review cycle There are a number of other differences between CCR and journals such as ToN. CCR is also broader in scope than journals such as ToN. Further, it does not have an archiving purpose as authors of articles published in CCR retain their own copyright. Another significant difference between CCR and traditional journals is that accepted papers are published along with a public review written by the paper's assigned area editor. The public review provides insights (based on the reviews and possibly an independent third party comment) and motivation for accepting the paper -- for example, pointing out the contributions and interesting aspects of the paper, mentioning perceived shortcomings, identifying broader issues raised by the work, and so forth Over the years, papers published in ACM CCR have had significant impact in the field of Computer Networks and Communication. Many papers published in CCR have hundreds of citations. In fact, seminal CCR papers such as \"Congestion Avoidance and Control\" by Jacobson and Karels, \"Development of the DNS system\" by Mockapetris and Dunlap, and \"The Design Philosophy of the DARPA Internet Protocols\" by Clark are among the most cited papers in Computer Science with thousands of citations. In 2007, a CCR paper received the ACM SIGCOMM \"test-of-time\" award While there is no definitive ranking of publications that is specific to the field of computer networking, the review process and impact of CCR suggest that it should be ranked in the top category, comparable to venues such as IEEE Networks and IEEE Communications magazines and conferences such as IEEE INFOCOM. In the past three years according to the ISI Web of Knowledge, CCR's Impact Factor has increased sharply, and CCR's ranking has risen accordingly. Therefore, we believe that the current ISI ranks (64 out of 87) for the field \"Computer Science, Information Systems\" does not match the real impact of CCR content. On the other hand, the ISI Web of Knowledge considers CCR as a journal. We hope this note will help clarify the CCR situation, and we take this opportunity to thank all authors who submit their papers to CCR. This is with your help that we can make CCR an event better and more exciting publication.",

    "abstract": "Network management currently undergoes massive changes towards realizing more flexible management of complex networks. Recent efforts include slicing data plane resources by network (link) virtualization and applying operating system design principles to Software Defined Networking to rethink network management. Driven by network operators, network management principles are currently envisioned to be even further improved by virtualizing network (middlebox) functions. The resulting Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) paradigm abstracts network functions from dedicated hardware to virtual machines running on commodity hardware. This change in the design of carrier networks is inspired by the success of virtualization in the server market. By deploying NFV, network operators envision to achieve benefits similar to the server market and elastic cloud services, e.g., flexible and dynamic service provisioning, increased resource utilization, improved energy efficiency, and ultimately decreased operational costs. Despite these efforts, the ability of NFV to satisfy performance demands is often questioned. Tackling these challenges opens a set of research questions that felt short in the current discussion and are of particular relevance to the SIGCOMM community. In this position paper, we therefore provide an overview on the current state-of-the-art and open research questions.",

    "abstract": "Authoritative DNS servers are susceptible to being leveraged in denial of service attacks in which the attacker sends DNS queries while masquerading as a victim---and hence causing the DNS server to send the responses to the victim. This reflection off innocent DNS servers hides the attackers identity and often allows the attackers to amplify their traffic by employing small requests to elicit large responses. Several challenge-response techniques have been proposed to establish a requester's identity before sending a full answer. However, none of these are practical in that they do not work in the face of \"resolver pools\"---or groups of DNS resolvers that work in concert to lookup records in the DNS. In these cases a challenge transmitted to some resolver R 1 may be handled by a resolver R 2 , hence leaving an authoritative DNS server wondering whether R 2 is in fact another resolver in the pool or a victim. We offer a practical challenge-response mechanism that uses challenge chains to establish identity in the face of resolver pools. We illustrate that the practical cost of our scheme in terms of added delay is small.",

    "abstract": "With vast amount of content online, it is not surprising that unscrupulous entities \"borrow\" from the web to provide content for advertisements, link farms, and spam. Our insight is that cryptographic hashing and fingerprinting can efficiently identify content reuse for web-size corpora. We develop two related algorithms, one to automatically *discover* previously unknown duplicate content in the web, and the second to *precisely detect* copies of discovered or manually identified content. We show that *bad neighborhoods*, clusters of pages where copied content is frequent, help identify copying in the web. We verify our algorithm and its choices with controlled experiments over three web datasets: Common Crawl (2009/10), GeoCities (1990s–2000s), and a phishing corpus (2014). We show that our use of cryptographic hashing is much more precise than alternatives such as locality-sensitive hashing, avoiding the thousands of false-positives that would otherwise occur. We apply our approach in three systems: discovering and detecting duplicated content in the web, searching explicitly for copies of Wikipedia in the web, and detecting phishing sites in a web browser. We show that general copying in the web is often benign (for example, templates), but 6–11% are commercial or possibly commercial. Most copies of Wikipedia (86%) are commercialized (link farming or advertisements). For phishing, we focus on PayPal, detecting 59% of PayPal-phish even without taking on intentional cloaking.",

To add clarity to a range of vigorous policy debates, and in pursuit of actionable objectives, this year’s meeting used a different approach to structuring the agenda. Each attendee chose a specific policy goal or harm, and structured their presentation to answer three questions: (1) What data is needed to measure progress toward/away from this goal/harm? (2) What methods do you propose to gather such data? (3) Who are the right entities to gather such data, and how should such data be managed and shared? With a specific focus on measurement challenges, the topics we discussed included: analyzing the evolution of the Internet in a layered-platform context to gain new insights; measurement and analysis of economic impacts of new technologies using old tools; security and trustworthiness, reach (universal service) and reachability, sustainability of investment into Internet infrastructure, as well as infrastructure to measure the Internet.

In particular, due to the challenge of monitoring user interactions over all possible channels on OSN platforms, we focus on characterizing the adoption process that relies only on user-based invitation (which is applicable to most gifting applications). We characterize the adoptions by tracking the invitations sent by the existing users to their friends through the Facebook gifting application and the events when their friends install the application for the first time. We found that a small number of big cascades carry the adoption of most of the application users. Contrary to common beliefs, we did not observe special influential nodes that are responsible for the viral adoption of the application.",

We argue that future SDN platforms should support automatic transformation of policies by moving, merging, or splitting rules across multiple switches. This would simplify programming by allowing programs written on one abstract switch to run over a more complex network topology, and simplify analysis by consolidating a policy spread over multiple switches into a single list of rules. This poster presents our ongoing work on a sound and complete set of axioms for policy transformation, to enable rewriting of rules across multiple switches while preserving the forwarding policy. These axioms are invaluable for creating and analyzing algorithms for optimizing the rewriting of rules.",

In this study, we investigate the characteristics of RSS (e.g., how the RSS values change as time goes on and between consecutive positions?). On this basis, we design LuPI (Locating using Prior Information) that exploits the characteristics of RSS: with user motion, LuPI uses novel sensors integrated in smartphones to construct the RSS variation space (like radio map) of a floor plan as prior information. The deployment of LuPI is easy and rapid since little human intervention is needed. In LuPI, the calibration of ``radio map'' is crowd-sourced, automatic and scheduled.

The existing relationship inference algorithms are profoundly based on the valley-free rule and generalize their inference heuristics for both the IPv4 and IPv6 planes, introducing unavoidable inference artifacts. To discover and analyze the Type-of-Relationship (ToR) properties of the IPv6 topology we mine the BGP Communities attribute which provides an unexploited wealth of reliable relationship information. We obtain the actual relationships for 72% of the IPv6 AS links that are visible in the RouteViews and RIPE RIS repositories. Our results show that as many as 13% of AS links that serve both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic have different relationships depending on the IP version. Such relationships are characterized as hybrid. We observe that links with hybrid relationships are present in a large number of IPv6 AS paths. Furthermore, an unusually large portion of IPv6 AS paths violate the valley-free rule, indicating that the global reachability in the IPv6 Internet requires the relaxation of the valley-free rule. Our work highlights the importance of correctly inferring the AS relationships and the need to appreciate the distinct characteristics of IPv6 routing policies.",

    "abstract": "Most recent works demonstrate that grouping methodology could bring significant reduction of memory usage to decision-tree packet classification algorithms, with insignificant impact on throughput. However, these grouping techniques can hardly eliminate rule-replication completely. This work proposes a novel rule grouping algorithm without any replication. At each space decomposition step, all rules projecting on the split dimension form the maximum number of non-overlapped ranges, which guarantees the modest memory usage and grouping speed. Evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm achieves comparable memory size with less pre-processing time.",

This approach makes securely adding devices to a wireless network straightforward without compromising security or burdening the user, and maintaining backward compatibility with existing deployed standards and protocols. The demo deploys a MultiNet Access Point (AP) and a number of Wi-Fi enabled consumer devices to allow viewers to dynamically construct and deconstruct the network via the MultiNet controller currently implemented as an app on an Android phone (Figure 1).

While existing approaches handle routine traffic smoothly, ephemeral but intense hotspots cause excessive packet loss and severely degrade performance. This loss occurs even though the congestion is typically highly localized, with spare buffer capacity available at nearby switches. We argue that switches should share buffer capacity to effectively handle this spot congestion without the latency or monetary hit of deploying large buffers at individual switches. We present detour-induced buffer sharing (DIBS), a mechanism that achieves a near lossless network without requiring additional buffers. Using DIBS, a congested switch detours packets randomly to neighboring switches to avoid dropping the packets. We implement DIBS in hardware, on software routers in a testbed, and in simulation, and we demonstrate that it reduces the 99th percentile of query completion time by 85%, with very little impact on background traffic.",

In the new timed global state reachability analysis, the exploration is decided by the predicate, the time relationships, and/or the input event. Using the TCSM model and the timed verification scheme, an Estelle-based Timed Protocol Verification System (ETPVS) has been developed on SUN SPARC workstations.

The performance measure of the timed token MAC network is in terms of the maximum number of MPEG video streams being transmitted without any frame missing its deadline. This simulation study observed that by employing the Regulated Scheme, we could improve the performance by 28 to 40%. When applying the Grouping Scheme for the MPEG transmission, we can improve the performance between 142 and 149%. When we combined the two schemes together, the Regulated Grouping Scheme can further improve the performance up to 153% which is a dramatic improvement over the original transmission scheme.",

The development of high-quality standards for networking services, protocols, and interfaces has taken on a new urgency in the past few years with the rapid evolution of communication technologies and system architectures that are uniquely suited, both technically and economically, to the construction of distributed application environments. Unfortunately, despite the growing importance of these standards to a very large community of computer system builders and users, the standards-making process is not widely understood; it has a language of its own, and its metabolism is extremely confusing to those who are not actively involved. These reports are motivated by the belief that better standards - timelier, more relevant, and closer to the state of the art - will result from a more widely informed community of interest. Communication standards are produced by a large number of domestic and international organizations, most of which have meaningless, unpronounceable names that look like something out of the Dewey Decimal system. As a further complication, the organizations and their relationships to one another change as the standards-making process evolves. The most important telecommunications standards organization, the International Telephone and Telegraph Consultative Committee (CCITT), disbands its study groups every four years, holds a plenary meeting (the 8th CCITT Plenary Assembly was held on October 8-19, 1984), and creates new study groups for the next four-year period. The other major communications standards body, Technical Committee 97 of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), has just completed a major reorganization of its subcommittees, which particularly affects the groups working on Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) standards. This report contains a new ISO TC97 organization chart, which supercedes the corresponding chart in the first of these reports (CCR 13:1, January, 1983). A new CCITT organization chart will appear in the next issue of CCR. Summary descriptions of what some of the standards groups are doing, arranged by subject, begin below. Needless to say, there are many other standards activities that for reasons of limited space are not mentioned.",

We first focus on the difference between the time a packet finishes service in a scheduling algorithm and its virtual finish time under a GPS (General Processor Sharing) scheduler, called GPS- relative delay . We prove that, under a slightly restrictive but reasonable computational model, the lower bound computational complexity of any scheduling algorithm that guarantees O (1) GPS-relative delay bound is Ω ( log 2 n ) (widely believed as a \"folklore theorem\" but never proved). We also discover that, surprisingly, the complexity lower bound remains the same even if the delay bound is relaxed to O ( n a ) for 0‹ a ⋵1. This implies that the delay-complexity tradeoff curve is \"flat\" in the \"interval\" [ O (1), O ( n )). We later extend both complexity results (for O (1) or O ( n a ) delay) to a much stronger computational model. Finally, we show that the same complexity lower bounds are conditionally applicable to guaranteeing tight end-to-end delay bounds. This is done by untangling the relationship between the GPS-relative delay bound and the end-to-end delay bound.",

The recommendation contains in particular a specification of how to establish and clear virtual circuits through a given DTE-DCE interface. We comment in this paper on the following three aspects of these procedures for call establishment and clearing: (a) The recommendation contains state diagrams to clarify the operation of the DTE-DCE interface. The reader may assume that the diagrams show, at each instant in time, the unambiguous state of the interface. This is, however, not always true since the DTE and the DCE may be in different states. (b) We have analysed the operation of the interface using a finite state validation method, and have found that in some rare cases a conflicting situation (i.e. when the DTE and the DCE are in different states) may sustain through the repetitions of some cyclic behavior. (c) The procedures of X.25 are very symmetrical. However, the packet level call establishment procedure contains a non-symmetrical element for the handling of call collisions. We consider as alternatives some symmetrical procedures for this purpose. For each of these aspects we try to explain the problem and give some suggestions for its solution.",

    "abstract": "Interdomain routing is a massive distributed computing task that propagates topological information for global reachability. Today's interdomain routing protocol, BGP4, is exceedingly complex because the wide variety of goals that it must meet---including fast convergence, failure resilience, scalability, policy expression, and global reachability---are accomplished by mechanisms that have complicated interactions and unintended side effects. The complexity of wide-area routing configuration and protocol dynamics requires mechanisms for expressing wide-area routing that adhere to a set of logical rules. We propose a set of rules, called the routing logic , which can be used to determine whether a routing protocol satisfies various properties. We demonstrate how this logic can aid in analyzing the behavior of BGP4 under various configurations. We also speculate on how the logic can be used to analyze existing configuration in real-world networks, synthesize network-wide router configuration from a high-level policy language, and assist protocol designers in reasoning about new routing protocols.",

    "abstract": "Improving the performance of data transfers in the Internet (such as Web transfers) requires a detailed understanding of when and how delays are introduced. Unfortunately, the complexity of data transfers like those using HTTP is great enough that identifying the precise causes of delays is difficult. In this paper we describe a method for pinpointing where delays are introduced into applications like HTTP by using critical path analysis. By constructing and profiling the critical path, it is possible to determine what fraction of total transfer latency is due to packet propagation, network variation ( e.g. , queuing at touters or route fluctuation), packet losses, and delays at the server and at the client. We have implemented our technique in a tool called tcpeval that automates critical path analysis for Web transactions. We show that our analysis method is robust enough to analyze traces taken for two different TCP implementations (Linux and FreeBSD). To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we present the results of critical path analysis for a set of Web transactions taken over 14 days under a variety of server and network conditions. The results show that critical path analysis can shed considerable light on the causes of delays in Web transfers, and can expose subtleties in the behavior of the entire end-to-end system.",

Many network operators would like to carry circuit traffic as an overlay on top of an IP network. With higher bandwidths, faster routers, and Differentiated Services [RFC2474, RFC2475] features in routers, this is now possible. In this paper we describe a simple set of mechanisms that are sufficient to allow an IP cloud to carry circuit replacement traffic. Then, using the framework of [RFC3086] for describing a Per-Domain Behavior (PDB), we explain where these mechanisms should be deployed and quantify how they should be configured in order to construct the appropriate edge-to-edge behavior. This \"Virtual Wire\" (VW) PDB makes it possible to replace dedicated circuits with IP transport. In the process we attempt to lay to rest two pieces of QoS mythology: first that a Diffserv approach requires substantial over-provisioning compared to int-serv, and second that Diffserv quality of service is inherently loose and not quantitative.",

We demonstrate the case for the MDI framework by using MDI to analyze and interpret the behavior of two delay-based protocols over cellular channels: Verus and Copa. Our results show a successful approximation of throughput and delay characteristics of the protocols' model versions across variable network conditions.

The multiple radio access technology (multi-RAT) is proposed to satisfy mobile users’ increasing needs. The Information-Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm is better tuned (than the current Internet Protocol approach) to support multi-RAT communications. ICN eschews the connection-based content retrieval model used today and has desirable features such as data naming, in-network caching, and device mobility–a paradigm ripe for exploration. We propose DICE, an ICN forwarding strategy that helps a device dynamically select a subset of its multi-RAT interfaces for communication. DICE assesses the state of edge links and network congestion to determine the minimum number of interfaces required to perform data delivery. We perform simulations to compare DICE’s performance with bestroute2 and multicast strategies (part of the named data networking simulator, ndnSIM). We show that DICE is the best of both worlds: providing a higher delivery ratio (0.2–2 times) and much lower overhead (by 2–8 times) for different packet rates.",

Finding the right operating point and adapting to it can significantly improve performance and reduce costs. We introduce Rendezvous On a Ring (ROAR), a novel distributed algorithm that enables on-the-fly re-configuration of the partitioning level. ROAR can add and remove servers without stopping the system, cope with server failures, and provide good load-balancing even with a heterogeneous server pool.

The BER data conversion function has been viewed as the dominant communication cost, with a processing overhead many times greater than that of the other protocol-related functions combined. This paper demonstrates that if engineered to operate under certain favorable but realistic conditions, the BER conversion function runs much faster than what has been previously reported. In fact, a throughput comparable to a TCP/IP/ATM package (20 Mb/s) has been achieved in experiments.

At the California Institute of Technology, the Mosaic project has integrated such a node onto a single chip. That reduction in scale fundamentally changes the scope of node application, since nodes become both very small, and inexpensive.Mosaic nodes may be employed to process, to generate, or to receive data. Since the router in a Mosaic node is independent of the microprocessor, computation and routing take place simultaneously. These nodes may be used to create general purpose gigabit LANs. They may also be used to create special purpose gigabit networks to interconnect instrumentation within spacecraft or aircraft.The ATOMIC project at USC/ISI is using Mosaic nodes to prototype a gigabit LAN testbed. This testbed is operational. Networking and administration software provides full TCP/IP compatibility. Packets have been exchanged between two interfaces at a rate above one gigabit per second (Gb/s).An individual ATOMIC interface is both inexpensive and small, consisting of one Mosaic chip, four SRAM chips and clock logic. Two interfaces easily fit onto a postcard-sized circuit board. Their low cost makes it practical to include several interfaces within a host, providing an interior Gb/s distribution network, multiple access points to the LAN for greater performance or redundancy, and other capabilities that are not yet fully explored. The results reported in this paper represent actual data obtained from the prototype.",

    "abstract": "At the data-link layer, ATM offers a number of features, such as high-bandwidth and per-connection quality of service (QoS) guarantees, making it particularly attractive to multimedia applications. Unfortunately, many of these features are not visible to applications because of the inadequacies of existing higher-level protocol architectures. Although a considerable effort is underway to tune these protocols for ATM networks, we believe that a new ATM specific protocol stack is essential to effectively exploit all the benefits of ATM. In this paper we describe the semantics of such a protocol stack, and discuss its advantages over traditional protocol architectures from the perspective of distributed multimedia applications. The performance impact of the new protocol architecture is experimentally demonstrated on a video conferencing testbed built around IBM RS/6000s equipped with prototype hardware for video/audio processing, and connected via ATM links.",

The proposed scheme complies with both the new Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) and the current Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4), providing that, in the latter case, routers are set to manage priority. A new queuing algorithm, namely Priority Weighted Fair Queuing (PWFQ), is defined and evaluated. A scalable audio encoder is adopted to perform audio transmissions over an emulated network. Background traffic is emulated, employing a traffic generator that adopts a self-similar model. Objective and subjective quality tests are performed, using a set of musical excerpts. Quality is evaluated as a function of Internet traffic. In the paper it is shown that, by adopting an encoding technique with scalable bit-rate, and a prioritized transmission algorithm, a smooth degradation of quality may be obtained during network congestion periods. This technique shows better performance than feedback-based algorithms, in which the delayed responses cause the core stage packets to be lost in low-to-high traffic transitions and the enhancement packets not to be transmitted in high-to-low traffic transitions.",

    "abstract": "Recently, several proposals have been made for sharing congestion information across concurrent flows between end-systems. In these proposals, the granularity for sharing has ranged from all flows to a common host to all hosts on a shared LAN. While these proposals have been successful at ensuring sound AIMD behavior of the aggregate of flows, they suffer from what we term \"false sharing\". False sharing occurs when two or more flows sharing congestion state may, in fact, not share the same bottleneck.In this work, we investigate the effects of false sharing on shared congestion management schemes. We characterize the origins of false sharing into two distinct cases: (i) networks with QoS enhancements such as differentiated services, where a flow classifier segregates flows into different queues, and (ii) networks with path diversity where different flows to the same destination address are routed differently --- a situation that occurs in dispersity routing, load-balancing, and with network address translators (NATs). We evaluate the impact of false sharing on flow performance and consider whether it might cause a bottleneck link to become persistently overloaded. We propose schemes for detecting false sharing and show how different metrics (loss rate, delay distribution, and reordering) compare for this purpose. We also consider the issue of how a sender should respond when it detects false sharing.",

In this paper we identify important characteristics/metrics of routing tables and updates which provide the foundation of the proposed BGP workload model. Based on the insights of an extensive characterization of BGP traffic according to such metrics as prefix length distributions, fanout, amount of nesting of routing table prefixes, AS path length, number and times between BGP update bursts and number and times between BGP session resets, etc., we introduce our prototype tool, rtg. rtg realizes the workload model and is capable of generating realistic BGP traffic. Through its flexibility and parameterization rtg enables us to study the sensibilities of test systems in a repeatable and consistent manner while still providing the possibility of capturing the different characteristics from different vantage points in the network.",

    "abstract": "We consider unicast equation-based rate control, where a source estimates the loss event ratio $p$, and, primarily at loss events, adjusts its send rate to $f(p)$. Function $f$ is assumed to represent the loss-throughput relation that TCP would experience. When no loss occurs, the rate may also be increased according to some additional mechanism. We assume that the loss event interval estimator is non-biased. If the loss process is deterministic, the control is TCP-friendly in the long-run, i.e, the average throughput does not exceed that of TCP. If, in contrast, losses are random, it is a priori not clear whether this holds, due to the non-linearity of $f$, and a phenomenon similar to Feller's paradox. Our goal is to identify the key factors that drive whether, and how far, the control is TCP friendly (in the long run). As TCP and our source may experience different loss event intervals, we distinguish between TCP-friendliness and conservativeness (throughput does not exceed $f(p)$). We give a representation of the long term throughput, and derive that conservativeness is primarily influenced by various convexity properties of $f$, the variability of loss events, and the correlation structure of the loss process. In many cases, these factors lead to conservativeness, but we show reasonable experiments where the control is clearly non-conservative. However, our analysis also suggests that our source should experience a higher loss event ratio than TCP, which would make non-TCP friendliness less likely. Our findings provide guidelines that help understand when an equation base control is indeed TCP-friendly in the long-run, and in some cases, excessively so. The effects of round trip time and its variations are not included in this study.",

These tools dynamically generate circuits for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). A library of hardware-accelerated modules has been developed that processes Internet Protocol (IP) packets, performs header rule matching, scans pocket payloads, and implements per-flow queueing. Other functions can be added to the library as extensible modules.An integration tool was developed to enable a network administrator to specify how a customized system should examine, drop, buffer, and/or modify packets. This tool joins together modules from the library to create a composite circuit that performs multiple functions. The tool allows additional modules to be quickly added to the library and integrated into systems. The integration tool has been used to create circuits that perform Internet firewall, network intrusion detection, network intrusion prevention, and Denial of Service (DoS) attack protection functions.A test tool was developed to automatically verify that circuits created by the integration tool run properly in reconfigurable hardware. Circuits created by the integration tool are deployed into a Field-programmable Port Extender (FPX) platform. As new modules were added to the library, the test tool reconfigured the logic on the FPX, injected traffic, and monitored the resulting packets.By using hardware, not software, networking system can process millions of packets per second. Together, the integration and test tools simplify the otherwise difficult task of developing reconfigurable hardware for networking systems and testing them at Gigabit per second rates.",

    "abstract": "The Applications and Services in the Year 2021 workshop was successfully organized on January 27--28, 2016 in Washington DC through funding support from the National Science Foundation (NSF). The goal of the workshop was to foster discussions that bring together applications researchers in multidisciplinary areas, and developers/operators of research infrastructures at both national, regional, university and city levels. Discussions were organized to identify grand challenge applications and obtain the community voice and consensus on the key issues relating to applications and services that might be delivered by advanced infrastructures in the decade beginning in 2020. The timing and organization for the workshop is significant because today's digital infrastructure is undergoing deep technological changes and new paradigms are rapidly taking shape in both the core and edge domains that pose fundamental challenges. The key outcomes of the discussions were targeted to enhance the quality of peoples' lives while addressing important national priorities, leveraging today's cutting edge applications such as the Internet of Things, Big Data Analytics, Robotics, The Industrial Internet, and Immersive Virtual/Augmented Reality. This report summarizes the workshop efforts to bring together diverse groups for delivering targeted short/long talks, sharing latest advances, and identifying gaps that exist in the community for 'research' and 'infrastructure' needs that require future NSF funding.",

The COSMOS wireless reasearch testbed is being deployed in West Harlem (New York City) as part of the NSF Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) program. COSMOS' approach for K-12 education is twofold: (i) create an innovative and concrete set of methods/tools that allow teaching STEM subjects using live experiments related to wireless networks/IoT/cloud, and (ii) enhance the professional development (PD) of K-12 teachers and collaborate with them to create hands-on educational material for the students. The COSMOS team has already conducted successful pilot summer programs for middle and high school STEM teachers, where the team worked with the teachers and jointly developed innovative real-world experiments that were organized as automated and repeatable math, science, and computer science labs to be used in the classroom. The labs run on the COSMOS Educational Toolkit, a hardware and software system that offers a large variety of pre-orchestrated K-12 educational labs. The software executes and manages the experiments in the same operational philosophy as the COSMOS testbed. Specifically, since it is designed for use by non-technical middle and high school teachers/students, it adds easy-to-use enhancements to the experiments' execution and the results visualization. The labs are also supported by Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)-compliant teacher/student material. This paper describes the teachers' PD program, the NGSS lessons created and the hardware and software system developed to support the initiative. Additionally, it provides an evaluation of the PD approach as well as the expected impact to K-12 STEM education. Current limitations and future work are also included as part of the discussion section.",

    "abstract": "Ethernet is pervasive. This is due in part to its ease of use. Equipment can be added to an Ethernet network with little or no manual configuration. Furthermore, Ethernet is self-healing in the event of equipment failure or removal. However, there are scenarios where a local event can lead to network-wide packet loss and duplication due to slow or faulty reconfiguration of the spanning tree. Moreover, in some cases the packet loss and duplication may persist indefinitely. To address these problems, we introduce the EtherFuse, a new device that can be inserted into an existing Ethernet to speed the reconfiguration of the spanning tree and suppress packet duplication. EtherFuse is backward compatible and requires no change to the existing hardware, software, or protocols. We describe a prototype EtherFuse implementation and experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness. Specifically, we characterize how quickly it responds to network failures, its ability to reduce packet loss and duplication, and its benefits on the end-to-end performance of common applications.",

Many of the fundamental, long-term improvements to the architecture, security, end-to-end protocols and management of the Internet originate in the related academic research communities. Even shorter-term, more commercially driven extensions are oftentimes derived from academic research. When interoperability is required, the IETF standardizes such new technology. Timely and relevant standardization benefits from continuous input and review from the academic research community. For an individual researcher, it can however by quite puzzling how to begin to most effectively participate in the IETF and - arguably to a much lesser degree - in the IRTF. The interactions in the IETF are much different than those in academic conferences, and effective participation follows different rules. The goal of this document is to highlight such differences and provide a rough guideline that will hopefully enable researchers new to the IETF to become successful contributors more quickly.",

In-network caching has been paid much attention, but there is still no consensus on its usage, due to its non-negligible costs. Meanwhile, massive storage and bandwidth resources of end systems still remain underutilized. To this end, we present an End System Caching and Cooperation scheme in CCN, called ESCC to realize content distribution of CCN, without using costly in-network caching. ESCC enables fast content distribution through clients caching and sharing contents with each other. Experiments show that ESCC can achieve better performance than the universal caching. It is also quite simple, efficient, robust and has low overhead. ESCC could be a candidate substitute for the costly and unnecessary universal caching.",

Tracking changes in the DNS over time provides valuable information about the evolution of the Internet's infrastructure. Until now, only one large-scale approach to perform these kinds of measurements existed, passive DNS (pDNS). While pDNS is useful for applications like tracing security incidents, it does not provide sufficient information to reliably track DNS changes over time. We use a complementary approach based on active measurements, which provides a unique, comprehensive dataset on the evolution of DNS over time. Our high-performance infrastructure performs Internet-scale active measurements, currently querying over 50% of the DNS name space on a daily basis. Our infrastructure is designed from the ground up to enable big data analysis approaches on, e.g., a Hadoop cluster. With this novel approach we aim for a quantum leap in DNS-based measurement and analysis of the Internet.",

In this paper, we propose a topology-aware name-based routing protocol which combines the benefits of location-oriented routing and content-centric routing together. We adopt a URL-like naming scheme, which defines register locations and content identifier. Node with copies sends Register messages towards a register using location-oriented routing protocols. All en-path routers record forwarding entries in forwarding table (FIB) as the \"bread crumb\" to this content. Following the bread crumb, routers know the \"best\" topology path to the available copies. An Interest is either forwarded towards a \"known\" copy by the content identifier, or towards the register nodes where it would find the bread crumb to the \"best\" copies. Compared with the existing flooding or name resolution methods, Our design shows a good potential in terms of scalability, availability and overhead.",

During the second phase, MMPTCP runs in Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP) mode, which has been shown to be very efficient for long flows.

Jumping out of TCP lineage's architectural deficiency, we propose Performance-oriented Congestion Control (PCC), a new congestion control architecture in which each sender controls its sending strategy based on empirically observed performance metrics.

    "abstract": "In SDN, the underlying infrastructure is usually abstracted for applications that can treat the network as a logical or virtual entity. Commonly, the ``mappings\" between virtual abstractions and their actual physical implementations are not one-to-one, e.g., a single \"big switch\" abstract object might be implemented using a distributed set of physical devices. A key question is, what abstractions could be mapped to multiple physical elements while faithfully preserving their native semantics? E.g., can an application developer always expect her abstract \"big switch\" to act exactly as a physical big switch, despite being implemented using multiple physical switches in reality? We show that the answer to that question is \"no\" for existing virtual-to-physical mapping techniques: behavior can differ between the virtual \"big switch\" and the physical network, providing incorrect application-level behavior. We also show that that those incorrect behaviors occur despite the fact that the most pervasive and commonly-used correctness invariants, such as per-packet consistency, are preserved throughout. These examples demonstrate that for practical notions of correctness, new systems and a new analytical framework are needed. We take the first steps by defining end-to-end correctness , a correctness condition that focuses on applications only, and outline a research vision to obtain virtualization systems with correct virtual to physical mappings.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of portable devices and online social networks (OSNs) has changed the traditional video consumption paradigm by simultaneously providing multi-screen video watching, social networking engagement, etc. One challenge is to design a unified solution to support ever-growing features while guarantee system performance. In this demo, we design and implement a multi-screen technology to provide multi-screen interactions over wide area network (WAN). Furthermore, we incorporate face-detection technology into our system to identify users' bio-features and employ a machine learning based traffic scheduling mechanism to improve the system performance.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the design, implementation, and validation of a novel system that supports streaming and playout of personalized, multi-path, nonlinear video. In contrast to regular video, in which the file content is played sequentially, our design allows multiple nonlinear video sequences of the underlying (linear) video to be stitched together and played in any personalized order, and clients can be provided multiple path choices. The design combines the ideas of HTTP-based adaptive streaming (HAS) and multi-path nonlinear video. Personalization of the content is achieved with the use of a customized metafile, which is downloaded separately from the underlying media and the manifest file that defines the HAS structure. An extension to the user interface allows path choices to be presented to and made by the user. Novel buffer management and prefetching policies are used to ensure seamless uninterrupted playback regardless of client path choices, even under scenarios in which clients defer their choices until the last possible moment. Our solution allows creative home users to easily create their own multi-path nonlinear video, opening the door to an endless possibility of new opportunities and media forms.",

    "abstract": "Computing the shortest-path distances between nodes is a key problem in analyzing social graphs. Traditional methods like breadth-first search (BFS) do not scale well with graph size. Recently, a Graph Coordinate System, called Orion, has been proposed to estimate shortest-path distances in a scalable way. Orion uses a landmark-based approach, which does not take account of the shortest-path distances between non-landmark nodes in coordinate calculation. Such biased input for the coordinate system cannot characterize the graph structure well. In this paper, we propose Pomelo, which calculates the graph coordinates in a decentralized manner. Every node in Pomelo computes its shortest-path distances to both nearby neighbors and some random distant neighbors. By introducing the novel partial BFS, the computational overhead of Pomelo is tunable. Our experimental results from different representative social graphs show that Pomelo greatly outperforms Orion in estimation accuracy while maintaining the same computational overhead.",

These applications have very stringent service level agreements (SLAs) which place tight constraints on the performance of the underlying geo-distributed datastores. Deploying these systems in the cloud to meet such constraints is a challenging task, as application architects have to strike an optimal balance among different contrasting objectives such as maintaining consistency between multiple replicas, minimizing access latency and ensuring high availability. Achieving these objectives requires carefully configuring a number of low-level parameters of the datastores, such as the number of replicas, which DCs contain which data, and the underlying consistency protocol parameters. In this work, we adopt a systematic approach where we develop analytical models that capture the performance of a datastore based on application workload and build a system that can automatically configure the datastore for optimal performance.",

The first workshop emphasized discussion of existing hardware and software platforms for macroscopic measurement and mapping of Internet properties, in particular those related to cybersecurity. The second workshop included more performance evaluation and data-sharing approaches.

Network virtualization technologies enable a flexible environment for educators, researchers, and operators to create functional models of current, planned, or theoretical networks. This demonstration will show VIRL --- the Virtual Internet Routing Lab --- a platform that can be used for network change validation, training, education, research, or network-aware applications development. The platform combines network virtualization technologies with virtual machines (VMs) running open-source and commercial operating systems; VM orchestration capabilities; a context-aware configuration engine; and an extensible data-collection framework.

    "abstract": "Designing scalable and cost-effective data center interconnect architectures based on electrical packet switches is challenging. To overcome this challenge, researchers have tried to harness the advantages of optics in data center environment. This has resulted in exploration of hybrid switching architectures that contains an optical circuit switch to serve long bursts of traffic along with an electrical packet switch serving short bursts of traffic. The performance of such hybrid switching architectures in data center is dependent on the schedulers. Building hybrid schedulers is challenging because of varying properties of data center traffic, increasing network demands, requirements imposed by hybrid network architecture etc. Slow schedulers can negatively impact the performance of the data center network because of poor resource utilization. With future demands, this problem is going to escalate motivating the need for faster schedulers. One approach to do this would be to use a hardware based scheduler. In this paper we propose a framework that can be used to explore and evaluate hardware based hybrid schedulers.",

Experimenters can easily assess to a huge pool of human subjects through crowdsourcing platforms. The workers are usually anonymous, and they participate in the experiments independently. Therefore, a fundamental problem threatening the integrity of these platforms is to detect various types of cheating from the workers. In this poster, we propose cheat-detection mechanism based on an analysis of the workers' mouse cursor trajectories. It provides a jQuery-based library to record browser events. We compute a set of metrics from the cursor traces to identify cheaters. We deploy our mechanism to the survey pages for our video quality assessment tasks published on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our results show that cheaters' cursor movement is usually more direct and contains less pauses.",

The Paxos algorithm has long dominated this domain, although it has been recently challenged by algorithms such as Raft and Viewstamped Replication Revisited. These algorithms rely on Paxos's original assumptions, unfortunately these assumptions are now at odds with the reality of the modern internet. Our insight is that current consensus algorithms have significant availability issues when deployed outside the well defined context of the datacenter. To illustrate this problem, we developed Coracle, a tool for evaluating distributed consensus algorithms in settings that more accurately represent realistic deployments. We have used Coracle to test two examples of network configurations that contradict the liveness claims of the Raft algorithm. Through the process of exercising these algorithms under more realistic assumptions, we demonstrate wider availability issues faced by consensus algorithms when deployed on real world networks.",

By directly comparing the resulting system to the well-known DECbit scheme which uses a window to adapt the load it is shown that most of the limitations of this scheme can be eliminated while preserving its advantages. More specific, because of the direct adaption of a rate fairness can be guaranteed in general topologies. This is possible without the need to put the burden of enforcing fairness on the (in a high-speed network already heavily loaded) routers. Finally the system can better adapt to varying packet-sizes, thus offering greater robustness and efficiency when used in real networks.",

    "abstract": "Data copying and checksumming are the most expensive operations when doing high-bandwidth network IO over a high-speed network. Under some conditions, outboard buffering and checksumming can eliminate accesses to the data, thus making communication less expensive and faster. One of the scenarios in which outboard buffering pays off is the common case of applications accessing the network using the Berkeley sockets interface and the Internet protocol stack. In this paper we describe the changes that were made to a BSD protocol stack to make use of a network adaptor that supports outboard buffering and checksumming. Our goal is not only to achieve \"single copy\" communication for application that use sockets, but to also have efficient communication for in-kernel applications and for applications using other networks. Performance measurements show that for large reads and writes the single-copy path through the stack is significantly more efficient than the original implementation.",

We assume that a stream of acknowledgements carries information about the state of a bottleneck queue back to the source, which adapts its transmission rate according to any monotone function of that state. We show stability for this class of schemes, in that their rate of transmission and queue length rapidly converge to a small neighborhood of the designed operating point.

The introduction of X.400 MHS based systems and services is slowly modifying the general attitude towards EDI communications. For the first time, a CCITT rapporteur group is drafting a recommendation for EDI communications within the context of X.400 MHS. More importantly, there already exist official guidelines, both in the U.S.A. and in Europe, which explain how to take advantage of X.400 MHS systems today.The purpose of this paper is to comment upon these first approaches to an EDI communication standard.

Communication channels are assumed to lose, duplicate and reorder messages in transit. The destination's data needs are represented by a receive window whose size can vary with time. The destination entity uses acknowledgement messages to inform the source entity of the current receive window size and the sequence number of the data word next expected. The source entity responds by sending segments of data words that lie within the allowed window. Each data segment is accompanied by an identifying sequence number and the size of the data segment. The destination entity also uses selective acknowledgement and selective reject messages to inform the source entity of the reception or lack of reception, respectively, of out-of-sequence data segments. Thus, this protocol is a proper extension of the Arpanet's TCP. We have obtained the minimum value of N that ensures correct data transfer and flow control, in terms of the minimum message transmission time, the maximum message lifetime, and the maximum receive window size. The protocol imposes no constraints on the retransmissions of messages or on the data segment sizes; thus, any retransmission policy that optimizes the protocol's performance can be used.",

In addition, this TCP is designed to exploit the availability of the large main storage and processor speed available on the IBM/370. TCP/IP is generally considered to be a mature protocol specification; however, in the course of our implementation we found several parts to be either ambiguous or problematic — in particular, error handling and notification, ICMP and its relationship to other protocols, and synchronization of data flow with TCP callers.

The basic architecture models are presented, the file transfer protocol is described and the implementation in the HMINET is shown with the functional capabilities and the command structure. A transfer of files between different computer system can be regarded as a service, which is divided into four steps: A: access to a file, which is administrated in a File Management System (FMS), residing on one computer system B: transfer the file data by any transport medium C: creation of a file copy in another EMS D: additional operations on the transferred file, e.g. print out or conversion The usual case of file transfer (FT) between different computer systems is an offline transport by means of any storage medium (disks, tapes, etc.). Some disadvantages arise by this method: - offline transfer takes a long time - incompatibility of peripheral devices, storage medium and dat a representation can make file transfer impossible or lead to an additional overhead - for step A and C the user must be familiar with the control languages of every participated operating and file management system - additional operations on the transferred file must be organised under the system control of the destination host A lot of advantages offers a File Transfer Service, integrated in a network, which links together the above mentioned computer systems (hosts): - with a reliable transport system in the network a fast online transfer of the file data can satisfy step B - step A and C are controlled by the File Transfer Service with only one standard interface to the user - additional operations on the copied file can he managed during the transfer of the data (conversion of file structure, file dat a and subsequent operations e.g. print) - peripheral device support by involved operating and file management system under File Transfer Service control The HMINET is a private star-shaped, heterogeneous network, which connects 22 process control computers and 3 mainframes. One basic function in that computer network is such a file transfer service. Typical applications of this service are: Copy of data files from and to mainframes and process control computers Transfer of programms and runable modules Remote Job Entry and remote spool services, etc.",

We explore the viability of employing retransmission timeouts in NACK-based (i.e., rate-based) streaming applications to support multiple retransmission attempts per lost packet. The first part of our simulation is based on trace data collected during a number of real-time streaming tests between dialup clients in all 50 states in the U.S. (including 653 major U.S. cities) and a backbone video server. The second part of the study is based on streaming tests over DSL and ISDN access links. First, we define a generic performance measure for assessing the accuracy of hypothetical RTO estimators based on the samples of the round-trip delay (RTT) recorded in the trace data. Second, using this performance measure, we evaluate the class of TCP-like estimators and find the optimal estimator given our performance measure. Third, we introduce a new class of estimators based on delay jitter and show that they significantly outperform TCP-like estimators in NACK-based applications with low-frequency RTT sampling. Finally, we show that high-frequency sampling of the RTT completely changes the situation and makes the class of TCP-like estimators as accurate as the class of delay-jitter estimators.",

    "abstract": "The Web is a distributed system, where data is stored and disseminated from both origin servers and caches . Origin servers provide the most up-to-date copy whereas caches store and serve copies that had been cached for a while. Origin servers do not maintain per-client state, and weak-consistency of cached copies is maintained by the origin server attaching to each copy an expiration time. Typically, the lifetime-duration of an object is fixed, and as a result, a copy fetched directly from its origin server has maximum time-to-live (TTL) whereas a copy obtained through a cache has a shorter TTL since its age (elapsed time since fetched from the origin) is deducted from its lifetime duration. Thus, a cache that is served from a cache would incur a higher miss-rate than a cache served from origin servers. Similarly, a high-level cache would receive more requests from the same client population than an origin server would have received. As Web caches are often served from other caches (e.g., proxy and reverse-proxy caches), age emerges as a performance factor. Guided by a formal model and analysis, we use different inter-request time distributions and trace-based simulations to explore the effect of age for different cache settings and configurations. We also evaluate the effectiveness of frequent pre-term refreshes by higher-level caches as a means to decrease client misses. Beyond Web content distribution, our conclusions generally apply to systems of caches deploying expiration-based consistency.",

    "abstract": "Software Operations and Management (O&amp;M) i.e., installing, configuring, and updating thousands of software components within a conventional Data Center is a well-understood issue. Existing frameworks such as the Rocks toolkit have revolutionized the way system administrators deploy and manage large-scale compute clusters, storage servers, and visualization facilities. However, existing tools like Rocks are designed for a \"friendly\" Data Center environment where stable power along with high-performance compute, storage, and networking is the norm. In contrast, sensor networks are embedded deeply within the harsh physical environment where node failures, node mobility and idiosyncrasies of wireless networks are the norm. In addition, device heterogeneity and resource-constrained nature (e.g., power, memory, CPU capability) of the sensor cyberinfrastructure (CI) are realities that must be addressed and reconciled. Although sensor CI must be more adaptable and more-rapidly reconfigurable than the data center equivalents, few if any of the existing software O&amp;M tools and techniques have been adapted to the significantly more challenging environment of sensor networks. A more automated approach to software O&amp;M would provide significant benefits to system builders, operators, and sensor network researchers. We argue that by starting with software O&amp;M techniques developed for data centers, and then adapting and extending them to the world of resource-constrained sensor networks, we will be able to provide robust and scientifically reproducible mechanisms for defining the software footprint of individual sensors and networks of sensors. This paper describes the current golden-image based software O&amp;M practice in Android world. We then propose an approach that adapts the Rocks toolkit to allow one to rapidly and reliably build complete Android environments (firmware flashes) at the individual sensor level and extend to a large networks of diverse sensors.",

    "abstract": "The IPv4 address space is quickly getting exhausted, putting a tremendous pressure on the adoption of even more NAT levels or IPv6. On the other hand, many authors propose the adoption of new Internet addressing capabilities, namely content-based addressing, to complement the existing IP host-based addressing. In this paper we propose the introduction of a location layer, between transport and network layers, to address both problems. We keep the existing IPv4 (or IPv6) host-based core routing functionalities, while we enable hosts to become routers between separate address spaces by exploring the new location header. For a proof of concept, we modified the TCP/IP stack of a Linux host to handle our new protocol layer and we designed and conceived a novel NAT box to enable current hosts to interact with the modified stack.",

    "abstract": "There are so many initiatives to look at the Internet's Future http://www.future-internet.eu/, http://www.nets-find.net/ and similar programs in pretty every any other geo-political arena, anyone would think that there was some tremendous threat like global warming, about to bring about its immediate demise, and that this would bring civilisation crashing down around our ears. The Internet has a great future behind it, of course. However, my thesis is that the Future Internet is about as relevant as Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW), in the way it is being used to support various inappropriate activities. Remember that the start of all this was not the exhaustion of IPv4 address space, or the incredibly slow convergence time of BGP routes, or the problem of scaling router memory for FIBs. It was the US research community reacting to a minor (as in parochial) temporary problem of funding in Communications due to slow down within NSF and differing agendas within DARPA. It is not necessary to invoke all the hype and hysteria - it is both necessary and sufficient to talk about sustainable energy See for example David Mackay's Without Hot Air book, at http://www.withouthotair.com/, and good technical communications research, development, deployment and operations. To continue the analogy between FI and AGW, what we really do not need is yet more climatologists with dodgy data curation methodologies (or ethnographers studying Internet governance). What we do need is some solid engineering, to address a number of problems the Internet has. However, this is in fact happening, and would not stop happening if the entire Future Internet flagship was kidnapped by aliens. \"We don't need no\" government agency doing top down dictats about what to do when. It won't work and it will be a massive waste of time, energy and other resources - i.e. like AGW, it will be a load of hot air:) On the other hand, there are a number of deeper lessons from the Internet Architecture which might prove useful in other domains, and in the bulk of this opinion piece, I give examples of these, applying the Postel and End-to-end principles to transport, energy, government information/vices.",

    "abstract": "As live streaming networks grow in scale and complexity, they are becoming increasingly difficult to evaluate. Existing evaluation methods including lab/testbed testing, simulation, and theoretical modeling, lack either scale or realism. The industrial practice of gradually-rolling-out in a testing channel is lacking in controllability and protection when experimental algorithms fail, due to its passive approach. In this paper, we design a novel system called ShadowStream that introduces evaluation as a built-in capability in production Internet live streaming networks. ShadowStream introduces a simple, novel, transparent embedding of experimental live streaming algorithms to achieve safe evaluations of the algorithms during large-scale, real production live streaming, despite the possibility of large performance failures of the tested algorithms. ShadowStream also introduces transparent, scalable, distributed experiment orchestration to resolve the mismatch between desired viewer behaviors and actual production viewer behaviors, achieving experimental scenario controllability. We implement ShadowStream based on a major Internet live streaming network, build additional evaluation tools such as deterministic replay, and demonstrate the benefits of ShadowStream through extensive evaluations.",

The networking community has appreciated the value of large scale test labs to explore complex network interactions, as seen in projects such as PlanetLab, GENI, DETER, Emulab, and SecSI. Virtualization has enabled the creation of many more such labs. However, one problem remains: it is time consuming, tedious and error prone to setup and configure large scale test networks. Separate devices need to be configured in a coordinated way, even in a virtual lab. AutoNetkit, an open source tool, uses abstractions and defaults to achieve both configuration and deployment and create such large-scale virtual labs. This allows researchers and operators to explore new protocols, create complex models of networks and predict consequences of configuration changes. However, our abstractions could also allow the discussion of the broader configuration management problem. Abstractions that currently configure networks in a test lab can, in the future, be employed in configuration management tools for real networks.",

Determining a tree in an arbitrary mesh network which satisfies the bandwidth constraints and minimizes the cost of reserved bandwidth is a NP-hard problem. In this paper, we look at some heuristics that can be used to solve the problem of routing these multi-point connections. The heuristics are based on finding the capacity-constrained minimum cost tree which minimizes the cost of bandwidth reserved for point-to-point communication from destinations to the source, and weights are assigned to minimize the number of extra nodes in the tree which increase the cost of bandwidth reserved from the source to the destination. A theoretical bound on the performance of some of the heuristics, as well as simulation results comparing their performance to that of the optimum solution are presented. The results are encouraging, the heuristics find a tree with a cost within 2% of the optimum on the average, and with a cost within 10% of the optimum in those cases when the heuristic fails to find the optimum tree.",

The performance effects of processor saturation, buffer management strategy, allocation of functions between host and front-end, and hardware-software interactions due to special hardware attributes can, in principle, be predicted at the design stage by analytic performance models. The paper describes the process of construction of such a model for the data transfer stage of a simple transport protocol resembling an OSI class 4 protocol, including queueing for critical sections which protect the buffer pools and connection state information. The model is part of a computer-aided design process for communications systems, currently under development.",

The CCITT, DARPA/DoD, and ISO/ECMA internetworking models, which have become widely accepted for doing this, do not address the pragmatic problem of interconnecting computer networks that are based upon closed-system, vendor-proprietary network architectures. This paper presents an approach for interconnecting private data networks that are based upon IBM's System Network Architecture (SNA) and Xerox's Network System (XNS). Paramount to the solution of the SNA/XNS network interconnection problem is the identification and definition of a number of gateway-provided data transport and application protocol support services, which can be incorporated into a multi-function, multi-level, protocol translation gateway.",

(Two machines are used to model the protocol itself, while the other two are used to model its interface to the upper data link protocol in the protocol hierarchy.) We outline a methodology to verify communication boundedness and progress for each protocol model. The methodology is based on three techniques that were proposed earlier to verify networks of communicating finite state machines; they are network decomposition, machine equivalence, and closed covers.",

Existing designs for providing IP-anycast must either globally distribute routes to individual anycast groups, or confine each anycast group to a pre-configured topological region. The first approach does not scale because of excessive growth in the routing tables, whereas the second one severely limits the utility of the service. Our design scales by dividing inter-domain anycast routing into two components. The first component builds inexpensive default anycast routes that consume no bandwidth or storage space. The second component, controlled by the edge domains, generates enhanced anycast routes that are customized according to the beneficiary domain's interests. We evaluate the performance of our design using simulation, and prove its practicality by implementing it in the Multi-threaded Routing Toolkit.",

The goal of wide area infrastructure is to provision these resources to enable applications within a community. The end-to-end principles provide a scalable approach to the architecture of the shared services on which these applications depend. As a prime example, IP and the Internet resulted from the application of these principles to bandwidth resources. A similar application to storage resources produced the Internet Backplane Protocol and Logistical Networking, which implements a scalable approach to wide area network storage. In this paper, we discuss the use of this paradigm for the design of a scalable service for wide area computation, or programmable networking. While it has usually been assumed that providing computational services in the network will violate the end-to-end principles, we show that this assumption does not hold. We illustrate the point by describing Logistical Network Computing, an extension to Logistical Networking that supports limited computation at intermediate nodes.",

    "abstract": "The paper provides an overview of the current available data sets for AS level topology and examines the usefulness and intuition of many and most widely used metrics used for graph analysis, and highlight some less known metrics. The paper makes two practical contributions.First, the paper highlights an important issue: all source of AS information are not the same. The paper utilizes three sources of information BGP tables, traceroute-based and archived information (WHOIS/IRR). The observed topo-logical properties are fairly different. A potential explanation could be that none of the sources captures the whole AS graph. Thus, the measurement community has more work to do to obtain a complete topology.Second, the paper critically analyzes the importance of the different topology metrics. The last six years have seen a proliferation of new metrics that are used in a selective fashion from researchers. This is one of the first thorough studies of most known metrics and on top of that many metrics that are used in related fields that also study networks (e.g. physics).In conclusion, this paper could become a reference point for making the analysis of the AS topology more systematic both in terms of making researchers: (a) aware of the differences among the datasets, and (b) careful in selecting metrics.",

We define a default ATM virtual channel identifier (VCI) to be used for transmitting IP packets over ATM links. We then define mechanisms which allow specific flows to be transmitted on specific ATM VCIs. The resulting system obeys IP's semantics for routing and forwarding, and takes advantage of ATM's switching hardware to accelerate the forwarding of packets. While this system takes advantage of ATM hardware, the ATM signalling, routing, and management architecture (as specified by the ATM Forum) is replaced by the protocols and practices currently in use for IP routing and management.",

We then analyze which operating systems are responsible for these updates by using three levels of signature techniques and find that over 97% of updates come from Windows systems. While newer versions of Windows OSes are more stringent in sending private DNS updates, we did not observe an overall decreasing trend due to this evolution. Users, software vendors, and system administrators can take steps to reduce this RFC1918 traffic. However, since most end users are unlikely to interfere with vendor default settings, it should be the responsibility of software vendor and system administrators to take positive action to fix this problem.",

    "abstract": "Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) is a fluid scheduling policy providing perfect fairness. The minimum deviation (lead/lag) with respect to the GPS service achievable by a packet scheduler is one packet size. To the best of our knowledge, the only packet scheduler guaranteeing such minimum deviation is Worst-case Fair Weighted Fair Queueing (WF 2 Q), that requires on-line GPS simulation. Existing algorithms to perform GPS simulation have O ( N ) complexity per packet transmission ( N being the number of competing flows). Hence WF 2 Q has been charged for O ( N ) complexity too. Schedulers with lower complexity have been devised, but at the price of at least O ( N ) deviation from the GPS service, which has been shown to be detrimental for real-time adaptive applications and feedback based applications. Furthermore, it has been proven that the lower bound complexity to guarantee O (1) deviation is Ω(log N ), yet a scheduler achieving such result has remained elusive so far.In this paper we present an algorithm that performs exact GPS simulation with O (log N ) worst-case complexity and small constants. As such it improves the complexity of all the packet schedulers based on GPS simulation. In particular, using our algorithm within WF 2 Q, we achieve the minimum deviation from the GPS service with O (log N ) complexity, thus matching the aforementioned lower bound. Furthermore, we assess the effectiveness of the proposed solution by simulating real-world scenarios.",

The workshop series attracts invited speakers from academia and industry and a selection of contributed abstracts for short presentations. NetPL brings together researchers from the networking community and researchers from the programming languages and verification communities. The workshop series is a timely forum for exciting trends, technological and scientific advances in the intersection of these communities. We describe some of the highlights from the invited talks through the lens of three trends: Advances in network machine architectures, network programming abstractions, and network verification. NetPL included five invited speakers, four from academia, and one from industry. The program contained six contributed papers out of eight submitted for presentation. The workshop organizers reviewed the abstracts for quality and scope. A total of 42 registrations were received and the attendance occupied the lecture room to the brink. Slides and abstracts from all talks are available from the workshop home page: http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2017/workshop-netpl.html.

The protocol is designed to operate in conjunction with a standard end-to-end communication protocol and uses special messages to determine the system fault state. A diagnosis message is represented using a test dependency model that is derived from the system topology. These messages are used by an adaptive strategy designed to achieve specific objectives such as reduced testing cost. Using the test dependency model, a general purpose algorithm is developed for generating these strategies based on an information theory criterion. Specific properties of the protocol are discussed, and several examples of strategies for a distributed system topology are provided.",

    "abstract": "Distributed shortest-path routing algorithms based on the Ford-Fulkerson method are simple to implement but they suffer from the cost-dependent looping problem: when link costs increase, routing table loops may form and convergence to correct paths may be too slow, depending on link costs. This problem can be eliminated if constraints are imposed on the order in which routing tables are updated at different nodes but the resulting internode protocols tend to be relatively complex. Furthermore, update constraints may restrict a node's ability to obtain alternate paths quickly in an environment where topology changes are frequent. In this paper, a new distributed shortest-path routing scheme based on the Ford-Fulkerson method is presented. Under the new scheme, each node uses partial topology information to eliminate the cost-dependent looping problem. No update constraints are imposed and no assumptions are made regarding link costs. In the worst case, the new scheme responds to link cost changes in O(D) update steps, where D is the diameter of the network after the occurrence of the changes.",

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with performance models and approximations for very large, multi-media networks. Blocking is the traditional performance measure in circuit-switched networks, and will remain as such in multi-rate circuit-switched networks. It is also considered a likely performance measure candidate for resource management and dimensioning in broadband fast packet-switched networks, operated under virtual circuit mode. To gain some insight into network-wide blocking phenomena, we study in this paper the basic building block of any network, a single link. Multi-media traffic calls with Poisson arrivals, arbitrarily distributed service times, and different bandwidth requirements (in number of circuits), are offered to a system (link) of finite capacity. A call is rejected when the sharing policy doesn't allow it to be accommodated by the system. Under complete sharing policy, an aggregate state describing the number of occupied circuits is shown to exhibit a product form solution in steady state, when the capacity and traffic intensities become very large asymptotically. This structural property leads to the main result of this paper, an approximation which reduces the computation of the blocking probabilities for the different classes of traffic to the evaluation of a single Erlang formula and the determination of the root of a monotonous polynomial function. We provide comparison curves of the exact blocking probabilities and the approximations for some examples with 3 classes of traffic.",

We also show that the number &amp;kappa; of virtual receivers naturally captures the tradeoff between channel utilization and bandwidth consumption. Our approach decouples the problem of determining the virtual receivers from the problem of scheduling packet transmissions, making it possible to employ existing scheduling algorithms that have been shown to successfully hide the effects of tuning latency. Consequently, we focus on the problem of optimally selecting the virtual receivers, and we prove that it is NP -complete. Finally, we present four heuristics of varying degrees of complexity for obtaining virtual receivers that provide a good balance between the two conflicting objectives.",

Novel aspects of this research include understanding how to encode knowledge from this domain, and how to reason efficiently on real networking problems. The prototype system—KNOBS/TCP—can correctly identify many common problems that network experts would normally be required to find ( e.g. , improper or inefficient retransmission and ACK strategies, silly-window-syndrome, a subset of reset and connection closing anomalies, and basic problems with auxiliary protocols such as address resolution, and routing).

    "abstract": "In a data network, when messages arrive at a switch to be served (transmitted) on a line, it seems reasonable to assume that the arrival process can be described as a Poisson (random) process. However, when messages are divided into a number of packets of a maximum length, these packets arrive bunched together. This gives rise to what is referred to as “peaked” traffic. The degree of peakedness depends on 1) the interarrival time of packets associated with a particular message and 2) the distribution of the number of packets per message. In this paper we describe a queueing model which accounts for the non-Poissonian nature of the packet arrival process as a function of these two factors. Since packets are of a fixed maximum length, the model assumes that the packet service time is constant, as opposed to the mathematically more tractable but less realistic assumption of exponentially-distributed service time. This queueing model is then used to describe the network delay as affected by: 1. Message switching versus packet switching, 2. A priority discipline in the queues, 3. Packet interarrival time per message, which is probably controlled by the line speed at the packet origination point, and 4. A network which carries only short inquiry-response traffic as opposed to a network which also carries longer low-priority printer traffic. The general conclusions are that the peakedness in the arrival process caused by a short interarrival time of packets per message and the longer printer traffic would cause excessive delays in a network. If inquiry-response traffic with a short response-time requirement is also to be carried on the same network a priority discipline has considerable value. Message switching for such a combination of traffic should be avoided.",

    "abstract": "For many users of networks like the ARPANET, an RJE protocol is probably as important in terms of utility as the TELNET (or Virtual Terminal) protocol. In fact, the facilities provided by a TELNET and an RJE protocol are probably of most interest to the majority of users of computer networks. For these users, the network provides a fast, cheap telephone surrogate to a variety of computers for RJE and terminal access. The collection (and layers) of protocols that are used to provide these services must be organized to efficiently support a wide variety of applications and user needs. They should not pose an undue software burden on the user. The \"official\" NETRJE protocol for the ARPANET is built on top of the Telnet and File Transfer Protocols (FTP). A user of NETRJE establishes a Telnet connection using the User NETRJE program on his local host to a Server NETRJE process at the host where he wishes to submit a job (see Figure 1). The user then sends to the Server process appropriate commands to log in, to describe where the job is that is to be submitted, to describe how the job is to be transferred, and to describe what is co be done with output when the job is completed. The Server NETRJE process on the foreign host then uses the FTP to transfer the input file to the foreign host, and then may use FTP again later to send the output back to the user. This protocol is very general and allows a user to submit his input from one host, process it at a second, and send the output to a third.",

    "abstract": "We critically examine the claims that TCP congestion control contributes to the observed self-similar traffic rate correlations. A simulation model is designed to analyze aggregated traffic of many TCP file transfers, with network topologies large enough so that each transfer has independent packet losses due to competition with other TCP traffic. To separate the effects of session-level variability from network-level variability we examine traffic consisting of small fixed-size files, and of heavy-tailed distribution of file sizes, with small variance of inter-session periods.We find that, with increasing packet loss rate, traffic rate scaling crosses over from the regime dominated by file size distribution to another scaling regime that is independent of file sizes. That loss-dominated scaling stretches over the timescales from RTT to the longest consecutive TCP time-outs (hundreds of seconds), and is not asymptotic. Analysis at the flow level exposes the mechanism of the crossover, from scaling dominated by variability of the flow ON-periods to that dominated by variability of the OFF-periods.However, it is unlikely that TCP timeouts contribute much to observed Internet traffic correlation structure, as they would matter only if widespread congestion losses exceeding 10% dominated the typical behavior of the Internet.",

    "abstract": "Challenges in addressing the memory bottleneck have made it difficult to design a packet processing platform that simultaneously achieves both ease-of-programming and high performance. Today's commercial processors support two architectural mechanisms - namely, hardware multithreading and caching - to overcome the memory bottleneck. The configurations of these mechanisms (e.g., cache capacity, number of threads per processor core) are fixed at processor-design time. The relative effectiveness of these mechanisms, however, varies significantly with application, traffic, and system characteristics. Thus, programmers often struggle to achieve high performance from a processor that is not well-suited to a particular deployment. To address this challenge, we first make a case for, and then develop a malleable processor architecture that facilitates the dynamic reconfiguration of cache capacity and number of threads to best-suit the needs of each deployment. We then present an algorithm that can determine the optimal thread-cache balance at run-time. The combination of these two allows us to simultaneously achieve the goals of ease-of-programming and high performance. We demonstrate that our processor outperforms a processor similar to Intel's IXP2800 - a state-of-the-art commercial Network Processor - in about 89% of the deployments we consider. Further, in about 30% of the deployments our platform improves the throughput by as much as 300%.",

    "abstract": "Over the years, web content has evolved from simple text and static images hosted on a single server to a complex, interactive and multimedia-rich content hosted on different servers. As a result, a modern website during its loading time fetches content not only from its owner's domain but also from a range of third-party domains providing additional functionalities and services. Here, we infer the network of the third-party domains by observing the domains' interactions within users' browsers from all over the globe. We find that this network possesses structural properties commonly found in complex networks, such as power-law degree distribution, strong clustering, and small-world property. These properties imply that a hyperbolic geometry underlies the ecosystem's topology. We use statistical inference methods to find the domains' coordinates in this geometry, which abstract how popular and similar the domains are. The hyperbolic map we obtain is meaningful, revealing the large-scale organization of the ecosystem. Furthermore, we show that it possesses predictive power, providing us the likelihood that third-party domains are co-hosted; belong to the same legal entity; or merge under the same entity in the future in terms of company acquisition. We also find that complementarity instead of similarity is the dominant force driving future domains' merging. These results provide a new perspective on understanding the ecosystem's organization and performing related inferences and predictions.",

As the technology becomes a commodity and its market matures, reliability often become a key differentiating factor between competing products. We posit that as broadband capacities continue to improve and users migrate to over-the-Internet services, such as on-demand video and voice-over-IP services, we will see this common pattern emerge for broadband services. In this poster, we present the first study of reliability in broadband networks. Using data collected from residential gateways (via FCC/SamKnows), we study the availability and reliability of fixed-line broadband services across the US. Using natural experiments, we look at the impact of increased network downtime on user network demand. We use traditional metrics (e.g. failure rate, MTBF, MTTR) to quantify broadband services, as well as each ISP's configured DNS. Since the impact of a network outage will depend on when it occurred (e.g. time of day), we compare ISP services by the annual average number of bytes lost, based on typical user demand during periods of network downtime.",

We define service differentiation as any attempt to change the performance of network traffic traversing an ISP's boundaries. ISPs may implement differentiation policies for a number of reasons, including load balancing, bandwidth management, or business reasons. Specifically, we focus on detecting whether certain types of network traffic receive better (or worse) performance. As an example, a wireless provider might limit the performance of third-party VoIP or video calling services (or any other competing services) by introducing delays or reducing transfer rates to encourage users to use services provided by the wireless provider. Previous work explored this problem in limited environments. Glasnost focused on BitTorrent in the desktop/laptop environment, and lacked the ability to conduct controlled experiments to provide strong evidence of differentiation. NetDiff covered a wide range of passively gathered traffic from a large ISP but likewise did not support targeted, controlled experiments. We address these limitations with Mobile Replay.",

In this editorial, I discuss why SmartNICs are an especially powerful form factor for improving I/O intensive applications, and how their position in the dataplane enables them to take on central role in managing I/O. Rather than focusing on the benefits of individual offloads, this paper aims to explore the position of SmartNICs in the overall system integration of datacenter servers at the hardware and software level. I argue that SmartNICs should be viewed as 'data movement controllers' (NIC-DMCs) which are responsible for tasks involved in moving data between network, CPU, accelerators, and other endpoints: multiplexing/steering, interfacing between protocols, and enforcing I/O policies. I then enumerate open questions in how the hardware and software systems of the future will evolve to accommodate a dedicated NIC-DMC which is independent of the CPU complex.",

    "abstract": "As internets grow, both in size and in the diversity of routing requirements, providing inter-domain routing that can accommodate both of these factors becomes increasingly crucial. We propose a scalable inter-domain routing architecture consisting of two major components: source-demand routing (SDR) and node routing (NR). The NR component pre-computes and installs routes that are shared by a significant number of sources. These generic routes are commonly used and warrant wide propagation. The SDR component provides on-demand computation and installation of specialized routes that are not shared by enough sources to justify computation by NR. The potentially large number of different specialized routes, combined with their sparse utilization, make them too costly to support with the NR mechanism. Together NR and SDR address the issue of scaling to global internet sizes without restricting the availability of a diverse set of routes. Routing will adapt naturally over time to changing traffic patterns and new services by shifting computation and installation of particular types of routes between the two components. To complement earlier discussions of SDR design choices [3], this paper evaluates the algorithmic design choices for the NR component in terms of scalability and functionality. In addition, we discuss mechanisms for improving the scaling properties of link-state SDR, and for integrating the two components of the architecture.",

We demonstrate the use of on-line dynamic programming in an adaptive cell scheduling mechanism that can easily be engineered to meet arbitrary quality of service constraints. When the objective is to minimize the total cell loss rate, our algorithm, urgency scheduling, compares favorably with the optimal earliest deadline first algorithm. For more complex quality of service constraints where optimal scheduling algorithms are unavailable, the simulations show urgency scheduling can provide significant increases in the usable bandwidth of a link. The learning techniques we develop are quite general and should be readily applicable to other network control problems.",

A layered network architecture has been used in integrating different host systems into the network. Portable software has been used extensively in implementing various layers in different systems. This paper discusses the use of portable software in supporting file transfers on CSIRONET. Two important benefits result from the systematic use of portable software. The first is the ease with which a new type of system can be integrated into the network. The second is the high degree of flexibility in changing layer functions and protocols, and propagating these changes to the network interfaces on different systems. The original layer protocols on CSIRONET were CSIRONET-specific. However, as the OSI standards emerge, these are being phased into use through the portable interface software. These portable software concepts have universal value in the present environment of evolving network standards.",

Formulae have been derived which allow one to quantitatively measure the effect of the distributed name server configuration on a given client's level of performance. In general, the cost of a name server query can be reduced by distributing replicated copies of name server database entries in a way that exploits the locality of clients' reference patterns.",

The user/computer sites are interconnected by a wide-area network with an end-to-end window flow-control mechanism. The QNM for the system including the communication subnet and the host computers is intractable because of blocking due to window flow control and memory constraints at computer systems, even under otherwise analytically favorable assumptions. The approximate solution method, which is based on iteration and decomposition, combines several recently developed computationally inexpensive algorithms to compute user response times, taking into account the delay in the communication network and the processing time at computer systems. We also introduce a fast non-iterative procedure to analyze QNM's with external arrivals and with population size constraints, such that blocked customers are queued. The effect of the choice of window sizes and minimum link/bifurcated routing on system performance is investigated.",

The window scheme may be implemented in the transport layer protocol (like in TCP), or in the source-to-destination protocol(like in ARPANET), or in the network layer protocol (like X.25). In many implementations, the window size is chosen at connection set up time. In this paper, we provide guidelines for window selection. Specifically, we show that if the network becomes overloaded, that is, the offered load exceeds network capacity, then the selection of user windows has a critical impact on individual user throughputs. Thus, user windows should be chosen judiciously, so as to satisfy a well defined “fairness” criterion. We formulate the optimal window assignment as a mathematical programming problem, and show that the exact solution is computationally impractical because of the combinatorial nature of the problem and the complexity of the underlying multiple chain, closed network of queue model. We then develop a heuristic approach which is computationally very efficient and provides nearly optimal solutions. Numerical results are provided to illustrate and validate the method.",

This algorithm has its origins in the access control algorithm A2 proposed in [1], but it achieves a more efficient use of the bus bandwidth. In fact the time required to switch from one active station to the next in a round is of the order of signal detection time and is independent of the end-to-end network propagation delay.",

The software is layered from the low-level executive, through the three X.25 levels and the transport layer, and through the corresponding layers on the local network side, to the bridging software itself. Both hardware and software are designed so that the system can be a general-purpose gateway: for example, the local area network peripheral board could be replaced by a ring type interface, and the software within the local network layers could similarly be replaced.",

    "abstract": "TCP/IP based networks were among the earliest and most successful applications of Local Area Network technologies, and TCP/IP-based internets continue to be a testing ground for emerging high performance transmission technologies as well as the distributed processing applications they support. As distributed processing applications become increasingly available in the next decade, consumer demand for high performance transmission services will extend beyond the distance serviceable by LANs; users will want the same service from their long distance data networks as they get from local networks.Switched Multi-megabit Data Service (SMDS) is a public network service concept designed to satisfy these service requirements. Networks which support SMDS will provide a service analogous to Local Area Networks across metropolitan and eventually wide area distances. The features of SMDS reflect many of the characteristics that make communication via LANs attractive for existing and future distributed processing applications: large packet sizes, high bandwidth, low delay, and multi-cast addressing.This paper identifies the technological and economical factors which contributed first to the emergence of LAN and now MAN technologies, and in particular focuses on how SMDS might be used in TCP/IP environments. A brief description of SMDS is provided, followed by a study of the relationship between SMDS and the DOD Internet Model and a description of the ways in which the service could play a role in existing and future TCP/IP-based internets.",

    "abstract": "We suggest a new simple forwarding technique to speed-up IP destination address lookup. The technique is a natural extension of IP, requires 5 bits in the IP header (IPv4, 7 in IPv6) and performs IP lookup nearly as fast as IP/Tag-switching but with a smaller memory requirement and a much simpler protocol. The basic idea is that each router adds a \"clue\" to each packet, telling its downstream router where it ended the IP lookup. Since the forwarding tables of neighboring routers are similar, the clue either directly determines the best prefix match for the downstream router, or provides the downstream router with a good point to start its IP lookup. The new scheme thus prevents repeated computations and distributes the lookup process across the routers along the packet path. Each router starts the lookup computation at the point its up-stream neighbor has finished. Furthermore, the new scheme is easily assimilated into heterogeneous IP networks, does not require routers coordination, and requires no setup time. Even a flow of one packet enjoys the benefits of the scheme without any additional overhead. The speedup we achieve is about 10 times faster than current standard techniques. In a sense this paper shows that the current routers employed in the Internet are clue-less; Namely, it is possible to speedup the IP-lookup by an order of magnitude without any major changes to the existing protocols.",

The Nectar network currently has 25 hosts and has been in use for over a year. The flexibility of our communication processor design does not compromise its performance. The latency of a remote procedure call between application tasks executing on two Nectar hosts is less than 500 μsec. The same tasks can obtain a throughput of 28 Mbit/sec using either TCP/IP or Nectar-specific transport protocols. This throughput is limited by the VME bus that connects a host and its communication processor. Application tasks executing on two communication processors can obtain 90 Mbit/sec of the possible 100 Mbit/sec physical bandwidth using Nectar-specific transport protocols.",

Using traffic observations and a number of well known design principles the Gauss ASE gets a number of favorable properties, for example the Gauss ASE is nonblocking and has minimum delay and variance of delay.

This may not be the case in large networks since a network may be composed of smaller autonomous pieces by design or by requirements on performance, with each piece having less than complete information about other pieces. We present a trade-off between the amount of topology information exchanged among these pieces and the efficiency of routing in the network. The large network that we study is a collection of networks connected by boundary nodes. Each boundary node knows the topology of its network and the connectivity of networks to each other. The question addressed here is how much topology information about each network should be distributed to other networks in order to achieve reasonably efficient routing.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the Internet architecture has been augmented so that Better-than-Best-Effort (BBE) services, in the form of reserved resources for specific flows, can be provided by the network. To date, this has been realized through two different and sequentially developed efforts. The first is known as Integrated Services and focuses on specific bounds on bandwidth and/or delay for specific flows. The Differentiated Service model was later introduced, which presented a more aggregated and local perspective regarding the forwarding of traffic. A direction that is missing in today's work on service models is a defined schema used to purposely degrade certain traffic to various levels below that of Best Effort. In a sense, a new direction that provides a balancing effect in the deployment of BBE service. This is particularly evident with continual and parallel short transaction flows (like that used for web applications) over low bandwidth links that are not subject to any backoff penalty incurred by congestion because state does not persist. In a more indirect perspective, our model correlates degraded service with the application of usage and security policies -- administrative decisions that can operate in tandem or disjointly from conditions of the network. This paper attempts to address these and other issues and presents the design and implementation of such a new degraded service model and queuing mechanism used to support it.",

    "abstract": "Reproducible research hinges on the ability to use common datasets, and so public datasets containing measurements of real, operational networks are important for the Internet measurement community, and subsequently for all those fields of networking that use their research. There are several such datasets available now, but given the ongoing evolution of the Internet, more are always needed. However, such data is often considered proprietary, or its release raises privacy or security concerns, and so access to data is often limited to the organization that collected itAnonymization of data has sometimes been used to remove the offending components of a dataset so that the remainder can be made public.As with all such work, the Devil is in the detail. Different organizations have their own requirements for anonymization, while on the other hand, researchers have different interests in a dataset. Particular aspects of an anonymization may remove the component of the data that is of interest in a study. Anonymization policies that balance security and privacy with research value are needed. It is a challenging problem --- as one reviewer put it \"the difference between a researcher and an attacker cannot be expressed in pure data analysis terms. It is motivation or funding source that makes the difference.In studying the issues of their own organization, the authors of this paper sought not to add a new tool that would perform anonymization according to their own policies, but rather they aimed to create a new (freely available) tool 'tcpmkpub,' which would allow one to implement complicated, multifaceted anonymization policies, considerably beyond the capabilities of existing tools. The paper also provides considerable discussion of the issues surrounding anonymization policies, and finally provides access to a large dataset (11 GB set of packet traces anonymized using their tool)The reviewers were all largely positive about the paper, for instance saying \"it raises the level of thoroughness at which packet traces are anonymized,\" and \"The authors present a tool able to fulfil this task [anonymization] in an elegant way and whose flexibility promises to make it easy to adapt in different environments.\" However, two reviewers noted the fundamental problem of making a trace totally attacker proof is not solved here, though this problem is highly challenging, and perhaps not solvable --- so there is plenty of remaining research to be performed in this area",

    "abstract": "Time tends to pass more quickly than we would like. Sometimes it is helpful to reflect on what you have accomplished, and to derive what you have learned from the experiences. These \"lessons learned\" may then be leveraged by yourself or others in the future. Occasionally, an external event will motivate this self reflection. For me, it was the 50th anniversary reunion of the St. Walburg Eagles, held in July 2011. The Eagles are a full-contact (ice) hockey team I played with between 1988 and 1996 (the Eagles ceased operations twice during this period, which limited me to four seasons playing with them), while attending university. What would I tell my friends and former teammates that I had been doing for the past 15 years? After some thought, I realized that my time as an Eagle had prepared me for a research career, in ways I would never have imagined. This article (an extended version with color photos is available in [1]) shares some of these similarities, to motivate others to reflect on their own careers and achievements, and perhaps make proactive changes as a result.",

Unfortunately, the difficulty of performing detailed measurements limits the consistency in parameters and methodology of current datasets.

Correcting this situation requires consistent and comparable wireless traces collected from a variety of deployment environments. In this paper, we describe AirLab, a distributed wireless data collection infrastructure that uses uniformly instrumented measurement nodes at heterogeneous locations to collect consistent traces of both standardized and user-defined experiments. We identify four challenges in the AirLab platform, consistency, fidelity, privacy, security, and describe our approaches to address them.",

It is a healthy sign that the premier conference in networking keeps debating how to reinvent and improve itself. In 2012 I got the chance to throw my hat into the ring; at the end of a talk I spent a few minutes describing why I think the Sigcomm conference should be greatly expanded. A few people encouraged me to write the ideas down. My high level goal is to enlarge the Sigcomm tent, welcoming in more researchers and more of our colleagues from industry. *More researchers* because our field has grown enormously in the last two decades, and Sigcomm has not adapted. I believe our small program limits the opportunities for our young researchers and graduate students to publish new ideas, and therefore we are holding back their careers. *More colleagues from industry* because too few industry thought-leaders are involved in Sigcomm. The academic field of networking has weak ties to the industry it serves, particularly when compared to other fields of systems research. Both sides lose out: there is very little exchange and transfer of ideas in either direction, and not enough vigorous debate about the directions networking should be heading.",

This poster describes our ongoing work in characterizing and minimizing the communication cost of Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) graph mining systems, like Pregel, when scaling to 4,096 compute nodes. Existing implementations generally assume a fixed communication cost. This is sufficient in small deployments as the BSP programming model (i.e., overlapping computation and communication) masks small variations in the underlying network. In large scale deployments, such variations can dominate the overall runtime characteristics. In this poster, we first quantify the impact of network communication on the total compute time of a Pregel system. We then propose an efficient vertex placement strategy that subsamples highly connected vertices and applies the Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) algorithm to efficiently partition the input graph and place partitions closer to each other based on their expected communication patterns. We finally describe a vertex replication strategy to further reduce communication overhead.",

Though such a scheme allows nodes to utilize the multiplex gain of a MIMO system, it however fails to leverage receive diversity gains provided by multiple receive antennas across nodes. We introduce Multiplex-Diversity Medium Access (MDMA), a MU-MIMO MAC protocol that achieves both the multiplex gain and the receive diversity gain at the same time. Instead of letting a node pair use all the available degrees of freedom, MDMA allows as many contending node pairs to communicate concurrently as possible and share all the degrees of freedom. It hence can exploit the antennas equipped on different receivers to further provide some of concurrent streams more receive diversity, without losing the achievable multiplex gain. We implement a prototype on software radios to demonstrate the throughput gain of MDMA.",

However, as access networks become increasingly more heterogeneous, seamless data delivery across internets consisting of a variety of network technology becomes a real challenge. In this demonstration, we showcase a system that enables content dissemination over heterogeneous internets consisting of wired, infrastructure-based and infrastructure-less wireless networks that may be prone to intermittent connectivity. Using an efficient, yet flexible buffer management scheme, we are able to address application-specific performance requirements such as average delay, delivery probability, energy efficiency, etc. Our system uses the Message Delivery in Heterogeneous, Disruption-prone Networks (MeDeHa) [2]) framework to deliver messages across a heterogeneous internet coupled with History-Based Scheduling and Drop (HBSD) buffer management [1] as a way to optimize resources provided by opportunistic networks. MeDeHa, which is described in detail in [2], provides seamless data delivery over interconnecting networks of different types, i.e., infrastructure-based and infrastructure-less networks. MeDeHa's comprehensive approach to bridging infrastructure-based and infrastructureless networks also copes with intermittent connectivity. For this demonstration, we showcase a \"complete stack\" solution featuring, from to top to bottom, the DTN2 \"bundle\" layer, HBSD as an \"external router\" to DTN2, and MeDeHa, which handles message delivery. We have implemented, on a Linux-based testbed, (i) the MeDeHa framework, (ii) the HBSD [3] external router for the DTN2 [4] architecture.",

    "abstract": "Multipath routing strategies such as Equal-Cost MultiPath (ECMP) are widely used in IP and data-center networks. Most current methods to balance packets over the multiple next hops toward the destination base their decision on a hash computed over selected fields of the packet headers. Because of the non-invertible nature of hash functions, it is hard to determine the values of those fields so as to make the packet follow a specific path in the network. However, several applications might benefit from being able to choose such a path. Therefore, we propose a novel next-hop selection method based on an invertible function. By encoding the selection of successive routers into common fields of packet headers, the proposed method enables end hosts to force their packets to follow a specific path.",

    "abstract": "A number of home-installed middleboxes, e.g., BISMark and SamKnows, and web-based tools, e.g., Netalyzr and Ookla's speedtest service, have been developed recently to enable residential broadband users to gauge their network service quality. One challenge to designing these systems is to provide stable network measurement. That is, the measurement results will not be fluctuated by sporadic overheads incurred inside the middlebox or web browser. In this poster, we propose a network measurement ware, OMware, to increase the stability of residential broadband measurement. The key feature is to implement the send and receive functions for measurement packets in the kernel. Our preliminary evaluation for an OpenWrt implementation shows that OMware provides very stable throughput and delay measurement, compared with typical socket-based measurement at the user level.",

If as little as one machine in 10,000 is a latency outlier, around 18% of requests will experience high latency. The sacrifice of latency determinism for bandwidth, however, is not an inevitable one. In our R2D2 architecture, we conceptually split the data centre network into an unbuffered, unswitched low-latency network (LLNet) and a deeply buffered bandwidth centric network (BBNet). Through explicitly scheduling network multiplexing in software, our prototype implementation achieves 99.995% and 99.999% messaging latencies of 35us and 75us respectively for 1514-byte packets on a fully loaded network. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to merge the conceptually separate LLNet and BBNet networks onto the same physical infrastructure using commodity switched Ethernet hardware.",

This implies that ONUs change from sleeping mode in which they just consume 1 W to active mode in which the consumption goes up to 10 W. In many cases, the OLT does not have any packets for the ONU and it goes to sleep again, what supposes a waste of energy. In this paper, we propose a novel Hybrid ONU that relies on a low-cost and low-energy technology, IEEE 802.15.4, to wake up those ONUs that are going to receive a packet. Our first estimations demonstrates that our solution would save around 25000$ per year and OLT.",

However, while content can be retrieved from many different places, the paths to those places are not equivalent. Indeed, some paths offer better bandwidth while others are less expensive or more stable. In addition, a new range of applications is sensitive to the performance of the paths that carry their traffic. To support this evolution of the Internet, we propose ISP-Driven Informed Path Selection (IDIPS). Any ISP can easily deploy IDIPS to help its customers to select the paths that best meet their requirements in order to reach their content. IDIPS helps in this selection through pro-active measurements and ISP-defined policies. IDIPS is scalable and can support thousands of clients. IDIPS is also flexible and can thus be used by the ISP to optimize its routing decisions to take the performance of its inter-domain links into account.",

The purpose of this paper is to consider some of the important issues in detail such as: the various ways flood control can be implemented; their relative advantages/disadvantages; the functions of a node; and one possible implementation of a node in Noahnet. Expected performance of the Noahnet in comparison to Ethernet and token ring networks is also discussed. Though Noahnet uses more complex structure and protocol, we demonstrate that the overhead of using flooding in Noahnet is minimal and that a Noahnet node implementation is very simple and inexpensive. The paper concludes that Noahnet provides features such as robustness, high availability, high throughput, and high communication band width at almost no additional cost.",

To perform the conformity analysis we develop a transformation system to extract from a CSP process the communication sequences that may arise during its execution, and to express these sequences in terms of behavior expressions in CCS (Calculus of Communicating Systems). By performing algebraic manipulations and the equivalence proof on these expressions, we can show that the external behavior of a protocol conforms to its intended service. A version of the Alternating Bit Protocol is used to demonstrate the feasibility of the methodology.",

This paper describes an analysis of the Memnet system performed to predict the possible performance levels attainable by a Memnet system. One objective of this analysis is to provide analytic results demonstrating the intrinsic soundness of the Memnet architecture. This is in support of the intuitive arguments of the shared-memory network model over the I/O modeled local network schemes. Another function of this analysis has been to provide design feedback for the choice of values for parameters such as page size. The analysis results indicate that the Memnet approach to networking should significantly speed communication compared to alternative networking schemes.

    "abstract": "We specify and verify a connection management protocol for use between entities connected by channels that can lose, reorder, and duplicate messages. The protocol is symmetric. Each entity is in one of the following states: closed, listen, open, active opening, passive opening, or closing. The first three are stable states to be exited only by user request, while the last three are transient states. Each entity maintains a local incarnation number at all times, and a remote incarnation number only when opening, open, and closing. Our protocol employs the 3-way handshake used in TCP and ISO Transport Protocol (Class 4). We verify the safety property that when an entity is open, its remote incarnation number matches the remote entity's local incarnation number. This ensures that data messages from past connection instances are not delivered to the user. We verify the following progress properties: an actively opening entity will eventually establish a connection, provided that the remote entity is willing to communicate or is itself actively opening; the states of active opening, passive opening, and closing are transient; if the entities remain closed, the channels will eventually become empty, assuming messages have a maximum lifetime. This protocol specification can be immediately combined with the data transfer protocol specifications presented in [SHAN1, SHAN2, SHAN3] to provide a transport layer protocol with the functions of connection management and two-way data transfer. The verifications too can be immediately combined to provide a hierarchical verification of the multi-function protocol. The specifications and verifications can be combined because the connection management and data transfer protocols are images of the multi-function protocol. This illustrates the power of protocol projections in constructing multi-function protocols.",

The problem of deriving a protocol converter from specifications of the protocols and a desired service can be viewed as the problem of finding the “quotient” of two specifications. We define a class of finite-state specifications and present an algorithm for solving “quotient” problems for the class. The algorithm is applied to an example conversion problem. We also discuss its application in the context of layered network architectures.",

    "abstract": "Closed queueing networks have been advocated by several authors to be a more desirable model than open queueing networks (Kleinrock's model) for network design. We compare open and closed network models and demonstrate the accuracy of a particular closed network model with experimental results. The proportional approximation method (PAM) is presented for evaluating performance measures of closed queueing networks. PAM algorithms have computational time and space requirements of O(KM) , where M denotes the number of queues and K denotes the number of virtual channels in the network. Thus, PAM is the first (and only) method that can be used for solving industrial-strength network design problems using a closed network model. We formulate the following optimal routing problem: Find a route for a new virtual channel to be added to a network with existing flow-controlled virtual channels. A fast heuristic algorithm is presented. The algorithm uses PAM and exploits the following empirical observation: The route that maximizes the individual throughput of a virtual channel coincides in most cases with the route that maximizes the total network throughput (this is not true in general). We present statistical results from studies of 100 randomly generated networks to demonstrate the accuracy of PAM algorithms and the effectiveness of the optimal routing algorithm. (Exact solutions obtained by the tree convolution algorithm were used as benchmarks in our statistical studies.)",

At light load, X-Net behaves as a random access scheme. With increasing load, transmissions are done in an orderly manner, arranged into cycles. The main advantage of X-Net is its superior channel utilization and delay performance, compared to other bus schemes. The packet delay is bounded at all loads. Performance is shown to be satisfactory over a wide range of a values, where a is the ratio of end-to-end medium propagation delay to the packet transmission time. Therefore, X-Net is a suitable candidate for operation at high speeds.",

Recently, ShuffleNet multihop lightwave networks were proposed as a way to tap the vast bandwidth potential of optical fiber for multiuser packet communications. We consider the use of ShuffleNet multihop networks for optical interconnection, and study their implementation in ring topologies with each node connected to several other nodes of the ring (i.e., multi-connected ring topologies). To minimize fiber cabling congestion, the design procedure uses a new representation of the ShuffleNet connectivity graph and a generalization of Gray code patterns. As an example, only six fibers (without wavelength-division multiplexing) are required to interconnect 24 Network Interface Units (NIUs), providing a total network throughput of 1.47 Gb/s for an optical transmission rate of 100 Mb/s. The design also provides for easy, modular growth of multi-connected rings.",

For example, rate of mobility, quality of wireless communication, density of communicating nodes, power constraints and computational constraints all vary greatly from situation to situation. Unfortunately, existing routing protocols, transport protocols and adaptive applications can only adapt in a limited way. One feature that is missing from many systems is the ability to identify gross operating conditions and take on very different modes of operation. Such adaptability would improve the efficiency of many solutions. We use the term multi-modal protocols to describe systems that adapt in this way. We have explored two such systems: Wireless TCP and Overlay Routing.",

    "abstract": "For some time now most people associated with research computer networks have championed the concept of layered protocols. These are uniform rules of procedure that are intended to be obeyed by each of the different computer systems, connected by a network, in order to disguise their differences and so allow them to intercommunicate freely with each other. The concept is an attractive one and has now been taken up in various standards bodies with a view to agreeing standards for 'open networking' through the public data networks. In principle, if a suitable set of standards can be agreed, any computer system will be able to call any other one and interact with it to conduct a variety of transactions. however, the extent to which this will be true in practice has yet to be established. The layered protocol approach has proved very effective at the lower levels, but could become cumbersome if it is pushed too far. If this happens, and clumsy standards emerge, large software packages will be required to implement them in each of the cooperating computers. Such packages will be more complex than is desirable for many of the simpler applications, and will add unnecessarily to operational overheads in the smaller systems. This note suggests an alternative approach that seems worthy of consideration in the light of recent advances in micro-electronics and the likely requirements of future systems. In particular, for intelligent terminals with only one user active there will be less need for the multi-threaded protocols of today, but a greater emphasis must be given to simplicity, so that implementation and subsequent maintenance will be easy and cheap. Accordingly, free-form protocols are introduced, and advocated as a means of harnessing the intelligence of terminals together with the intelligence of their users to greater effect than has hitherto been common.",

    "abstract": "Scheduling algorithms for input-queued packet switches have been widely researched. It has been shown that various classes of scheduling algorithms provide guarantees on stability and on average delay for single switches. However, recent research has demonstrated that most of these scheduling algorithms do not guarantee stability for networks of switches. Most of the research that treats networks of switches proposes switching policies that require coordination among the single switches. The problem to find &lt;i&gt;distributed&lt;/i&gt; scheduling policies that guarantee the stability of a network of switches has so far only been investigated for a policy based on a computationally very complex maximum weight matching algorithm. In this paper, we investigate &lt;i&gt;distributed&lt;/i&gt; scheduling algorithms of &lt;i&gt;low complexity&lt;/i&gt; that belong to the classes of maximal weight matching algorithms, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-maximal weight matching algorithms for switch architectures based on a space-division multiplexing extension, and MNCM algorithms. For these scheduling algorithms, we prove the stability of networks of input-queued switches where all switches deploy the same scheduling policy. We also show that networks of input-queued switches in which specific classes of different switching policies are deployed simultaneously at different switches are stable.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of flow traces can help to understand a network's usage patterns. We present a hierarchical clustering algorithm for network flow data that can summarize terabytes of IP traffic into a parsimonious tree model. The method automatically finds an appropriate scale of aggregation so that each cluster represents a local maximum of the traffic density from a block of source addresses to a block of destination addresses. We apply this clustering method on NetFlow data from an enterprise network, find the largest traffic clusters, and analyze their stationarity across time. The existence of heavy-volume clusters that persist over long time scales can help network operators to perform usage-based accounting, capacity provisioning and traffic engineering. Also, changes in the layout of hierarchical clusters can facilitate the detection of anomalies and significant changes in the network workload.",

    "abstract": "Multimedia content is a dominant fraction of Internet usage today. At the same time, there is significant heterogeneity in video presentation modes and operating conditions of Internet-enabled devices that access such content. Users are often interested in the content, rather than the specific sources or the formats. The host-centric format of the current Internet does not support these requirements naturally. Neither do the recent data-centric naming proposals, since they rely on naming content based on raw byte-level hashing schemes. We argue that to meet these requirements, enabling content retrieval mechanisms to name and query directly for the underlying information is a good way forward. In addition to decoupling content from available sources and transfer protocols, these \"information-aware names\" or InfoNames explicitly decouple the information from content presentation factors as well. We envision an InfoName Resolution System (IRS) to resolve location based on InfoNames, while taking into account the operating conditions of devices. In this demo, we present an application to show how InfoNames can serve as presentation-invariant and portable names to fetch video content independent of device capabilities and resource constraints.",

Existing anti-censorship systems often require users to connect through proxies, but these systems are relatively easy for a censor to discover and block. We explore a possible next step in the censorship arms race: rather than relying on a single system or set of proxies to circumvent censorship firewalls, we use the vast deployment of sites that host user-generated content to breach these firewalls. We have developed Collage, which allows users to exchange messages through hidden channels in sites that host user-generated content. To send a message, a user embeds it into cover traffic and posts the content on some site, where receivers retrieve this content. Collage makes it difficult for a censor to monitor or block these messages by exploiting the sheer number of sites where users can exchange messages and the variety of ways that a message can be hidden. We have built a censorship-resistant news reader using Collage that can retrieve from behind a censorship firewall and show Collage's effectiveness with a live demonstration of its complete infrastructure.",

However, wireless networks are also relatively vulnerable: physically located off-premises, attackers can circumvent wireless security protocols such as WEP, WPA, and even to some extent WPA2, presenting a security risk to the entire network. To address this problem, we propose SecureAngle , a system designed to operate alongside existing wireless security protocols, adding defense in depth. SecureAngle employs multiantenna APs to profile the directions at which a client's signal arrives, using this angle-of-arrival information to construct unique signatures that identify each client. With these signatures, we are currently investigating how a SecureAngle enabled AP can enable a \"virtual fence\" that drops frames injected into the network from a client physically located outside a building, and how a SecureAngle-enabled AP can prevent malicious parties from spoofing the link-layer address of legitimate clients.",

    "abstract": "The Internet is organized as a collection of administrative domains, known as Autonomous Systems (ASes). These ASes interact through the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) that allows them to share reachability information. Adjacent routers in distinct ASes use external BGP (eBGP), whereas in a given AS routes are propagated over internal BGP (iBGP) sessions between any pair of routers. In large ASes where a logical full-mesh is not possible, confederations or route reflectors (RRs) are used. However, these somewhat scalable alternatives have introduced their own set of unpredictable effects (persistent routing oscillations and forwarding loops causing an increase of the convergence time) addressed in the literature [1]. The solution we propose to these issues consists of a structured routing overlay holding a comprehensive view of the routes. We describe the design of a distributed entity that performs BGP route pre-computation for its clients inside a large backbone network and propagates the paths to the routers. Compared to the current iBGP routing, the advantage of the overlay approach is the separation between the responsibility of the control plane (route storage and best path computation) and the forwarding of the packets. One of the major improvements we bring is the divided routing table tackling the scalability concerns and allowing for parallel computation of paths.",

This paper presents a dual bus approach for connecting LAN interworking units (IWU) to ATM networks. Several IWUs connecting heterogeneous LANs are configured into a dual bus structure and the end of the buses are directly connected to the ATM ports. Each IWU transforms the connectionless frame from the legacy LAN to fixed-length time-slots on the dual bus. To provide reliable connectionless services, a cell-based flow control scheme is proposed for dynamically adjusting the cell input rate so as to match with the current resources in the ATM switch. The scheme is further verified to be able to provide an optimal, best-effort and reliable interconnection scenario through simulations. The results show that the total throughput obtained by each local subnetwork dynamically matches with the cell processing throughput of the ATM switch. Besides, each IWU on the dual bus shares a fair bandwidth.",

    "abstract": "When a transport protocol segment arrives at a receiving system, the receiving system must determine which application is to receive the protocol segment. This decision is typically made by looking up a protocol control block (PCB) for the segment, based on information in the segment's header. PCB lookup (a form of demultiplexing) is typically one of the more expensive operations in handling inbound protocol segment [Fe190]. Many recent protocol optimizations for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) [Jac88] assume that a large component of TCP traffic is bulk-data transfers, which result in packet trains [JR86]. If packet trains are prevalent, there is a high likelihood that the next TCP segment is en route to the same application (i.e. uses the same PCB) as the previous TCP segment. In these environments a very simple one-PCB cache like those used in BSD systems yields very high cache hit rates. However, there are classes of applications that do not form packet trains, and these applications do not perform well with a one-PCB cache. Examples of such applications are quite common in the area of heads-down data entry into on-line transaction-processing (OLTP) systems. OLTP systems make heavy use of computer communications networks and have large aggregate-packet-rates but are also characterized by large numbers of connections, low per-connection packet rates, and rather small packets. This combination of characteristics results in a very low incidence of packet trains. This paper uses a simple analytic approach to examine how different PCB lookup schemes perform with OLTP traffic. One scheme is shown to work an order of magnitude better for OLTP traffic than the one-PCB cache approach while still maintaining good performance for packet-train traffic.",

    "abstract": "The efficiency with which multicast communication can take place is largely determined by the network level support available for such communication. Two factors contribute to the complexity of supporting current multicast applications: the lack of reliable multicast transport mechanisms at the network level and the lack of network support for large scale multicast communication. In this paper, we examine the issues pertinent to eliminating these shortcomings. We first show that internet multicasting algorithms based on reverse path forwarding are inherently unreliable and present a source-tree-based reliable multicasting scheme. The new scheme makes use of simple inter-gateway protocols and works on top of previously developed distance vector and link state internet routing schemes. Next, to support large scale applications, we present a scheme for partial multicasting and introduce a new network level operation, called gather . The partial multicasting mechanism allows messages to be delivered to subsets of multicast destinations, while the gather operation aids gateways in selectively suppressing redundant messages, thus reducing the message complexity. Using simulations, we investigate the efficacy of our schemes in supporting a sample application based on multicast communication.",

User processes generate separate sequences of messages and specify the causal relation among them according to some application need; the algorithm ensures that the messages within the same sequence are delivered to all active, i.e. both correct and faulty, processes in the group, or to none of them, and are processed according to their causal order. Messages belonging to different sequences can be concurrently processed.This problem has few solutions presented in literature; in common with a part of them, the algorithm we describe has the centralized approach and the use of history buffers to recover from omission failures. The differences mainly concern the mechanism we devised to recover from crash failures, that avoids resorting to specialized protocols. As a consequence, under failure conditions, the algorithm performs better than other proposals in terms of both network load and throughput without affecting the performances under reliable conditions. Further, it allows to implement the most general interpretation of causality and it does not require any particular service to the underlying transport protocol.",

    "abstract": "The asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) technique provides a standardized and flexible scheme to transport and switch traffic effectively for different services. To provide satisfactory quality of service (QOS) to all users on the network, it is necessary to control the user's traffic so that network resources can be efficiently and fairly utilized by all the users while still meeting the individual QOS requirement. In this paper, we propose to control the user's traffic at two places in the network: at the user-network interface (UNI) by a traffic shaper or a traffic enforcer, and at the network-node interface (NNI) by a traffic regulator and a traffic scheduler. The traffic shaper/enforcer adopted in our work contains a buffer to delay and shape the violating cells that do not comply with some agreed-upon traffic parameters. The traffic regulator regulates cells at each network node to avoid long bursts being formed which may increase the network congestion probability. A traffic scheduler that follows the traffic regulator schedules the cells' departure sequences based on their delay priorites. We have proposed a general, feasible architecture to implement the traffic shaper, regulator, and scheduler, at various places in the network. A key component, the Sequencer chip, which contains 150k CMOS transistors, has been implemented to realize the architecture.",

In the near future corporate customers may want to subscribe to broadband VPN services offered by globally operating service providers to replace most of their leased line services that are used today to build their corporate networks. The concepts historically known as characterizing VPNs, such as the concept of closed user groups, will still be valid, but the importance of VPN service features and, in particular, the set of VPN management services offered to VPN customers will become dominant. In this paper we present a detailed technical approach to the management of broadband VPNs based on current technology and common standards. In particular, we discuss architectural solutions, management interfaces and management services provided at these interfaces, as well as managed objects.",

Protocol and hardware are designed specifically for networks that are intended to function as integrated, general-purpose MIMD machines, i.e. for \"network computers\". The SCS protocol is a form of circuit switching that degrades automatically into packet switching when unavailable output lines make further extension of a partial circuit impossible. The SCS hardware uses a front-end crossbar switch to multipex some small number of communication channels among all of a given node's incident links. Together, hardware and protocol represent an attempt to convert spare bandwidth into lower network delays. They also allow experimentation with networks that reconfigure themselves dynamically in response to measured traffic patterns. We compare SCS to packet switching, circuit switching and the \"virtual cut-through\" protocol of Kermani and Kleinrock, and discuss an SCS implementation designed for the SBN network computer.",

Network protocols are described by a high level concurrent language (CSP) and a methodology is developed which permits the verification of partial and total correctness assertions about the system in a simple and natural way. Global invariants are used to establish invariant properties of the whole system and histories to record the sequence of communication exchanges between every matching pair of processes.

The interaction of finite state machines can be very complex especially if the protocol involves a large number of states. To counteract the complexity of analysis and design, we propose an approach of decomposition. Through this approach, the protocol graph can be partitioned into subgraphs each having a unique entry node and zero or more exit nodes. The exit nodes of one subgraph can be connected only to the entry nodes of other subgraphs. From the standpoint of protocol analysis, the correctness of the entire protocol graph can be inferred from the correctness of individual protocol subgraphs. From the standpoint of protocol design, the individual protocol subgraphs can be designed to correspond to different phases of the protocol. If the individual protocol subgraphs are designed correctly and the connections between subgraphs conform to the structure discussed above, then we show that the entire protocol graph will operate correctly.",

However, many practical papers stop short of having a sharp problem formulation or a rigorously considered solution, and many theory papers overlook or assume away some key aspect of the system they intend to model. Still, every so often, a paper comes along that nails a practical question with just the right bit of theory. When that happens, it's a thing of beauty. These are my ten favorite examples. In some cases, I mention survey papers that cover an entire body of work, or a journal paper that presents a more mature overview of one or more conference papers, rather than single out an individual research result.

    "abstract": "Advances in networking have been accelerated by the use of abstractions, such as \"layering\", and the ability to apply those abstractions across multiple communication media. Wireless communication provides the greatest challenge to these clean abstractions because of the lossy communication media. For many networking researchers, wireless communications hardware starts and ends with WiFi, or 802.11 compliant hardware. However, there has been a recent growth in software defined radio, which allows the basic radio medium to be manipulated by programs. This mutable radio layer has allowed researchers to exploit the physical properties of radio communication to overcome some of the challenges of the radio media; in certain cases, researchers have been able to develop mechanisms that are difficult to implement in electrical or optical media. In this paper, we describe the different design variants for software radios, their programming methods and survey some of the more cutting edge uses of those radios.",

Using the knot detection algorithm as a building block, a deadlock detection algorithm in a dynamic environment is developed. This algorithm has the following properties: It detects all the nodes which cause the deadlock. The algorithm is triggered only when there is a potential for deadlock and only those nodes which are potentially deadlocked perform the algorithm. The algorithm does not affect other processes at the nodes.",

What I propose here is a facility whereby all connected systems can be informed of this \"REBOOT\" situation as soon as it is detected by its neighbouring Bridge. This way, subsequent redundant, and wasteful transmissions can be prevented taking place from remote sources to 'unobtainable' hosts. A broadcast medium such as Ethernet is assumed.",

    "abstract": "The paper presents architectural and protocol techniques for multicast transport of multi-service data (such as video, audio and graphics). A tree-structured channel in the network is employed as building block for constructing multicast transport services. Data from different sources are multiplexed over a shared tree channel for reaching destinations through intermediate network nodes and links. The choice of multicast architecture is based on the extent of sharing of common links in a tree across multi-source data flows to allow finer degree of link bandwidth allocation control and reduce the fixed cost of links for data transport. The canonical network substrate so constructed exemplifies a 'programmable network' that may be 'plugged-in' with QOS and flow parameters to instantiate the network behavior for matching the needs of each application. This philosophy is in alignment with the evolving 'Internet Service Layer' functionalities. The paper describes the functional and protocol elements of multicast architectures to support the 'programmable network' view. It also describes the salient features of an implementation embedding these architectures.",

The test design technique used to derive a conformance test suite is semi-formal based in part on the formal specification and also the informal specification. The tests obtained are expressed in natural language. In the tester design part, we discuss the distributed test architecture of ISO and give the detailed designs of upper and lower testers. It is shown that, in testing Class 4 transport implementations, a parametrized protocol implementation approach in the lower tester design, renders the tests easier to implement.",

    "abstract": "The term Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) has increased in familiarity to those involved in distributed processing and data communications to such an extent that an understanding of the architecture it describes and the principles behind its development have quite nearly become commonplace. OSI consists of two closely related pieces: the OSI Basic Reference Model, ISO 7498, which provides a coordinated framework for the development of protocols to support distributed processing environments; and the set of related protocols which achieve that objective. The Reference Model describes an architecture wherein functions which provide communications are separated into a hierarchy of seven layers. Each layer provides services to the next higher layer, utilizing the services provided by subordinate layers in order to achieve that end. At each layer, protocols are employed to convey information between peer layer entities in communicating systems. When in compliance with the suite of standard protocols prescribed for OSI, systems are considered to be \"open\". Initially, ISO 7498 defined only the requirements of connection mode services within the Reference Model. However, in recognition of the importance which connectionless-mode applications play in the data communications environment, an addendum to ISO 7498 was produced which defines the requirements for connectionless-mode services in the Reference Model. The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of the development of connectionless-mode service and protocol within the Transport Layer of the OSI Reference Model.",

The system being modeled was based on an experimental distributed system currently being prototyped. As a specific detailed case study, we have evaluated the performance of a file server. A file server is a key component to achieve the data sharing necessary in a distributed system. The file server is probably the most heavily used resource of the distributed system and as a result, its performance is critical to the success of the system. The primary goal of the study was to identify and quantify the effects of the bottlenecks in the server and assess design alternatives to enhance performance. In particular, the improvements due to file caching, outboarding transport functions and the effect of multiple network interfaces were studied. We model in detail the various stages of processing of a request to a file server. Parameterization of the model was achieved by initial measurements made on the prototype system. An important characteristic modeled was the buffer overflow from the network interfaces. This required the approximate solution of a non-product-form queueing network.",

    "abstract": "A well known disadvantage of standard token-passing in ring and bus networks is the waste of channel bandwidth often seen in lightly loaded or asymmetric systems. It is possible to make use of the broadcast mechanism in token bus systems to distribute nearly up-to-date information about the state of individual stations to the entire system. One such scheme involves the determination of a randomly varying set of more active stations. These stations are given a chance to form a second logical ring above the standard logical ring that characterizes the token bus. The transmission cycles of the system can thus be made to alternate between standard token-passing and transmission cycles, and the cycles of token-passing and transmission within the logical ring of more active stations. We assume that each station makes at most one transmission when given the chance to transmit. For Poisson arrivals and otherwise general input distributions, the cycle-time distribution of the token is derived for each kind of cycle. An important random variable is the random token turnaround time seen by individual stations. For lightly loaded stations this time tends to be larger than for heavily loaded stations. The distribution of this random time, simple performance measures, and a comparative measure of stability, showing the adaptive scheme to be more stable than the standard, are obtained.",

The second direction of the language development leads to the high-level implementation languages. The separability technique (separate compilation) which can be used in the case of ESTELLE documents is investigated and a different structuring principle is suggested. The inner contradiction of the module instantiation is revealed and the construction of an alternative specification is suggested. The ESTELLE process concept is compared with an implementation process concept.

Alpha transport combines the TDM circuit switching concept and packet switching technology. It is easy to implement and particularly cost effective to carry the subnet traffic of meshed packet switching networks. Alpha transport is robust, enables high utilization of the subnet bandwidth, reduces the subnet delay, and provides fairness.",

Each node may have two communication channels. The first is a token ring and is used for short or prioritized message data transmissions. The other consists of an arbitrary collection of data links, which are used for relatively high volume and low priority data messages. With this architecture, a LAN can be installed in the form of token ring and can be upgraded and “tuned” to its application environment by the insertion of node-to-node data links. Simulation results indicate that even with rather simple network control and routing algorithms, performance is improved over token ring due to data transmission concurrency greater than one.",

Current internetworking approaches use either concatenated virtual circuits, as in X.75, or a “universal” internetwork datagram, as in the DoD Internet IP protocol and the ISO connectionless network protocol (CLNP). Both approaches have significant disadvantages. This paper describes Sirpent™ (Source Internetwork Routing Protocol with Extended Network Transfer) 1 , a new approach to an internetwork architecture that makes source routing the basis for interconnection, rather than an option as in IP. Its benefits include simple switching with low per-packet processing and delay, support for accounting and congestion control, and scalability to a global internetwork. It also supports flexible, user-controlled routing such as required for security, policy-based routing and realtime applications. We also propose a specific internetwork protocol, called VIPER™ 2 , as a realization of the Sirpent approach.",

    "abstract": "We present a design and preliminary analysis of an end-to-end transport protocol that is capable of high throughput consistent with the evolving wideband physical networks based on fiber optic transmission lines and high capacity switches. Unlike the current transport protocols in which changes in control state information are exchanged between the two communicating entities only when some significant event occurs, our protocol exchanges relevant and full state information periodically, routinely and frequently. We show that this results in reducing the complexity of protocol processing by removing many of the procedures required to recover from the inadequacies of the network such as bit-errors, packet loss, out of sequence packets and makes it more amenable to parallel processing. Also, to increase channel utilization in the presence of high speed, long latency networks, and to support datagrams, we propose an efficient implementation of selective repeat method of error control used in our protocol. Thus, we utilize small extra bandwidth to simplify protocol processing; a trade-off that appears proper since electronic speeds for protocol processing are far slower than fiber transmission rates. Our preliminary estimates indicate that 20,000 packets/second can be handled in a completely software implementation on a 10 MIP microprocessor using 8% of its cycles.",

In addition, the ASH system provides support for dynamic integrated layer processing (thereby eliminating duplicate message traversals) and dynamic protocol composition (thereby supporting modularity). ASHs provide this high degree of flexibility while still providing network performance as good as, or (if they exploit application-specific knowledge) even better than, hard-wired in-kernel implementations.

In this environment, access to one of several machines that have a given resource is determined by the effective bandwidth and reliability of internetwork communications, the ability to interact with the machines offering the resources, and the load on those machines. Using these criteria, the resources management system enables applications to determine and obtain access to the “best” copy of a resource. Should the resource become unavailable from one machine, the resource management system can dynamically direct the applications to another machine known to offer the same resource. This paper discusses some of the problems that motivated the design, an implementation for a UNIX workstation environment, and future directions for the resource management system .",

The nature of services provided in the proposed protocol are derived from typical application requirements, and include group communications, synchronization and recovery, and integrated distributed primitives such as mutual exclusion and consensus. The protocol is also influenced by the characteristics of typical local networks that support sequenced delivery with data integrity, have low latency and high throughput, and are well suited to global addressing schemes. Initial experiences with a test implementation indicate that high level service support is valuable and can be provided with good performance.",

    "abstract": "IFIP is a multinational federation of professional-technical societies concerned with information processing. At present, thirty-five national societies are members of the federation, united to achieve the following aims: -to promote information science and technology; -to advance information cooperation in the field of information processing; -to stimulate research, development, and application of information processing in science and human activity; -to further the dissemination and exchange of information about information processing; and -to encourage education in information processing Thus, IFIP is both a catalyst and a focal point for conceptual and technological developments which advance the state of the information processing art. Within IFIP, the technical work is sponsored by a series of technical committees. Under their auspices, workshops, seminars, and conferences are organized to encourage research and technological progress, and to publish definitive texts on the state of that progress. At present, technical committees are working in such fields as: -information processing terminology -programming languages -applications in education -information processing in medicine -applications in technology -data communications -modelling and optimization -the effect of information processing on human institutions In addition to the specialized events organized by the technical committees, IFIP sponsors a Congress once every three years which provides an overall view of the state of information processing science. The next Congress will be held in Toronto, Canada in August 1977. The library of books published by IFIP now contains sixty volumes. They cover a variety of fields including applications in technology, administration and management, the description and use of programming languages, mathematical theory, computing education, applications in medicine and other human activities, terminology, and overview descriptions of the technological state of the art. Together they constitute a definitive view of research and applications for use by scientists, users, and associated organizations. Cooperation with CCITT (Commite Consultatif International pour Telephonie et Telegraphic -- a technical body of the International Telegraphics Union which makes recommendations for worldwide standards in the area of telecommunications) has been instituted by the IFIP Technical Committee studying Data Communications. One of the specialized working groups of TC6 coordinates research to clarify the problems and options for the international interconnection of packet switched networks. Results of this research are made available to Study Group VII of CCITT which is deliberating on the facilities and appropriate standards for new data networks (of which packet switched networks are only one type).",

ThingVisor consists of (1) a Device Design Stack to configure virtual IoT devices, (2) an Immersive Runtime Stack to interact with devices and environment, and (3) a Device Emulator, which is a runtime environment used to execute virtual devices to get their behaviors. Our experiments confirm the learning effectiveness and user satisfaction of our platform. Additionally, we have demonstrated the scalability and usability of the system through load testing and application of the System Usability Scale. Our results indicate that students can achieve up to a 32% improvement in their scores after engaging with ThingVisor for two weeks, irrespective of their prior experience.",

Token Reservation fails when higher priority messages enter the system too late to be included in the priority bidding scheme or after a lower priority message successfully captures the token. Although allowing preemption in the media access protocol could reduce or eliminate these failings, no preemptable protocol exists among the extant LAN protocols. We are interested in whether preemption service in LANs could improve service for high priority messages; since no LAN with preemption currently exists, we developed a preemption protocol and tested it in simulation. We compare this protocol with non-preemption protocols using conventional metrics (such as throughput and delay), as well as introducing a new metric, the priority inversion ratio, to quantify the effectiveness of the protocols for providing priority-ordered service. We show that non-preemptable token reservation protocols suffer from priority inversion. We also show that a preemption protocol indeed provides better service to high priority messages at the expense of lower priority messages, and that this improvement is measurable.",

This paper discusses cost allocation in the context of multicast flows. The question we discuss is this: when a single data flow is shared among many receivers, how does one split the cost of that flow among the receivers? Multicast routing increases network efficiency by using a single shared delivery tree. We address the issue of how these savings are allocated among the various members of the multicast group. We first consider an axiomatic approach to the problem, analyzing the implications of different distributive notions on the resulting allocations. We then consider a one-pass mechanism to implement such allocation schemes and investigate the family of allocation schemes such mechanisms can support.",

The NSFNET backbone network provides transit services to a large portion of the global Internet and maintains routing tables reflecting this current connectivity.

While this is an old idea, we describe several specific new mechanisms based on this principle. We describe a new technique, source hashing , which can provide O (1) lookup costs at the Data Link, Routing, and Transport layers. Source hashing is especially powerful when combined with the old idea of a flow ID ; the flow identifier allows packet processing information to be cached, and source hashing allows efficient cache lookups. Unlike Virtual Circuit Identifiers (VCIs), source hashing does not require a round trip delay for set up. In an experiment with the BSD Packet Filter implementation, we found that adding a flow ID and a source hash improved packet processing costs by a factor of 7. We also found a 45% improvement when we conducted a similar experiment with IP packet forwarding. We also describe two other new techniques: threaded indices , which allows fast VCI-like lookups for datagram protocols like IP; and a Data Manipulation Layer , which compiles out all the information needed for Integrated Layer Processing into an easily accessible portion of each packet.",

    "abstract": "The complexity and efficiency aspects of a distributed application protocol (e.g., replicated data access) are often intertwined with the application-specific communication requirements between protocol entities and the underlying primitives for message broadcasting. For instance, the choice between recovery by application from a mis-ordered message delivery versus providing message ordering property in the communication layer (CL) is based on tradeoffs between protocol complexity and efficiency. The paper systematically analyzes these tradeoffs with respect to message ordering and atomicity properties in broadcast communication. Enforcing these properties in the CL leads to uniform communication structure of applications; however, the CL incurs message and execution time overhead due to extensive communication state (e.g., message buffering). When these properties are not supported by CL but are required for an application, mechanisms to enforce it are built into the application protocol, thereby increasing complexity in the protocol structure. Detailed examples of applications are given to illustrate these tradeoffs. The analysis is useful in designing communication primitives and application protocols for distributed systems.",

    "abstract": "Loss-load curves are a recently proposed feedback mechanism for rate-based congestion control in datagram computer networks. In the loss-load model, packet loss inside the network is a direct function of sender transmission rates, and senders have the responsibility of choosing their own transmission rate based on the loss-load tradeoff curve provided by the network. Earlier work has provided the mathematical basis for the loss-load model and provided preliminary simulation results demonstrating its responsiveness, fairness, and stability. The loss-load model works well for simple network environments where each source has many packets to transmit, and wishes to maximize raw throughput.In this paper, the applicability of loss-load curves is extended to senders with more general network traffic requirements, such as file transfer activities. In particular, the paper considers senders wishing to minimize the response time for a transfer of N packets. When N is small, a sender chooses a low transmission rate, to minimize the probability of packet loss. When N is large, a higher transmission rate is chosen to increase raw throughput. The loss-load curve mechanism provides necessary and sufficient information for senders at the edges of the network to choose a proper transmission rate based on their traffic requirements and the current network load.Simulation results show that the loss-load mechanism is effective in achieving high network utilization and minimizing response time for file transfers. The loss-load model also does a good job of providing equitable service to senders with different traffic workloads and different round trip times.",

Our prototype environment interprets the trace as a whole. It identifies conversations across protocol layers, simulates the services offered by lower layers, and hides the lower layer implementation detail from the representation of higher layer conversations. Our prototype offers over a dozen different types of diagrams for showing protocol interactions and uses linked highlighting to show the relationships between the objects in different diagrams.",

It utilizes the bandwidth efficiently while keeping the processing requirements low by requiring stations to compute their transmission and reception schedules only at the start and end of each connection.

These features include RED, fair queuing, etc. Unfortunately testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of these mechanisms in test environments is often limited by the simplicity of the test setup. Yet, variability is necessary to locate equipment bugs and to evaluate the features benefits. As a result the real test is the deployment in the operational network - not a sound testing methodology.As a first step towards addressing this problem, we are building a tool that can generate realistic routing tables of arbitrary size and updates of arbitrary frequency. To this end, we first define a set of metrics that can capture important characteristics of routing tables and routing updates. Next, we present insights of a characterization of measured routing tables and updates and identify some key insights. These results are then used to parameterize our tool. Finally, we describe the key ideas behind the tool and conclude with a brief discussion of future work.",

    "abstract": "Companion papers have considered the concept of the Virtual Terminal in the context of a network (ref 1) and as an interface between users and computers (ref 2). These papers give a background for the present paper which proposes a Virtual Terminal protocol for use between an applications program and a remote terminal handler, based on the concept of the dynamic assignment of zones, introduced by Luca (ref 3). The paper by Luca contains an excellent discussion of the concept and use of zones, which seem well suited for a Virtual Terminal protocol although this was not considered in his paper. Some simplification of Luca's work is appropriate because he is concerned both with the interface between an application and the terminal handler, which he calls the programmable communications controller (PCC), and with the mapping between the PCC and a real terminal. The first aspect only will be considered here as the basis of a simple applications level protocol for a Virtual Terminal. However, Luca's paper is also a useful guide for the designers of the terminal handler and users who are concerned with mapping the Virtual Terminal onto particular real terminals. This paper draws on the ideas contained in the earlier papers reviewed in Appendix 1 of ref 2, and uses the notation introduced in Appendix 2 of ref 2. The zones concept is similar to the idea of the Communication Unit introduced by Schulze (ref 4) and this has also influenced the proposals set out below.",

    "abstract": "A major achievement of the standardization process has been the definition of a universal circuit interface (X21 or X21 bis) together with a universal transmission procedure (HDLC). This allows a large degree of compatibility between terminal equipments, regardless of configuration or communication media. X25 departs from this approach as it requires specialized DTE's that could no longer operate in conjunction with other simple DTE's using an HDLC interface. DTE's and procedures operating on private or public circuits would not be able to communicate with DTE's operating on public virtual circuits. This situation would be chaotic and detrimental to the user interest. Simple DTE's with single access have no need for an X25 interface. They can certainly establish a call using the X21 or X21 bis interface, and operate in packet mode with an HDLC procedure. In particular, DTE's operating in half-duplex mode, or in a multipoint configuration, cannot use X25. An analysis of X25 shows that its packet level is redundant with other level. Its functions could be performed in taking advantage of the facilities already present in HDLC. On the other hand X25 contains undesirable functions which should be eliminated or made user options, as they are generating incompatibilities. The proposal described in this paper has major advantages over the present X25 in providing compatibility between \"real\" and \"virtual\" circuits while using a standard HDLC interface for all DTE's.",

    "abstract": "We prepared this description of the X.25 link access protocol for a commercial packet-switching network installation in which we participated. Our goal was to provide the network's users with a version of the link access procedures specification which was easier to read and understand than the X.25 specification documents available at the time. No attempt was made to change or improve the X.25 link access procedure; we merely attempted to write the procedure down more clearly. We have written the description in terms of \"Nodes\" and \"Hosts\", terms which are in common use in the packet-switching network field. Others desiring to adopt this description may decide to use the CCITT terms \"DCE\" and \"DTE\", or still other terms, for the same functional entities. The X.25 specification of its link access procedure includes a detailed description of the mechanisms used to provide bit error detection and data transparency on the link, i.e., a specific 16-bit checksum and a method of inserting and later deleting additional 1-bits which provides the equivalent of the BSC escape character mechanism. We do not view the detailed specification of these aspects of the (presumably hardware) interface as fundamental to the X.25 link access procedure. Both the error control and transparency functions must be provided, but it is easiest to use whichever specific mechanisms are provided in the communications interface line of the vendor of the Host computer rather than requiring the X.25 specification to be used. We were aided in learning the X.25 link access procedure by Marie Rousseau. Our colleague, Alex McKenzie, provided important editorial assistance and guidance regarding the presentation of this description, and by rights he should be considered a co-author.",

    "abstract": "Over paths characterized by extended outage periods, a TCP connection can suffer a severe performance penalty due to its Retransmission Timeout (RTO) backoff mechanism. If outages are long enough, the RTO can grow large enough to cause unacceptably long pauses when the link is eventually restored. One proposed solution is \"Link-Up Notification\" (LUN), which involves an intermediate device that can detect the link state. When the link is restored, the device immediately sends a packet that causes traffic to resume, terminating the TCP timeout. We have implemented a version of LUN that we call \"kickstart.\" A kickstart gateway buffers a packet from each connection and uses them to restart the connections when the channel is restored. Based on empirical data, we have built a mobile satellite channel emulator and demonstrated how the technique can effectively eliminate the pause in restarting a TCP flow once a blocked channel is reestablished. When conducting experiments with shorter channel outages and shorter TCP flows, a different picture emerges; in this case, while connection transfer times are not noticeably reduced by a kickstart gateway, the overall completion ratio of TCP connections is increased, as fewer connections are dropped due to exceeding the maximum number of retransmissions. Our experiments also exposed some problems in the Linux and FreeBSD end host TCP implementations that impair performance in such an environment. Correcting these problems improves success ratios still more, while having little positive effect on transfer times.",

    "abstract": "The delay and throughput characteristics of a packet switch depend mainly on the queueing scheme and the scheduling algorithm deployed at the switch. Early research on scheduling algorithms has mainly focused on maximum weight matching scheduling algorithms. It is known that maximum weight matching algorithms guarantee the stability of input-queued switches, but are impractical due to their high computational complexity. Later research showed that the less complex maximal matching algorithms can stabilize input-queued switches when they are deployed with a speed-up of two. For practical purposes, neither a high computational complexity nor a speed-up of two is desirable.In this paper, we investigate the application of matching algorithms that approximate maximum weight matching algorithms to scheduling problems. We show that while having a low computational complexity, they guarantee the stability of input queued switches when they are deployed with a moderate speed-up.In particular, we show that the improve_matching algorithm stabilizes input-queued switches when it is deployed with a speed-up of 3&lt;over&gt;2+ε.In a second step, we further improve on these results by proposing a class of maximal weight matching algorithms that stabilize an input-queued switch without any speed-up.Whereas initial research has only focused on scheduling algorithms that guarantee the stability of a single switch, recent work has shown how scheduling algorithms for single switches can be modified in order to design distributed scheduling algorithms that stabilize networks of input-queued switches. Using those results, we show that the switching algorithms proposed in this paper do not only stabilize a single switch, but also networks of input-queued switches.",

    "abstract": "Cloud computing is transforming networking landscape over the last few years. The first order of business for major cloud providers today is to attract as many organizations as possible to their own clouds. To that end cloud providers offer a new generation of managed network solutions to connect the premises of the enterprises to their clouds. To serve their customers better and to innovate fast, major cloud providers are currently on the route to building their own \"private Internets\", which are idiosyncratic. On the other hand, customers that do not want to stay locked by vendors and who want flexibility in using best-for-the-task services spanning multiple clouds and, possibly, their own premises, seek for solutions that will provide smart overlay connectivity across clouds. The result of these developments is a multiplication of closed idiosyncratic solutions rather than an open standardized ecosystem. In this editorial note we argue for desirability of such an ecosystem, outline the main requirements and sketch possible solutions. We focus on enterprise as our primary use case and illustrate the main ideas through it, but the same principles apply to various different use cases.",

    "abstract": "Latency is becoming a key factor of performance for Internet applications and has triggered a number of changes in its protocols. Our work revisits the impact on latency of address family selection in dual-stack hosts. Through RIPE Atlas measurements, we analyse the address families latency difference and establish two requirements based on our findings for a latency-focused selection mechanism. First, the address family should be chosen per destination. Second, the choice should be able to evolve over time dynamically. We propose and implement a solution formulated as an online learning problem balancing exploration and exploitation. We validate our solution in simulations based on RIPE Atlas measurements, implement and evaluate our prototype inside a DNS resolver in four access networks using Chrome and popular web services. We demonstrate the ability of our solution to converge towards the lowest-latency address family and improve the latency of transport connections used by applications.",

With software like Mastodon and Friendica, PeerTube is part of a series of federated social media platforms built partly in response to growing concerns about centralized control and ownership of the incumbent ones. In this paper, we present the first characterization of PeerTube, including its underlying infrastructure and the content being shared on its network. Our findings reveal concerning trends toward centralization that echo patterns observed in other contexts, exacerbated by the limited degree of content replication. PeerTube instances are mostly located in North America and Western Europe, with about 70% hosted in Germany, the USA, and France, and over 50% hosted on the top 7 ***ASes. We also find that over 92% of videos are stored without any redundancy in spite of PeerTube's native support for video redundancy.",

    "abstract": "The future success of computer communications will largely depend on how effectively applications achieve their desired quality of service (QoS). Active networks move closer to the goal of application specified QoS by allowing user-specified network related computation to be injected into the network elements. Although research into active networks is in its infancy, one area that has not yet received much attention is the representation of active programs. The Active Network Encapsulation Protocol (ANEP) has made a significant effort towards producing a common definition, however, as the name suggests, ANEP has only gone as far as the packet header for encapsulating an active program. The contribution of this paper is to show how an independent packet representation such as Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) can be used as a common substrate for representing active programs. An active networking framework, using ASN.1 whereby any active network solution can be deployed independently of the active network element's architecture is discussed. In this paper, we demonstrate the independent representation using a simple procedural language. This technique however is language independent and can be extended to cover any language including all those currently used in active networks. ASN.1 is ideally suited to this purpose since it was originally conceived as a language for the representation of programs and data types in protocol data units (PDUs). This solution maintains security, mobility and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "If the reliability provided by the network is lower than that requested by the application, the error and flow control systems in the end-nodes must make up for the difference. While most applications use retransmission based schemes to recover lost data, ARQ based closed loop techniques may not be suitable for many new applications. Time sensitive information requiring no-loss of data would constitute a major segment of the emerging traffic (interactive web, videophones, CSCW) that typically employ Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes. Such codes send redundant information which help to recover lost data without retransmission. This paper shows that just plain FEC is not enough when one considers the fragmentation effects that takes place when legacy networks interwork with ATM. Simple yet powerful buffer management techniques can yield higher throughput thereby reducing block loss rates. A combination of a gatekeeping operation along with janitor routine that cleans up the buffer to preserve frames on an end-to-end basis is proposed. A simulation study demonstrates positive results. The proposed schemes even point towards efficient sizing of ATM switch buffers which guarantee no-loss transport of real-time information.",

    "abstract": "Byte stuffing is a process that transforms a sequence of data bytes that may contain 'illegal' or 'reserved' values into a potentially longer sequence that contains no occurrences of those values. The extra length is referred to in this paper as the overhead of the algorithm.To date, byte stuffing algorithms, such as those used by SLIP [RFC1055], PPP [RFC1662] and AX.25 [ARRL84], have been designed to incur low average overhead but have made little effort to minimize worst case overhead.Some increasingly popular network devices, however, care more about the worst case. For example, the transmission time for ISM-band packet radio transmitters is strictly limited by FCC regulation. To adhere to this regulation, the practice is to set the maximum packet size artificially low so that no packet, even after worst case overhead, can exceed the transmission time limit.This paper presents a new byte stuffing algorithm, called Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing (COBS), that tightly bounds the worst case overhead. It guarantees in the worst case to add no more than one byte in 254 to any packet. Furthermore, the algorithm is computationally cheap, and its average overhead is very competitive with that of existing algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The DARPA Domain Name project is an attempt to move from a centralized naming authority to a distributed one. In essence, the domain system computes a single binding from a character string known as a host name to another string known as the host address (a 32-bit integer). Besides the syntactic changes in names, the chief difference between the old-style names and domain names is that in the old system, a database containing the name-to-address bindings was distributed to each host where bindings were performed locally, while in the domain system computation of the name-to-address binding uses the internet to contact search the hierarchy of domains until a server is found that can perform the binding. Unfortunately, to make the system efficient, servers cache bindings they look up, and clients begin a search by contacting the nearest “leaf” server to avoid searching the hierarchy. If sufficient memory is available, the cache at a server corresponds exactly to old-style host tables. The domain scheme raises other questions. In principle, the hierarchical structure of domain names permits easy delegation of naming authority because it allows names within independent subtrees to be assigned by independent organizations. In practice, however, the hierarchical scheme collects together organizations under fixed top-level domains. Because extremely small organizations cannot afford to maintain a domain name server, they must be supported by (and obey the authority of) a domain server for the subhierarchy under which they lie. A hierarchical organization of names also imposes restrictions on the use of the system. For example, even though domain name servers contain (name, address) pairs, it is impossible to locate the desired binding given only the address.",

    "abstract": "This work originated from discussions on the interpretation of the ISO 8327 Session Protocol and the ISO 8326 Session Service. The author, who participated in the development of the above mentioned documents, discovered that many who attempted a thorough reading of them, either for implementing the Session layer or for a better understanding of the protocol, had a number of questions regarding the interpretation of the documents.There are two principal reasons for these difficulties. First, the state table description of the protocol in Appendix A of ISO 8326 and ISO 8327 is not formal, and thus subject to different interpretations. Second, there are actions which are not explained in Appendix A, but rather are described in the text. This means that even after having solved all questions related to Appendix A, one cannot be sure that an implementation is in fact correct.This paper is intended as an aid in interpreting the documents, and to correlate the plain text description to the state table description.A number of persons contributed to the contents of this paper, and it is impossible to list them all. The author, however, wishes to mention the major discussions that had with Albert Fleischmann and Stefan Pappe during their implementation of the Heidelberg Session layer; Colin West of the Zuerich Lab when he was attempting to devise a testing strategy for the above mentioned implementation; and Marten van Sinderen of the Twente University and Giuseppe Scollo of the Catania University when using LOTOS to describe the ISO Session layer.Wolfgang Effelsberg and Jim Staton of E.

    "abstract": "As a user's computing environment grows from a single time-shared host to a network of specialized and general-purpose machines, the capability for the user to access all of these resources in a consistent and transparent manner becomes desirable. Instead of viewing commands as binary files, we expect the user to view commands as services provided by servers in the network. The user interacts with a personal workstation that locates and executes services on his behalf. Executing a single service provided by any server in the network is useful, but the user would also like to combine services from different machines to perform complex computations. To provide this facility we expand on the UNIX notion of pipes to a generalized pipeline mechanism containing services from a variety of servers. In this paper we explain the merits of a multi-machine pipeline for solving problems of accessing services in a heterogeneous environment. We also give a design and performance evaluation of a general mechanism for multi-machine pipes using the DARPA UDP and TCP protocols.",

    "abstract": "The sheer scale and complexity of large data networks makes testing them a daunting task. System commissioning, release acceptance, network troubleshooting, performance testing, host conformance testing, and certification are all operational activities that involve testing. Packet switching systems typically provide built-in features to help with hardware level test operations such as modem loopback commands, system failure alarms and system selftests. However, testing system and protocol level functions still required the use of separate tool boxes. Typical data product test tools are designed to test single data lines, not multiline distributed networks (1,2,3). Considering all of the above, the SL-10 test tools group set out to develop network tools (4). Tools have been implemented which are well-integrated into the SL-10 product. The same tools can be used alone, independent of the SL-10 network. This tool set makes the job of network testing more manageable for developer, manufacturer and network operator alike. Terminals and host computers, as well as total networks, can now be tested for conformance and performance automatically, instead of manually. As a result, major productivity improvements and quality gains have been observed since the tools were introduced. The tool set consists of four tools: an interactive protocol tester (IPT) for checking protocol implementations against specifications; the network load test system (NLTS) which generates simulated traffic and measures the network's performance; the network process monitor (NPM) which examines operating software at the module level; and the network test system (NTS) Driver which is an automatic or interactive test sequencer for coordinating and controlling distributed network testing. Each tool can be operated individually using a standard data terminal. The IPT, NLTS and NPM tools run on SL-10 RAPID * network processors and can be operated remotely via the network or the NTS Driver. Using these tools in combination, a fully integrated and automatic operational test center can be realized, and the need for separate tool boxes can be eliminated. The design and capabilities of each of these tools are described. This paper describes how these tools meet the special needs of network test operations.",

Recently, Quemada and Fernandez proposed the introduction of time in LOTOS (what we call Timed LOTOS henceforth). We specify in CCS, LOTOS and Timed LOTOS a simple handshake protocol with a one shot sender, a one shot receiver and two unidirectional channels with a capacity of one message and the possibility of loosing this message. For each of these specifications, we calculate the corresponding semantics, which show their properties such as the deadlock freeness and the livelock freeness. By the way, we also compare their relative power with respect to timer description. The conclusion is that none of these models is well suited for the description of timers and time out mechanisms. The reason of this is analyzed.",

    "abstract": "The higher-level communication protocols in computer networks, such as belonging to the OSI Transport through Application layers, are usually considered to have an end-to-end significance, that is the entities executing the protocol reside at the two respective ends of the connection, close to the application users. This question of end-to-end significance was in particular an issue in the discussion of the meaning of acknowledgements in the Transport layer, and in the distinction between the OSI Network and Transport layers. The OSI protocols are developed for the interworking of \"Open Systems\". It seems that an Open System may be, in particular, a distributed computing system which presents to its environment, for example through a gateway, the protocol behavior defined by OSI. In this case the Open System would use internally, possibly over a local area network, specific protocols, which may or may not be structured according to the OSI Reference Model, but which are different to the protocols defined for OSI. In this case the OSI higher-level protocols would be executed between the entities in the environment of the Open System (e.g. system of user A1) and the gateway of the Open System, which is not end-to-end, as indicated in the figure below. The purpose of this contribution is to point out that this situation can be considered normal (i.e. end-to-end significance is irrelevant) provided that the OSI services have a property, which we call in the following \"concatenation property\". A service specification has the concatenation property if two service providing subsystems may be concatenated such that the system (consisting of the concatenated subsystems) provides a service which has the same logical properties as the original services. (Clearly, the performance of the concatenated service would in general be lower). It is important to note that we assume that the services of the non-OSI system (e.g. service provider B) are logically identical to those defined for OSI (e.g. service provider A). In this case the concatenation entity has a straightforward function (see below). In the case that they are different, some adaptation may be performed which has, however, an impact on all users and could sometimes result in quite complex gateway functions. The OSI Transport service has the concatenation property to a large extent. It is sufficient to use a concatenation entity that generates service requests to the service provider B for each service indication received from service provider A (with same parameter values). A problem arising, however, is one of addressing. It is necessary that the addressing space within the service provider B be foreseen by the addressing conventions used within the service provider A (and inversely) such that a user connected to the service provider A may select an address which identifies a user connected to the service provider B. It is then necessary that all service indications generated by service provider A destined to users connected to service provider B be generated over the interface to the concatenation entity, and similarly in the opposite direction. Another problem is related to error reporting. It seems that a distinction between connection aborts generated by the user or service provider, respectively, is not possible in the manner defined for OSI. It seems that the services specified for the other higher layers of OSI have similar concatenation properties. We can see two conclusions from the above discussion: (1) If services have the concatenation property the question of end-to-end significance is irrelevant. Gateways may be constructed which realize the concatenation of two or more distributed system services. (2) The service specifications of OSI are the main documents on which the construction of OSI gateways is based. These specifications are therefore essential, not only as a basis for checking the consistency of several protocol layers within the OSI hierarchy, but also as as basis for interworking between existing systems according to OSI.",

Examples of such networks are TYMNET and SNA. A route selection algorithm can be either static or dynamic. A static selection is based on given route selection tables which are usually provided to the system by the system generation process. A dynamic selection uses dynamically changing information of the network for determining an optimal route for the new session to be assigned to. This paper develops both static and dynamic route selection algorithms which may be used in a session-based communication network. Route selection algorithms will be classified into several classes depending on the network work-load information available for making decisions. It will be shown that very simple algorithms give good robustness with good response time.",

The reliable delivery is fairly important since an error might cause retransmission of a whole data.

The goal of this paper is to describe a minimal duplex connection capability for the top three layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model that will be appropriate for use by very small Open Systems such as home computers. Such a connection capability would allow these small systems to interconnect with machines of arbitrary size. The approach taken is to use only the parameters on service primitives that are absolutely required to accomplish this connection service. The protocol and services necessary to accomplish such a minimal connection are described for the application, presentation, and session layers of the OSI Reference Model. The existing draft proposals for services and protocol for the session layer provide a basis for this duplex connection service. A minor modification to the session draft proposals is suggested. The services for the presentation and application layer are defined in terms of the tentative service primitives being considered in the international standards efforts. The transparent initial context defined for the presentation layer is used to minimize the work of that layer. The benefits of this minimal duplex connection capability are then discussed from the point of view of very small Open Systems.",

    "abstract": "In distributed systems surveillance protocols are used for monitoring the status of remote sites. A remote site is regarded as being available as long as messages are received from this site, otherwise it is regarded as being unavailable. If a site becomes unavailable, this will be reported to other sites and recovery actions can be initiated. Using an example it will be shown that in certain cases it is necessary, that whenever some site S1 detects the unavailability of some other site S2, within a fixed amount of time S2 must also have detected an unavailability of S1. Unfortunately, this cannot be guaranteed by existing surveillance protocols. Another problem with existing protocols is, that remote sites are usually reported as being unavailable after being timed out only once, i.e. the loss of just one message might cause complete systems to back out. Two versions of a protocol for so-called symmetric surveillance are presented. Both guarantee, that if S1 detects the unavailability of S2 at time t0, then S2 (provided that S2 has not crashed) will become aware of this fact at t1 such that [t1 - t0] &lt; Δ. This property is of special interest for handling network partitionings. Additionally, one of the versions is tunable, i.e. it can be specified, how many timeouts may occur before a site is regarded as being unavailable.",

The DMS plan has a target architecture, for the year 2008, that integrates those separate systems, uses CCITT X.400 message handling and X.500 directory services, and provides writer-to-reader security with the Secure Data Network System developed by the National Security Agency. The implementation strategy has three phases that extend over 20 years. The plan has an indirect but strong effect on the Internet outside DoD.",

As a result an efficient Stream Traffic Protocol using hybrid switching and implicit token passing is designed. The performance of the protocol both for voice and data is analysed using a discrete event simulation model. The protocol increases the system capacity for voice while the strict real-time constraints for its transmission are still met. It supports a number of subscribers comparable with the equivalent to the capacity of a small PABX, with a good performance for data.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces Wiretap, an experimental routing algorithm which computes maximum-likelihood diversity routes for packet-radio stations sharing a common broadcast channel, but with some stations hidden from others. The wiretapper observes the paths (source routes) used by other stations sending traffic on the channel and, using a heuristic set of factors and weights, constructs speculative paths for its own traffic. The algorithm is presented as an example of maximum-likelihood routing and database management techniques useful for richly connected networks of mobile stations. Of particular interest are the mechanisms to compute, select, rank and cache a potentially large number of speculative routes when only limited computational resources are available.A prototype implementation has been constructed and tested for the AX.25 packet-radio channel now in widespread use in the amateur-radio community. Its design is similar in many respects to the SPF algorithm used in the ARPANET and NSFNET backbone networks, and is in fact a variation of the Viterbi algorithm, which constructs maximum-likelihood paths on a graph according to a weighted sum of factors assigned to the nodes and edges.",

    "abstract": "The MT35 is a digital exchange. It handles subscribers lines and transit traffic. It features a modular structure based on interconnected terminal sites (TS). Each TS has full call handling capability, and can support up to 1500 subscribers; the overall control is handled by two microsynchronized Motorola M68000 microprocessors. Up to 15 TSs may be point to point connected to form a MT35 exchange. There is no shared memory between TSs: communication is over TDM links (Time Division Multiplex, 2 Mb/s) carrying both data (messages between sites) and digitalized voice. It is a loosely coupled architecture (JEN), as compared to an architecture as CM* (SWA). The overall system operational data, including subscriber tables, equipment configuration, supervision and maintenance data, is handled by the exchange as a distributed data base (BOC, COR). Each TS holds a part of this data base in its private memory: it includes local objects (e.g. equipment or subscriber descriptors) and an image of non-local objects (e.g. routing tables or configuration data). A single special TS, in which telephony equipment is replaced by I/O peripherals, called Management and Maintenance Site (MMS) maintains an up-to-date copy of the data base on secondary storage. It supports operator interface, coordinates update operations on non-local objects, TS programs and data base loading. The execution of a function (e.g. call establishment, operator request, etc.) results in the creation of a transaction, which generally spans over several sites, according to the location of the resources involved (e.g. caller and called party).",

Running an independent copy of the protocol on each of these channels would be undesirable, since each user would have to select one channel to monitor for packets addressed to it, inducing a logical partitioning of the user population into N groups. To preserve the logical connectivity of the network, we examine the effect of separating packet transmissions into two parts, a short preamble, which is sent over a public channel, and followed by the body, &gt; which is sent over a private channel. We assume that m of the available codes are used as preamble channels, and the remaining N - m codes are used for actual packet transmissions. If m (@@@@) N , then the network can support broadcast and multicast packets, and still make use of all of the available channels.",

One of these, the DRAMA protocol, is based on broadband technology and allows for dynamic allocation of bandwidth to clusters of nodes in the total network. In this paper we propose a distributed algorithm to allocate bandwidth in a fair manner, where we have defined fair to mean that every node in the network, regardless of its location, should have the same expected access delay to the net. We show by means of simulation that the algorithm is stable and within a few percentage points of the optimal solution. Stability is measured in terms of the time it takes the system to return to near optimal distribution of the bandwidth after strong disturbances. The algorithm is shown to handle total reallocation of the resources within O(100ms).",

Research interests in development of the network have been focused on resource name managing, Japanese character handling and communication technologies. For the name managements, the hierarchical domain concept is employed to construct a name space for the network, and a mechanism for text message exchange is implemented using the concept. An environment for text message exchange using Japanese characters is achieved as results of general discussions to handle 16-bit Kanji codes in computers. Efficient data transmissions with the high speed modems are achieved by a new UUCP protocol and the dial-up IP link mechanism developed with a tty driver which provides host-to-modem flow control mechanism. As the result of researches described above, JUNET currently connects various types of organizations relating computer science which are 87 organizations with more than 250 computers in number. It connects universities and major research laboratories in Japan, and the protocols currently used are TCP/IP over leased lines as well as dial-up lines, and UUCP over dial-up lines. The services such as electronic mail and network news have been provided since the network was started, and special technologies for Japanese character handling, name servers, and multimedia mail supports have been developed. In this paper, the current status of JUNET and its research results in development of the network are described.",

Protocol compilers usually produce inefficient code both in terms of code speed and code size. In this paper, we show that the combination of two techniques makes it possible to build protocol compilers that generate efficient code. These techniques are i) the use of a compiler that generates from the specification a unique tree-shaped automaton (rather than multiple independent automata), and ii) the use of optimization techniques applied at the automaton level, i.e. on the branches of the trees.We have developed a protocol compiler that uses both these techniques. The compiler takes as input a protocol specification written in the synchronous language Esterel. The specification is compiled into a unique automaton by the Esterel front end compiler. The automaton is then optimized and converted into C code by our protocol optimizer called HIPPCO. HIPPCO improves code performance and reduces code size by simultaneously optimizing the performance of the common path and optimizing the size of the uncommon path. We evaluate the gain expected with our approach on a real-life example, namely a working subset of the TCP protocol generated from an Esterel specification. We compare the protocol code generated with our approach to that derived from the standard BSD TCP implementation. The results are very encouraging. HIPPCO-generated code executes up to 25 % fewer instructions than the BSD code for input packet processing while maintaining comparable code size.",

    "abstract": "The bridge algorithm adopted by the IEEE 802.1 committee for interconnecting 802 LANs requires the topology of the Extended LAN to be a Spanning Tree. A distributed algorithm to compute a spanning tree dynamically has already been published [1], and adopted by the IEEE 802.1 committee [2]. In this paper, however, we describe an alternative distributed algorithm to compute a spanning tree. This algorithm, variants of which have been implemented, initially appears simpler than the IEEE 802.1 algorithm; we show, however, that it has subtle failure modes that makes it unattractive in practice. We also show that some failure modes of the Spanning Tree Algorithm introduced in this paper are characteristic of a broader class of distributed graph algorithms. Such algorithms potentially examine all possible path combinations between a source and destination in a graph. Thus, they suffer from exponential message overhead in topologies that have an exponential number of paths between source and destination. Attempts to fix this problem lead to extra complexity (in terms of CPU, bandwidth, memory) when compared to other algorithms. We briefly describe a second example belonging to this class, and propose that designers avoid such algorithms if restricting the topology or scale of the network is unacceptable.",

The priority mechanism is implemented using a reservation scheme whereby packets attempt to reserve the token. We present an analytic model that predicts mean delay for each priority level. We show that operation of the priority mechanism is not free; that is, there is a well-defined cost (measured in terms of increased average message delay) associated with its implementation, and that in general there is minimal discrimination made between the various priority levels. We also show that the cost of the priority mechanism is an easily computable function of various network parameters. One of the circumstances where the priority mechanism results in a large discrimination between priorities is when service is limited to a single packet per received token. We show that single-packet-per-token service is necessary (but not sufficient) to gain maximum benefit from priority operation. Our main conclusion is that the network user will not, in general, receive much benefit from the priority mechanism since the priority mechanism can in fact increase slightly the delay for all priorities. The exception to this statement occurs when the network is operating under fairly extreme conditions which are well defined, and which we believe are unlikely in most installations.",

These dynamic directory services provide more timely and accurate information about network resources than static tables. A wide variety of services address various components of the resource discovery and location problem. These services can be loosely classified as either low-level protocols or high-level services. Low-level protocols, such as RARP and ICMP, are simple delivery protocols and provide limited information; high-level services, such as the Internet Domain Name System and X.500, use complex delivery protocols to answer complex queries. Neither class of directory service is appropriate in all situations.

We examine the use of a group random access protocol based on time windows for achieving time-constrained communication in a multiple access environment. First, we formulate a policy for controlling protocol operation in order to minimize the percentage of messages with waiting times greater than some given bound. A semi-Markov decision model is then developed for protocol operation and three of the four optimal control elements of this policy are then determined. Although the semi-Markov decision model can also be used to obtain performance results, the procedure is too computationally expensive to be of practical use. Thus, an alternate performance model based on a centralized queueing system with impatient customers is developed. Protocol performance under the optimal elements of the control policy shows significant improvements over cases in which the protocol is not controlled in this manner. Simulation results are also presented to corroborate the analytic results.",

    "abstract": "In a computer network, the transport layer uses the service offered by the network layer and in turn offers its users the transport service of reliable connection management and data transfer. We provide a formal specification of the transport service in terms of an event-driven system and safety and progress properties. We construct three verified transport protocols that offer the transport service. The first transport protocol assumes a perfect network service, the second assumes loss-only network service, and the third assumes loss, reordering and duplication network service. Our transport service specifications are very realistic. Each user can be closed, listening, active opening, passive opening, open, or closing. A local incarnation number uniquely identifies every active opening and listening duration. Users can issue requests for connection, listening, closing, data send, etc. The transport layer issues indications for successful or unsuccessful connection, closing, data reception, etc. A connection is established only if one user requested the connection and the other was listening, or both requested the connection. A user receives data only from the appropriate incarnation of the distant user, and receives it insequence, without loss or duplication. Progress properties ensure that every outstanding user request is eventually responded to by an appropriate transport indication. Our protocols are constructed by stepwise refinement of the transport service. The construction method automatically generates a verification that the protocols satisfy the transport service. One distinctive feature of our protocol construction is that the events and verification of the data transfer function is directly obtained from any one of the numerous verified single-incarnation data transfer protocols already presented in the literature.",

We present the Pulsar switch, a non-blocking design based on a high-spin-rate, port-dedicated, word-parallel, shift-register ring. Several design alternatives address the problem of Head-Of-Line blocking. In contrast to Batcher-Banyan switches, access to the ring is asynchronous which facilitates low delay and arbitrary packet length. The switch can support ATM cells simultaneously with packets sized for applications such as single characters, memory words, disk blocks, memory pages, or video images. Pulsar can be used as a high-throughput computer backplane replacement. The design can be implemented with existing high-speed circuit technology.",

This paper presents two extensions to Hoare's CSP that are felt by the author to provide suitable mechanisms for specifying protocol performance. Firstly, the effects of introducing time into CSP are presented, based on the work done by Reed and Roscoe. Secondly, the traces model is modified by associating probabilities with event sequences. Finally, some example specifications are given using these two extensions.",

In particular, we distinguish physical multiplexing of resources from logical multiplexing of streams. Both physical-resource multiplexing and logical multiplexing determine the service that can be provided by a communication system. We also discuss two issues affected by logical multiplexing - flow control and the relationship between control and data streams of a connection. We conclude that the granularity of physical resource sharing must be fine enough to meet the jitter and latency constraints of demanding applications. Also, high speed communication systems should restrict their logical multiplexing to layer 3.",

This architecture defines routing in the OSI network layer, functionally partitions the problem into its components, defines a routing hierarchy and an address hierarchy and discusses their relationship, and discusses arms-length routing relationships between differently administered networks. This paper presents that architecture, and discusses problems which remain to be solved as work progresses towards a global OSI network.",

The second solution, geared towards computing environments supporting public-key cryptographic systems , permits the simultaneous protection of the code and data areas of mobile agents that travel in an information network. This latter protection mechanism can be implemented using any asymmetric cryptosystem.We believe the protection strategies we have developed in our investigation are the first complete solution for the protection of mobile agents in distributed computing environments.",

The HTTP protocol is described as well as the different interactions between the web server, the communication components, and the web client application. The first measure is based on the time it takes for the web server application to deliver an object to its operating system, keeping in mind the buffer effect of the server network. The second measure also considers the inter-arrival times to the server application of the GET requests for the objects that are part of a web page. We propose formulas, validated experimentally, that relate the proposed measurements in the server with the different components that take part in a web transaction and the service time experienced by clients. We have carried out several experiments to evaluate the validity of the proposed measurements and the best measure estimates the service time of the client with an error below 20% for 90% of the requests. We observed a cyclic component in the measurements of the server that can simplify the estimation of future values. For this reason, the proposed measures may be used to know what is the service time the client perceives in each visit to a server. It can also be used by content distribution networks to choose between several replica located in different places in the Internet.",

After we modified this factor, we reviewed the features of the scheduler again.

    "abstract": "Naïve pictures of the Internet frequently portray a small collection of hosts or LAN's connected by a \"cloud\" of connectivity. The truth is more complex. The IP-level structure of the Internet is composed from a large number of constituent networks, each of which differs in some or all of transmission technologies, routing protocols, administrative models, security policies, QoS capabilities, pricing mechanisms, and similar attributes. On top of this, a whole new structure of application-layer overlays and content distribution networks, equally diverse in the sorts of ways mentioned above, is rapidly evolving. Virtually any horizontal slice through the current Internet structure reveals a loosely coupled federation of separately defined, operated, and managed entities, interconnected to varying degrees, and often differing drastically in internal requirements and implementation. Intuitively, it is natural to think of each of these entities as existing in a region of the network, with each region having coherent internal technology and policies, and each region managing its interactions with other regions of the net according to some defined set of rules and policies.In this paper, we propose that a key design element in an architecture for extremely large scale, wide distribution and heterogeneous networks is a grouping and partitioning mechanism we call the region . Furthermore we postulate that such a mechanism can provide increased functionality and management of existing unresolved problems in current networks. The paper both describes a proposed definition of the region concept and explores the utility of such a mechanism through a series of examples. We claim that there is significant added benefit to generalizing the idea of the region .",

    "abstract": "DNSSEC has been in development for 20 years. It provides for provable security when retrieving domain names through the use of a public key infrastructure (PKI). Unfortunately, there is also significant overhead involved with DNSSEC: verifying certificate chains of signed DNS messages involves extra computation, queries to remote resolvers, additional transfers, and introduces added latency into the DNS query path. We pose the question: is it possible to achieve practical security without always verifying this certificate chain if we use a different, outside source of trust between resolvers? We believe we can. Namely, by using a long-lived, mutually authenticated TLS connection between pairs of DNS resolvers, we suggest that we can maintain near-equivalent levels of security with very little extra overhead compared to a non-DNSSEC enabled resolver. By using a reputation system or probabilistically verifying a portion of DNSSEC responses would allow for near-equivalent levels of security to be reached, even in the face of compromised resolvers.",

We implement a prototype of GuideLoc using ArduCopter and evaluate the performance by simulations and experiments. Experimental results show that GuideLoc achieves an average location accuracy of 2.7 meters and reduces flight distance more than 50% compared with other known wireless localization approaches using UAV.",

    "abstract": "To build large and scalable setups, researchers usually employ mixed testbeds of regular SDR devices and cheaper, generally less flexible COTS devices. Such hybrid setups often face uncontrollable interference from other users in the ISM bands, which leads to incomparable results and requires frequent repetitions of experiments. Maintaining the ability to use COTS devices and ISM band-only SDR devices while moving experiments to less crowded frequency bands is thus of high interest to practical wireless communications research. In this paper we present whiteLAN, a frequency converter that enables IEEE 802.11b/g devices to operate over UHF frequencies. We discuss the advantages of a ISM-UHF converter setup, present the hardware architecture of our solution, and provide key performance metrics of the physical implementation. Through a comparative study of ISM vs. UHF operations we show that whiteLAN is viable for use as a plug-and-play extension for wireless research deployments.",

However, the trust issues that arise from a centralized system are particularly damaging to the \"Web democracy\" that social news sites are meant to provide. In this poster, we present cliq, a decentralized social news curator. cliq is a P2P based social news curator that provides private and unbiased reporting. All users in cliq share responsibility for tracking and providing popular content. Any user data that cliq needs to store is also managed across the network.

However, their impact so far has been limited due to complex programming tools.

In this demo we present our novel SDR programming environment called Ziria. Ziria consists of a novel programming language and an optimizing compiler. The compiler is able to synthesize very efficient SDR code from high-level PHY descriptions written in Ziria language. To illustrate its potential, we present the design of an LTE-like PHY layer in Ziria. We run it on the Sora SDR platform and demonstrate on a test-bed that it is able to operate in real-time.",

Algorithmics is the servant of abstraction, allowing system performance to approach that of the underlying hardware, sometimes by using efficient algorithms but often by simply leveraging other aspects of the system. I will survey the trajectory of network algorithmics starting with a focus on speed and scale in the 1990s to measurement and security in the 2000s. While doing so, I will reflect on my experiences in choosing problems and conducting research. I will conclude by describing my passion for the emerging field of network verification and its confluence with programming language research. George Varghese worked at DEC designing DECNET protocols before obtaining his Ph.D. in 1992 from MIT. He worked from 1993-1999 at Washington University and from 1999 to 2012 at UCSD, both as professor of computer science. He joined Microsoft Research as a Principal Researcher in 2012. He won the ONR Young Investigator Award in 1996, and was elected to be a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in 2002. He helped design the 40 Gbps forwarding engine for Procket Networks, subsequently acquired by Cisco Systems. His book \"Network Algorithmics\" was published in December 2004 by Morgan-Kaufman. He co-founded NetSift Inc. in May 2004. NetSift was acquired by Cisco in 2005. He was the 2014 winner of the IEEE Koji Kobayashi Computers and Communications Award",

We propose a new architecture, called Application Independent Information Infrastructure (AI3). The design goals of AI3 are: 1) Decoupling users' data from ASPs and users' social relations from ASPs, such that ASPs become independent from users' data and social relations. 2) Open architecture, such that different ASPs can interoperate with each other. This demo is to show a prototype of AI3. The demo has four parts: 1) ASPindependent data management in AI3; 2) ASP-independent management of users' social relations in AI3; 3) inter-domain data transport and user roaming; 4) real-time communications by using AI3.

However, as more and more data-transfer formats of network protocols and applications are encoded at the bit-level, byte-level signatures are losing their effectiveness in traffic classification. In this poster, we creatively construct bit-level signatures by associating the bit-values with their bit-positions in each traffic flow. Furthermore, we present BitMiner, an automated traffic mining tool that can mine application signatures at the most fine-grained bit-level granularity. Our preliminary test on popular peer-to-peer (P2P) applications, e.g. Skype, Google Hangouts, PPTV, eMule, Xunlei and QQDownload, reveals that although they all have no byte-level signatures, there are significant bit-level signatures hidden in their traffic.",

It allows to compare solutions to the problem of ordering multicast messages in an identical way at all receiving sites when multiple senders operate concurrently. A new type of delay measure called Synchronization Delay forms the basis for this framework. It filters out network-dependent factors and accounts precisely for the excess delay that user messages suffer in order to achieve the ordering property. The usefulness of the evaluation framework is demonstrated by applying it to three protocols covered in the literature. As an example their delay behavior is analyzed for low-traffic environments. The evaluation results allow a user to choose the most suitable protocol for his application.",

    "abstract": "Applications to be supported on broadband networks exhibit a wide range of traffic statistics and many of them are sensitive to delay and loss violations. To accurately estimate admissible workload and bandwidth requirement, a detailed traffic model, HAP (Hierarchical Arrival Process) is proposed in this paper. Packets generated from HAP are modulated by processes at user, application, and message levels. This model is a generalization of on-off traffic models and is shown to be equivalent to a special class of MMPP (Markov Modulated Poisson Process). Three algorithmic methods along with simulations are applied to evaluate the queueing performance under HAP traffic. Delay under HAP traffic can be well over tens of times higher than Poisson traffic, depending on parameters and load. Congestion may persist for minutes. HAP's dramatic short-term behavior explains the occasional congestion in the real networks. Conventional traffic models, however, do not exhibit this behavior. With these results, we give implications for broadband network control.",

The committee also decides the questions to be considered in the following study period. The recommendations of the CCITT has very strong standing internationally, and to a large extent they are being used also as guidelines for national network development. In the field of data transmission the well established cooperation with bodies representing computer users and manufacturers has made it possible to develop widely recognized interface specifications between telecommunications/computing equipment and functions. Between the plenary meetings of the CCITT the detailed work is being carried out in a number of Study Groups. There is one special group for data transmission techniques over the existing telegraph and telephone networks \"SG Special A\" (they make all the modem specifications), and one younger one for new digital data transmission networks, the \"SG VII\". Members of these study groupes are the telecommunications administrations and operating companies (\"carriers\"), manufacturers of equipment and cooperating international organisations. These groups meet once or twice a year.",

However, refraction networking faces major practical challenges due to performance issues and various attacks (e.g., routing-around-the-decoy and fingerprinting). Given that many sites are now hosted in the cloud, data centers offer an advantageous setting to implement refraction networking due to the physical proximity and similarity of hosted sites. We propose REDACT, a novel class of refraction networking solutions where the decoy router is a border router of a multi-tenant data center and the decoy and covert sites are tenants within the same data center. We highlight one specific example REDACT protocol, which leverages TLS session resumption to address the performance and implementation challenges in prior refraction networking protocols. REDACT also offers scope for other designs with different realistic use cases and assumptions.",

Although it was in an excellent location in the city center of Nice with views to the sea, it suffered from poor Internet connectivity. In this paper we describe what happened to the network at CoNEXT and explain why Internet connectivity is usually a problem at small hotel venues. Next we highlight the usual issues with the network equipment that leads to the general network dissatisfaction of conference attendees. Finally we describe how we alleviated the problem by offloading network services and all network traffic into the cloud while supporting over 100 simultaneous connected devices on a single ADSL link with a device that is rated to only support around 15-20. Our experience shows that with simple offloading of certain network services, small conference venues with limited budget no longer have to be plagued by the usual factors that lead to an unsatisfactory Internet connectivity experience.",

    "abstract": "There have been many recent discussions within the computer science community on the relative roles of conferences and journals [1, 2, 3]. They clearly offer different forums for the dissemination of scientific and technical ideas, and much of the debate has been on if and how to leverage both. These are important questions that every conference and journal ought to carefully consider, and the CoNEXT Steering Committee recently initiated a discussion on this topic. The main focus of the discussion was on how to on one hand maintain the high quality of papers accepted for presentation at CoNEXT, and on the other hand improve the conference's ability to serve as a timely forum where new and exciting but not necessarily polished or fully developed ideas could be presented. Unfortunately, the stringent \"quality control\" that prevails during the paper selection process of selective conferences, including CoNEXT, often makes it difficult for interesting new ideas to break-through. To make it, papers need to ace it along three major dimensions, namely, technical correctness and novelty, polish of exposition and motivations, and completeness of the results. Most if not all hot-off-the-press papers will fail in at least one of those dimensions. On the other hand, there are conferences and workshops that target short papers. Hotnets is one of such venues that has attracted short papers presenting new ideas. However, from a community viewpoint, Hotnets has several limitations. First, Hotnets is an invitation-only workshop. Coupled with a low acceptance rate, this limits the exposure of Hotnets papers to the community. Second, Hotnets has never been held outside North-America. The SIGCOMM and CoNEXT workshops are also a venue where short papers can be presented and discussed. However, these workshops are focussed on a specific subdomain and usually do not attract a broad audience. The IMC short papers are a more interesting model because short and regular papers are mixed in the single track conference. This ensures broad exposure for the short papers, but the scope of IMC is much smaller than CoNEXT. In order to address this intrinsic tension that plagues all selective conferences, CoNEXT 2013 is introducing a short paper category with submissions requested through a logically separate call-for-papers. The separate call for paper is meant to clarify to both authors and TPC members that short papers are to be judged using different criteria. Short papers will be limited to six (6) two-column pages in the standard ACM conference format. Most importantly, short papers are not meant to be condensed versions of standard length papers and neither are they targeted at traditional \"position papers.\" In particular, papers submitted as regular (long) papers will not be eligible for consideration as short papers. Instead, short paper submissions are intended for high-quality technical works that either target a topical issue that can be covered in 6 pages, or are introducing a novel but not fully flushed out idea that can benefit from the feedback that early exposure can provide. Short papers will be reviewed and selected through a process distinct from that of long papers and based on how good a match they are for the above criteria. As alluded to, this separation is meant to address the inherent dilemma faced by highly selective conferences, where reviewers typically approach the review process looking for reasons to reject a paper (how high are the odds that a paper is in the top 10-15%?). For that purpose, Program Committee members will be reminded that completeness of the results should NOT be a criterion used when assessing short papers. Similarly, while an unreadable paper is obviously not one that should be accepted, polish should not be a major consideration either. As long as the paper manages to convey its idea, a choppy presentation should not by itself be ground for rejecting a paper. Finally, while technical correctness is important, papers that maybe claim more than they should, are not to be disqualified simply on those grounds. As a rule, the selection process should focus on the \"idea\" presented in the paper. If the idea is new, or interesting, or unusual, etc., and is not fundamentally broken, the paper should be considered. Eventual acceptance will ultimately depend on logistics constraints (how many such papers can be presented), but the goal is to offer a venue at CoNEXT where new, emerging ideas can be presented and receive constructive feedback. The CoNEXT web site 1 provide additional information on the submission process of short (and regular) papers.",

First, with the aid of YouTube traces collected inside operational residential networks, we identify the characteristics of real traffic that need to be considered or can be safely neglected in order to accurately predict the performance of a cache. Second, we propose a new parsimonious traffic model, named the Shot Noise Model (SNM), that enables users to natively capture the dynamics of content popularity, whilst still being sufficiently simple to be employed effectively for both analytical and scalable simulative studies of caching systems. Finally, our results show that the SNM presents a much better solution to account for the temporal locality observed in real traffic compared to existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "The growing prevalence of broadband Internet access around the world has made understanding the performance and reliability of broadband access networks extremely important. To better understand the performance anomalies that arise in broadband access networks, we have deployed hundreds of routers in home broadband access networks around the world and are studying the performance of these networks. One of the performance pathologies that we have observed is correlated, sudden latency increases simultaneously and to multiple destinations. In this work, we provide an preliminary glimpse into these sudden latency increases and attempt to understand their causes. Although we do not isolate root cause in this study, observing the sets of destinations that experience correlated latency increases can provide important clues as to the locations in the network that may be inducing these pathologies. We present an algorithm to better identify the network locations that are likely responsible for these pathologies. We then analyze latency data from one month across our home router deployment to determine where in the network latency issues are arising, and how those pathologies differ across regions, ISPs, and countries. Our preliminary analysis suggests that most latency pathologies are to a single destination and a relatively small percentage of these pathologies are likely in the last mile, suggesting that peering within the network may be a more likely culprit for these pathologies than access link problems.",

Isolation between such services is ensured by virtualization. We demonstrate a prototype of our ( SHG ). It is based on the hardware platform that will be used for future home gateways.

Existing systems rely on mechanisms and metrics that fail to effectively utilize all available sources of bandwidth in the network. This paper presents a novel metric, called the Content Propagation Metric (CPM), for quantitatively evaluating the marginal benefit of available bandwidth to competing consumers, enabling efficient utilization of the bandwidth resource. The metric is simple to implement, imposes only a modest overhead, and can be retrofitted easily into existing content distribution systems. We have designed and implemented a high-performance content distribution system, called V-Formation, based on the CPM. The CPM guides V-Formation toward a global allocation of bandwidth that maximizes the aggregate download bandwidth of consumers. Results from a PlanetLab deployment and extensive simulations show that V-Formation achieves high aggregate bandwidth and that the CPM enables hosts to converge quickly on a stable allocation of resources in a wide range of deployment scenarios.",

Modern routers use general purpose programmable processors, and the software used for packet processing on these systems is potentially vulnerable to remote exploits. We describe a specific attack that can launch a devastating denial-of-service attack by sending just a single packet. We also show that there are effective defense techniques, based on processor monitoring, that can help in detecting and avoiding such attacks.",

    "abstract": "Exchanging the channel state information (CSI) in a multiuser WLAN is considered an extremely expensive overhead. A possible solution to reduce the overhead is to notify the analog value of the CSI, which is also known as analog channel feedback . It however only allows nodes to overhear an imperfect channel information. While some previous studies have theoretically analyzed the performance of analog channel feedback, this work aims at addressing issues of realizing it in practice and empirically demonstrating its effectiveness. Our prototype implementation using USRP-N200 shows that analog channel feedback produces a small error comparable to that of estimating CSI using reciprocity, but however can be applied to more general scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Data is the basis of the modern information society. However, recent natural catastrophes have shown that it is not possible to definitively secure a data storage location. Even if the storage location is not destroyed itself the access may quickly become impossible, due to the breakdown of connections or power supply. However, this rarely happens without any warning. While floods have hours or days of warning time, tsunamis usually leave only minutes for reaction and for earthquakes there are only seconds. In such situations, timely evacuation of important data is the key challenge. Consequently, the focus lies on minimizing the time to move away all data from the storage location whereas the actual time to arrival remains less (but still) important. This demonstration presents the dynamic fast send protocol (DFSP), a new bulk data transfer protocol. It employs striping to dynamic intermediate nodes in order to minimize sending time and to utilize the sender's resources to a high extent.",

The experiment results shows our scheme can improve the system lifetime by 27%, and provide better throughput as well as lower loss rate than conversional 3G systems do.",

    "abstract": "On numerous occasions, trips to the facilities coincide with an important mobile phone call. Due to the sleek and polished nature of modern phones, attempting to promptly deal with such calls can occasionally lead to the phone sliding through the owner's hands, surrendering to the force of gravity and flying down the hole. This is a disaster, and often an expensive incident. It can also be a health and safety hazard, with the owner desperately attempting to retrieve their phone and re-using it. This paper provides a first attempt at a cell phone recovery system using the modern functionalities of Toto Japanese toilets. In our approach, the phone is calmly recovered, sanitized and retrieved by the user. This can all happen without the call even being dropped, with possibility of secure back-up of the user data by embedded sensor and Wi-Fi network connectivity in the toilet. We envision that such an approach will increase the collaboration between Japanese, European and American mobile operators, network researchers and hardware manufacturers.",

    "abstract": "In all seriousness, Differential Privacy is a new technique and set of tools for managing responses to statistical queries over secured data, in such a way that the user cannot reconstruct more precise identification of principles in the dataset beyond a formally well-specified bound. This means that personally sensitive data such as Internet packet traces or social network measurements can be shared between researchers without invading personal privacy, and that assurances can be made with accuracy. With less seriousness, I would like to talk about Differential Piracy , but not without purpose. For sure, while there are legitimate reasons for upstanding citizens to live without fear of eternal surveillance, there is also a segment of society that gets away with things they shouldn't, under a cloak. Perhaps that is the (modest) price we have to pay for a modicum less paranoia in this brave new world. So, there has been a lot of work recently on Piracy Preserving Queries and Differential Piracy. These two related technologies exploit new ideas in statistical security. Rather than security through obscurity, the idea is to offer privacy through lack of differentiation (no, not inability to perform basic calculus, more the inability to distinguish between large numbers of very similar things).",

    "abstract": "As researchers we have a duty to communicate our ideas. As communications researchers, we are privileged to study the technology and phenomena that are so transforming human society. We seek to understand and enhance the very tools with which we can convey our contributions to human knowledge. In Japan there is a mode of presentation called, Pecha Kucha, where speakers present 20 images for 20 seconds each, as a way to convey new experimental thoughts effectively. I am going to present 12 ideas, each one in that spirit. Rather than a retrospective of my work, or a vision for a possible future Internet Architectures, I want to engage in what I do in my daily work with graduate students, thinking of problems that need solving in existing communications systems, or simply new ways to build communications systems. I do not expect more than one or two of these ideas to make it past first base, but there is value in learning how to apply one's critical faculties even when filtering out bad ideas. Metcalfe's law is that the value of the network is the square of the number of participants since each participant contributes new input for all other participants. In an Internet of ideas, then, this value is only achieved if we contribute our ideas freely. Researchers censor ideas for various reasons, including that a new communications system must have a business case. The Internet itself (the Web, Facebook and Twitter) was created without any business case. Many startups end up in a business that is nothing to do with the one-pager or elevator pitch they presented to the venture capitalists. We have no business filtering out ideas except if they are simply bad. So here are my twelve research elevator pitches.",

    "abstract": "Today's inter-domain routing protocol, the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), is increasingly complicated and fragile due to policy misconfiguration by individual autonomous systems (ASes). Existing configuration analysis techniques are either manual and tedious, or do not scale beyond a small number of nodes due to the state explosion problem. To aid the diagnosis of misconfigurations in real-world large BGP systems, this paper presents BGPVerif , a reduction based analysis toolkit. The key idea is to reduce BGP system size prior to analysis while preserving crucial correctness properties. BGPVerif consists of two components, NetReducer that simplifies BGP configurations, and NetAnalyzer that automatically detects routing oscillation. BGPVerif accepts a wide range of BGP configuration inputs ranging from real-world traces (Rocketfuel network topologies), randomly generated BGP networks (GT-ITM), Cisco configuration guidelines, as well as arbitrary user-defined networks. BGPVerif illustrates the applicability, efficiency, and benefits of the reduction technique, it also introduces an infrastructure that enables networking researchers to interact with advanced formal method tool.",

We consider two primary usage scenarios: (1) enabling a local voice communication within a village-like setting, in developing regions (2) supporting an on-site local communication among a team of users e.g. during emergency response systems. While there is plentiful literature on the use of TDMA for multi-hop wireless mesh networks, a practical multi-hop TDMA system remains elusive. Our contributions in this regard are three-fold. (1) We demonstrate the working of an 802.15.4-based low-cost, low-power, local communication system (referred as Lo3) using custom made handsets and off-the-shelf platforms. (2) We show the practicability of LiT: a full-fledged TDMA-based multi-hop, multi-channel MAC protocol for real-time applications; especially on resource constrained platforms, (3) We present implementation-based evaluations results of LiT and show that our protocol achieves practical synchronization, and robust operation in the face of wireless packet errors.

Splitting the configuration space into equivalence classes allows the identification of which parameter combinations lead to protocol stability, and which do not. This ahead-of-time analysis generates a predicate, in the form of a combination of linear integer inequalities, which can be used in several complementary ways by downstream applications. Examples presented include warning operators about errors in advance, recovery from protocol oscillation, plotting a series of safe parameter changes, and understanding the dynamics of the routing system.",

Signpost names exist in the DNSSEC hierarchy, and resolve to secure end-points when accessed by existing DNS clients. Signpost clients intercept user connection intentions while adding privacy and multipath support. Signpost servers co-ordinate clients to dynamically discover routes and overcome the middleboxes that pervade modern edge networks. The demo will show a simple scenario where an individual's personal devices (phone, laptop) are interconnected via Signposts while sitting on different networks behind various middleboxes. As a result they will be able to fetch and push data between each other, demonstrated by, e.g., simple web browsing, even as the network configuration changes.",

    "abstract": "A PHY and MAC protocol for MIMO concurrent transmissions, called Contrabass , is presented. Concurrent transmissions, also referred to as multi-user MIMO, are simultaneous transmissions by multiple interfering nodes over the same carrier frequency. Concurrent transmissions technique has the potential of mitigating the overhead of MAC protocols by amortizing protocol overhead among multiple packets. However, existing proposals for concurrent transmissions could not achieve this as MIMO channel training and collision avoidance typically involve an expensive process of coordination and control message exchanges. This overhead has made MIMO concurrent transmission Impractical and thus unused in real applications. Contrabass implements simultaneous channel training and optimal transmission control without any coordination. As a result, Contrabass achieves very high aggregate throughput, low delays and scalability even under dynamic environments and outperforms the existing MIMO protocols. This is the first practical implementation of MIMO-based concurrent transmissions. We implemented Contrabass in GNU radios and also in NS-2.",

Inspired by the optimum route calculation method used in car navigation systems, the compiler toolchain in TRUMP realizes an appropriate MAC solution at runtime. TRUMP allows expressing various types of constraints and options such as speed, energy consumption and packet delivery rate which leads to different MAC compositions. The live demonstration of MAC reconfiguration will be carried out on WARP SDR platform.",

    "abstract": "Virtual Appliances (VAs) are Virtual Machines (VMs) geared towards a specific set of tasks. They require little or no configuration, working out-of-the-box. VAs fit neatly into the Cloud Computing paradigm - many copies of an identical machine can be launched in a data center, or home/business users can grab the appliance they need from the cloud to run locally just for so long as required. Companies and projects whose sole offerings are VAs ready for either desktop or data center use [3, 11] attest to the growing popularity of VAs. VMware's Appliance directory alone currently lists over 1400 VAs available for the VMware family of Virtual Machine Monitors (VMMs) [13]. Current VA distribution generally requires download of the complete virtual disk image, only after which the VA can be run. Given that compressed VA sizes run anywhere from several hundred MB to a few GB, there can be significant delays from the time a user decides he/she wants to run a particular VA until the time that VA can be used. These problems are only exacerbated when demand for particular VAs spikes and server bandwidth resources become the distribution bottleneck.",

There is no unified system to implement these critical features. The access control that does exist on the network doesn't integrate well with user authentication systems, so access control decisions are based on the network location of a computer rather than the privilege level of its user. Just about every layer of the Internet provides optional encryption, yet most data on the Internet continues to be sent in the clear. Application developers routinely make mistakes in security critical code leading to bugs that manifest in worms, malware or provide a doorway for actively malicious attackers. We propose a unified session layer that integrates trustworthiness features into the core of the network. This would reverse the fortunes of security on the Internet and lead us toward a safer, more secure global network.",

This problem can be formulated as a minimum cost multicommodity flow problem. The most efficient linear and integer programming approaches yield programs with memory requirements proportional to the square of the problem size, making impractical their use for large scale problems. In this paper a heuristic method is described which produces suboptimal solutions with smaller execution time requirements, and memory requirements linear with the problem size. Experimental results are presented comparing the proposed method with a Linear Programming approach.",

    "abstract": "Volumes of information available from network information services have been increasing considerably in recent years. Users' satisfaction with an information service depends very much on the quality of the network information retrieval (NIR) system used to retrieve information. The construction of such a system involves two major development areas: user interface design and the implementation of NIR protocols.In this paper we describe and discuss the possibilities of using formal methods of protocol converter design to construct the part of an NIR system client that deals with network communication. If this approach is practicable it can make implementation of NIR protocols more reliable and amenable to automation than traditional designs using general purpose programming languages. This will enable easy implementation of new NIR protocols custom-tailored to specialized NIR services, while the user interface remains the same for all these services.Based on a simple example of implementing the Gopher protocol client we conclude that the known formal methods of protocol converter design are generally not directly applicable for our approach. However, they could be used under certain circumstances when supplemented with other techniques which we propose in the discussion.",

In network simulations, complex dynamical behavior is observed even for simplistic stationary offered loads. An important contributor to the complexity of the network dynamics is the routing system. When a network consists of a large number of nodes, a routing system is applied in order to route traffic in an efficient manner between the nodes. The routing system has an important effect on the resulting network dynamics. This paper will discuss the complex dynamical behavior observed in networks controlled by distributed adaptive routing systems. This methodology can be applied during stability analyses of routing systems and is useful in system-level simulation verification.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we design a protocol to efficiently deliver multicast messages to mobile computers. The main concern in the design of such a protocol is to ensure that each message is delivered exactly once to each mobile host in a multicast group. However, the requirements of avoiding multiple delivery of a message, and of a host not missing a message are not easy to efficiently satisfy in a mobile environment. To satisfy these requirements, an earlier work had to actually broadcast a multicast message. The novelty of our approach is that we satisfy the multicast requirements without broadcasting a message, which is central to the efficiency of our protocol. We structure the mobile support stations (MSS) as a de Bruijn network, and define a multicast tree on the network. A multicast message is routed on a multicast tree on a de Bruijn network. Assuming that there are N MSS's in a network, a multicast group of mobile hosts belong to the cells of N MSS's, &amp;tau; is the maximum of the time to route a message between two adjacent MSS's, &amp;Lambda; is the sum of the mobility rates of all mobiles in a multicast group, &amp;lambda; max is the maximum among the mobility rates, and &amp;phi; is the cell cross-over time of a mobile, our protocol runs with a message complexity of O ( min ( N log N, N ) + &amp;Lambda; log N ) and a communication delay of O (&amp;tau; log N + &amp;lambda; max &amp;phi;). Thus, our protocol is very efficient when a message is multicast to a small number of mobile hosts. To show the practicability of structuring a set of MSS's as a de Bruijn network, we have demonstrated how a de Bruijn network can be emulated as a collection of virtual paths on an arbitrarily connected ATM network.",

    "abstract": "The ideal local area network is a mechanism which provides concurrent high speed error-free data paths over a limited geographical area and between any computational entities on the network. A computational entity may be a program running on any type of computer, any intelligent device, or any terminal. This means that such an ideal network must be able to support systems of cooperating processes within disjoint and dissimilar host environments. Achieving such an ideal heterogeneous network (referred to as an “open” network with respect to the ISO Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnection) may be impossible in the limit. However, the ideal shows promise of being approachable. Recent work in local area networks, protocols, and multiprocessor operating systems looks promising for attacking the problem. This paper first discusses data paths and the dilemma of heterogeneous data communications. Existing local area networks, their functionality, shortcomings, and relationship to networking standards are described. Commercial LANs are discussed and classified. Standards, high level protocols, and operating system concepts are discussed and related to networks. Finally some possible approaches to the implementation of hetergeneous networks are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Datagram services provide a simple, flexible, robust, and scalable communication abstraction; their usefulness has been well demonstrated by the success of IP, UDP, and RPC. Yet, the overwhelming majority of network security protocols that have been proposed are geared towards connection-oriented communications. The few that do cater to datagram communications tend to either rely on long term host-pair keying or impose a session-oriented (i.e., requiring connection setup) semantics.Separately, the concept of flows has received a great deal of attention recently, especially in the context of routing and QoS. A flow characterizes a sequence of datagrams sharing some pre-defined attributes. In this paper, we advocate the use of flows as a basis for structuring secure datagram communications. We support this by proposing a novel protocol for datagram security based on flows. Our protocol achieves zero-message keying, thus preserving the connectionless nature of datagram, and makes use of soft state, thus providing the per-packet processing efficiency of session-oriented schemes. We have implemented an instantiation for IP in the 4.4BSD kernel, and we provide a description of our implementation along with performance results.",

    "abstract": "This paper claims that Shadow Technical Program Committee (TPC) should be organized on a regular basis for attractive conferences in the networking domain. It helps ensuring that young generations of researchers have experience with the process of reviewing and selecting papers before they actually become part of regular TPCs. We highlight several reasons why a shadow TPC offers a unique educational experience, as compared with the two most traditional learning process: \"delegated review\" and \"learn on the job\". We report examples taken from the CoNEXT 2007 shadow TPC and announce the CoNEXT 2008 Shadow TPC",

The conference was technically cosponsored by the IEEE Communications Society and the Information Technology Society within VDE, and in cooperation with ACM SIGCOMM. ITC 28 provided a forum for leading researchers from academia and industry to present and discuss the latest advances and developments in design, modelling, measurement, and performance evaluation of communication systems, networks, and services. The main theme of ITC 28, \\emph{Digital Connected World}, reflects the evolution of communications and networking, which is continually changing the world we are living in. The technical program was composed of 37 contributed full papers, 6 short demo papers and three keynote addresses. Three workshops dedicated to timely topics were sponsored: Programmability for Cloud Networks and Applications, Quality of Experience Centric Management, Quality Engineering for a Reliable Internet of Services.

Then, as CCR is selective and its scope limited to timely works relevant to our community, few technical papers make it above our bar. Finally, I have witnessed a healthy shift away from technical papers towards more thought-provoking editorials over the last few years. We have enough conference and journals for technical papers to find an appropriate venue. On the other hand, our conferences and journals, due to their selective nature and the overly critical nature of the reviewing process, do not lend themselves to welcome thought-provoking and contentious contributions.

Although the agreement to use standard protocols by the various parties involved is the first necessary step towards OSI, it is not sufficient without assuring that the protocols be correctly implemented in the communication equipment. The assessment of the adherence of a communication protocol implementation to its specification relies on testing as its main tool. The development of the tests and their application (the architecture of the test system) have properties and constraints which make them different from those currently created for testing hardware and software systems. In the remainder of the presentation, these constraints and problems as related to the successful development of a protocol test system will be reviewed. They will be separated into those aspects which pertain more to the form of the test support system (the system architecture), and to those which influence the selection of effective test interaction sequences. This division is slightly arbitrary, for some of the issues have effect on both of the above components of the test system.",

In addition, the distributed implementation of the name to address database uncovered several fundamental naming and addressing issues that had been ignore by the original centralized approach. For example, name servers and resolvers must be able to select a reasonable Internet address for hosts connected to the Internet at multiple points. The decentralized solution also raises questions about authority over host names.",

In this paper two, quasistatic techniques, which proved to be robust with respect to overall performance, are compared. The first one, uses \"The Learning Automata\" principle, which is a promising technique regarding its simplisity and ease of implementation. This technique is thoroughly investigated. The second, uses \"The Deterministic Routing\" principle, that is selected for comparison since it uses the deterministic sequence generation like the first one. The goal is to highlight the efficiency of each technique with respect to the other. This have been realized using a simulated 10-nodes sample network to clarify the advantages and defficiencies of each technique. The relative performance of the two algorithms is judged on the basis of delay and blocking probability. The results are in favour of the learning automata specially in cases of networks of big number of nodes.",

    "abstract": "The Department of Defense has embarked on a Protocol Standardization Program aimed at the development of high-level protocol standards for the DoD internetwork environment. A major piece of this standardization program involves the development of the \"DoD Protocol Reference Model\" [1], which will serve to describe a basic framework for future DoD protocol standardization activities. The DoD Reference Model is in many respects similar to the ISO Reference Model [2]; in other respects, there are major differences between the two models. This paper discusses the issues faced during the development of the current draft of the DoD Reference Model. There are four fundamental differences between the DoD and ISO Reference Models: (1) the meaning of \"layer\"; (2) the importance of internetworking; (3) the utility of connectionless services; and (4) the approach to management functions. It has been found that well-designed computer networks have their protocols organized hierarchically. By this we mean that one protocol interpreter provides a communications service to its users by adding value to the services provided by one or more other protocols; and \"good engineering practice\" dictates that at no point should one protocol be implicitly using its own services, i.e. the protocols form a hierarchy. Within the ISO Model, however, this requirement for protocol hierarchies is strengthened into a requirement that protocols fit into \"layers\". This is the origin of a major disagreement between the ISO and DoD Reference Models. Within the ISO Model, the concept of layer has become of paramount importance, overshadowing the more fundamental notion of protocol hierarchy. Good protocol engineering does not require that protocols fit into layers; it is only required that protocols be arranged hierarchically. This latter principle is the basis of the DoD Reference Model. The second fundamental difference between the ISO and DoD Models is the relative importance given to the problems of internetworking. This is most easily seen by considering that the DoD Reference Model has explicitly identified an \"Internet Layer\". Although many efforts based on the ISO work are now taking the Network Layer to include an Internet Sublayer, this seems to confuse rather than clarify the issue (since it raises questions as to the meaning of sublayers). It is also difficult to correctly present the DoD approach to internetting within the confines of the ISO Model due to the ISO Model's lack of emphasis on \"connectionless\" services. This is the third of the fundamental differences between the two models. The primary use of connectionless service within the DoD architecture is for internetting - IP [3] being the paradigm. However, connectionless services are of great utility in other contexts as well. For example, interactions with a Name Server may involve the use of a connectionless protocol within the Transport Layer. The final fundamental difference between the ISO and the DoD Models is the manner in which various management - related functions are treated. Here we refer to functions such as the naming of resources, the control of access to resources, and the accounting for resource and network usage. Many of these functions are most naturally handled via connectionless services, they typically involve entities which are only involved at the initiation or termination of a sequence of data transfers, and many communicants may be involved besides the \"users\". The DoD Model identifies such protocols as typical of \" session\" services. Such protocols are placed within the session layer by virtue of their use of \" transport layer\" services and their common features. Of course, there will be many protocols defined which sit at other locations within the protocol architecture which may play a role in the management of the network and of network resources. It is not implied that all such protocols are most appropriately defined as \"session\" protocols. These are the differences between the two developing Models which are currently identified. Both Models will continue to evolve, most likely in directions which differ in important respects.",

The analysis of the algorithm is presented for the two cases of small number of users and of large number of users. In both cases the analysis shows a considerable improvement for the maximum throughput, which gets larger as the average message length increases. Second, we present the reservation tree algorithm, R-Tree, which uses &amp;test&amp; packets instead of the message's first packet to resolve the collision among users. The R-Tree maximum throughput approaches one as the average message length increases, which for single packet messages can be a maximum throughput of 0.776 for infinite number of users.",

    "abstract": "Consider a message transmission protocol where the sender waits for acknowledgement of each message before sending the next. Obviously this scheme can be modeled by a single server FIFO queue where the clients are the messages, the queue line is the sender's buffer queue and the service time is the delay in getting the message to receiver. Now consider another protocol where the sender does not wait for ack before sending the next message. Messages could be acked selectively and will lead to selective retransmission. The receiver gets the messages in any order and buffers them up for sequential delivery to the user. Messages have to be buffered both at the sender and receiver. The buffer is not a FIFO queue as sequencing and selective retransmission spoil the order at both ends. Can we still model the protocol for total delay using a FIFO queue?",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a topology for local computer networks. Called \"Dragnet\", it is similar to the Ethernet network in function, but rather different in the following respects:1. Instead of a single long bidirectional cable, there are multiple short unidirectional cables.2. Just as an Ethernet network may require some number of signal repeaters to join multiple segments, the proposed system always uses one or more simple concentrator units, each one merging several signals into one.3. Each concentrator unit also provides the facility to silence the lines coming into it, thus providing security against any number of bad (jammed) transmitters. (It is this capability that inspired the name \"Dragnet.\") Most of the remaining good transmitters in the system can continue to send, and all units can receive regardless of the number of errant transmitters.The paper discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the Dragnet approach. The key disadvantage is that the active medium is potentially less reliable than the simplest Ethernet network (one with no repeaters). The key advantages are: simpler, potentially more reliable drivers and receivers; better fault tolerance; and better message verification. In principle, the systems are compatible, and the two might be combined into a hybrid network.",

The approach combines the leaky bucket traffic shaper (a preventive congestion control mechanism) with the loss-load model (a reactive congestion control mechanism). Simulation is used to evaluate the virtual loss-load model, and to compare its performance to that of other reactive congestion control strategies from the literature. The evaluation is done using a benchmark suite of network scenarios proposed by Kanakia, Keshav and Mishra. The performance metrics used in the evaluation are file transfer time and packet loss probability.The simulation results show that the virtual loss-load model is an effective congestion control strategy, providing performance comparable to several other reactive congestion control strategies. While transient effects due to dynamic changes in cross traffic result in significantly higher packet loss than expected in the virtual loss-load model, the parameters of the virtual loss-load model make it directly tunable to trade off packet loss and file transfer time.",

In CSMA/CD protocols, all messages are treated equally in competing for the communication channel. Thus, important or time-critical messages may be severely delayed. In this paper, a new CSMA/CD protocol with message-based priority functions is proposed. A priority code comparison period is needed to determine the highest priority class that can compete for the comunication channel. A contention period based on CSMA/CD scheme is then followed. Both nonpreemptive discipline and preemptive discipline are discussed. In each discipline, both the single mode and the batch mode are considered and compared. The overhead in implementing the proposed protocol, either for a few or for a large number of priority classes, is shown to be minimal. In general, a preemptive single mode scheme provides a better performance. The requirements of hierarchical independence of performance and fairness are satisfied.",

We conclude that an architecture based upon source routing, a link state algorithm, and policy information in the link state advertisements, is best able to address the long-term policy requirements of inter-AD routing.

This paper presents a data processing model to analyze the performance of the Application data receiving process in the Presentation layer. The model is based on a finite pushdown automaton. A scheme is proposed that can determine the memory space and processing time needed by the receiving process for any type of data structure.

The paper discusses the problems of real-time packet video, suggests several techniques to cope with them, and describes some new approaches to the encoding of real-time video communication. The paper describes in more detail several encoding schemes based on this approach, using the 2-dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Section-C describes issues which are arise in the application of packet satellite channels for real-time video communication. Section-D discusses a general approach which addresses these issues. Section-E describes a general methodology for signal coding and compression, and Section-F describes a scheme for the communication of video images using DCT of the raw images in an absolute way, unlike the four differential schemes which are described in Section-G. Section-H describes a scheme which self-corrects the accumulated quantization errors introduced by the encoding and compression. Such errors are totally eliminated for static images.",

While preserving some necessary properties of loops, the algorithm transforms the name graph into one which avoids resolution loops and controls duplications.

From the perspective of network users, lost packets are a waste of resources, and constitute additional burden on them. We use simulation to quantify the effect of packet losses on end-user cost in an internetwork consisting of transit domains with usage based charging policies. Our simulation shows that time based cost, packet based cost and byte based cost are differently affected by the changes in the packet loss probability of the inter-domain route. This will have implications for inter-domain routing protocols.",

It is hoped to show a more powerful loop detect packet based algorithm in this paper.

This leads to the proposal of a new security sublayer (SFRC) which provides Secure Frame Relay Connections. Initially, we discuss the choice behind the placement of the SFRC sublayer within the Frame Relay interface. Then, we present the security services provided by the SFRC sublayer, the structure of the protocol data unit it employs for secure transfer of data and the types of MIB objects controlling its functionality. Finally, we suggest some supplementary security services not directly supported by the SFRC entities for future consideration.",

    "abstract": "The development of “very high speed” networks is being motivated by emerging applications and is therefore attracting increasing attention. As demonstrated in the past, in conventional high speed systems the high ratio between the end-to-end propagation delay and the message transmission time severely restricts the system performance. Thus the increase in channel bandwidth may be accompanied by only a marginal increase in actual system capacity. In this paper we propose a network architecture which eliminates this problem by introducing a combined Frequency - Time Division based control of the high speed channel. We consider the implementation characteristics of the resulting multichannel system and show that the design of protocols in these systems is subject to unique channel control penalties. Specifically, we show that in addition to the relatively high cost of channel sensing, the allocation of channel on a demand assignment basis is hindered in the multichannel configuration by the time penalty involved in locating an idle channel and by practical limitations of multichannel node interface design. We therefore introduce a new class of “allocation” protocols in which the channel access is obtained without the aforementioned penalties. The allocation protocols build on message source and destination oriented transmission rights allocation, taking into account the implementation aspects of multichannel networks. We show that the class of “multichannel allocation” protocols covers the whole range of random access to fixed channel access control policies and introduce an analytic approach for a uniform analytic treatment. The analysis demonstrates the potential for a significant improvement in the system capacity and the average message delay, when compared to a conventional single (undivided) channel system.",

A network management system is expected to manage a large collection of network nodes remotely. There is an obvious need for sophisticated network management application software in this process. Previous network management systems have been designed without particular regard for the application programmer's interface requirements. We propose that such software be written in a specialized Network Management Language (NML) that provides the programmer with high-level abstractions rather than low-level communication primitives. The NML would help reduce development costs, promote portability and accommodate multiple standards. We propose an NML which is an extension to the SQL database standard. An implementation of the NML within the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) systems management framework is discussed, and examples of its functionality and expressiveness are presented.",

    "abstract": "The LAN-HUB is a new local area network designed to combine the properties of several existing LAN standards to provide highly reliable communication at a relatively lower cost per station, improve network capacity/delay performance and increase the LAN user's flexibility in configuring his network. The LAN-HUB network is configured around the CODEX 4320 LAN-HUB communication controllers which allow up to eight Ethernet/IEEE 802.3 stations to transparently share one network transceiver or RF Modem. Each LAN-HUB controller executes a fair, collision free, arbitration among its local stations attached to its LAN ports, using a patented collision avoidance algorithm. The HUB's rear panel further provides a Network port which can be attached to a standard 802.3 transceiver, to another HUB or terminated in a loop back mode. The HUBs, thus, allow stations to be organized in a standalone star network, in a “cascading” star configuration, or as an integrated bus/star network. When organized as star or cascaded star networks, the HUB controllers provide highly reliable and controlled, collision free, bandwidth allocation suitable for applications such as CPU room clusters. Alternately, in a bus configuration the HUBs support an Ethernet type bus network, with random access channel control. In the latter configuration the HUBs provide a lower cost/higher performance solution for bursty traffic users, since they reduce cabling requirements, decrease cost by sharing each transceiver among several LAN stations and improve network throughput/delay performance by eliminating local collisions. The LAN-HUB is thus effective in creating a local communication solution with a significant degree of flexibility in choosing the network layout and the type of service, random or deterministic, provided to the network users.",

    "abstract": "Recently protocols have been introduced that enable the integration of synchronous traffic (voice or video) and asynchronous traffic (data) and extend the size of local area networks without loss in speed or capacity. One of these is DRAMA, a multiband protocol based on broadband technology. It provides dynamic allocation of bandwidth among clusters of nodes in the total network. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a number of traffic placement policies for such networks. Metrics used for performance evaluation include average network access delay, degree of fairness of access among the nodes, and network throughput. The feasibility of the DRAMA protocol is established through simulation studies. DRAMA provides effective integration of synchronous and asynchronous traffic due to its ability to separate traffic types. Under the suggested traffic placement policies, the DRAMA protocol is shown to handle diverse loads, mixes of traffic types, and numbers of nodes, as well as modifications to the network structure and momentary traffic overloads.",

The method employed involves classifying these interfaces according to their “transport abstraction type.” Each actual interface is converted to or from a canonical form depending on its type, and the library also contains sufficient “abstraction converters” to convert between all of the canonical forms. The overall conversion is accomplished by combining some number of elementary conversions which execute in series. The paper describes the toolkit, contrasts it with other approaches, and shows how it can be used to solve various problems in protocol conversion and the “migration” of distributed services to new network contexts.",

    "abstract": "With the emergence of large switched public data networks that are well-suited to connectionless internets, for instance SMDS, it is possible that larger and larger numbers of internet users will get their connectivity from large public data networks whose native protocols are not the same as the user's internet protocol. This results in a routing problem that has not yet been addressed. That is, large numbers of routers (potentially tens of thousands) must be able to find direct routes to each other in a robust and efficient way. This paper describes a solution to the problem, called shortcut routing, that incorporates 1) a sparse graph of logical connectivity between routers, 2) hierarchical addressing among the public data network subscribers, and 3) the use of “entry router” information in packets to allow routers to find one hop “shortcuts” across the multi-hop logical graph.",

    "abstract": "Noahnet is an experimental flood local area network with features such as high reliability and high performance. Noahnet uses a randomly connected graph topology with four to five interconnections per node and a flooding protocol to route messages. The purpose of this paper is to present two analytical performance models which we have designed to understand the load-throughput behavior of Noahnet. Both models assume slotted Noahnet operation and also assume that if k messages attempt transmission in a slot, the network gets divided into k partitions of arbitrary sizes - one partition for each message. First, we show that the average number of successful messages in a slot given k partitions of transmissions is ( M - k )/( N - 1), where N is the number of nodes in the network and M is the number of nodes out of N that participate in the flooding of k messages. This is an interesting result and is used in both models to derive the load-throughput equations. Each model is then presented using a set of assumptions, derivations of load-throughput equations, a set of plots, and the discussion of results. Models one and two differ in the way they account for retransmissions.",

    "abstract": "Dartmouth College's Kiewit Network connects nearly all of the computing resources on the campus: mainframes, minicomputers, personal computers, terminals, printers, and file servers. It is a large internetwork, based on the AppleTalk protocols. There are currently over 2900 AppleTalk outlets in 44 zones on campus. Over 90 minicomputers act as bridges between 177 AppleTalk twisted pair busses. This paper describes the extent and facilities of the current network; the extensions made to the AppleTalk protocols, including a stream protocol and an asynchronous link protocol; and current development projects, including an AppleTalk stream to TCP converter. The Kiewit Network is a general purpose local data network. It serves as glue between all the host computers and nearly all the personal computers and terminals on campus. The network extends to the academic and administrative buildings, and the student residence halls, with network ports placed in almost all the offices and rooms. From these ports, users may access any of the host computers connected to the network. In addition, the hosts use network connections to communicate between themselves for electronic mail, file transfer, printer sharing, etc. The network also supports Apple Computer's AppleTalk® protocols. Departments and individuals can purchase standard devices which use AppleTalk (such as LaserWriters® and file servers), and connect them directly to the network. The Kiewit Network is not part of the telephone, energy control, or security systems of the College. While there can be benefits from combining them, separating these systems has simplified our design in many ways. A network failure doesn't interrupt these other services. We can also schedule experimental time for testing new software at our convenience. Dartmouth College started its campus network with General Electric Datanet 30 computers acting as front ends for the Dartmouth College Time Sharing (DCTS) system. In 1978, as the requirement for ports grew, Honeywell 716 minicomputers replaced the Datanet machines. In the same time period, two factors forced a change in perspective away from a front-end function toward a networked approach. New hosts began to arrive on campus. These new machines required enhancements to the network. Second, off-campus sites demanded more ports than the existing phone lines could supply. We served these remote users by using Prime P200 minicomputers as statistical multiplexors. In 1980, we implemented the DCTS terminal handling protocols on a less expensive minicomputer, and began to place these network nodes in the basements of buildings across the campus. When the College recommended that the freshmen entering in the fall of 1984 purchase a Macintosh™ computer, funds were appropriated for three major network enhancements: installation of a network port for each undergraduate in the residence halls; conversion of the network to the AppleTalk protocols; and creation of a terminal emulation program to exploit the enhanced network capabilities.",

This interface is built using an array of transputers, and can achieve high utilization of the bandwidth available on the primary rate channel.",

    "abstract": "Emerging high speed networks are using optical fibers employing time division synchronous communication. In these systems the use of optical switching is strongly advocated due to the bottleneck created by store and forward in electronic components. Switching solutions geared toward optical systems have been proposed so far only for packet switching networks. This paper introduces a new circuit switching approach for the emerging time division controlled fiber optic networks based on the requirement to avoid store and forward at intermediate nodes. The approach, termed Fast Circuit Switching (FCS), is unique in several operational and performance aspects. In terms of the way time slots within each cycle are allocated, a circuit is guaranteed a transmission slot immediately upon arrival at every intermediate node. As a result, the proposed Fast Circuit Switching (FCS) can be implemented by pure optical switches. In terms of performance, FCS guarantees minimum data transmission delays, consisting only of the end to end propagation delay in the network. Lastly due to being based on fixed time allocation at intermediate nodes, the FCS controlled system is purely end to end controlled. These properties make FCS inherently suitable for efficiently implementing circuit switching in wide area fiber optic networks, particularly, for supporting real time communications. The realization of slot assignments, which support the FCS solution, entails a novel graph oriented algorithmic approach. Several new algorithms for allocating circuits according to FCS are presented, dealing with fixed, as well as dynamic, circuit management. It is shown that, while providing unique operational and performance advantages as discussed above, the FCS is also bandwidth efficient, requiring only system bandwidth similar to conventional circuit switching methodologies.",

    "abstract": "For high-speed local area networks that offer integrated services for data, voice, and image traffic, a class of demand-assigned multiple-access protocols have been presented in the literature. These protocols exploit the directionality of signal propagation and enforce time constraints to achieve collision-freedom. A correct implementation of such a protocol requires a careful analysis of time-dependent interactions of event occurrences using a formal method. To date, most protocol verification methods are intended for the analysis of asynchronous communication over point-to-point channels. We present a model for broadcast bus networks. The novel features of our model include the ability to specify broadcast channels and the specification of real-time behavior. The broadcast characteristics of cables or buses are captured by some simple axioms. Real time is modeled as a discrete quantity using clocks and time variables. Real-time properties are specified by safety assertions. To illustrate our model and analysis method, we present a specification of the Expressnet protocol. We found that to achieve collision-freedom, a small modification to the original Expressnet protocol is needed.",

An entry consists of a set of attributes where one or more attributes are designated as the object name relative to the entry's immediate superior. X.500 defines a name as an ordered sequence of entry names starting from the root and terminating at the object. Therefore, a user must know the names of all the superiors of an object. In contrast, the descriptive name form is an unordered set of attributes. Only enough attributes need be given to distinguish the object from other objects. As a result, users do not have to know or understand the underlying hierarchy of the directory in order to do name look-up.",

Users, however, have questioned whether feedback can help in avoiding congestion in wide-area networks that operate at speeds of multiple megabits- or gigabits-per-second. In this paper we analyze a class of adaptive schemes with delayed feedback, where adaptive sources interact with each other as well as with non-adaptive sources through a single queue. We model the network as a stochastic, delay-differential equation and the rate at which an adaptive source transmits data as a fluid. Our model accounts for different levels of traffic burstiness introduced by the non-adaptive sources and for distinct propagation delays for different adaptive sources. We show how the performance of the system scales with increasing network speeds for quite general fluctuations in the bandwidth available to the adaptive sources. Simulation results show the accuracy of the model's predictions as a function of key parameters. This paper should raise the expectations of users about the potential effectiveness of responding to congestion notification.",

    "abstract": "The problem of the design of communications networks has spawned the development of many of the algorithms currently used to solve the minimum cost spanning tree problem. We show that three minimum cost spanning tree algorithms, those by Kruskal, Prim, and Esau and Williams, can be derived from a single problem specification using “specification and transformation by parts,” a methodology for deriving families of algorithms. This approach is an alternative to the Kershenbaum and Chou unification of spanning tree algorithms. Whereas the Kershenbaum &amp; Chou approach might be called bottom up, this is a top down approach which shows the original unity of the algorithms which emerges from the statement of the problem and also the essential differences. Besides pedagogical and aesthetic value, we maintain that an understanding of the algorithms from this perspective may be helpful in network design and modification.",

    "abstract": "LTCP is a new modification to TCP's congestion control to enable it to scale to high-speed networks. In comparison with prior work on high-speed congestion control, the paper explores an interesting design space: what if a single flow acts similarly to K virtual TCPs, where K is dynamically adjusted according to the network's congestion state; K increases in times of under-load to aggressively grab the available bandwidth and decreases in times of congestion to quickly release the bandwidth. The paper elaborates on how to design such a protocol and particularly how to make it fair when multiple flows with a different initial K share the same bottleneckThough I find it interesting to explore such a design, with much prior work on high-speed congestion control, it is unclear what LTCP can add. The paper claims that one of the contributions of LTCP is that \"it retains the time-tested AIMD behavior of TCP.\" Yet, because of the dynamic value of K, LTCP does not really do AIMD. Besides, why is maintaining AIMD important? The paper does not elaborate on this issue; neither does it show that the use of different increase-decrease rule has hurt other high-speed congestion control protocolsOverall, LTCP is a nice piece of research but I would encourage the authors to argue more why their design is important given all prior work on the topic. Further, they should run more extensive simulations that explore multiple bottleneck links, and provide at least a simple analysis that supports the convergence claim.",

    "abstract": "Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn are this year's recipients of the ACM Turing Award (the highest award in Computer Science) for their pioneering work in internetworking. To commemorate their award, and with the gracious consent of IEEE (which originally published the paper) and the authors, SIGCOMM is reprinting their famous early paper on internetworking, \"A Protocol for Packet Network Interconnection,\" from IEEE Transactions on Communications of May 1974.When the paper was written, Bob was early in his thirteen year-career at the US Defense Advanced Research Projects agency and Vint was a junior professor at Stanford. Bob eventually left DARPA and has continued in a distinguished career of nurturing research through the not-for-profit Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI), which he founded in 1986 and has led ever since. Vint soon left Stanford to spend several years at DARPA. After DARPA, Vint worked at MCI, leading the development of MCI Mail, then worked with Bob at CNRI, then rejoined MCI in 1994, where he is senior vice president for technology strategy.Throughout this time, both Vint and Bob have been actively involved in Internet activities. For many years, Vint served on (and for some years, chaired) the Internet Activities Board. Vint is currently chairman of the board of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Bob, Vint and CNRI have provided essential support services for the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for many years.Closer to home, both Bob and Vint have served as chairs of SIGCOMM. And both have received the ACM SIGCOMM Award: Bob in 1993 and Vint in 1996.I continue to find reading this paper intellectually rewarding, both for what it contains and what it does not. What it contains, of course, is a lot of the ideas that eventually became TCP and IP. It is somewhat astonishing to see how much was known in 1974, only 5 years after ARPANET was turned on. Equally interesting are things that were missing, such as congestion coordination with routers (e.g. the TCP congestion window). And there are also a few (not many) ideas that turned out to be bad (such as shrinking the receiver window from the right). All in all a rewarding read and I hope you'll agree, worth reprinting 31 years later.",

    "abstract": "This paper considers a problem that plagues both Internet research and operation: obtaining global statistical meas-ures that span the domains of multiple ISPs. ISPs generally consider many important performance measures of their networks to be competition sensitive. How then to gauge the size of the Internet, or measure the amount of traffic it is carrying, detect the presence of Internet-wide anomalies or other phenomena, or perform many other similar measurements?This paper makes a good case for the need to collect a variety of global statistics of Internet size and performance. It then points out that the problem may in principle be solvable: research in cyptography has developed methods for multiparty computations in which no single party actually reveals its own contribution to the other parties involved. Reviewers liked the problem definition and the general approach. It is clear that the work in this paper is still in the early stages, but this is to be expected. The most pointed reviewer comments concerned the cryptographic methods employed in the paper. The problem considered is a special case of secure multiparty computation, which has been considered in cryptography for over 20 years, starting with work by Yao in 1982 and Goldreich, Micali and Widgerson in 1987. The method proposed in this paper is one of many that could be employed; alternatives can be found by consulting the cryptography literature. On the positive side, the paper considers the kind of implementation details that are not usually considered in the cryptography literatureIn summary, this paper should stimulate more research into the problem of collecting certain kinds of Internet-wide measurements. Researchers have commonly assumed these kinds of measurements to be essentially impossible to obtain for practical reasons. Maybe not!",

Existing embedding-based approaches use linear algorithms on a single source of data, such as latency or hop count information, to approximate the position of a node in the Internet. In contrast, DIP computes low-dimensional representations of nodes that preserve structural properties and non-linear relationships across multiple, heterogeneous sources of structural information, such as IP, routing, and distance information. Using a large real-world data set, we show that DIP learns representations that preserve the real-world clustering of the associated nodes and predicts distance between them more than 30% better than a meanbased approach. Furthermore, DIP accurately imputes hop count distance to unknown hosts (i.e., not used in training) given only their IP addresses and routable prefixes. Our framework is extensible to new data sources and applicable to a wide range of problems in network monitoring and security.",

Organized in part by the late computer scientist and historian Chris Edmondson-Yurkanan, the tutorial brought together 19 key players from the development of the Internet to reflect on their foundational work. Using both digital and physical records from Edmondson-Yurkanan's archive, we discuss the importance of this event in generating a robust discussion and historical record about the Internet's technical evolution. Historical work about this tutorial also raises important questions on the ways in which records about the Internet's development are preserved or neglected.",

    "abstract": "The ever-increasing demand for data has forced cellular networks towards advanced multi-antenna (MIMO) techniques. However, advanced MIMO solutions such as massive MIMO, coordinated multi-point, distributed MIMO, and multi-user MIMO, all require the base station to know the downlink channels to the client. In the absence of this information, the base station cannot beamform its signal to its users. Therefore, base stations require user devices to perform the measurements and send the channels back to the basestation as feedback. This feedback generates significant overhead that scales linearly with the number of antennas, and is a bottleneck for next generation of cellular networks with large antenna deployments.",

    "abstract": "Network researchers know that packets are not always evenly spaced, they sometimes arrive in bursts. This burstiness is also present in history. Important events sometimes occur almost simultaneously even if there is no direct relationship between them. Fifty years ago, several historical events took place within a period of a few months. In July, after years of efforts, NASA engineers successfully launched Apollo 13 and the Eagle landed on the Moon. The first footsteps of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin have opened the era of space exploration and maybe another human will land on another planet during this century. One month later, hundreds of thousands of music fans gathered at the Woodstock festival. In parallel, a few computer scientists and engineers started to deploy prototype nodes of the ARPANET network. The first packets that they exchanged have initiated the revolution that brought the Internet and today's connected society. At that time, research in computer networks had already started and several members of this emerging community gathered in an interest group that later became ACM SIGCOMM.",

Too often, network protocols are taught as 'memorize the details of what is currently deployed', which creates a lot of confusion, and certainly does not encourage critical thinking. Some decisions have made today's networks unnecessarily complex and less functional. But surprisingly, mechanisms that were created out of necessity, to compensate for previous decisions, sometimes turn out to be useful for purposes other than the original reason they were invented. If the world had adopted a different approach originally, some very interesting technology may not have been invented. Given limited space in this article, we will not worry about exact details, but rather convey the main conceptual points, and only cover a few examples.",

Furthermore, they have some limitations in terms of performance. This paper leverages the eBPF virtual machine that is included in the Linux kernel to propose a replacement for iptables that preserves their semantics while providing improved performance. They release their implementation and evaluate its performance in details.",

The FCC's latest open Internet order ostensibly changes the landscape of regulation by using Title II as its basis. This year we discussed the implications of Title II (common-carrier-based) regulation for issues we have looked at in the past, or those shaping current policy conversations. Discussion topics included differentiated services on the public Internet, evolving approaches to interconnection across different segments of the ecosystem (e.g., content to access), QoE and QoS measurement techniques and their limitations, interconnection measurement and modeling challenges and opportunities, and transparency. The format was a series of focused sessions, where presenters prepared 10-minute talks on relevant issues, followed by in-depth discussions. This report highlights the discussions and presents relevant open research questions identified by participants. 1",

    "abstract": "Buffered multistage interconnection networks offer one of the most scalable and cost-effective approaches to building high capacity routers. Unfortunately, the performance of such systems has been difficult to predict in the presence of the extreme traffic conditions that can arise in the Internet. Recent work introduced distributed scheduling, to regulate the flow of traffic in such systems. This work demonstrated, using simulation and experimental measurements, that distributed scheduling can deliver robust performance for extreme traffic. Here, we show that distributed schedulers can be provably work-conserving for speedups of 2 or more. Two of the three schedulers we describe were inspired by previously published crossbar schedulers. The third has no direct counterpart in crossbar scheduling. In our analysis, we show that distributed schedulers based on blocking flows in small-depth acyclic flow graphs can be work-conserving, just as certain crossbar schedulers based on maximal bipartite matchings have been shown to be work-conserving. We also study the performance of practical variants of these schedulers when the speedup is less than 2, using simulation.",

    "abstract": "This April 2006 issue is thin. We hope the quality will satisfy you though. Maybe because of the SIGCOMM deadline or the season holidays or both, we only received around 10 submissions and one article was selected for publication. This acceptance rate is much lower than what we would like to see for CCR, and I take this as a failure to attract the right type of contributions. CCR looks for nicely-written papers describing new ideas, new studies, new protocols, or new mechanisms in the area of computer communication. Remember that a full validation is not necessary. Also, depending on how advanced your work is, you can either submit a ten-page article or a four-page editorial (including position papers).But maybe your expectations are different? Please send us comments. We can not improve CCR without the help of our readers (did I say that already?Another unsolved issue is the implementation of CCR as an online community where articles are available online as soon as they are submitted. This online CCR community would also be used to implement a junior researcher reviewing program where Ph.D. students and recently graduate researcher could pick papers and submit their reviews.This issue of CCR is mostly made of editorials and of SIGCOMM-community news. For the first time, we received unsolicited four-page papers. We published most of them. SIGCOMM news is also richer than usual with in particular the second issue of Michalis Faloutsos' column (co-authored with Kevin Almeroth), even more hilarious than the first one. Michalis also put together a very useful resource for measurement based research: a catalogue of publicly available traffic data and analysis tools. Last, Jim Kurose helped convince Jon Crowcroft to send his list of 10 must-read papers.Among the noticeable sigcomm news, we announce the creation of a \"Test-of-Time\" award. This award recognizes a paper published 10 to 12 years ago for its significant contribution. Please contribute.",

We received 20 papers for this issue.The editorial section is structuring with the third \"10 recommended readings\" by David Wetherall. This column is so successful that we appointed Jim Kurose as honorary 10 recommended readings editor. For next issues, you can send him your contribution directly. We also decided to show our support to the SIGCOMM conference's \"test of time\" award by starting a new column: Test of time: rejected 10 years ago, but still worth reading. Greg Minshall's paper on IP Switching is the first paper to be published in this column, with an introduction from Jon Crowcroft. Michalis Faloutsos' column is also addressing a serious problem with a non serious tone: who is the real father of the Internet? Michalis does a great job at demystifying the topic. We hope nobody feels insulted (we tried to avoid that); but we hope someone will react.Last, we are about to launch an on-line CCR virtual community and it is a coincidence that we publish the short paper by Fabio Ricciato making the case for a WiKi to support paper discussion. Ernst Biersack (from EURECOM) and his student Moritz Steiner have been prototyping a CCR community that we will make available to privileged users this summer, and that will be discussed at SIGCOMM. This community will allow researchers to publish articles on-line, apply for papers to review, comment on papers, give their opinion and interact, etc. Contact us if you want to help with the test and design of this new community service. We hope to launch it before the end of this year.",

    "abstract": "We had 14 submissions for this issue and accepted 2. We are still much below the acceptance rate that we would like to achieve, even when averaging on two or three issues. I can observe a significant increase in the quality and innovation of the papers submitted though. However, because of the very short turn-around (there is generally less than one week to revise papers), we have to reject papers because the work requested by the reviewers is not feasible in such a short time period. We have also received much fewer comments that we would expect. We would love to receive your feedback on the CCR content. Maybe the online CCR community will make is easier (see the end of this editorial).One of the fourteen papers was withdrawn two weeks before notification. We (the editorial board) suspect a beautiful specimen of double submission. So, we take this opportunity to refresh our readers' mind: double submission is not only unethical and forbidden; it is showing very little respect for those who spend time processing and reviewing papers. There are enough publications opportunities these days. No need to submit in parallel unless you have more confidence in the law of large numbers than in the quality of your work to get your papers accepted :-) This issue contains the usual columns. Matthias Grossglauser is offering us his 10 recommended readings, focusing on modeling papers. Do not miss Michalis Faloutsos article, as well as the now usual SIGCOMM community news.You know that CCR is dedicated to bring you the hottest ideas and innovation. Therefore, we are proud to publish the first fully automatically generated paper. The generation tool has been designed by Christian Kreibich and Jon Crowcroft from Cambridge University. As you will see, the result is not perfect, but close. Jon is confident that the tool can bring him a Sigcomm paper within a couple of years. Then, it will be time to automate the reviewing process ...We also re-publish the paper that received this year's test-of-time award. It has been granted to Vern Paxson for \"End-to-End Routing Behavior in the Internet,\" published 10 years ago in SIGCOMM.The CCR online community is currently being stress-tested. It should be available from http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigcomm/ccr/ by the time you read this editorial. Please connect, add content, and send us comments. It is still a prototype and needs improvement. However, improvement will come from you. We can not really do more than what we have now. And please join me to congratulate again Ernst Biersack and Moritz Steiner, from EURECOM (Sophia-Antipolis, FRANCE), for having designed CCR-online.",

    "abstract": "With this first 2006 issue, we are closing one year of the \"new CCR formula.\" This aniversary makes me realize that we have not received many comments about CCR--just a couple of encouragement emails and one strong criticism. The authors of the criticism were mostly unhappy with the fact that we have made changes to the criteria to accept papers, and that these changes are not clearly described on the CCR web site. This is probably (at least partially) true, and we need your feedback to improve CCR. Please send us more feedback, positive or negative. You can send me or any of the area editors direct feedback. Alternatively, you can use the sigcomm mailing list sigcomm@postel.orgTo clarify, papers published in CCR should be of interest to our community. They should be mostly original (please do not send a paper based on material already published--the purpose of CCR is not to archive), with some evidence that it works or that the idea is worth being investigated. Novelty is certainly the heaviest acceptance criteria. So far, we have received around 15 to 20 submissions per issue and accepted 4 or 5 each time. This might be low as an acceptance rate for CCR, and we would love to publish more.Editorials seem to gain popularity. We are publishing 12 of them in this issue with some noticeable ones. Michalis Faloutsos accepted to run a new column on community news to appear in every issue. This editorial will provide news, gossips, practical information, etc. from our community in a humorous way. Michalis needs your input. Note that every gossip will be peer reviewed. Also in this issue Jim Kurose inaugurates a column entitled \"10 recommended readings.\" Please send us the list of your 10 favority papers as well. Finally, we have a new episode of the CCR sitcom \"buffers: size does matter!\" This series has generated a lot of controversy (under the author's responsability). I believe this kind of argument is useful and I would like to encourage many more of such discussions. What about a new saga on QoS, on overlays, or on clean-slate design of communication architectures? And please keep sending us two-page papers on other topics. We will make our best to publish them as soon as possibleLast, in the previous issue I told you about a new junior reviewing program that I intended to deploy early 2006 (see the October issue for details). Unfortunately, I have received very little feedback on this project. In particular, nobody volunteered to help design the web interface for this service. If you really think such a service can help the community, please drop me a note and (a) volunteer!",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new topology for multidimensional interconnection networks, namely D-ARM, which has the goal of simultaneously providing a high network transmission capacity and a low information transfer delay. The new D-ARM topology has a connection pattern arranged in alternated regular mesh fashions with toroidal boundaries. Five distinct network attributes, normally used to characterize interconnection network topologies, were employed to analyze the D-ARM topology: network diameter, bisection width, deflection index, degree of connectivity and symmetry. Also the evaluation of the performance of the D-ARM network through computer simulations was carried out based on the following measures: throughput and information transfer delay. An upper-bound of the network transmission capacity was derived in function of the network dimension (D) and length (W). In order to validate our proposal, as a viable topology among other well-known topologies, a comparative analysis among the D-ARM, MSN and ShuffleNet was performed. The analysis results show that the D-ARM outperforms the MSN and ShuffleNet in many aspects and suggest some plausible applications of the D-ARM networks, e.g., broadband switching architecture, multiprocessor connection, high-speed MAN, WDM optical networks and photonic networks.",

    "abstract": "The Differentiated Services model (DiffServ) provides a great flexibility in defining a variety of services through PHBs ( Per Hop Behaviors ) and traffic conditioners. It fits in well with the Integrated Services model (IntServ), jointly offering features such as: QoS signaling; admission control; channel management; assignment of resources (buffer and bandwidth); sorter configuration; and establishment of traffic agreements. With this integration you can have a scalable, flexible, and dynamic QoS environment in networks of the Internet core.This article describes and analyzes the DGF ( DTM Guaranteed Forwarding ) service that guarantees a minimum rate of retransmission of packets, based on RSVP signaling and traffic agreements (SLA), as well as losses close to the error rate of the physical medium, which are ideal features for video applications on demand.When this service is provided, the aforementioned QoS models are integrated with the transport and switching solution called DTM ( Dynamic Synchronous Transfer Mode ), a fast circuit switching technology. DTM is simple, cost-effective, provides QoS features, and is naturally dynamic in supplying bandwidth as well as flexible in fitting in with other IETF QoS models.Thus in the proposed architecture, IPoDQoS ( IP over DTM QoS ), we make use of the dynamism of network protocols and we offer managed VBR traffic in the IP layer (i.e.: DGF service) not originally offered in DTM technology.",

Great efforts have been spent to make current data communication networks more flexible and dynamic. Unfortunately, such efforts are followed by complexity and, therefore, the process of deploying the mechanisms has been committed. In order to make this process simpler, this work presents an open approach for having programmable nodes that make computer networks more dynamic in terms of adding new services without increasing complexity. This approach presents SNPI (Simple Network Programming Interface), which is a group of skeletons and data structures resources that make possible to the programmers and developers a fast deployment of new services into the network.

    "abstract": "This April 2022 issue contains five technical papers and two editorial notes. The first technical paper, Data-Plane Security Applications in Adversarial Settings , by Liang Wang and colleagues, investigates security issues that may arise when creating and running data-plane applications for programmable switches. This work moves security analysis and design forward in this particular area. This paper also calls for a more thorough rethinking of security for data-plane applications for programmable switches. The second technical paper, One Bad Apple Can Spoil Your IPv6 Privacy , by Said Jawad Saidi and colleagues, leverages IPv6 passive measurements to pinpoint that a non-negligible portion of devices encodes their MAC address in their IPv6 address. This threatens users' privacy, allowing content providers and CDNs to consistently track users and their devices across multiple sessions and locations. Overall, the paper is an excellent contribution toward privacy-by-design solutions and a nicely executed measurements study that clarifies the problem and provides solid suggestions to mitigate the problem. The third technical paper, Hyper-Specific Prefixes: Gotta Enjoy the Little Things in Interdomain Routing , by Khwaja Zubair Sediqi and colleagues, investigates the presence of high-specific prefixes (HSP) on the BGP Internet routing during the last decade. These prefixes are more-specific than /24 (/48) for IPv4 (IPv6) and are commonly filtered by Autonomous Systems operators. Overall this paper offers a nice contribution to the understanding of the BGP universe, with a clear message and a nice quantification of the phenomenon. The authors clearly present and motivate the work, offering also to not experts a nice view of the routing complexity of the nowadays internet. The fourth technical paper, Programming Socket-Independent Network Functions with Nethuns , by Nicola Bonelli and colleagues, proposes a new solution to transparently develop packet-processing programs on top of different network I/O frameworks. The authors design and develop an open-source library, nethuns, serving as a unified programming abstraction for network functions that natively supports multi-core programming. Not only is this work very relevant to our community, but also the code is released open-source through a BSD license, which can be used to foster more research in the area, towards unifying programming mechanisms of end-host networking. The fifth technical paper, Measuring DNS over TCP in the Era of Increasing DNS Response Sizes: A View from the Edge , by Mike Kosek and colleagues, studies one of the foundations of today's Internet: the Domain Name Service (DNS). The original RFC document of DNS instructs to send queries either over UDP (DoUDP) or TCP (DoTCP). This paper presents a measurement study on DoTCP focusing on two perspectives: failure rates and response times. Finally, we have two editorial notes. A Case for an Open Customizable Cloud Network , by Dean H. Lorenz and his colleagues, argues for the desirability of the new ecosystem of managed network solutions to connect to the Cloud, outlines the main requirements and sketches possible solutions. Recommendations for Designing Hybrid Conferences , by Vaibhav Bajpai and colleagues, presents guidelines and considerations-spanning technology, organization and social factors-for organizing successful hybrid conferences. I hope that you will enjoy reading this new issue and welcome comments and suggestions on CCR Online (https://ccronline.sigcomm.org) or by email at ccr-editor at sigcomm.org.",

    "abstract": "Many network intensive applications can benefit substantially from reasonable estimates of future available bandwidth. As a simple example, consider a user, John, that is about to board a flight that is leaving shortly. Using his palmtop equipped with the Aura ubiquitous computing system, John has just finished editing some very large documents that he needs to email over the airport's wireless network. Just before he begins transmission, a 747 begins deplaning passengers at a gate adjacent to where John is waiting; these deplaning passengers are heavily loading the network in John's cell. John's Aura client contacts the bandwidth advisor and learns that there is insufficient bandwidth for John to complete his transmission before his plane leaves. Fortunately, Aura learns from the bandwidth advisor that a nearby cell has ample bandwidth which enables John to move into that cell briefly and complete his transmission before catching his plane.The utility of bandwidth advisors has lead to efforts such as Remos and the Network Weather Service which have investigated providing bandwidth advice in wired network settings. This research builds on this previous work by developing a bandwidth advisor that is specifically tuned for wireless networks, and is suited to the needs of mobile applications.",

    "abstract": "The features of ATM offered many attractions to the application community, such as fine-grained multiplexing and high-throughput links. These created considerable challenges for the O.S. designer, since a small protocol data unit size (the 48 byte \"cell\") and link bandwidths within a (binary) order of magnitude of memory bandwidths demanded considerable rethinking of operating system structure.Using an historical and personal perspective, this paper describes two aspects of that rethinking which I participated in directly, namely, those of new event signalling and memory buffering schemes. Ideas and techniques stemming from ATM network research influenced first research operating systems and then commercial operating systems. The positive results of ATM networking, although indirect, have benefitted applications and systems far beyond the original design goals.",

    "abstract": "The usage of price instruments was found to offer an interesting opportunity for reactive congestion flow control in communication or computer networks where the objective is to maximize the total utility of all traffic sources over their transmission rates. The proposed control mechanisms were, amongst others, based on the Price Method-known also as the Interaction Balance Method-and both synchronous and asynchronous versions were developed. It was, however, so far assumed that the transmission network model was known exactly and that no traffic was lost and the traffic routes were fixed and known to the transmitting sources. In this paper, we formulate the flow control problem in a modified form, allowing in particular for the routing decisions to be hidden from the sources, and recall the concept of the Price Coordination with Feedback (known also under the name of the Interaction Balance Method with Feedback-IBMF). It is then shown that the use of this approach allows for proposing the new distributed algorithm for pricing of network services. The existence of an optimal solution in steady state is proved under reasonable assumptions and the convergence issues are discussed. Two examples are provided to illustrate the operation of the proposed algorithm and to compare its performance with the usage of classical price coordination.",

Our approach allows mobility to be rapidly deployed, as the networking infrastructure required for deployment is available off the shelf. Furthermore, a mobile node does not require modifications in order to use these mobile services. While our approach provides rapid deployment and supports both IP and non-IP protocols, only a subset of mobile usage scenarios are offered. In other words, our approach does not solve all the problems of mobility. We discuss the characteristics of mobility usage, and we list the scenarios our approach supports. We believe that the mobile usage scenarios supported by this method are some of the more common usage scenarios. We also believe that investigations into this method will provide more insights into network and mobility research.",

The results indicate that BGP4 for IPv4 is continuing to scale steadily even as IPv4 approaches its end of life, and that it is working as it should for IPv6, except for a slight concern that the number of announced routes is trending upwards faster as time goes on.",

NemFi is a record-and-replay emulator that captures traces representing real WiFi conditions, and later replay these traces to reproduce the same conditions. In this paper, we demonstrate that the state-of-the-art emulator that was developed for cellular links cannot emulate WiFi conditions. We identify the three key differences that must be addressed to enable accurate WiFi record-and-replay: WiFi packet losses, medium-access control, and frame aggregation. We then extend the existing cellular network emulator to support WiFi record-and-replay. We evaluate the performance of NemFi via repeated experimentation across different WiFi conditions and for three different types of applications: speed-test, file download, and video streaming. Our experimental results demonstrate that average application performance over NemFi and real WiFi links is similar (with less than 3 percent difference).",

We invited all researchers who reported use of CAIDA data in these disciplines. We discussed their successes and challenges of using the data, and how CAIDA could help these fields via Internet measurement and data curation. To avoid Zoom fatigue, we had a conversation-focused rather than presentation-focused workshop. Research topics we discussed included: Internet data for macroeconomics; connectivity and its effect on economic interdependence; effects of the EU’s new GDPR on internet interconnection; measuring corporate cyber risk; measuring work-from-home trends; measuring the economic value of open source software; and more generally how to best support evidence-based policymaking.",

    "abstract": "Routing systems for datagram packet-switched networks' iteratively applying Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithms on load-based link cost metrics exhibit poor stabilization and convergence properties at moderate traffic loads without the addition of experimentally determined Bertsekas Additive Bias Factors to aid in damping undesirable oscillations. Routing systems which iteratively apply SPF Algorithms on load-varying link costs implicitly assume routing assignments can be independently modified without affecting the validity of cost estimates on other links. Even under stationary offered loads, this assumption is less accurate as the load increases due to nonlinear dynamical interactions among traffic flows. Failure to compensate for this independence assumption in iterative SPF computations leads to dynamical instabilities above moderate offered loads. Unfortunately, while Bertsekas Additive Bias Factors improve stability, they also reduce the sensitivity of the routing system to network congestion. As alleviation of traffic congestion is often an important service requirement for a routing system, this is a serious drawback. This paper is motivated by a search for techniques to improve the convergence of routing systems upon near-optimum sets of routing assignments for current traffic conditions, without introducing a loss of congestion sensitivity. Due to the limitations of Markov Chain Models of packet-switching networks for our application, a network simulation is developed which provides a more accurate reflection of network dynamics, as it incorporates bounded queue and minimum interarrival time constraints. Utilizing this simulation, it is demonstrated that a Genetic Algorithm which estimates the near-optimal number of routing assignment changes allowed by the Dijkstra SPF Algorithm during each routing update interval, enables substantial performance advantages for networks operated at or above moderate offered loads. This adaptive feedback compensation technique achieves these performance improvements by avoiding the Kauffman and Eigen Catastrophes, although additional processing and slight increases in routing update packet lengths are required. In a broader context, the technology of adaptive feedback compensation should prove a relevant to a variety of real-time distributed adaptive control applications.",

The draft proposed American National Standard entitled Additional Controls for Use with ASCII is out for public comment as BSR X3.64. The primary thrust of the standard is to encode the control functions needed by the current technology of two-dimensional character-imaging input-output devices, such as cathode ray tube terminals. The ANSI X3 Technical Subcommittee X3L2, Coding and Character Sets, has been working on the standard since 1969. It is a comprehensive standard which should standardize information interchange for this decade in a manner similar to that provided by ASCII in the last decade. The standard uses a multiple character structure similar to an Escape Sequence to obtain 78 distinct functions. Furthermore, it uses a uniform method for representing both numeric and selective parameters to indicate dimensional quantities and to obtain 88 more sub-functions. Finally, 23 modes alter the interpretation of some of the functions. The types of controls include editing functions, formatting, and the specification and control of input areas, as well as certain status setting and interrogation functions, mode selection and typesetting composition functions. The standard does not contain any network or data transmission controls. The Standard is open ended so that more controls can be included in future revisions. Furthermore, a conforming implementor is provided with a means of implementing some so-called private, non-standard functions as well. As with ASCII it is not expected that implementors will implement all of the functions in the standard. A compatible subset of this dpANS was approved in June 1976 by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA). It is entitled ECMA-48 Additional Controls for Character-imaging I/O Devices.",

    "abstract": "Research and development at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) and Office Systems Division (OSD) have led to many advances in an evolving network architecture. As early experimenters in local area networking, researchers at PARC built a prototype of what is becoming the basis for an international standard. Their early work with networked personal workstations, distributed networked services, and local network interconnection provided valuable insight into requirements for higher level protocols. As designers of products such as the Star professional workstation and the Network Systems services, developers at OSD expanded the original PARC network architecture to include features required for the commercial marketplace. Contrasting the PARC Universal Packet (PUP) architecture with OSD's Network Systems (NS) architecture is itself an interesting study of protocol evolution and compatibility. No level of the PUP architecture was untouched in its transformation to the NS architecture. One of the major changes was to the addressing conventions at both the Ethernet and the internetwork levels. It is believed that the NS addressing conventions are adequate for world-wide heterogeneous internetworks. The introduction of a remote procedure calling protocol changed the foundation for developing application protocols. Modelling distributed operations as procedure calls has simplified the development and specification of application protocols. The NS remote procedure calling protocol, &lt;i&gt;Courier&lt;/i&gt;, is oriented toward a heterogeneous processor and language environment. The evolution did not stop with the first version of the NS protocols. Xerox OSD gained experience with the initial NS architecture through use in its development system (the Mesa Development Environment) and early products. Most of the experience was encouraging, reinforcing the strength of the architecture. During this period the benefits and problems of protocol evolution became apparent, and each protocol was examined for its ability to support evolution and backward compatibility. Minor changes at the physical and data link layers (&lt;i&gt;Ethernet&lt;/i&gt;) were made to accommodate standardization. The convergence of the Ethernet Specification and standards from IEEE 802 and ECMA have received adequate attention elsewhere. At the network layer, Xerox's &lt;i&gt;Internet work Datagram Protocol&lt;/i&gt; has changed little since its inception. This protocol is distinguished by its simplicity and power. The &lt;i&gt;Internetwork Datagram Protocol&lt;/i&gt; is the foundation of the internetwork architecture. It defines the addressing structure and routing functions that permit higher level protocols to virtually ignore the problems of the location of communicating entities. The primary protocol in the transport layer, the &lt;i&gt;Sequenced Packet Protocol&lt;/i&gt;, has enjoyed stability since its publication; though implementation strategies have been refined, especially in the areas of flow control and retransmission strategies. Early changes included a delimiting feature to facilitate treating a stream of packets as a message. Most of Xerox's application protocols rely on &lt;i&gt;Courier&lt;/i&gt;, the NS remote procedure calling protocol. &lt;i&gt;Courier&lt;/i&gt; defines a set of universal data types, the messaging mechanism for performing calls and returns, and a syntax for the specification of higher level protocols. Since its introduction, &lt;i&gt;Courier&lt;/i&gt; has been enhanced to include protocol version numbers (both for itself and protocols built upon it), to support more varied data types, and to directly integrate the streaming of bulk data with a procedure call. Binding of user processes to application services within the NS architecture has changed dramatically with the development of the &lt;i&gt;Clearinghouse&lt;/i&gt;. The &lt;i&gt;Clearinghouse&lt;/i&gt; serves as an internetwork white pages and yellow pages for naming and locating distributed resources. It permits both simple mappings of names to addresses and the enumeration of instances of a particular type of resource. Distribution lists for electronic mail and access control lists are also supported by the &lt;i&gt;Clearinghouse&lt;/i&gt;. The evolution of the NS architecture, from its beginnings at PARC to its present form in Xerox products has been influenced by a basic philosophy. &lt;i&gt;An architecture or protocol must pass the test of stressful use in its intended environment before it can be considered for standardization.&lt;/i&gt;",

The ability to control and manage large networks has required many innovations and has been most successful where the growing network itself has provided the mechanisms needed for network management. This discussion will cover the increasing use of decentralization and parallel operation of functions required to monitor the network, to remotely test and maintain subscriber facilities, to collect billing and statistical data, and to distribute and install new software. Specific problems which require special attention in large network management will be covered; these include time synchronization, routing optimization, and network security. The SL-10 packet switching system from Northern Telecom is referenced through this discussion as an example of a system which has built on the facilities and technology of the network switching equipment to provide the management function. Since all of the attributes of capacity, availability, reliable communication, configuration flexibility, and security are the same for both packet switching subscribers and network management, using a common base provides real advantages. The discussion will show how the exclusive use of network terminal interfaces, virtual circuits, and X.25 host interfaces for all management data transfer functions provides the required function with virtually unlimited growth potential. Support of both packet switching and management functions on the same base of processor, storage devices, and software, further extends the benefits of commonality.",

The most significant aspect of this strategy lies in its flow assignment method. A distributed loop-free shortest path algorithm assigns a number to a path at the time it is created and this number remains valid through shortest path changes. Consequently, existing traffic can be maintained on existing paths, while new traffic is assigned to the current shortest paths. Stable multiple path routing is thus achieved without packet disordering. Abnormal conditions such as trunk failure and recovery and trunk congestion are dealt with by tagging routing updates with update causes. Simulation of this routing strategy shows that maximum network throughput (under a certain congestion constraint) can be increased substantially compared to a single path routing strategy.",

The number of networks which provide resource sharing have increased steadily from the early years of ARPA network. As the number of users sharing the resources increases, there is a potential danger for degradation of services, if the demand for the resources is greater than the available resources. The maximum traffic that can be carried by a network depends on the finite network resources such as link bandwidth and storage buffers. An uncontrolled flow of traffic results in service degradation and deadlock if the traffic allowed into the network exceeds the capacity of the network.",

The first was a demand for high speed trunks in the T1 (1.54 Mb/s) and above range to cost effectively serve future networks. The second market force was the emergence of satellite data technology with its attendant high bandwidth and lower cost. A protocol with a large sequence number range and the ability to selectively retransmit more than one packet in error without impacting the flow of correctly received packets was required. None of the standard data protocols met these requirements.",

    "abstract": "As the practice of networking has become more widespread, the study of communications protocols has grown accordingly. At the same time, techniques for verification of message-passing networks have been developed to the point where they can now be used to prove safety properties about such protocols. In this paper, we discuss the problem of two processes which must communicate through some semi-reliable medium. In order for communication to take place, there must be some set of rules for acknowledging correctly received messages, called frames, and for retransmitting lost or damaged frames. Such a set of rules is called a communication protocol. We present a generalized communication data link layer protocol and give a proof using a technique recently proposed by Misra and Chandy [Misra81]. We also show that this protocol and proof include two very important special cases: 1) the well-known Alternating Bit protocol, and 2) the portion of the HDLC protocol dedicated to ensuring that packets are received, and that they are received in the correct order. The problem of verifying communication protocols, has been addressed by Stenning [Stenning76], and more recently by Hailpern [Hailpern8l]. Each of these protocols can be considered to be a special case of the one presented here. Hailpern also proves liveness of his algorithm, but uses temporal logic and explicit induction (on the number of messages) for proving both safety and liveness. We do not cover the proof of liveness in this paper. However, the proof technique can be extended for liveness proofs. For a discussion of this, the reader is referred to [Misra82].",

    "abstract": "In early 1977, Southern Bell began to study ways to reduce terminal and leased line costs associated with internal computer communications. Because a large volume of these communications were of an asynchronous, character-mode nature, packet switching emerged as the most attractive solution to reducing these costs. In May, 1979, the first application went on-line with one switch, one host concentrator and three terminal concentrators. Operation of this network was simple, with operations and planning residing in the same work group. Today, the network consists of twenty tandem switches, 185 local switches and 85 packet assembler/disassemblers, interconnected by 15,928 miles of trunk facilities. The network architecture has evolved to geographically distributed “principle switching points” interconnected through a single major switching center in Atlanta, Georgia. Each “principle switching point” serves an area of company interest by supporting a number of local switches and concentrators. As the complexity of the network has increased, so has the complexity of network operation. Operations have been both functionally and geographically differentiated to keep up with the evolution of the network, and to stay consistent with changing packet switch architecture. This talk will cover the network operations and maintenance considerations associated with the operation of today's very large network.",

    "abstract": "The basic step involved in communication across a network and inter-network is the identification and validation of entities. Normally the identification of the entity in a network takes the form of a name or an address. The naming convention and its validation can affect both the user of the system as well as the system design and communication performance. On the user side, the naming scheme can be ad hoc, difficult to understand and non-user-friendly and can lead to inefficient addressing. On the system side, the name validation may require the global information of the entity names in the network and can impose certain restrictions on the dynamic topology reconfiguration of the network. Hence the naming convention is an important issue for the network architecture and possibly for standardization. This paper examines the semantics of name with respect to the communication and users point of view. The naming convention proposed by IFIP working group 6.5 is reviewed with respect to the naming requirements on public networks.",

As the network evolves and the customer demand for higher network availability increases, the need for line operations personnel to reduce customer impact has presented a unique challenge for innovative ideas to accomplish this objective. Although the equipment supplier may provide excellent technical documentation for the provisioning, testing and maintenance of their products, they cannot provide the means to administer, manage and control a large network. This is the sole area where the network provider is responsible for deciding how his network will impact the customer. This presentation will deal with some of the operational problems encountered in growing a network from 5 nodes to 55 nodes over a period of 9 years. Some of the subject areas that will be covered are: the maintenance window - is it required?; administrative documentation; utilization of network statistics; hardware retrofits; and software updates - major and minor. These are but a few of the problem areas challenging packet switching network providers today. Their resolution are limited only by the imagination of the personnel charged with the responsibility of resolving them.",

To take full advantage of broadband systems, assignment of nodes to channels must be dynamic, leading to the use of a flat address space. Combined with the desire to avoid reliance on a central server or complex routing in packet forwarders, this addressing scheme leads to adoption of a controlled flooding technique to “discover” the best path to a destination node. This discovery procedure sets up a path through internetwork forwarders for use by subsequent packets to the same destination. This paper describes the design and implementation of such a technique in Sytek's LocalNet(TM) systems along with several refinements which increase performance and keep the worst case load for route discovery below a few percent of network capacity.",

    "abstract": "In the sixties and early seventies, major activities in networking were focused on private and public data networks using either circuit and packet-switching technology or integrating both switching methods into a single network. In this time frame, manufacturers of main frames defined and implemented network architectures, ISO started work on the reference model of the Open-System Interconnect Architecture, and CCITT recommended the X-series of interfaces. Local-area communication networks (LAN's) represent a comparatively new field of activity which can be viewed as an extension to data networks for making high-speed packet-switching services available to the in-house domain. Currently, much research and development work is being pursued in this field, both at universities and in industry. The term local refers to communication on the users' premises, i.e., within a building or among a cluster of buildings. Local data and voice communication are not new. A typical example of a system widely used today for local data communication between hosts and display terminals is a star configuration where the terminals are attached to control units tightly coupled to a processor via I/O channels. The necessary terminal control functions are provided in the control unit and shared among a set of terminals. The most widely used local communication system is the Private Automatic Branch Exchange (PABX). Most PABX's installed today are optimised for real-time voice, and use analog technology.",

This scheme allows a high priority message to immediately interrupt a lower priority message which is in the process of being transmitted, and yet will not require the retransmission of the first part of the lower priority message; hence, the term graceful preemption. Graceful preemption may be extended to furnish multiple priority levels similar to existing processor interrupt structures which implement multiple levels. This protocol may serve a single processor which handles several different processes, or several independent stations that share a common bus. Hence, priority levels can be enforced without the need for a centralized bus “master” or “arbitrator” unit. As an example, the application of graceful preemption to the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) link access procedure, LAPD, is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Token rings have the property that a station that transmits a frame on the ring is responsible for removing the frame after it has been delivered to the destination stations. The algorithm to perform the frame removal is called 'Frame Stripping'. Most existing algorithms strip frames based on their content. This is not always adequate. The need for a new algorithm arises from the fact that frames transmitted by a station need not have the station's own address as the source address for a variety of reasons - such as when a bridge transmits a frame or when another address is used as the source address by a station instead of its original station address. This paper discusses a new frame content independent stripping (FCIS) algorithm for token rings. The FCIS algorithm counts the number of frames transmitted by the station after capturing the token. In addition, the station places a special delimiter frame at the end of the transmission of frames, before releasing the token. The station then strips all received frames until either the number of frames stripped equals the number of frames transmitted or when either the delimiter frame or a token is received. We demonstrate that the FCIS algorithm has a minimal impact on the performance of the ring. We study the robustness of the algorithm to errors and demonstrate that its reliability is as good as the inherent mechanisms of the token ring. The algorithm studied here is very simple to implement and interoperates with other stations not implementing this algorithm. The algorithm places no topological restrictions on the network and has the attractive feature of removing large fragments and no-owner frames.",

The first is for detecting deterioration and identifying a subset of nodes that constitutes a “problem area”, the second is to provide each node with the distances (propagation delays) to all other nodes, and the third is to use this topological information to construct a minimal spanning tree, from which a good “token passing” sequence can be derived.

Each protocol layer is implemented as a collection of cooperating processes. These are structured in one of two alternative ways, reflecting differences in the type of exceptional situations that may occur. Within each of the lower protocol layers, one process takes the form of a Finite State Machine. In these lower level protocols, where it is difficult to identify “normal” transitions, there are no special exception cases; we treat all transitions as being equally likely to occur. For higher level protocols such as the X.29 protocol, exceptions occur less frequently. Here, transmitting and receiving are performed by two independent processes, and exception handling is performed by an auxiliary process which is invoked as needed. This multi-process structure matches the functionality of the protocol, and results in software which is easy to program and easy to understand.",

    "abstract": "A survey which investigated organizational management of telecommunications and the current and future configurations of telecommunications equipment showed some expected results and some surprises. The survey showed that public academic institutions are in advance of private institutions in the acquisition of different types of telecommunication equipment and connections. Also surprisingly widespread is the use in academic institutions of connections usually identified with business. Fully 8% of the academic institutions report being connected to customers, 14% indicate use of EDI, and 16% indicate connection to suppliers. Another surprising result is that previous investment in telecommunications is a better predictor than revenue (for business firms) or size of student body (for academic institutions) of the presence of rare telecommunications options, if they have acquired experience by a steady progression of telecommunications acquisitions. A final, perhaps more predictable, result concerns the evolution of telecommunication configurations in organizations of all types toward more interconnectability and in the directions of organization wide networks. Over 70% of the organizations are working toward organization wide networks but only 24% to 25% of the organizations consider that they have attained this goal. This trend is evident in both the academic and business environments. While it is not clear how this will impact the availability of data, it is apparent that a need for more interconnectability and ease of communication is being felt by organizations at this time.",

Virtual terminal protocol support is planned for the near future. MAP is a subset of the internationally agreed Open Systems Interconnection computer networking architecture, protocols and supporting standards. The MAP subset of OSI Protocols was originally selected by General Motors and has been agreed by a MAP Task Force comprised of nearly 100 user and vendor corporations. MAP specifications are also agreed by the NBS/OSI Implementor's Workshop, indicating that the MAP specifications are OSI compatible. The MAP System and Protocols are described here in sufficient detail to permit the reader to gain a general understanding of MAP against a background of OSI fundamentals.

    "abstract": "This contribution describes a new type of an integrated system's architecture which reconciles the diverging needs of both, stream traffic of 64 kbit/s and bursty traffic of low and high data rates. The total capacity of a unidirectional bus is subdivided into a high-speed channel and a certain number of time slots for stream traffic. The capacity of the high-speed channel can dynamically be adjusted according to the amount of time slots required for stream traffic. Due to the dynamic creation and deletion of time slots, the subsystem for 64-kbit/s channels is almost blocking-free. The same mechanism is used to control access to the high-speed channel, and to determine the fraction of the total capacity dedicated to the high-speed channel. The performance of the proposed access mechanism has been investigated by means of system modelling and simulation. The results show that besides its ability to accommodate 64-kbit/s channels it compares quite favourably with other LAN concepts like CSMA/CD.",

This configuration enables network partitioning into independent subnetworks that can emulate various indirect cube topologies on a virtual point-to-point basis. Node transmitters are assigned fixed channels and reconfiguring the partition and/or the individual sub-network topologies is achieved by monitoring the appropriate channels. The considered network configuration can function as a general-purpose optical interconnect for a variety of heterogeneous traffic sources, such as multicomputers and ATM network interface units, communicating independently within logically defined subnetworks. The paper derives a conflict-free channel partition and assignment map for a general ( p, k ) cluster shuffle using a minimal number of channel sets.",

    "abstract": "The use of heterogeneous distributed systems is a promising approach to significantly increase computational performance of scientific applications. However, one key to this strategy is to minimize the percentage of time spent by an application moving data between machines. This percentage is composed of two parts: 1) the time to translate data between the formats used on different machines, and 2) the time to move data over the network that interconnects the machines. Previous work suggests that data format conversion activity, generally known as presentation-level services, is by far the more costly of the two.In this paper we describe how vectorization can be used to improve presentation-level performance in scientific applications by one or two orders of magnitude over the conventional approach. While others have recognized the advantages of vectorized data format conversion, we describe how to automate this process so that an application programmer need not explicitly call vectorization routines. We explore the impact of presentation-level vectorization on software portability, programming efficiency and protocol standards. We compare our performance results with those of two other popular distributed scientific application programming tools and then summarize the lessons we have learned during the course of our research.",

    "abstract": "The National Bureau of Standards has three primary goals in computer networking. 1. To develop networking and protocol standards which meet U.S. Government and industry requirements and will be implemented in off-the-shelf, commercial products. 2. To develop testing methodologies to support the development and implementation of computer network protocols; and 3. To assist Government and industry users in the application of advanced networking technologies, and computer and communication manufacturers, in the implementation of standard protocols. To support these objectives, NBS has laboratory activities where prototypes of draft protocol standards are implemented and tested in a variety of communications environments (e.g. global networks, local networks, office systems networks), supporting different applications (e.g. file transfer, message processing), on difference kinds and sizes of computers. The primary purposes are to advance the state of the art in measurement methodologies for advanced computer networking technologies, and to determine protocol implementation correctness and performance. NBS views testing as a cooperative research effort and works with other agencies, private sector companies and other countries in the development of methodologies. At this time, this cooperation involves five network laboratories in other countries and over 20 computer manufacturers. The test methodologies developed at NBS are well documented and the testing tools themselves are developed with an objective of portability and made available to many organizations engaged in protocol development and implementations. Consistent with goals, NBS standards developments, research in testing methodologies, and technical assistance are characterized by direct industry/government cooperation and mutual support.",

Until then there will remain the substantial problem of keeping an X.500 Directory up-to-date, frequently from a number of sources. Usually the volume of data will require that maintenance procedures are as automated as possible.However, naive procedures will not suffice for a number of reasons: different sources will name the same object differently; different sources will name different objects the same; the data obtained from these sources may overlap to some extent, though one source may be regarded as more authoritative than another.It is recognised that a complete solution to these data merging and updating problems will be quite complex, and such a solution is not essayed here. Instead, this paper proposes some pragmatic solutions to the majority of the problems. It is anticipated that further understanding of the problems will result from experimentation with an implementation of the tools described herein.",

    "abstract": "Most recently proposed optical fiber-based LAN architectures may be considered as different implementations of the basic round-robin transmission service in different topologies using special signal patterns or events to achieve the effect of the token passing protocol. Prioritizing the transmission of various data and control messages is necessary for time-critical applications (e.g. in data sensor or process control applications). Some extensions of the basic CSMA-CD protocol to handle packet priorities have been proposed for bidirectional channels but prioritized multiaccess protocols taking advantage of the unidirectional property of optical channels do not appear to be widely available yet. The main thrust of this paper is to propose some distributed prioritized multiaccess protocols for twin-bus optical channels. We will introduce two prioritized protocols: one uses the token packet to convey and enforce priorities and the other employs time-outs to achieve prioritization. Our protocols require only backlogged stations to be active.",

    "abstract": "A new switch-node architecture for data traffic for integrated services in a Local Area Network (LAN) is proposed. Specifically it has been designed to provide service to the following two broad types of traffic:1. Connectionless service for Interactive Data (ID) traffic.2. Connection-oriented service for Non-Interactive Data (NID) traffic.The topology of the switch-node is a bus. The key feature of the proposed scheme is the centralization , which has been exploited to provide the requisite flexibility for handling every class of traffic. The shared transmission medium is a short high speed bus which enjoys a fundamental advantage relative to distributed approaches in that the propagation delay along the length of the bus is smaller than the transmission time of a single bit. This feature can be exploited to provide simplicity and efficiency in accessing the transmission medium. The performance of the proposed media-access scheme and the centralized scheduling policy for interactive and non-interactive data traffics have been analyzed through simulation. The simulation study shows the actual efficiency of the switch-node, and proves that the proposed concurrent dual buses switch-node architecture with its centralized scheduling policy is a strong candidate to form the core of an efficient ISDN.",

Communications systems are used not only for the administration of the Department, but, most critically, for the command and control of force structures. To this end, the Defense Communications Agency (DCA) strives to ensure that the Department's missions are carried out with state-of-the-art communications systems. In this article an architecture is postulated to achieve the Department's objective of rapid, reliable, secure exchange of information at an affordable price. The goal is one system for all communications services (data, voice, video, imagery) including Office Automation (OA) needs.This article was written with the view toward communications systems which are commonly referred to as fixed systems used on military bases and for long-haul transport of information, rather than tactical communications systems used on mobile platforms such as armored vehicles, ships, and airplanes. However, due to advances in VLSI and flexibilities afforded by new transmission frameworks and switching fabrics, the concepts described in this article could apply to tactical systems as well.The views contained in this article are those of the author and should not be interpreted as necessarily representing the official policies, either expressed or implied, of DCA and DoD.",

These senses of distribution are not independent, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages in various circumstances, as well as its own research problems. However, some senses are becoming better understood than others, and some are becoming recognized as more fundamentally important than others. Distributing the user access or the system geography per se can be regarded as neither especially challenging nor critically fundamental technology. Distributing the (user portion of the) processing is important, and the ease of doing so is, to a first order approximation, determined by the extent and manner in which the data and operating system are distributed. It currently seems to be these latter two aspects of computing whose distribution involves the most essential, and difficult, new technology.",

    "abstract": "Current communication architectures suffer from a growing collection of protocols in the host operating systems, gateways and applications, resulting in increasing implementation and maintenance cost, unreliability and difficulties with interoperability. The remote procedure call (RPC) approach has been used in some distributed systems to contain the diversity of application layer protocols within the procedure call abstraction. However, the same technique cannot be applied to lower layer protocols without violating the strict notion of layers. In this paper, we show how the RPC approach can be used for lower layer protocols so that the resulting “layer violations” generate a simple recursive structure. The benefits of exploiting recursion in a communication architecture are similar to those realized from its use as a programming technique; the resulting protocol architecture minimizes the complexity and duplication of protocols and mechanism, thereby reducing the cost of implementation and verification. We also sketch a redesigned DoD Internet architecture that illustrates the potential benefits of this approach.

Nodes are connected to the Nectar network using network coprocessors that are primarily responsible the protocol processing, but that can also execute application code. This architecture allows us to analyze message latency both between workstations with an outboard protocol engine and between lightweight nodes with a minimal runtime system and a fast, simple network interface (the coprocessors). We study how much context switching, buffer management and protocol processing contribute to the communication latency and we discuss how the latency is influenced by the protocol implementation.",

If only the OSI connectionless network protocol (CLNP) is supported on the LANs, then this same protocol must operate above X.25, using the X.25 service as a virtual data link layer. The intermediate systems in this case must support CLNP packet delivery over X.25 virtual circuits, implementing the ISO 8473/DAD1 subnetwork dependent convergence function to resolve the differences which exist between the OSI connectionless network service and the connection-oriented service offered by the X.25 subnetwork. This means that the main functionality of this subnetwork dependent convergence function is to open virtual circuits on packet demand and to close them when no traffic has occurred for a period of time. This paper describes an algorithm, which calculates such a time period by taking into account the current traffic load, the connection cost and the maintenance cost.",

The applications of such databases to the provision of telecommunications and other public services are discussed. It is shown that the distribution and maintenance of the directory information describing object locations poses some fundamental problems. A new partially informed class of distributed databases is described which distributes the directory information on a “needs-to-know” basis. The class is described by models of the network topology, and by the knowledge available to each site. These proposals are sufficiently general to support the partitioning of data relations into distribution fragments, and for those fragments to be replicated at multiple sites.",

    "abstract": "No single LAN technology is sufficient to interconnect all the computers in a given plant, campus, or site. Thus it is desirable to combine different types of LANs, using a device called a Bridge, to produce an Extended LAN. Some LANs in the Extended LAN may have incompatible Data Link formats. Thus a bridge may need to encapsulate a frame originating on LAN A inside the Data Link header of another (incompatible) LAN B in order to allow the type A frame to travel over LAN B. In general, frames sent between any pair of LANs in the Extended LAN must be encapsulated across every incompatible LAN in the path between the LANs. Bridges learn their routing information from information contained in frames they forward. Besides the problems of distinguishing various kinds of encapsulated and unencapsulated frames, the encapsulating protocol used by bridges must also solve the learning problem. This leads to a new set of considerations and solutions. We begin with a rough solution, and refine it using informal arguments and examples to lead to the final description. The stages in the description roughly mimic the design process.",

However, our first proposal did not provide an effective mechanism for preallocating control channels thus presenting an overhead in gateways.This paper presents a simple new protocol for managing control reservations on each subnetwork of an internet; it is called the Virtual Control Setup Protocol (VCSP).

    "abstract": "Cronus [1-7] is an object oriented distributed system which operates in a heterogeneous computer environment of interconnected local area networks. As a distributed system architecture. Cronus faces a number of resource management issues not present in non-distributed architectures. Strategies for effectively controlling the redundancy and reconfigurability inherent in Cronus are needed to take advantage of the distributed system environment. These strategies for resource management are often conveniently separated into policies and mechanisms. A policy is a goal or guideline set by a system administrator or component designer constraining the decisions made by a resource allocator. A mechanism is an internal system structure designed to implement a class of policies. In the Cronus distributed system model, there are currently two general aspects of resource allocation mechanisms which are particular to the network environment and must be effectively managed. One of these is the binding of a client request to a particular resource manager for those resources which are available redundantly. Redundancy comes in two forms: replicated objects, (e.g., a multi-copy file) and replicated managers (any manager for a type can create a new instance of that object type). For both forms the selection of an object manager to provide the given service is an important resource management policy decision. The other important aspect of resource management mechanism is the ability to reconfigure parts of the system by dynamically migrating objects. Object migration is a powerful tool for matching system resources to tasks in a manner that attempts to maximize some measure of system performance, reliability, or survivability. Both static reconfiguration (e.g., choosing or amending the placement of object managers and their associated objects), and dynamic reconfiguration (e.g., moving an individual object in direct response to demand for its use possible in the Cronus architecture and design. The general approach to resource management in Cronus is to individually control the management of the classes of objects which make up the system. This approach extends Cronus resource management concepts beyond system resources to the abstract resources developed by applications. Resource management for an individual abstract resource (type) and for groups of related resource types (services) in Cronus is based on combining a number of carefully planned mechanisms which are part of the system architecture. In addition to resource management by resource type, a client specific policy which considers collections of object types used in a specific context can be constructed. In Cronus we achieve system wide and easily controllable resource management by requiring the object managers to cooperate in enforcing a resource management policy for their resource type. An object manager can redirect operations to a peer manager on another processor on the basis of current resource status. In the case for creation of a file to an alternate file manager which may have more storage available. Part of the basis for decisions to redirect requests are parameters, settable dynamically by system administrators through monitoring and control functions, which control the resource management strategy. The creation of objects and resource management in general thus becomes a responsibility that is decentralized among object managers on each processor based on a global allocation policy, both in terms of sharing current status and possible redirection of operations between managers. The Cronus resource management model is based on the integration of the following set of primitive mechanisms: the kernel routes requests for a given type to any available manager of that type, using the Locate mechanism Cronus managers redirect requests to a more appropriate peer to accomplish resource management objectives managers periodically collect current status of their peers, via a standard mechanism (ReportStatus), to be used as a basis for selecting a site for redirecting an operation users and applications optionally indicate specific location preferences with requests an operator can monitor and regulate the functioning of the resource management policy applications can use the basic system mechanisms (e.g. broadcast or multicast, ReportStatus operations) to build special-purpose resource management strategies tailored to their need There is a hierarchy of desirable locations for implementing resource management policies: object managers, shared libraries, and finally client programs or users themselves. Managers are the most desirable because they are readily identifiable with a limited set of object types which are likely to have similar policy goals. Also, managers are addressable as a group for administrative control to regulate the policy parameters, and for peer manager cooperation to implement the policy. Many decisions are negotiated between managers based upon information periodically obtained via the ReportStatus operation. The Cronus Monitoring and Control System uses the same ReportStatus operation to present the operator with a global view of how well the resource management policy is proceeding. In this paper we elaborate on these approaches to distributed resource management in Cronus, including appropriate background, detailed system design, and experiences with incorporating these ideas into three different resource managers.",

Traveler is an extension of the ISO routing protocols. The Traveler architecture is designed to work with traffic characteristic of existing large networks, such as the Internet. While Traveler does not require a particular routing algorithm, it is designed to work in conjunction with families of distributed routing algorithms. Because Traveler is based on the paradigm of a human traveler, it attempts to use non-deterministic and heuristic methods rather than purely algorithmic methods to determine high quality routes between two points. Traveler builds on the Landmark and Area routing architectures.",

Integrating increasing numbers of autonomous subnetworks (each with an increasing number of hosts) makes it more difficult to determine if the network managers of the subnetworks will interoperate correctly. We propose a high level, formal specification language, NMSL, as an aid in solving this problem. NMSL has two aspects of operation, a descriptive aspect and a prescriptive aspect. In its descriptive aspect, NMSL specifies abstractions of the network components and their instantiations, and verifies the consistency of such a specification. The abstractions include the data objects and processes in a network management system. These abstractions are instantiated on network elements. Network elements are grouped together in the specification of domains of administration. An extension mechanism is provided to allow for the specification of new management characteristics that the basic language cannot express. In its prescriptive aspect, NMSL generates configuration information directly from a consistent specification. This information is used to configure network management processes to make their operation consistent with their specifications. Standard management protocols (such as the emerging ISO or IETF standards) can be used to incorporate the configuration information into running management processes.",

    "abstract": "Space Station and its associated laboratories, coupled with the availability of new computing and communications technologies, have the potential of significantly enhancing scientific research. Telescience involves the interaction of scientific researchers and equipment on earth with on-board personnel and equipment as well as with other researchers, remote ground-based resources, mission control personnel, and space station developers. To assure that this potential is met, scientists and managers associated with the Space Station project must gain significant experience with the use of these technologies for scientific research, and this experience must be fed into the development process for Space Station. In this talk, a pilot program is described that is attempting to address this problem. University researchers are conducting rapid prototyping testbeds employing new telescience technologies and ideas. These testbeds are specific research experiments within the scientific discipline areas that will use Space Station laboratories. The experiments are being carried out in a coordinated manner to allow the critical questions to be answered by groups of scientists working with technologists in a rapid prototyping testbed environment. The rapid prototyping testbeds are not like a typical testbed. Rather than being used to evaluate and integrate systems on the way to deployment, the rapid prototyping testbeds constitute a Technology Evaluation Environment (TEE), allowing users to interact with advanced technologies in the conduct of scientific research in order to develop the required base of experience to permit development and evaluation of requirements and specifications.",

The Current BIAS™ routing architecture incorporates improvements [1] in the original algorithm which significantly reduce the recovery time from failures of nodes or links and is virtually loop-free, even during recovery from those failures. BIAS™ automatically re-determines the best routes for traffic throughout the network in response to the following changes to the network topology: a node (an end system or intermediate system) is added to the network; a node is removed from the network; the cost of transiting a node is changed; a logical link (LAN, leased or switched circuit, X.25 virtual circuit) is added to the network; a link is removed from the network; and/or the cost of transiting a link is changed.",

At each instant, every sender sends one bit, and the bits from all of senders are or-ed together into one bit before being received by the receiver. If a sender has a data message to send, it sends the message bits one by one; otherwise it sends zero bits. Clearly, if the sending of two messages by two senders overlap, then the resulting “collision” can result in a corrupted message, i.e., one that was not sent by either sender. The function of the protocol is to deliver those and only those messages that are not corrupted by collision. (In other words, the receiver acts as a discriminating seine that catches and delivers only uncorrupted messages; hence the title.) The two protocols presented here are based on Manchester codes and general balanced codes, respectively.",

    "abstract": "We present a feedback congestion control method, Dynamic Time Windows, for use in high speed wide area networks based on controlling source variance. It is part of the two-level integrated congestion control system introduced in our earlier work[1]. The method consists of a packet admission control system and a feedback system to dynamically control source burstiness. Source throughput is not modulated as with traditional packet windows, allowing system throughput to remain high while avoiding congestion. Furthermore, the admission control bounds congestion times in the network, allowing feedback to be effective in the face of large bandwidth delay products. The basic control mechanisms are analogs to traditional packet windows applied to controlling time windows - a new mechanism which allows switches to modulate source variances. The proposed system is simulated, and the results reported and analyzed. Enhancements to the basic system are also proposed and analyzed. We wish to stress that the system described here is the second level of a two-level congestion control. Previous work[1] concentrated on the switch queueing mechanism, Pulse, while this work is a detailed examination of the feedback system used to adjust time windows to changing network load.",

A priority mechanism that was considered for the standard showed to be not effective. As of now, there exists no protocol for multiple access dual bus networks that is able to implement pre-emptive priorites and, at the same time, can satisfy minimal fairness requirements for transmissions at the highest priority level. In this study, a protocol with strictly pre-emptive priorities, i.e., a protocol that does not admit low priority traffic if the load from high priority traffic exceeds the capacity of the transmission channel, is presented. The protocol is derived from a unique bandwidth allocation scheme with a full utilization of the bus capacity, with a fair distribution of bandwidth respective to traffic from a particular priority level and with pre-emptive priorities. The performance of the presented protocol is compared to a priority mechanism that is based on the bandwidth balancing mechanism. It is shown that adopting the new protocol results in shorter access delays for high priority transmissions.",

A properly chosen hierarchical system has the advantages of the individual schemes while lessening the impact of their disadvantages. The hierarchical scheme is also applicable to packet-switched and datagram-based networks.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a distributed, end-to-end congestion control protocol for use in high-traffic packet switched networks. The network is represented as a stochastic single-server queue, with arrival rates being the control variables. A time-stamp based measure of network state called warp is defined, and it is shown to be an estimator of network utilization. Congestion is modeled explicitly using unimodal load-service rate functions, and its monotonicity property is exploited to yield characterizations of stability and optimality. A protocol based on \"perfect\" information is analyzed, whose prowess is then shown to be emulated by one which only uses locally computable, delayed information. The main effect of a unimodal load-service function is to induce a division of the phase space into stable and unstable regions, the optimal operating point being its \"boundary.\" Protocols are devised for dealing with each regime separately, rate adjustment protocol being the control that guides the system to the optimal operating point. Proactive rate protocol and reactive rate protocol deal with the issue of the optimal operating point being near to the unstable zone. Protocols for handling fairness and structural perturbation augment the basic suite. The analysis is supported by simulations showing the global dynamical properties of the system.",

    "abstract": "Recently, multichannel networks composed of several parallel, medium-speed channels multiplexed on a single high-speed medium have been proposed as a practical way to harness the high bandwidths of optical fibers. In order to limit the cost of network interfaces, a partially-connected multichannel network allows each node access to only a proper subset of the channels, its channel set. Staircase interconnection topologies constitute a family of partially-connected multichannel networks in which every node can still send messages directly to every other node. Group-based computer applications composed of cooperative processing entities are proliferating. The communication among processes in group-based applications typically involves multiple destinations and is often symmetric and temporally local. In this paper, we investigate the problem of supporting group communication in staircase multichannel networks. We analyze those properties of staircase topologies that benefit temporally local multicast communication. We then develop an adaptive protocol that permits nodes to dynamically change their channel sets. These changes are based on recent network traffic history, thus enabling the topology to conform to network traffic patterns and, specifically, group locality. Analytical and simulation results are presented.",
