    "abstract": "PURPOSE To compile a survey of the longevity and reasons for failure of stainless steel crowns, amalgam, glass-ionomer, composite and compomer restorations in stress-bearing cavities of primary molars. METHODS This work reviewed the dental literature of 1971 up to July 2003 for longitudinal, controlled clinical studies and retrospective cross-sectional studies. Only studies investigating the clinical performance of restorations in primary teeth with an observation period of at least 2 years were included. Annual failure rates of stainless steel crowns, amalgam, glass-ionomer, composite and compomer restorations were determined and failure reasons were discussed. RESULTS Annual failure rates in stress-bearing cavities of primary molars were determined to be: 0-14% for stainless steel crowns, 0-35.3% for amalgam restorations, 0-25.8% for glass-ionomer restorations, 2-29.1% for atraumatic restorative treatments, 0-15% for composite restorations, and 0-11 for compomer restorations. Main reasons for failure were secondary caries, marginal deficiencies, fracture, and wear.",

    "abstract": "Purpose To follow-up teeth with deep caries lesions submitted to incomplete caries removal over a 10-year period. Methods 27 subjects (32 permanent posterior teeth) with deep caries lesions composed the sample. In this single-arm long-term prospective study, the inclusion criteria were risk of pulp exposure during caries excavation, positive response to the cold test, absence of spontaneous pain or sensitivity during percussion, and radiographic absence of a periapical lesion. Subjects were submitted to the following procedures: complete caries removal from the surrounding cavity walls, incomplete caries removal from the pulpal wall, capping with a calcium hydroxide cement, and sealing with a modified zinc oxide-eugenol cement. After 6-7 months, the temporary sealing was removed for methodological purposes (no further excavation was performed), and teeth were capped with a calcium hydroxide cement and filled with resin composite. Clinical and radiographic assessments were conducted after 6-7 months, 1.5, 3, 5 and 10 years. Success was defined as clinical and radiographic signs and symptoms of pulp sensitivity while failure was defined as endodontic treatment need. Results Over 10 years, one tooth was excluded from the sample (pulp exposure during treatment), five were lost to recall, 10 had therapy failure (five fractures and four necroses leading to endodontic treatment need, and one extraction) and 16 had therapy success (pulp sensitivity). Overall survival rates were 97%, 90%, 82% and 63% at 1.5-, 3-, 5- and 10-year follow-ups, respectively. Teeth with two or more restored surfaces failed significantly more than teeth with one restored surface (P= 0.01).",

A total of 60 restorations were inserted equally in Class I and II preparations and in premolars and molars. A glass ionomer liner was applied to the dentin. Light-cured direct inlays were fabricated in the oral environment. Thirty inlays were heat-treated for 7.5 minutes at 125 degrees C in a dry heat oven. Enamel margins of the preparations were etched with 37% phosphoric acid gel. All inlays were cemented with a light-cured enamel bonding resin. Restorations were evaluated using the USPHS system and M-L indirect scale. Six, 12, 24 and 36-month recalls were compared to baseline. Color, interfacial staining, secondary caries, and wear were unchanged from baseline for all restorations. Marginal integrity and surface texture show a differential change from baseline and with respect to restoration type. Indirect wear was not significantly different between restoration types (P < 0.05). Wear resistance was not significantly improved with heat treatment, but marginal integrity and surface characteristics showed marked improvement in the heat-treated group at 24 and 36-month recalls.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the reliability of marginal leakage assessment of self-etch adhesive Class II resin composite restorations in primary molars prepared in vivo using the micro-CT.Fourteen primary molars, divided over seven ART and seven traditional resin composite Class II restorations, were subjected to marginal leakage test using a 50% (w/v) silver nitrate solution for 4 hours by a micro-CT. Two evaluators selected the image with the deepest marginal dye penetration for each restoration from the occlusal and approximal surfaces on consensus. The deepest dye penetration depth and total length of the axial cavity wall from both the occlusal and from the approximl surface were measured manually using morphometric quantification software by three evaluators independently. ANOVA was applied to test for differences in marginal leakage scores between the three evaluators.There was no marginal leakage found in five traditional and one ART restoration. The percentage of silver nitrate penetration depth from the cervical-approximal site ranged from 10.2-92.6%. There was only a statistically significant difference observed in measuring total axial wall length from the cervical-approximal site between the three evaluators (P = 0.02). This explanatory investigation showed that the micro-CT was a very useful device for developing a standardized method for measuring marginal leakage from samples obtained in vivo. In combination with 50% (w/v) silver nitrate and 4-hour immersion, marginal leakage along the restoration-tooth tissue interface was accurately and reliably measured. (Am J Dent 2008;21:393-397).",

At baseline the following measurements were recorded: (1) recession depth; (2) probing depth; (3) clinical attachment level; and (4) width of keratinized tissue. At 24 months post-surgery, all clinical measurements were repeated.Mean root coverage obtained with the laterally positioned flaps was 93.8%. Complete root coverage was obtained in 62.5% of the recipient sites. The mean recession depth decreased from 4.71 +/- 1.30 mm to 0.28 +/- 0.42 mm. Statistically significant improvements were found for all clinical parameters from baseline to 24 months (P < 0.05). Patients with maxillary recessions recorded statistically superior gains in the width of keratinized tissue than patients with mandibular recessions. The results of the present study demonstrated that the LPF is an effective procedure to cover localized gingival recession. Moreover, both groups (i.e., patients with maxillary or mandibular recessions) recorded similar significant improvements from baseline to 24-month examination, except for the width of keratinized tissue which was statistically higher for maxillary recessions.",

After ethics approval, a randomized controlled split-mouth clinical trial was performed. 30 subjects were selected according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and two restorations were randomly performed in each first or second molar that presented caries, fracture, or cosmetic needs. One restoration was done with the bulk-fill material Admira Fusion x-tra, applied with increments up to 4 mm (intervention group), while the second was performed with the regular Admira Fusion, applied by a 2 mm layering technique (control group). The universal adhesive system Futurabond U was used for both groups. The subjects and examiners were blinded, and the examiners were previously calibrated. The restorations were evaluated according to FDI criteria, after 7 days, 6, 12 and 24 months, and the outcome was success rate based on esthetic, functional and biological properties. The time necessary for application of both materials into the preparations was also measured. After 24 months, 26 patients attended the recall and 52 restorations were evaluated. The Fisher's statistical analysis (α= 5%) showed non-significant differences between techniques for esthetic, biological and functional properties in all evaluations (P> 0.05). After 2 years, 96% of the subjects for both groups did not show any sign of post-operative sensitivity and 100% of the teeth were vital and without secondary caries. Around 70% of the restorations received score excellent for surface luster, more than 83% for surface staining and 63% for color match. In relation to marginal adaptation and marginal staining, more than 80% for the layering material and 63% for the bulk showed excellent scores. Only three restorations of the 60 performed showed small fractures, although not affecting the esthetics or function. The time for composite application was significantly shorter for the bulk material (P= 0.0454). After 24 months of intraoral service, the restorations made with both materials presented similar and excellent clinical performance for all parameters analyzed. The bulk-fill material required significantly less chair time to apply than the layering one, simplifying and accelerating the restorative technique. The bulk-fill ormocer-based composite was an appropriate alternative to the conventional layering material, since similar clinical performance was observed after 2 years, with the advantage of shorter chair time, due to simplified operative procedures.",

Ratios of the hue angle shifts by the illuminant were from -1.6 to 1.8 for the VITA, from -7.3 to 1.2 for the CHRO and from -1.2 to 3.1 for the 3D-M. Changes in color and hue angle of shade tabs were significantly different by the shade tab designation when illuminant was changed (P < 0.01).",

The in-office whitening agent (Opalescence Boost 35%) was used in this study. Two whitening regimens were evaluated on maxillary anterior teeth: (1) with light irradiation; and (2) without light irradiation. The ΔE*, changes of L*, a*, b*, and the best shade match on the central incisor before, immediately after, and 6 months after whitening procedures were evaluated using a dental spectrophotometer. The ΔE and shade had no significant differences with or without light irradiation. In addition, the ΔE, changes of L*, a*, b*, and shade did not change over 6 months after bleaching at a level detectable to the naked eye. The results suggested that the in-office whitening agent using 35% hydrogen peroxide without photocatalysts can improve tooth color with or without light irradiation for 6 months after whitening. In office whitening using 35% hydrogen peroxide without photocatalysts should be considered as a good treatment option for vital teeth whitening.",

As a control, the longitudinal section of a caries-free extracted human tooth was prepared. The VMH and DIAGNOdent values were measured and the microstructure of the dentin cavity wall was examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM).When Caries Check was employed as a guide for carious dentin removal, the microhardness of the cavity wall was significantly lower than the normal dentin and the DIAGNOdent value indicated that the dentin may have recalcified. SEM observations of the stained regions revealed that Caries Check did not stain the sclerotic dentin. Based on these findings, Caries Check may be a useful modality because the excavation of the dentin structure was shallower and the sclerotic dentin was preserved.",

For cultivation of the microorganisms as well as for the subsequent determination of the colony forming units (CFUs), Columbia blood agar plates or Sabouraud agar were used. The cycle of daily toothbrushing was imitated by rinsing the brushes with 200 ml sterile tap water to reduce the number of microorganisms and the brushes were then placed upright to allow drying overnight. Colony counts were done initially (time 0) and again at 20 hours. The rinsing fluid was also examined in order to determine the decrease of microorganisms due to this step. All experiments were done twice and the means were calculated and statistically evaluated.There was no significant reduction in CFUs by silver-coated toothbrushes (P > 0.05) for all of the microorganisms tested. On the contrary, the colony counts for S. sanguis (P = 0.02) and C. albicans (P = 0.01) were significantly higher on silver-coated toothbrushes compared to the controls.

Immediately after rinsing, subjects brushed their teeth for 30 seconds with a commercially-available dentifrice containing 0.76% sodium monofluorophosphate and a soft-bristled toothbrush. The morning rinsing/brushing procedure was done under supervision at the clinical facility. The evening rinsing/brushing procedure was done at home.

The deltas for luminosity, chroma, and hue all showed significant improvements for baseline to 15 minutes post treatment (P ≤ 0.05), baseline to 3 days post treatment (P ≤ 0.05), but not for 15 minutes to 3 days post treatment (P ≥ 0.05). When comparing between groups applying T-test, no statistically significant differences were found (P ≥ 0.05) for all three deltas. When comparing sensitivity after bleaching, no differences were found between groups (P ≥ 0.05). The use of laser during bleaching treatment did not improve the results compared to not using laser.",

    "abstract": "Purpose To evaluate the effect of bacterial exposure on the marginal integrity of dentin-resin interfaces for composites with and without bioactive glass (BAG). Methods Cavity preparations of 5 mm width and 1.5 mm depth were machined into dentin disks by means of a computer controlled milling system. After applying the bonding agent, cavity preparations (n=3-5) were restored by incremental technique with experimental resin composites (50:50 BisGMA/TEGDMA: 72wt% filler) with different filler compositions: control - 67 wt% silanated strontium glass and 5wt% aerosol-silica filler and BAG - 57 wt% silanated strontium glass and 15 wt% BAG-65 wt% silica. Samples were then stored in sterile Todd-Hewitt media or co-incubated with Streptococcus mutans (UA 159), at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 1-2 weeks. For samples co-incubated with a living biofilm, a luciferase assay was performed in order to assess its viability. Surfaces were impressed before and after each storage condition and replicas examined in a scanning electron microscope. Using image analysis software (Image J), the discontinuous margins percentage (%DM) was quantitatively assessed. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test (α= 0.05). Results Gap size ranged between 7-23 µm. The bacterial exposure significantly increased the %DM in both groups predominantly due to the formation of new gap regions. There was no difference between control and BAG composites regarding %DM and the biofilm viability. Bacterial exposure promoted degradation of composite restoration marginal integrity, with no difference between composites with and without BAG. Clinical significance The samples incubated with living biofilm had a higher gap percentage in the margins, confirming the negative effect of cariogenic bacteria on margin degradation. The parameters defined for such synergy can help to understand the multi-factorial aspect of marginal discontinuity and therefore, predict the behavior of composite restorations subjected to the challenging oral environment.",

Eligible articles were included. Second, the eligible articles were classified according to the different types. Next, the NOS and ROB2 as evaluation indicators were used to evaluate the bias of those included articles. Finally, sensitive factors were excluded through the outcomes and data analyses were retrieved. Results More than 1,562 articles were retrieved, and 38 in vivo research documents were systematically analyzed after screening according to the inclusion criteria, which mainly listed three aspects of the coronal, apical, and angular implant data, and integrated the same type of articles in the study. To test its heterogeneity, the P-values of those articles included in the analysis were all less than 0.05. Finally, in the comparison between the guide group and the free-hand group after excluding sensitive factors, the standardized mean difference (Std.MD) of the angle was 1.26 (95% CI 1.06, 1.47), the Std.MD of the apical point was 1.38 (95% CI 1.12, 1.63), and the Std.MD of the coronal point was 0.98 (95% CI 0.66, 1.29). Comparing the maxillary and mandibular groups after excluding sensitive factors, the Std.MD of the coronal point was -0.31 (95% CI -0.52, -0.09), the Std.MD of the apical point was -0.15 (95% CI -0.34, 0.03), and the Std.MD of the angle is -0.23 (95% CI -0.46, 0.01). Comparison between the smoking group and the nonsmoking group, and between the flap group and the flapless group showed that there was not enough evidence to make a reliable assessment. Clinical significance Compared with free-hand operation, a digital guide is more accurate in the apex, the coronal point and the angle, and the accuracy in the angle was very high. The difference in accuracy between the maxillary and mandibular groups was not statistically significant. Other factors such as smoking habit and flap need more clinical data.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To evaluate the effect of light cure, as well as various dentin surface treatment approaches, on the penetration depth of silver precipitating from 38% silver diamine fluoride into primary dentin tubules. METHODS The occlusal dentin surfaces of 42 non-carious primary molars were exposed and then sectioned into halves bucco-lingually. The halves from each tooth pair were randomly split in two mega-groups, and each mega-group was divided randomly as follows into six experimental groups: prepared by either carbide bur (G1, G2), ceramic bur (G3, G4), or erbium laser (G5, G6). SDF was then applied to all prepared surfaces, and finally even-numbered groups (G2, G4, G6) were light cured. One mega-group was assigned to quantitative evaluation of silver penetration depth along the axial wall, and the other mega-group was reserved for qualitative observation of relative silver distribution on the occlusal surface, both via scanning electron microscope. RESULTS No significant difference was observed in silver penetration depth between light cure and non-light cure groups (P= 0.8908). There was a statistically significant association between tooth preparation method and depth of silver penetration (P< 0.000001); laser-treated groups had significantly deeper silver penetration (1,148.9 µm G5, 1160.4 µm G6) than carbide bur (P< 0.05; 184.7 µm G1, 301.8 µm G2) or ceramic bur (P< 0.05; 184.1 µm G3, 131.0 µm G4) groups. A significant difference (P< 0.05) was noted in percentage occlusal surface coverage of particles between laser (51.4% G5, 35.8% G6) and carbide groups (21.1% G1, 19.3% G2). Light cure had no significant effect on the depth of silver penetration from 38% SDF in the dentin of primary teeth. Laser preparation resulted in deeper silver penetration than carbide or ceramic bur. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Exposure of 38% silver diamine fluoride-treated dentin to light cure did not affect the depth of penetration of silver particles into the dentin tubules of primary teeth. Rather, tooth preparation approaches that reduce the smear layer, like laser ablation, resulted in the deepest penetration of silver into the tubules. Clinical application of these findings will depend on scenario and treatment aim.",

METHODS 10 seconds RE was delivered to MARC-PS' anterior sensor by Bluephase-Style, Demi-Plus, and Deep-Cure-S. Two ivorine lower first-molars received Class-2 proximal box preparations: (3×2×4 mm and 4×4×4 mm) and were sectioned horizontally above the cementoenamel junction. Tofflemire matrix-retainer was placed around each tooth and secured with a low-fusing compound. Each LPU tested delivered 10 seconds RE to MARC-PS through proximal slots. Mean RE of three readings per group was obtained. Data were analyzed using Pearson correlation, mixed ANOVAs with a pre-set alpha of 0.05. RESULTS RE attenuation ratio calculated from the baseline to 4× 4×4/3×2×4 Class-2 boxes were: 58.25/80.03 Bluephase-Style; 49.36/80.25 Demi-Plus; 32.8/77.43 Deep-Cure-S. A significant and strong correlation (r= 0.86, P< 0.001) between the reduction in aperture size and RE was found. The beam profile of LED-LPUs tested decreased RE values at the bottom of a proximal box. More than 80% RE value reduction from the baseline to the smallest Class-2 cavity 3×2×4 aperture was observed. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Polymerization of resin-composites at the bottom of the Class-2 box is challenging due to the small aperture size, depth, and hard-to-reach location. Inadequate polymerization at the bottom of the Class-2 proximal box is a causative factor for secondary caries and, ultimately, restoration failure.",

The four treatment regimens consisted of (1) brushing for 2 minutes with the Ultreo powered toothbrush according to manufacturer's instructions, (2) brushing for 2 minutes with the Ultreo toothbrush (power turned off) using the brush like a manual toothbrush, (3) having a trained dental hygienist hold the Ultreo toothbrush head 3 mm from tooth surfaces for a total of 2 minutes, or (4) swishing with a dentifrice slurry for 1 minute in the absence of toothbrushing. For each subject, an experienced, calibrated plaque examiner performed the Turesky Modified Quigley-Hein Plaque Index prior to brushing and following brushing. The difference (baseline minus post-regimen) in average scores was calculated for each subject. The difference scores were analyzed for treatment regimen differences using a mixed model ANCOVA (with baseline whole-mouth average score as the covariate and subjects considered random) for a crossover design.Adjusted mean plaque removal scores (baseline plaque score minus post-brushing plaque score) were 0.052 for swishing with a dentifrice slurry, 0.058 for the dental hygienist holding the Ultreo toothbrush approximately 3 mm from tooth surfaces, 0.536 for the Ultreo toothbrush used according to manufacturer's instructions and 0.666 for the Ultreo toothbrush (power turned off) used like a manual toothbrush.

A bleaching agent (40% H2O2) was activated using a neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser, an 810-nm diode laser, a light-emitting diode (LED), and conventional (chemical) treatment. The CIE L*a*b* system and ΔE* values were used to measure color changes in the teeth using a spectrophotometer. TS was measured using the visual analogue scale (VAS). The measurements were performed before the treatment, immediately afterwards, and 2 weeks, 1 month, and 6 months later. A P< 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. The most statistically significant color change occurred in the 2nd week (⏊E2) in all groups (P< 0.05). However, the most color change in the 2nd week (ΔE2) occurred in the Nd:YAG group, yet there was no statistically significant result between Nd:YAG and LED (P< 0.05). After the procedure (VAS2), a statistically significant increase in TS was observed in all groups (P< 0.05), with the highest sensitivity observed in the LED group; significant differences were observed between the LED and the other groups (P< 0.05). Although all light activation techniques showed noticeable color changes, the conventional technique showed appreciable color change at the 6-month follow-up. Nd:YAG and diode laser activation can be preferable alternatives to LED and conventional activation in clinical practice as they bleach more and faster, decrease the number of sessions and chair time, and cause minimum sensitivity.",

METHODS 66 molars with compound class II cavities, with gingival margin 1 mm below CEJ, were divided into three groups according to the universal adhesive used. The adhesives evaluated included All-Bond Universal (AB), Single Bond Universal (SB), and Prime&Bond Elect (PB). The groups were further subdivided according to adhesive application technique, either single layer or double layer application. All teeth were restored with the same nanofilled resin composite. µTBS were examined at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/minute after 24 hours or 12 months water storage. Fracture mode was assessed under stereomicroscope. Data were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's post hoc test (P< 0.05). RESULTS The double layer application µTBS values were significantly higher than single layer application in all groups. Regardless of the type of adhesive or application technique, all subgroups showed significantly decreased bond strength after aging. There were significant lower µTBS values for AB adhesive compared with the other two adhesives that demonstrated no significant differences between them. The double layer application technique was effective in enhancing µTBS values of all tested adhesives bonded to proximal dentin/cementum gingival margins compared to single layer application. Regardless of application technique, all tested adhesives were incapable of defying long-term water aging. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The double layer application technique may be recommended to enhance the bonding durability of universal adhesives to face challenges in bonding to dentin-cementum cervical margins.",

METHODS Integrated data of hospital patients was used. Data from the corresponding diagnosis codes for rheumatoid arthritis and periapical abscess was retrieved by searching the appropriate query in the database. The odd ratio (OR) of periapical abscesses, its association with rheumatoid arthritis and intake of three commonly prescribed antirheumatic medications were calculated and analyzed statistically. RESULTS The prevalence of periapical abscesses in patients with rheumatoid arthritis was 1.53% as compared to 0.51% in the general patient population of the hospital. The OR was 2.60 and the difference was statistically significant (P< 0.0001). In patients treated with either Methotrexate, Sulfasalazine, or Etanercept, the ORs were 2.88, 3.1, and 1.07, respectively. The differences between Methotrexate and Sulfasalazine were statistically significant (P< 0.0001). The OR for prevalence of periapical abscesses in patients treated with Etanercept was significantly lower than that of patients treated with either Methotrexate or Sulfasalazine (P< 0.005). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Oral healthcare providers should be aware of the possible association between rheumatoid arthritis and occurrence of periapical abscesses. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, mainly women, may exhibit higher prevalence of periapical abscesses. Treatment with TNF alpha inhibitors may lower the prevalence of periapical abscesses in such patients.",

The root surfaces were thoroughly cleaned, thereby removing the cementum. From each tooth four root dentin specimens were prepared. The specimens were distributed among the following experimental groups: C: control group (untreated), S: Syntac Classic, X: Xeno III, and H: Hyposen. For each subject, one dentin specimen of each group was inserted into both buccal aspects of a bilateral intraoral mandibular appliance. The appliances were worn by 14 subjects for 5 weeks day and night. One side was brushed daily with fluoride-containing toothpaste (Aronal) (B). On the other side, plaque was allowed to grow (NB). Individual oral hygiene techniques were performed without any fluorides. During meals, the appliance was stored in 10% sucrose solution. After the in situ period, slabs (150 microm) were ground and studied using polarized light microscopy.For lesion depth, ANOVA revealed significant differences between brushed and unbrushed specimens.

Compared to the non-brushed groups, lesion depths in the brushed group were significantly decreased (P < 0.05, Tukey's test). The reduction of lesion depths after application of the three agents was significant in both cases (brushed and non-brushed groups).

The hypothesis tested was that there was no significant difference among the posts.90 freshly extracted single rooted lower bicuspids were evaluated for similar root morphology. The teeth were decoronated using an Isomet saw leaving a 15 mm-long sample. Preoperative digital radiographs were taken of all samples from the buccal and mesial direction. A glide path was established with #15K type file. Roots were then instrumented to working length to a size #40 .04 using Profile nickel titanium files. 1cc of distilled water was used as an irrigant after each file to remove dentinal debris. The teeth were then obturated with custom fit #40 0.04 taper gutta percha points and AH Plus as a sealer, using a warm vertical compaction technique. Residual gutta percha of 5 mm was left. The samples were divided into three experimental groups to receive posts. Group 1: Fiber White Para-Post No. 2 red; Group 2: No. 1 DT Light Post; Group 3: PeerlessPost No. 3. Post spaces were created in Groups 1 and 2 with the appropriate drills supplied by the manufacturer using a slow speed handpiece. The post spaces from Group 3 required no further preparation after endodontic treatment. All posts were cemented with Nexus 2 Universal Luting System. A layer of excess cement was left in the most coronal portion of the tooth for visual confirmation of tensile strength failure. Using an Instron the teeth were mounted in a custom-made jig to prevent crushing of the post and to ensure extension perpendicular to the long axis of the post. Samples were then subjected to tensile stresses until failure occurred. Failure was defined as the maximum load produced under tensile load that corresponded to visual separation of the post from the tooth. The maximum load at failure in kilograms was recorded. The average of each group was compared for significant difference. Data was analyzed using ANOVA at a significance level of P= 0.016 (Bonferroni correction for multiple t-tests).Maximum load at failure, measured in kilograms, were as follows: PeerlessPosts 126.07 kg, Fiber White Posts 90.14kg, and DT Light Posts 88.46 kg.

Biofilms were divided into four groups and were exposed to acoustic energy delivered by Sonicare for 0 (control group), 5, 15 and 30 seconds. The distance between the end of the bristles and the disk surface was set to 7 mm, to ensure that the biofilm removal was simply due to fluid forces and not to the contact with the bristle tips during the brushing cycle. A colorimetric technique (MTT assay), based on the reduction of a yellow tetrazolium salt to a purple formazan, was used to evaluate the reduction of the adherent biomass after the exposure to the sonic energy.ANOVA results showed that sonic energy exposure significantly reduced the biomass of S. mutans and S. salivarius adherent to the disks, while L. acidophilus and V. alcalescens seemed to remain basically unaffected. In the two streptococcal groups, the increase of the exposure time led to different reduction trends; while S. salivarius exhibited a progressive decrease over time, S. mutans showed a rapid reduction of the adherent biomass after a 15-second exposure to Sonicare.",

Impressions were taken of a master cone at 30-second intervals after mixing and up to 30 seconds beyond the recommended working time. Impression accuracy (deltad) was determined as the dimensional deviation of stone dies from the master cone. The phase angle delta(t) and storage modulus G'(t) were measured and the working time determined according to ISO 4823. Three operators assessed the latest point in time for uncompromised impression taking. Correlation analysis was performed using Spearman's Rho (P = 0.05).For most materials investigated, deltad(t) was constant within the manufacturers' recommended working time whereas delta(t) and G'(t) changed significantly. There was no correlation (P > 0.05) between deltad(t) versus delta(t) and G'(t), respectively.

Methods 40 resin composite discs were divided into three groups: 15 each for CS and EVP aerosol exposure and 10 for air exposure (control). Exposures were performed for 15 days, with daily brushing with regular toothpaste. Two whitening sessions, including 21 days of brushing with whitening toothpaste and 3 days of treatments with take-home bleaching (6% H2O2), were performed after the exposure. Color and gloss were assessed before exposure, at every 5 days of exposure, and after each whitening session. Results After 15 days of exposure, marked discoloration of resin composite was observed in the CS group (ΔE = 23.66 ± 2.31), minimal color change in the EVP group ((ΔE = 2.77 ± 0.75), and no color change in the control group. Resin composites exposed to CS did not recover their original color after treatment with whitening toothpaste ((ΔE = 20.17 ± 2.68) or take-home bleaching ((ΔE = 19.32 ± 2.53), but those exposed to EVP aerosol reverted to baseline after treatment with whitening toothpaste ((ΔE = 0.98 ± 0.37), and no further change in color was observed following take-home bleaching. The gloss of resin composites exposed to CS, EVP aerosol, and air decreased equally with exposure time. Brushing with whitening toothpaste recovered the gloss similarly in all groups, but no further change was observed following take-home bleaching. Clinical significance Aerosol from electronic vapor products induced minimal discoloration of resin composites that can be completely reverted by brushing with whitening toothpaste alone. Bleaching with 6% H2O2 did not revert discoloration caused by cigarette smoke. Whitening toothpaste could help revert the decreased gloss of resin composites.",

METHODS Early caries lesions were created in human permanent enamel specimens. The specimens (n=36 per group) were then treated with a single application of: SDF (38%), SDF followed by application of potassium iodide (SDF+KI), potassium fluoride (KF); fluoride control, 44,800 ppm (F), silver nitrate (AgNO3); silver control, 253,900 ppm (Ag), or deionized water (DIW). Immediately, the specimens were subjected to 4 days of continuous remineralization with or without mucin (n=18 per subgroup). Changes in Vickers surface microhardness from lesion baseline (ΔVHN) were calculated. Data were analyzed using two-way (intervention vs. rehardening models) ANOVA. RESULTS In both rehardening models (with or without mucin), SDF (ΔVHN data; mean ± standard deviation; with/without mucin: 26± 19/3± 11) was significantly less effective in rehardening promotion than SDF+KI (37± 12/39± 16) and KF (40± 17/41± 29; P≤ 0.0332). Compared to AgNO3 (9± 9/18± 15) and DIW (3± 7/12± 9), SDF was more effective in the presence of mucin (P≤ 0.001) but not in its absence, similar to DIW (P= 0.1117); less effective vs. AgNO3 (P= 0.0061). The presence of mucin significantly increased the rehardening ability of SDF (P< 0.0001). However, mucin did not affect the extent of rehardening in the other groups (P≥ 0.082). SDF+KI and KF were superior in their ability in rehardening promotion than AgNO3 and DIW in both rehardening models (P< 0.0001). In both rehardening models, ΔL* values from baseline to post-rehardening show that applying KI after SDF significantly lessened the dark staining caused by SDF (P< 0.0001). Under the present in vitro conditions, SDF does not appear to enhance surface rehardening of early enamel caries lesions. The co-presence of mucin during rehardening enhanced the efficacy of SDF which warrants further investigation. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Silver diamine fluoride + potassium iodide may be a viable option in rehardening of early enamel caries lesions.",

METHODS Blue, green, pink and gold-colored titanium backgrounds were produced via different anodization voltage values. Non-anodized grey colored titanium was used as a control. A total of 40 disc-shaped zirconia specimens were prepared from four different zirconia types (Cercon HT, Noritake Alliance, Prettau, and Ice Zirkon). The zirconia specimens were placed on different titanium backgrounds to evaluate color differences (ΔE) by recording the L, a and b values. ΔE, ΔL, Δa and Δb values were compared for different titanium backgrounds and zirconia types. To analyze the results, repeated measures ANOVA and Bonferroni adjustments for pairwise comparison were used (α= 0.05). RESULTS The Cercon HT group had the highest ΔE value, while the Noritake group showed the lowest ΔE value (P< 0.05). ΔL, Δa and Δb values showed significant color changes depending on the color of the titanium background, the sintering procedure of zirconia and the zirconia ingredients (P< 0.05). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Anodized titanium abutments may improve color in esthetic regions when a ceramic abutment cannot be used. The study showed that the gold-colored titanium produced via anodization was better than other colors at producing a tooth-like color for implant-supported zirconia restorations. Also, by adjusting the color of zirconia restorations, the effect of the background could be altered using the zirconia sintering protocol.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the effect of a stannous-containing fluoride dentifrice on gingival health and on the composition of the oral microbiome versus a positive control dentifrice over 2 weeks, in a population of healthy adults with self-reported sub-optimal oral health at baseline. This was a randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical study. 87 subjects with self-reported sub-optimal oral health at enrollment were randomized to brush twice daily with either an experimental dentifrice (n= 43) or a marketed positive control dentifrice (n= 43), both containing stannous chloride and 0.321% sodium fluoride. All subjects used a soft, manual toothbrush that was provided. The Mazza modification of gingival papillary bleeding Index (Mazza GI) was used to assess gingivitis at baseline and at Week 2. Supragingival plaque was collected for microbiome composition analyses at baseline, Week 1, and Week 2. 83 subjects completed the study. Baseline means were balanced between the treatment groups (P> 0.34). At Week 2, the positive control dentifrice demonstrated a 63.8% statistically significant (P< 0.0001) reduction relative to baseline for Mazza number of gingival bleeding sites. The experimental stannous containing dentifrice provided a comparable 63.5% gingival bleeding reduction versus baseline. There was no significant (P= 0.96) difference between the two dentifrices for either Mazza GI score or number of bleeding sites measured. The microbiome composition analysis at Week 1 found that 28 gingivitis-associated bacterial genera, including Porphyromonas, Tannerella, and Fusobacterium, were significantly inhibited in both dentifrice groups when compared to baseline, while the relative abundance of genera associated with oral health, such as Rothia, Streptococcus, Haemophilus, and Lautropia, was significantly elevated after treatment. These improvements in the oral ecosystem were sustained at Week 2. An experimental stannous-containing sodium fluoride dentifrice significantly reduced gingival bleeding comparable to a positive control, and both dentifrices promoted a shift in the oral microbiome towards those genera associated with oral health in a subject population with self-reported sub-optimal oral health at baseline.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To compare the effect of the immediate dentin sealing (IDS) and resin cement type on fracture resistance of Class II mesio-occluso-distal (MOD) zirconia inlay restorations. METHODS 90 Class II MOD cavities on freshly extracted human mandibular third molars, prepared with a high-speed handpiece, were divided into two groups: those with IDS (CR+) and without IDS (CR-). The CEREC system was used to prepare zirconia inlays from Katana super translucent multi-layered blocks. The inlays were cemented with one of three resin cements: RelyX Unicem 2 (RU), Multilink Automix (MA), or Super-Bond (SB). These specimens were stored in water at 37°C for 24 hours and exposed to 5,000 thermal cycles. A vertical load was applied with a metal sphere (Φ 6-mm) on a material testing system, with a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/minute, until the specimen fractured. Fracture resistance was measured for each tooth, and the fractures were categorized according to Burke's classification. Statistical analyses were conducted using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's honest significant difference tests (P< 0.05). RESULTS No significant differences in tooth fracture resistance were identified between the CR+ and CR- groups. The SB group had a significantly higher fracture resistance compared to that of the MA group. Fracture morphology showed many mode IV fractures in all groups. IDS did not affect tooth fracture resistance, although there was a significant difference in tooth fracture resistance for different resin cement types used with Class II MOD zirconia inlay restorations. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Zirconia inlay restorations provide excellent mechanical performance, morphology, and esthetic appearance. In vitro, zirconia inlays cemented with any luting resin cement restored tooth fracture resistance to levels similar to that of intact teeth. Fracture resistance varied among the different resin cements.",

METHODS 80 teeth were prepared for laminate veneer, and divided into eight groups of different CAD-CAM blocks in each group. Each group was restored with the manufacturers' recommended procedures. After cementation of the veneers, all samples were thermocycled (1,000 cycles); the crowns of the teeth were embedded vertically into acrylic blocks and subjected to shear bond strength in a universal tester. Shear bond strength was determined in Newtons (N). RESULTS The tests showed 52.5% cohesive failure, 30% adhesive failure, and 17.5% adhesive-cohesive failure (mixed). Lava Ultimate had the highest bond strength average and the Cerec blocks had the lowest with 82.2N.

METHODS Dentin (N= 64) and enamel blocks (N=64) were randomized into four experimental groups of 16 specimens each for dentin and enamel. CP: Colgate Cavity Protection, served as the low abrasive toothpaste; AW: Colgate Total Advanced Whitening was used to represent a highly abrasive toothpaste. Two different types of toothpaste tablets were used. DT: Denttabs and BT: Bite tabs. To prepare the slurries, 40 mL of water was added to 25 g of each toothpaste and 4.4 g of each toothpaste tab. Blocks were brushed for a total of 10,000 and 40,000 strokes for dentin and enamel, respectively following ISO standard 11609. On completion of brushing, specimens were scanned with a microCT system. Tomographic 3D reconstruction followed by abrasion depths measurements were performed. Kruskal-Wallis procedure tested abrasion depths among the different groups.

In this indication not only color, translucency and opalescence, but also surface gloss is of paramount importance. The purpose of this study was to determine the changes in surface gloss of different composite materials after simulation of mechanical and chemical ageing mechanisms. Thirty six specimens were fabricated for each material and polished with 120-, 220-, 500-, 1200-, 2400- and 4000- grit SiC abrasive paper, respectively. Gloss measurements were made with a glossometer (Novocurve) prior to testing procedures. Specimens of each material were randomly divided into three groups. First group was conditioned for seven days at 37° C in 75% ethanol aqueous solution. Second was immersed in fluoride gel (Elmex gelee® ; ) at 37° C for 1 hour. Third was subjected to simulated toothbrushing with an electrical toothbrush while being immersed in toothpaste. Surface gloss measurements were made subsequently. Surface gloss of all the materials was affected by simulated toothbrushing and the decrease of gloss was material dependent. Following immersion in Elmex gelee® , surfaces of Enamel HFO, Miris 2, CeramX and Clearfill Photo Posterior presented a severe decrease in gloss. There was no significant drop of surface gloss values after 7 days of storage in 75% ethanol. Artificial materials available nowadays try to mimic natural enamels' appearance without reaching a complete success. New developments in nanotechnology, however, let us to imagine that in the future more tooth-like materials could be developed which will present better optical properties and allow enhanced esthetic outcomes.",

Each mouthrinse was used for 1 minute. Bleaching was performed following the same protocol in all groups, with 40% hydrogen peroxide (Opalescence Boost), in three 40-minute sessions, with a 48-hour interval between sessions. Clinical parameters such as sensitivity, gingival irritation and mouthrinse acceptability were assessed using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and clinical examination at two timepoints: baseline (before any treatment) and 48 hours after the end of treatment. The color was evaluated with a spectrophotometer (VITA Classical scale guide, 3D Master guide and CIEL*a*b*). The data were analyzed by generalized linear models and by one-way ANOVA. There was significant color change in all groups according to the VITA Classical scale guide (P< 0.001).

The other groups showed no significant difference between initial and final timepoints (P> 0.05). No symptoms of gingival irritation were observed in any of the groups evaluated. All desensitizing treatments presented high acceptability. Bleaching treatment was effective, regardless of association with desensitizing treatments. No treatment prevented bleaching sensitivity, but the absence of a combined desensitizing treatment led to increased sensitivity. Although bleaching sensitivity during in-office bleaching treatment cannot be avoided, daily fluoridated mouthrinse or calcium lactate used prior to fluoridated mouthrinse prevented its increase.",

METHODS 80 teeth were selected and divided into two groups which were stained with black coffee and red wine respectively. The stained specimens were subdivided into four subgroups to be bleached with Opalescence, LumiBrite, WhiteLight and strawberry extract. Color measurements were made using spectrophotometer at baseline level, after staining, after bleaching and 1 week after bleaching.

Data were analyzed by paired t-test and ANOVA with a significant difference of P< 0.05. RESULTS Paired t-test showed significant differences in ΔE₀₀1 and ΔE₀₀2 for both stained specimens (P< 0.001). For black coffee stained specimens, Whitelight had significantly higher ΔE₀₀2 compared to the other bleaching agents (P< 0.05). For red wine stain, Whitelight also showed the significantly lowest ΔE₀₀1 (P< 0.001) and the highest ΔE₀₀2 (P< 0.001) compared to other groups.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To examine the marginal adaptation in enamel and dentin of mixed Class V saucer shaped restorations where cavities were prepared by two different lasers. METHODS A handpiece-integrated Er:YAG laser @ 4.5 W, 300 mJ, 15 Hz (LiteTouch III) and a novel CO2 laser @ 12.95 W, 19.3 mJ, 671 Hz (Solea 9.3 µm). Diamond bur preparation with a 25 µm diamond bur (Intensiv) in a red contra angle at high speed under water spray cooling served as the control. Eight cavities per group were readied and restored under simulation of dentin fluid with a one bottle universal adhesive (One Coat 7 Universal) and a nanohybrid resin composite (Everglow), applied in two layers. For every preparation technique, the adhesive system was applied in the selective-etch and the self-etch mode, resulting in six experimental groups. Marginal analysis was performed immediately after polishing and after simultaneous thermal (5-50°C, 2 minutes each) and mechanical (max. 49 N; 200,000 cycles) loading by using a SEM (x200 magnification). RESULTS Significant differences were found for all groups - except groups 2 and 5 - between initial and terminal results and between the groups as well (P< 0.05, 2-way ANOVA with Fisher's post-hoc test). The bur prepared group with selective-etch technique showed the best overall results after loading, followed by Er:YAG prepared self-etch group and CO2-prepared selective-etch group. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE By using a universal one-component adhesive system, marginal adaptation in enamel and in dentin depended on the preparation method and on the adhesive's application technique as well. When using lasers, Er:YAG in self-etch mode and CO2 9.3 µm in selective-etch mode total marginal adaptation showed results which were comparable to conventional bur preparation with selective-etch technique.",

Methods A 3D model of a sound maxillary left second premolar and its supporting bone was generated in a previous study and reutilized under permission of the authors for the present study. Inlay models obtained from the sound tooth were then assigned according to the type and inherent elastic modulus of the restorative material used, as follows: microhybrid composite (Filtek Z250); indirect resin composite (Paradigm); lithium disilicate reinforced glass ceramic (IPS e.max Press); and type III gold alloy. The geometric models were then exported for 3D FEA. All materials were considered isotropic, homogeneous, and linear-elastic. A static load of 100 N was applied in two conditions: axially at both cusps (axial loading) and at the mesial marginal ridge (proximal loading). Maximum principal and von Mises stresses were used to analyze the stress distribution pattern in inlays and sound premolar models. Results Under axial loading condition, either resin composite, ceramic or type III gold alloy inlays generated a similar biomechanical behavior, especially in terms of stress distribution in the remaining tooth structure and cusp deflection. However, higher tensile stresses were observed along the proximal gingival margin of the preparation under proximal loading in the Z250 and Paradigm models, as well as a greater cusp deflection. In contrast, a deflection like the sound model was observed in the ceramic and gold inlay models. Clinical significance Restorative materials with higher elastic modulus, such as dental ceramics and type III gold alloys, seem to be the best choice for maxillary premolars restored with inlays in the presence of occlusal contact on the marginal ridge.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To evaluate some biological (Candida albicans biofilm formation and cytotoxicity) and mechanical (roughness and hardness) properties of a hard reline acrylic resin after immersion in liquid disinfectant soaps. METHODS Reline samples were made (14 mm in diameter and 1.2 mm in thickness) and immersed in different disinfectant solutions: DW: distilled water at 37°C (control group); DS: Dettol liquid soap; and LS: Lifebuoy liquid soap. After immersion in the different groups, the properties of C. albicans biofilm formation, cytotoxicity, hardness, and roughness were evaluated. Each sample was immersed in the disinfectant solutions for 8 hours for microbiological testing and for 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days, with daily immersion cycles, for cytotoxicity and mechanical testing. Data were tabulated and analyzed by Shapiro-Wilk and Levene statistical tests. Based on these results, the appropriate tests for finding statistically significant differences were applied (α= 0.05). RESULTS There was a reduction of roughness after immersion of the samples in DS for 21 days (P= 0.0001) and LS for 28 days (P= 0.0218). Hardness values significantly increased after storage of samples in solutions (0.0007≥ P≥ 0.0076), especially considering the longer period of immersion (28 days). The viability and metabolic activity of the biofilm formed on the hard reline samples were significantly reduced (P< 0.05) after soaking in Lifebuoy liquid soap in relation to DW. In addition, the samples immersed in the different solutions were not cytotoxic, as they inhibited less than 25% in relation to the control group (100% of cell viability). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE This study showed that, in general, immersion in liquid disinfectant soaps had no adverse effect on the physical properties of the hard reline acrylic resin evaluated. In addition, Lifebuoy liquid soap reduced the biofilm formed on the samples and the solutions did not affect the cytotoxicity of the material. Disinfectant liquid soaps could be an alternative method for disinfection of relined dentures.",

METHODS Root dentin specimens were subjected to an erosion-remineralization cycling model (6×/day; 5 days) that included 5-minute immersion in 1% citric acid and 60-minute immersion in remineralization solution (RS). At the remineralization half-time, the specimens were treated (n= 20) with EGCg-mint, RS (negative control) or sodium fluoride (1,000 ppm of NaF; positive control). Half of the specimens were kept overnight in RS (pH cycling) and the other half in RS with Clostridium histolyticum collagenase (pH-proteolytic cycling). Erosion depth was measured using optical profilometry and data analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey tests (α= 0.05). RESULTS Under pH-cycling, NaF resulted in statistically lower erosion depth compared to EGCg-mint (P= 0.020) and RS (P= 0.005). Under pH-proteolytic cycling, EGCg-mint and NaF significantly decreased the tissue loss (erosion depth, P< 0.001) compared to the RS. The EGCg-mint exhibited an anti-erosion property on root dentin under a proteolytic challenge. NaF presented an anti-erosion property regardless of the erosive cycling model.

METHODS The CBCT scans of 616 maxillary premolars from 154 subjects were retrospectively evaluated. The premolars were ascribed into low torque group (LTG) -3.9°, when the torque was referring to the occlusion plane. The prevalence of NCCLs in each group was evaluated. Then finite element models of a maxillary first premolar, its adjacent teeth and alveolar bone were established. The models were prepared with ANSYS software generating the premolars presenting different torques. The mastication scenario for the premolars in maximum intercuspation position was simulated. RESULTS The prevalence of NCCLs was 15.7% in LTG, 7.9% in MTG and 5.5% in HTG. The prevalence of LTG was significantly higher than that of MTG (P< 0.05) and HTG (P< 0.01). As for FEA, the stresses at the buccal necks of the premolars basically increased with decrease of the torque. The tensile stress peaks were in the cemento-enamel junction in most premolars of the LTG, while in the middle of the crowns in premolars of MTG and HTG. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Low torque with excessive lingual inclination is a risk factor for NCCLs of maxillary premolars, and excessive tensile stress concentration in buccal necks during mastication may be responsible for that.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To evaluate color and gloss changes of three different resin composites after staining and whitening. METHODS 57 disc-shaped composite samples were made for each of three resin composite materials [Activa BioActive Restorative (Activa), Filtek Supreme (Filtek), and TPH Spectra (TPH)], producing 19 samples per composite (n=19). Each group of resin samples was divided among four solutions: red wine, coffee, tea, and water (control), producing six samples per staining group (n=6) and one control (n=1). Samples were stained for 40 days for 3 hours/day at room temperature. When not undergoing staining/whitening, samples were stored in DI water at 37°C. Measurements were obtained for color and gloss before staining, after staining, and after whitening. Illuminant source specular component excluded (SCE) and included (SCI), with both CIE L*a*b* and CIE 2000 L*C*h* systems, were obtained with colorimetric measurements. The standard ΔE (total color change) = 3.3 was used as a clinically acceptable value. Stained groups were divided into two groups (n= 9 each) for each whitening product: Opalescence Boost and Opalescence PF. Both were applied according to manufacturer's instructions. RESULTS Staining of all samples consistently showed decreased lightness. Filtek showed the most colorimetric changes, especially with wine, while TPH and Activa composites showed few changes; most changes were with tea. Whitening altogether showed generalized increased lightness. All Activa specimens returned to clinically acceptable levels, but the other two materials tested varied. Gloss was most affected for TPH, followed by Filtek; and gloss improved with Activa groups. Overall, Filtek's color varied most, with Activa and TPH being less. All Activa groups returned to clinically acceptable values. However, multiple TPH and Filtek groups had ΔE> 3.3. Furthermore, TPH had the most gloss changes. Activa composites appeared the most stable under the conditions of this study. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Clinicians should be aware that resin composites can undergo staining from a variety of sources. Some resin composites can return to their original esthetic appearance after using bleaching agents. In addition, staining beverages can affect the gloss of the resin composite.",

For SLA manufacturing, 30 small cylinders were shaped with Denture Teeth resin and 30 large cylinders with Denture Base resin. For the mixed technique, 30 large cylinders were manufactured by SLA with V-print dentbase resin, and 30 small cylinders were milled with a CediTEC DT disk. Half the specimens were bonded with liquid Denture Base resin and half with CediTEC Primer and Adhesive, according to the manufacturers' protocols. Shear bond strength was measured using a universal testing machine. The failure mode was noted for all the specimens.The shear bond strength values were not significantly different between the groups (P> 0.05). Specimens bonded with liquid Denture Base resin displayed cohesive failure (P> 0.05, ×²= 0). Of the specimens bonded with CediTEC Primer and Adhesive, cohesive failures were observed with five specimens manufactured with the SLA technique and one specimen manufactured with the mixed technique (P> 0.05, ×²= 3.33). The Chi-square test results were significant between groups with different bonding agents regardless of the technique used (P< 0.001). Within the limitations of the present study, even if the shear bond strength values were similar, the failure mode analysis suggests that the uncured liquid Denture Base resin may be more effective than the CediTEC Primer and Adhesive for bonding denture bases and teeth manufactured either by SLA or the mixed technique.The present study suggests that the uncured liquid resin (Denture Base) used as a bonding agent and the denture base and tooth materials (V-Print and CediTEC DT) manufactured by SLA and the subtractive technique are clinically compatible.",
