It is a comprehensive and indispensable reference to the generic and family names of flowering plants and ferns. The entries attempt to cover all published generic names from 1753 onwards and published family names from 1789, together with a number of supra- and infra-familial taxa where these have not been based on family or generic names. The generic names include many variant spellings and inter-generic hybrids. Brief characters of subfamilies are usually given. The treatment of the families and higher taxa of the Pteridophyta is based on the classification scheme proposed by Pichi-Sermolli. The synopses of the Bentham & Hooker and Engler & Prand systems are retained. This eighth edition is now published in paperback in order to make it available to a wider readership, not only of professional botanists, but also students and serious amateurs.",

    "abstract": "-We present the first cladistic analysis of extant ferns based on morphological characters. Our data set consisted of 77 vegetative and reproductive morphological/anatomical characters recorded on a broad sampling of 50 extant pteridophyte taxa, with representatives of all major fern groups, and one seed plant (Cycas). An annotated list of both retained and excluded morphological characters is presented. Results from the morphological analysis are compared with an independent analysis of rbcL data carried out here for the same set of pteridophyte taxa. Finally, we analyze a combined (morphological and molecular) data set. All three data sets were analyzed using maximum parsimony. N o separate sets of analyses using different taxon combinations were conducted on each of the three data sets. Analysis 1 focused on phylogenetic relationships of ferns only (Filicopsida, Botrychium, and Angiopteris), using Cycas as an outgroup representative from the seed plants. Analysis 2 focused on phylogenetic relationships of pteridophytes (Filicopsida, Angiopteris, Botrychium, Equisetum, Psilotum), using Lycopodium as the outgroup. In both sets of analyses, the combined data set provided the most robustly supported hypothesis of relationships. Results from the combined data set in Analysis 1 provided strong bootstrap support for the monophyly of the following clades: leptosporangiate ferns (with Osmunda as the most basal leptosporangiate fern], heterosporous ferns, Cheiropleuria-Dipteris, Diplopterygium-Stromafopteris, tree ferns, schizaeoid ferns, pteridoid ferns, and a large clade consisting of a derived group of leptosporangiate ferns that excludes dennstaedtioids and pteridoids. Various smaller clades within some of these larger clades also have strong support. The dennstaedtioid ferns are paraphyletic. We use the results of the combined data set in Analysis 1to examine character evolution within the leptosporangiate ferns. Results from the combined data set in Analysis 2 indicated robust support for essentially the same fern clades as the combined data set in Analysis 1.In both Analyses 1 and 2, bootstrap support for the leptosporangiate fern clade is much greater using the combined data set than when either the morphological or, particularly, the molecular data set is analyzed separately. Relationships among major groups of pteridophytes at the base of the tree (Botrychium, Angiopteris, Psilotum, Equisetum, Lycopodium) were poorly supported by the combined data in Analysis 2, except for a weak association between Botrychium and Psilotum. We are convinced from this study of the value of using both molecular and morphological data sets in combination as well as separately. A synthetic approach that integrates paleobotanical and neobotanical data will be of greatest interest in further elucidating the phylogenetic relationships of pteridophytes. Our understanding of the phylogeny of pteridophytes has lagged behind the considerable progress made recently in clarifying the phylogenetic relationships of other green plants, especially seed plants (Crane, 1985a, 1985b; Doyle Present address: Department of Botany, Field Museum of Natural History, Roosevelt Rd. at Lakeshore Dr., Chicago, IL 60605. 206 AMERICAN FERN JOURNAL: VOLUME 85 NUMBER 4 (1995) and Donoghue, 1986a, 1986b, 1992; Doyle et al., 1994; Loconte and Stevenson, 1990, 1991; Nixon et al., 1994; Rothwell and Serbet, 1994). Often-cited reasons for this discrepancy are that ferns have, relatively speaking, far fewer morphological characters, and that determining homologous character states, particularly when dealing with organisms with such a long geological record, is not feasible. These arguments have become less persuasive since the publication of a number of comprehensive studies on bryophytes and green algae and their relationships to tracheophytes (Garbary et al., 1993; Graham et al., 1991; Mishler and Churchill, 1984, 1985; Mishler et al., 1994). An overview of extant tracheophyte relationships based on recent analyses of green plant phylogeny is shown in Figure 1, indicating major clades that are resolved and areas of greatest uncertainty (unresolved polychotomies). Although numerous phylogenetic studies have been devoted to the seed plants (spermatophytes), higher-level relationships among some of the major extant lines (cycads, Ginkgo, conifers, gnetales, angiosperms) still are not resolved convincingly (Doyle et al., 1994). For example, the position of the cycads as the most basal group in the spermatophytes is supported by Crane (1985b), Loconte and Stevenson (1990), and Nixon et al. (1994), whereas Ginkgo is the most basal spermatophyte in the analysis by Rothwell and Serbet (1994). Other authors have obtained still different arrangements. Within tracheophytes, relationships among pteridophytes are the least understood (Kenrick and Crane, 1991; Nayar, 1970; Rothwell, 1994). The major clades of extant pteridophytes are: lycopodiophytes (Lycopodiaceae, Selaginellaceae, Isoetaceae); psilotophytes (Psilotum, Tmesipteris); equisetophytes (Equisetum); and ferns (Fig. 1).Ferns comprise three classes: the Ophioglossopsida and Marattiopsida (eusporangiate ferns), and the Filicopsida (leptosporangiate ferns). It has been hypothesized that the psilotophytes are the most basal lineage of extant pteridophytes, and indeed of all extant tracheophytes (Bremer, 1985; Bremer et al., 1987; Parenti, 1980; Pichi Sermolli, 1959). However, more recent evidence supports the placement of the lycopodiophytes at the base of the extant tracheophyte clade (DiMichele and Skog, 1992; Donoghue, 1994; Kenrick and Crane, 1991; Raubeson and Jansen, 1992). Contemporary estimates of higher-level relationships in ferns are mostly intuitive and founded largely on the phenetic concept of overall similarity of morphological/anatomical characters. These characters most often include the sorus and its associated structures (sporangia, indusia, spores), leaf architecture and venation, rhizomes, stipes, and chromosome numbers. In 1969, Wagner attempted a more objective approach to resolving fern phylogeny by applying his ground plantdivergence to homosporous ferns. This method consisted of first inferring the primitive and advanced states of various characters based on the assumption that the commonest character state is usually also that which is primitive. How these states were correlated was then determined so as to organize the taxa graphically in an evolutionary pattern (Wagner, 1969, 1980). A slightly modified version of Wagner's scheme of evolutionary relationships is still presented in morphology and evolution textbooks (e.g., Gifford and Foster, 1988).

    "abstract": "Population biology of pteridophytes has attracted considerable attention over the last 20 years as documented in successive reviews by Klekowski (1969), Lloyd (1974b), Klekowski (1979), Page (1979), Haufler (1987), Klekowski (1988), and Cousens (1988). Yet much remains unknown, particularly with respect to species' specific differences in reproduction and the reflection of these differences in species' demographic and distribution patterns. Homosporous pteridophytes as a group are often considered to be equivalent to one another in their ability to disperse and migrate (Tryon, 1970, 1972, 1986) and superior to seed plants with regard to species' dispersability (Smith, 1972; Tryon, 1986). These views are based primarily upon the presumed ease of dispersal of pteridophyte spores in comparison with seeds and a potential of homosporous ferns to reproduce by single spores capable of producing self-fertile bisexual gametophytes. Indeed, some species have these capabilities; examples of longrange and recent disjunctions and of wide-ranging species are readily found among homosporous pteridophytes (Wagner, 1972; Tryon, 1970, 1972, 1986; Smith, 1972). However, to extrapolate from these species to generalizations encompassing all homosporous pteridophytes obscures significant differences among species imposed by differences in fecundity, habitat requirements, mating systems, and gametophyte ecology (Klekowski, 1969, 1972, 1979, 1988; Lloyd, 1974a, 1974b; Cousens, 1979, 1981; Cousens et al., 1985; Cousens et al., 1988; Schneller, 1975, 1979; Grime, 1985; Farrar, 1976; Farrar & Gooch, 1975; Crist & Farrar, 1983; J. Peck, 1980; C. Peck, 1985). Species-specific characteristics in combination with local habitat characteristics, in fact, determine geographic ranges of fern species that are generally comparable to those of seed plants (Wagner, 1972) and bryophytes (Anderson, 1971; Crum, 1972). In an attempt to elucidate factors differentiating species' abilities to disperse via gametophyte reproduction, we have conducted complementary field and laboratory studies on a number of co-occurring fern species in Central Iowa. For purposes of comparison, we have divided fern life history into a series of successive stages and processes (Table 1), each of which contributes in serial fashion to the species' overall reproductive potential. Most of our work has been conducted at a state preserve where sixteen pteridophyte species are",

    "abstract": "The water-ferns, represented by Salvinia and Azolla, are among the most curious of plants, and would not ordinarily be taken to be related to the ferns. Salvinia plants consist of a shoot up to one or two inches long, with clusters of round floating leaves rarely as much as a centimeter in diameter. Azolla likewise is a floating plant, chiefly of the tropics; the entire surface of quiet ponds may be so covered by the tiny branching fronds as to exclude mosquitoes from the surface, and for this reason the plant is sometimes known as mosquito-fern (cf. Benedict, AMER. FERN JOURN. 13: 48. 1923). These little floating plants send rootlets down into the water much in the manner of the duckweed (Lemna); their small size, branching habit, and the almost crystalline appearance of the tiny individual leaves may be judged from the accompanying drawings of living, non-fruiting plants from the greenhouses and out-door pools of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden (Pt. 6, fig. 1). The succulent leaves, in the center of which blue-green algae always live, gleam under the lens like leaves of Mesembrianthemum. In full sunlight the fronds often become reddish, but those in shaded localities remain bright green. The branches of Azolla show a dorsiventral structure suggesting that of Selaginella.

    "abstract": "Size of equivalent cells has traditionally been assumed to be constant within species and variable between species. Systematists have commonly measured cells with constant form, such as spores and stomates, as a means of distinguishing species and hybrids in polyploid complexes, since the best known factor determining cell size is ploidy level (Stebbins, 1950). Preliminary hypotheses about polyploid evolution can be generated directly from herbarium specimens based on spore and stomate measurement data. The first evidence of a relation between cell size and polyploidy in the ferns was Lawton's 1932 demonstration that prothallial cells, lower epidermal cells, and stomates in induced apogamous races of Dryopteris marginalis and Woodwardia virginica vary directly with ploidy level. Butters and Tryon's 1948 work on Woodsia x abbeae included epidermal cell and annulus cell measurements that corroborated data from spore germination experiments to document an instance of somatic autopolyploidization. More recently a considerable body of evidence has been assembled supporting the contention that spore size is related to ploidy level in the ferns. Manton (1950) noted that Vancouver Island Cystopteris fragilis (n = 84) has smaller spores than Swiss Cystopteris alpina (n = 126). Hagenah (1961) postulated a polyploid series in species of Cystopteris based on spore-size measurements. In a monograph of Cystopteris, Blasdell (1963) concluded that it was possible to infer ploidy level from spore size in that genus. Blasdell assigned ploidy levels to cytologically unknown components of polyploid complexes based only on spore size (see Lovis, 1977 for a critique). Wagner (1966) demonstrated that there were two varieties of Gymnocarpium dryopteris: a larger-spored typical variety, which is tetraploid, and a smaller-spored variety disjunctum, which is diploid. Schneller (1974) recently provided an analysis of ploidy level and spore size in the Dryopteris filix-mas group of Europe. He concluded that ploidy and spore size are positively correlated for diploid to pentaploid cytotypes in a closely knit phylogenetic group. In an exhaustive analysis of spore features of northeastern North American Isoetes, Kott and Britton (1983) provided new insight into spore-size variability. Whereas megaspore variation within sporangia of a single plant, between sporangia of a single plant, and between plants of a population was found to be more or less equivalent and negligible, variation between populations of a species was demonstrated to be twice that between plants of a population. Microspores were found to be slightly less variable. Kott and Britton (1983) suggested that",

This fern has become an aggressive invader of natural vegetation in many different habitats that are frequently dominated by the weed. Aerial surveys conducted in 1993, 1995, and 1997 detected increasing densities and continued expansion of its distribution in Florida. The fern is expected to continue to increase in Florida and could spread by spores to suitable habitats in Texas and Mexico. No effective method of control for the plant exists. Lygodium microphyllum (Cav.) R. Br. (Schizaeaceae), or Old World climbing fern, is native to wet tropical and subtropical regions of the Old World. It has become a serious weed in southeastern Florida, where it is increasing in density and range. In the present paper we discuss the ecological problems associated with the fern and its naturalization and spread, probable origin, and potential to spread, and the control attempts to date. The companion paper (Pemberton, 1998) discusses the potential of biological control to reduce populations of this plant and to limit its spread. The fern's native distribution and taxonomic relations, both essential information for a biological control program, are also reported.",

Representatives of the Calamophyta, to which Equisetum belongs, were important and characteristic plants of the Carboniferous period and fossils have also been found in the Devonian. Besides what were undoubtedly true Equisetales, directly related to our modern plants, the Sphenophyllales and Calamariales flourished in the Carboniferous and extended somewhat beyond this period. The Sphenophyllales were apparently a more primitive group than the Equisetales, while the Calamariales represented a more advanced group which had not only attained the heterosporous condition but also a very efficient physiological reaction system, giving rise to trees over a foot in diameter and often over 60 ft. high. In thinking of the most primitive vascular forms we must think of small, slow-growing sporophytes in which there was no sex expression and in which the functional system was still very inefficient as compared with what evolved later in the great trees of all the higher phyla.",

The family comprises two primary lineages, one phegopteroid, the other thelypteroid (including cyclosoroid). The phegopteroid lineage (Macrothelypteris, Pseudophegopteris, and Phegopteris) includes those elements that are the most dissected, lack adaxial grooves on the frond axes, and are generally morphologically the most distinct elements within the family. Within the thelypteroid-cyclosoroid lineage, three predominantly north-temperate subgroups, including Thelypteris s.s., form a free-veined clade that is in turn sister to the rest of the family. All segregates possessing x=36 (Cyclosorus sensu Smith, with predominantly anastomosing veins) form a strongly supported clade. Those groups with dysploid base chromosome numbers (x=27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35) form a series of smaller clades basal to Cyclosorus s.l. Although our sampling is not yet sufficient to favor one classification over another, recognition of an intermediate number of genera may be the most reasonable taxonomic course.",

The best known fossil members of this group are the arborescent lepidodendrids that dominated the Late Carboniferous coal swamps. Simpler unbranched isoetaleans with elongate stems also predated, coexisted with, and postdated the coal swamp trees, extending well into the Mesozoic. Whereas certain synapomorphies such as stigmarian rootlets, bipolar growth and secondary tissues unite the clade, other features characterize smaller subgroups of differing age, growth form and possibly, evolutionary lineage. Although some of these features are well known for plants of given time periods, particularly the Carboniferous, trends in character evolution have never been adequately documented for the group as a whole. A better understanding of such trends throughout the isoetalean fossil record could be valuable in distinguishing evolutionary lineages from convergence. It is interesting that several morphological characters of modern Isoetes are present as early as the Triassic: monolete microspores, sunken sporangia and elaborate ligules with glossopodia occur within elongate-stemmed Triassic forms. The dominant plant habit of modern Isoetes, a reduced cormose form that lacks appreciable stem elongation, originated at least by the Jurassic and typifies late Mesozoic and Cenozoic isoetaleans.",

    "abstract": "The genus Elaphoglossum is one of the largest and most complex of fern genera.It is composed of perhaps 600 species, which frequently are difficult to distinguish.The genus has not been afforded careful study in the past.As a result, some names have been misapplied and others not used at all, and sometimes new names have been made for old species.Consequently, much herbarium material is either misidentified or unidentified.\"Elaphoglossum is more in need of a taxonomical revision than other fern genera, all the more so as many species are imperfectly known or badly delimited in comparison with their allies.\"(Pichi Sermolli, 1968).Elaphoglossum is a remarkably uniform genus of mostly simple-bladed ferns with acrostichoid sori.The veins are free (with two exceptions), the rhizomes scaly, and the blades densely scaly to nearly glabrous.The taxonomy of the genus is based to some extent on frond form and rhizome habit, but more importantly on the scales of the rhizome and blade.Until now there has not been a useful treatment that conveniently breaks the large number of species into smaller, more coherent units.Modern keys have been made for a few areas, such as tropical Africa (Schelpe, 1969), Brazil (Alston, 1956a), Guatemala (Mickel, 1980b), Malaysia (Holttum, 1978), and India (Sledge, 1967), but these do not provide insight into treatment of the genus as a whole.The purpose of this paper is to take the first step in revising the genus by breaking it into infrageneric units that subsequently can be monographed.Even so, this treatment is provisional because a complete understanding of the genus can be had only after the species are better known.HISTORY OF THE GENUS Linnaeus (1753) described Elaphoglossum crinitum under Acrostichum, which included all ferns with sporangia covering the dorsal blade surface.Schott (1834) first proposed the name Elaphoglossum, but it was not formally described until later by John Smith (1841, p. 148), and was not widely accepted until the end of the The first broad treatment of the genus was prepared by Fee (1845) under Acrostichum.He divided the elaphoglossoids into two groups, Oligolepideae and Polylepideae.These in turn were subdivided on the basis of frond size and scale characters.Later, Fee (1852) used four primary groups without further subdivision:Oligolepideae, Polylepideae, Pilosellae, and Chromatolepideae.Moore (1857-1862) was the first to use the genus name Elaphoglossum extensively; he made many new combinations under it.He utilized a generic breakdown of Oligolepidum (\"fronds naked, or with but few scales\") and Polylepidum (\"fronds clothed with numerous scales\").Sodiro (1897, under Acrostichum) used more group names (Glabra, Setosa, Oligotrichia, Polytrichia, Squamosa,",

By most students of ferns, the prothallia have been thought of as very delicate structures readily succumbing to drought, extremes of temperatures and other unsatisfactory conditions. Before 1912 very little work indeed had been done on the ability of fern prothallia to survive periods of water shortage or actual desiccation. Before that time some German students had published papers dealing with the ability of certain mosses to live through long periods with a reduced water supply. Papers had also been published describing the ability of certain moss and fern spores to live through periods of several years in normally dry atmosphere. It was also well known that seeds and some other structures of higher plants could revive and continue growth and other activities after several years of dry storage. It is true that Goebel had described before the above date",

    "abstract": "Despite its ancient origins, its worldwide distribution, and adaptation to diverse habitats, Isoëtes has a highly conserved morphology. This feature has made it difficult to resolve species and species relationships using morphological characters. In this paper, we report the utility of nucleotide sequences from the nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, chloroplast atpB/rbcL intergenic spacer region, and second intron of a LEAFY (LFY) homolog for identifying species relationships, delimiting basic diploid species, and determining hybrid origins. Variation in the ITS regions and atpB/rbcL spacer is most useful at the family level in Isoëtes and the LFY second intron is appropriate at the species and population level. The tree resulting from an analysis of the combined nuclear ITS and chloroplast atpB/rbcL spacer contains three major well supported clades (bootstrap ≥ 99%): an Old-World/California clade (I. abyssinica, I. longissima, I. velata, I. nuttallii, and I. orcuttii), an Asian/Australian clade (I. taiwanensis, I. japonica, I. kirkii, and I. drummondii), and a poorly resolved clade consisting of nine North American species. To further resolve and delimit the North American species, a combination of the LEAFY second intron and ITS data was used. The resulting consensus tree has limited resolution, supporting the hypothesis that the North American species complex radiated rapidly. The combination of LFY and ITS data provided numerous characters, both substitutions and indels, that are useful in species delimitation and identification of cryptic species. ITS sequence data, through additive banding and sequence misalignment, is also useful in confirming interspecific hybrids and determining their parental origins.",

Xkenzoi showed that it is a hybrid between A. antiquum and A. prolongatum, whose close relationship was first suggested by our r6cL tree.Thus, A. xkenzoi appears to to be a hybrid between two closely related species with very different morphologies.",

    "abstract": "could control the sex expression of fern gametophytes was made in the laboratory. In 1950, Dopp published a paper in which he showed that old media or aquatic extractions from media containing female gametophytes of bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) induced antheridia formation in young gametophytes of its own species or those of the male fern (Dryopteris filix-mas). This pioneer work was supplemented by two further publications in 1959 and 1962. In the United States, it was mainly Naf (for review see Nif, 1979) who started studies on antheridiogen in the late 1950's. Some of the most interesting questions that arose were: Does a selected fern taxon produce or react to antheridiogen? Are antheridiogen-systems widely distributed? What is the sex expression of isolated gametophytes? How much antheridiogen is required to induce antheridia? What happens to a culture of young sterile gametophytes when antheridiogen of a female or a meristic gametophyte is added? Do meristic gametophytes become insensitive to antheridiogen? Since D6pp's initial work, a large number of publications have appeared. Nearly all of these have been based on laboratory investigations and our knowledge of antheridiogen has increased strikingly. It has been shown that at least three main classes of antheridiogens occur (Nif, 1979), antheridiogen A (bracken-antheridiogen), antheridiogen B (produced by members of the family Schizaeaceae) and antheridiogen C (produced by species of the genus Ceratopteris). Although the chemistry of only antheridiogen B has been studied in detail (Corey & Myers, 1985; Nakanishi et al., 1971; Yamane et al., 1979) many similarities among the various types of antheridiogens can be seen from the standpoint of physiology. Antheridiogens are all water soluble, are active in very low concentrations, and are formed by large, meristic gametophytes. At present, the term pheromone is preferred over the term hormone when speaking of antheridiogens (Nif, 1979). Although much has been accomplished, many questions may still be pursued through laboratory experiments. In contrast to the multitude of laboratory-oriented studies, only a few publications have focused on the occurrence and importance of antheridiogen in natural fern populations. The first publication giving evidence for the natural role of antheridiogen was that of Tryon & Vitale (1977). By mapping gametophytes on natural sites Tryon & Vitale (1977) could show that there was",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary potential of a species depends in part on the levels of genetic variation maintained within the species and also on the distribution of that variation both within and among its populations. Analyses of electrophoretic data for seed plants have resulted in several generalizations regarding levels and distribution of genetic variation: (1) High levels of genetic variation are maintained in populations of species with outcrossing mating systems, wide (regional) geographic distributions, habitats of late successional stages, and wind-pollination (Hamrick et al., 1979), (2) Inbreeding populations often exhibit genetic structure (i.e. a nonrandom distribution of genotypes in space), whereas genotypes are typically randomly distributed in highly outcrossing populations (Loveless & Hamrick, 1984), and (3) Outcrossing species maintain genetic variation within single populations, whereas inbreeding species distribute relatively more of their genetic variation among rather than within populations (Brown, 1979). Because ferns differ from seed plants in several life-history characteristics, especially in their life cycle and potential for large amounts of interpopulational gene flow via spore dispersal, it is unclear whether species of ferns follow these generalizations. Therefore, we address the following topics in homosporous ferns: (1) levels of genetic variation within populations of ferns, (2) the genetic structure of populations of ferns, and (3) the genetic structure of species of ferns. For all three topics we review the patterns of genetic variation that have been observed in ferns and then discuss factors that may contribute to these patterns. Electrophoretic data from the literature will be used to provide estimates of genetic variation. Data from the literature will be supplemented by our published and previously unpublished data for North American species of Polystichum. LEVELS OF GENETIC VARIATION WITHIN POPULATIONS OF FERNS Typical measures used to quantify the amount of genetic variation present in natural populations are P, the proportion of loci that are polymorphic in the population, A, the mean number of alleles per locus in a population, H, mean heterozygosity in a population (that is, heterozygosity expected at HardyWeinberg equilibrium), and Hobs, observed heterozygosity in the population. Measures of genetic variation for most of the diploid fern species that have been analyzed are presented in Table 1. Mean values for each measure of genetic variation cover a broad range. P ranges from 0.067 in Polystichum lonchitis to 0.635 in Pellaea andromedifolia. A ranges from 1.08 in P. lonchitis to 2.62 in Bommeria hispida. Hobs ranges from 1.08 in P. lonchitis to 0.221 in P. andromedifolia.",

Such deposits also occur in Cheilanthes Swartz and Notholaena R. Br., although they are less known because species these genera are not easily cultivated in greenhouses. The culture the decorative species Pityrogramma was especially in fashion at the beginning the 19th century. Both P. calomelanos (L.)

Fanciers were attracted by the great variability species and strains and by the formation various forms and hybrids that occurred during the culture of Gymnogramma. However, the proliferation hybrids and horticultural forms led to serious taxonomic confusion. Domin's (1929) statement is still valid: one can easily find completely different species or hybrids grown in greenhouses under the same name.

    "abstract": "It is practically axiomatic that interspecific and intergeneric in ferns are, with rare exceptions, sterile. The situation found by Trevor Walker (1958) in certain of Pteris remains our only example of interspecific hybridization that yields fertile progeny directly. Because sterility is otherwise so nearly universal among fern hybrids, it seems desirable to describe some of the signposts of this condition. What is meant by sterile requires explanation, because there have been some misunderstandings. The mere absence of sori, for example, is not necessarily diagnostic for hybridity. So far as has been determined, fern have just as many sori as do normal species. Species as well as both tend to lack sori when growing, under conditions unusual for the plants involved, such as exceptionally deep shade and especially wet, rich substratum. The point is that production of sori and of sporangia per se are not inhibited in interspecific crosses, so that a hybrid plant which is unable to reproduce itself may nevertheless be abundantly soriferous. A more serious problem, as will be exemplified by alleged hybrids described and figured by Crane (1953) and Tryon (1942) to be discussed below, involves misinterpretation of the criteria for the detection of hybrids. We hope, therefore, that the following notes and illustrations will prove useful to those who are engaged in clarifying the variations and taxonomy of American woodferns, Dryopteris.",

Phylogenetic analyses of these chloroplast sequence data indicate that the Asplenium species of New Zealand are not monophyletic. More specifically, the Asplenium species participating in hybridization in New Zealand form a closely related ‘Austral’ group, whereas the non-hybridizing species have closer affinities to species from outside New Zealand. Within the Austral group, three well-supported sub-groups are recognized, represented by the species A. bulbiferum, A. flaccidum, and A. obtusatum. Dating analyses reject an 80 million year old vicariant origin for any of the Asplenium lineages in New Zealand, and the distributions of the many Asplenium species disjunct between New Zealand and elsewhere appear best explained by long-distance dispersal.

    "abstract": "Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) has been applied successfully to solve systematic problems in various groups of angiosperms (reviewed in Palmer, 1987, 1988). It is now widely accepted that this method can provide more definite evidence of systematic relationships than can morphological, cytological, or chemical (secondary plant products) analyses. Two major approaches are used to detect cpDNA RFLPs. One is that of preparing purified cpDNA (Palmer & Zamir, 1982; Ogihara & Tsunewaki, 1982; Palmer et al., 1983), and the other is that of preparing total cellular DNA, in which cpDNA RFLPs are detected by means of heterologous cpDNA probes (Sytsma & Schaal, 1985; Sytsma & Gottlieb, 1986a,b; Jansen & Palmer, 1988). Since, in pteridophyte molecular systematics, we usually use field-collected living materials and often have to extract DNA from small quantities of leaf tissue, the second method is the more suitable. In contrast to the wide use of cpDNA analysis for angiosperm systematics, for pteridophyte cpDNA systematic studies only two groups, Osmunda (Stein et al., 1986) and some polystichoid ferns (Yatskievych et al., 1988; Stein et al., 1989; Soltis et al., 1990), have been analyzed. These pioneering studies have clearly demonstrated the usefulness of cpDNA analysis in pteridophyte systematics. One problem encountered when applying RFLP analysis of cpDNA to pteridophyte systematics is that currently available angiosperm heterologous cpDNA probes hybridize to fern cpDNA only weakly, even in low-stringency conditions, and give only slight signals. Improvement of probe DNA is thus desirable to ensure stronger signals. This will be possible by preparing better-matched probes from fern cpDNAs, since the maximum rate of hybridization at the optimal temperature is expected to increase as the homology between probe and sample DNAs increases (Bonner et al., 1973; Anderson & Young, 1985). In this paper, we report application of our newly prepared Adiantum capillus-veneris cpDNA clone bank (Hasebe & Iwatsuki, 1990) to pteridophyte systematics. This is the first nearly complete clone bank from a pteridophyte that has been characterized by both physical and gene maps.",

    "abstract": "There are few studies of growth rates of tropical trees. Moreover, the growth of tree ferns in their native habitats has seldom, if ever, been studied because of their slow growth and the need to make observations over a long period of time. As a Peace Corps volunteer in El Salvador I had the chance to study the growth of the cloud forest tree fern Alsophila salvinii Hooker (Cyatheaceae). Bosque Montecristo is a cloud forest that covers about 15 km2 and is located at the common borders of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Approximately 60 percent of the forest is in El Salvador and has been set aside as a national park and wildlife preserve. The highest point in the forest, the summit of Cerro Montecristo, has an altitude of 2414 meters. Bosque Montecristo receives an average of 2250 mm of rain annually. Fog drip during the night deposits about the same amount of water on the forest (Reyna, 1979). March and April are the driest months. The rainy season begins in mid-May or early June and continues until December. Bosque Montecristo is a subtropical, lower montane, very humid forest according to the Holdridge life zone classification (Holdridge, 1975). The cloud forest proper begins at ca. 2100 m and extends to ca. 2350 m, where it is replaced by an ericaceous shrub association on the mountain summits. The ecotone between the cloud forest and the pine-cypress association below occurs between 1900 and 2100 meters. Secondary forest is found in the whole zone wherever there has been logging (Reyna, 1979). The majority of the trees in the cloud forest are evergreen. The emergent trees in the forest canopy are principally oaks, which are thickly covered with epiphytes (Reyna, 1979). Tree trunks near the forest floor support lush growths of mosses, filmy ferns, and many other ferns such as Asplenium, Grammitis, and Elaphoglossum. Reyna (1979) reports 175 species of trees in the Montecristo area and 71 species from the cloud forest proper. In the area where the present study was undertaken three tree ferns are common: Dicksonia gigantea Karst., Trichopteris schiedeana (Presl) Tryon, and Alsophila salvinii Hooker. Alsophila salvinii is a cloud forest tree fern known from southern Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador (Stolze, 1976). It is one of the most conspicuous ferns in Bosque Montecristo and is the most common tree fern. In very wet parts of the forest, A. salvinii forms large, dense thickets, often in areas where a large tree or branch has fallen. The thicket shown in Fig. I is brightly lit during the morning from holes in the forest canopy. The thicket appears to be perpetuating itself, as there are hundreds of very young tree ferns present with trunks as yet undeveloped. Fronds of these are only about 30 cm long, whereas fronds of adults are about 2.5 m long. Alsophila salvinii is also found in relatively dry, open secondary forest at ca. 2050 meters in Bosque Montecristo. The ferns in the secondary forest don't form dense",

    "abstract": "Tree ferns are often regarded as evergreen, non-seasonal, slow-growing plants of tropical forests. However, several species possess seasonal leaf phenology patterns and seasonal differences in growth rates. To investigate the environmental triggers which influence leaf phenology and to measure trunk growth rates, we studied a population of Alsophila firma at Las Cañadas, Huatusco, State of Veracruz, Mexico. We measured leaf traits monthly for 26 mo and trunk height at the beginning and end of the study. Alsophila firma showed a unique seasonal pattern of leaf phenology, shedding its leaf pinnules when they are yellow or still green during the wet season, and 50–70% of plants stay leafless for at least 1 mo, after which strongly asynchronous leaf flush occurs. This phenological pattern may be of advantage to evade higher herbivore pressure of the wet season and to benefit from higher light levels in the understory during the dry season when a proportion of canopy trees are leafless. The trunks had a mean height of 2.46 ± 0.16 m, a mean leaf number of 5.2 ± 0.27 (n = 169), and 25% of the plants were fertile. Mean annual trunk growth was 17.1 ± 0.85 cm. Based on this trunk growth rate, the tallest tree ferns (>10 m) are at least 60 yr old.",

    "abstract": "Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is known to occur in many succulent plant species (Ranson & Thomas 1960; Ting et al., 1972; Wolf, 1960). To date, more than 184 plant species have been reported to exhibit CAM features, but none of them are ferns (Szarek, pers. comm.). Recently we reported nocturnal assimilation of C02 by Drymoglossum piloselloides (L.) Presl, an epiphytic fern (Hew & Wong, 1974). This paper presents further evidence to support our previous findings that certain epiphytic ferns do exhibit characteristics of CAM plants. Two epiphytic ferns, Pyrrosia longifolia (Burm.) Morton and Drymoglossum piloselloides, were chosen for the present investigation. These ferns are found frequently on the lower part of Acacia tree trunks. Gleichenia linearis (Burm.) Clarke, a terrestial sun fern which has been shown to be a C3 plant (Hew & Wong, 1974), also was included in the study. All three ferns grow wild around the Nanyang University campus. For comparison purposes, the flowering plant Kalanchoe pinnata, a known CAM plant, was also used as experimental material. For 14C02 fixation studies and determination of titratable acidity, detached leaves or fronds were used; the method for 14C02 fixation has been described previously (Wong & Hew, 1973). Titratable acidity of plant tissues was determined as described by Szarek and Ting (1974), except the leaf or frond extract was titrated to a pH7 end point. Diffusive resistance of intact fronds or leaves were measured at three hour intervals using an Li-60 Diffusive Resistance Meter (LiCor Limited). Titratable Acidity.-The diurnal changes in titratable acidity of Drymoglossum, Pyrrosia, and Kalanchoe were similar (Figs. 1 -3). Titratable acidity decreased in the light, and at night the acidity increased. The magnitude of dark acidification in these three species was comparable to that previously reported (Bruinsma, 1958; McWilliams, 1970; Szarek & Ting, 1974). Among the three species, titratable acidity was highest in Kalanchoe, both in light and darkness. There was no significant difference in titratable acidity between the two ferns. In contrast, Gleichenia (Fig. 4), which is a C3 plant, shows no diurnal fluctuation in titratable acidity. Diffusive Resistance.-Changes in diffusive resistance patterns of intact Pyrrosia fronds (Fig. 5) and Kalanchoe leaves (Fig. 6) in the day and at night were similar, with high diffusive resistance in the day and low at night. The values for minimum diffusive resistance (5-15 secocm-1 ) and maximum diffusive resistance (100-120 sec*cm ) also were in agreement with that of other succulent plants (Szarek & Ting, 1974; Ting et al., 1972). From the changes in patterns, one could conclude that Pyrrosia and Drymoglossum stomata were closed in the day and open at night (Nishida, 1963; Ting et al., 1972). A point worth noting is that with the onset of darkness, an increase in diffusive resistance in both Pyrrosia and",

    "abstract": "dominant weed is well recognized in many vegetation types throughout the world (see Braid, 1959, for a review). It has been demonstrated that this dominance is a consequence of the fern's rapid extension of underground stems and abundant vegetative reproduction (Watt, 1943, 1947), its strong allelopathic potential (Gliessman & Muller, 1972), and its resistance to fire (Vogl, 1964). Very little attention has been directed to spore germination, gametophyte formation, and sporeling establishment in relation to the dominance of Bracken. Bracken is capable of producing large numbers of spores on each frond, and the time of spore release can extend through much of the growing season (Conway, 1957). In temperate regions, however, most spore dispersal takes place during the drier part of the year or just before the winter begins, times of the year that do not particularly favor sporeling establishment. This would explain, at least in part, reports of the small number of Bracken sporelings which become established under natural field conditions (Conway, 1953). In the tropics, where conditions of temperature and humidity are much more equable, such climatic control of spore germination and early growth presumably is less important. I have observed continual growth of new Bracken fronds throughout the year in several locations in Costa Rica (Gliessman, 1976). It is possible, then, that spore release is not restricted to a certain period, as it is in temperate regions (Conway, 1957), but may be much more haphazard over the entire year. Thus, a constant source of spores could be available for any potentially habitable area. Observations were made in the field in Costa Rica to determine the conditions under which Bracken sporelings become established, which has possible implications for Bracken control. In Costa Rica, Bracken is encountered frequently from just above sea level on well-drained soils up to more than 3000 m elevation. As in other areas of the tropics (Richards, 1966, pp. 391-399), Bracken most often forms a type of deflected succession in regions formerly covered with dense, tropical forest. These are areas that have an annual rainfall in excess of 2500 mm, the majority of which is concentrated in the wet season that extends from mid-May to late December. Due to frequent cloud cover (especially at higher elevations) and the occurrence of sporadic rainfall even in the dry season, humidity at the soil level is quite favorable for sporeling establishment all year around. The pattern of land use in this part of the tropics appears to lend itself quite well to the establishment of Bracken. Most forest clearing, using the well known system of and burn, takes place towards the end of the wet season (December) until late in the dry season (late April). The felled material is allowed to dry as much as possible. Before the more frequent rainfall begins in early May, the slash is burned. As a consequence, when the wet season rains begin in earnest,",

    "abstract": "There are at least 500 species of ferns in Malaysia and Singapore, and these plants form a conspicuous part of the local flora. The reason for their abundance lies in the particularly favorable climate of this part of the world. Holttum (1954) has divided the ferns of Malaysia and Singapore into various classes according to the conditions under which they grow: terrestrial sun ferns, terrestrial shade ferns, epiphytes of sheltered places, epiphytes of exposed places, rock and riverbank ferns, aquatic ferns, and mountain ferns. The fact that ferns grow in a great diversity of habitats makes them very interesting plants for physiological and ecological studies. Interest in the physiological studies of ferns has been centered mainly in the growth and development of fern gametophytes (Allsopp & Rao, 1969; Bloom & Nicols, 1972; Miller & Miller, 1961; Raghavan, 1965; Sobota & Partanen, 1966), spore germination (Raghavan, 1971), and the changes accompanying the conversion of aquatic to land forms of Marsilea (Allsopp, 1955; Gaudet, 1963, 1965). More recently, the role of light in the interrelated processes of morphogenesis and photosynthesis of fern gametophytes has also been investigated (Donaher & Partanen, 1971). However, very little work has been done on photosynthesis and respiration of fern fronds, particularly in relation to their adaptations to different habitats.",

    "abstract": "Ferns form a part of vegetable consumption in many communities across the globe. Their popularity is rising because of their high nutritional content such as vitamin C, protein, and iron. Given that the nutritive value of different wild edible ferns has not been explored comprehensively, the present study was carried out. Six different species of wild edible ferns viz. Diplazium esculentum, Dryopteris cochleata, Diplazium spectabile, Diplazium dilatatum, Tectaria coadunata, and Diplazium maximum were analyzed for dietary nutrients and multi-elemental profiling. The highest moisture content (89.83%) and highest vitamin C content (25.38 mg g−100) was found in Diplazium maximum.The highest protein was found in Tectaria coadunata (12.10%), which was much higher compared to many common commercial vegetables. Fat content was highest in Dryopteris cochleata (0.40%), whereas fiber content was found to be maximum in Diplazium esculentum (5.05%) and ash content was highest in Diplazium spectabile (1.57%). The mineral analysis of these ferns showed that they are good suppliers of sodium (0.46– 3.56 mg g−100), magnesium (6.42– 13.39 mg g−100), and iron (10.36– 16.35 mg g−100). Most of the toxic and heavy metals were found to be within permissible limits. However, some of the fern species collected from certain regions had higher levels of these metals. Based on the present study on dietary nutrients and elemental profile, these edible ferns could be popularized for commercial cultivation. Further, research work could be conducted for standardizing practices and, because of anticipated climate changes, these ferns could add diversity in the world food basket.",

Specialized natural enemies of L. microphyllum are predicted to exist that can be safely employed to control the fern in Florida, where it is a severe problem. Lygodium microphyllum (Cav.) R. Br., or Old World climbing fern, is a serious weed in southern Florida, as described in the companion to this paper (Pemberton and Ferriter, 1998). In an attempt to reduce populations of this plant and to limit its spread, a biological control research effort is being initiated. The theory of biological control and the suitability of this approach to reduce and manage L. microphyllum are discussed. To help lay the groundwork for the biological control effort, the native range and taxonomic relations of the fern are defined. This information is used to plan and conduct surveys for natural enemies as well as research to define the potential host ranges of candidate biological control agents. The question of whether insects and other natural enemies can be expected to be associated with L. microphyllum is addressed.",

(1987) placed Psilotum at the base of vascular plants, the lycopsids branched off next, then Equisetum, and then the ferns.However, the portion of the clade containing the fern allies was constructed with only four morphological characters and it is not reasonable to expect that a robust phylogeny containing highly divergent taxa can be produced from such a small data set.Conversely, fossil evidence (Knoll and Rothwell, 1981;Stewart, 1983;Gensel and Andrews, 1984], characters relating to male gametogenesis (Garbary et. al., 1993), and chloroplast genome structures (Raubeson and Jansen, 1992) support the hypothesis that the lycophytes are at the base of the vascular land plant clade.Mishler et al.

    "abstract": "There is a consensus among fern systematists that the eusporangiate ferns, Ophioglossaceae and Marattiaceae, constitute ancient and isolated lineages, the former perhaps allied to progymnosperms.Osmundaceae, Schizaeaceae sensu lato, Gleicheniaceae, Matoniaceae, Cyatheaceae, Dicksoniaceae, and several other small or monotypic families represent early offshoots from the main line leading to higher leptosporangiate ferns, conclusions supported by fossil evidence.Among the higher ferns, there is also general agreement as to the major evolutionary groups (variously assigned subfamilial, familial, or ordinal rank), e.g., the dryopteroid, thelypteroid, blechnoid, asplenioid, polypodioid, dennstaedtioid, and pteridoid/cheilanthoid ferns.There is much less agreement on the origins and interrelationships of these more modern lineages.Highly modified ferns that occupy specialized ecological niches are especially difficult to place in a phylogenetic scheme; these include filmy ferns and heterosporous ferns.Disagreements in various phyletic schemes include the origin of the polypods (and grammitids) from either gleichenioid (exindusiate) stock or from a line leading to the largely indusiate ferns (dennstaedtioid line sensu Holttum, 1949), with sporangia having a vertical annulus.The often-suggested derivation of pteridoid/cheilanthoid ferns from schizaeoid ferns needs reexamination.In recent years, fern systematists have refrained from producing phyletic schemes based on morphological traits, and rigorous cladistic analyses of the Polypodiophyta have never been attempted, perhaps because of a supposed high incidence of reticulate evolution and homoplasy, as well as inadequate and incomplete data sets.It is the purpose of this paper to summarize ideas on the phylogenetic relationships of ferns, as based on evidence derived from such traditional sources as fossils, comparative morphology, anatomy, and chromosome number.I will approach this topic by first giving a cursory overview of characters that have been employed in the classifications of the last 250 years.These characters form the basis for most of the published evolutionary schemes, including ones by Bower (1926), Holttum (1947, 1949, 1973), Wagner (1969), Mickel (1973, 1974a), and Pichi Sermolli (1977), and also underlie commonly used classifications that lack a schematic depiction of relationships (e.g., Tryon and Tryon, 1982; Kramer in Kubitzki, 1990).The generic sequence proposed by Crabbe et al. (1975) was intended as a filing arrangement for herbaria, but the authors stated that they \"incorporate the most recent evidence bearing on phylogeny\" (p.142), so that in fact it qualifies as a classification, more than many that have been advanced.Other phylogenies or classifications incorporating evolutionary principles for all or a portion of the ferns include ones by",

    "abstract": "Opinions on the phylogeny and classification of the Polypodiaceae sensu stricto have been particularly divergent and recent DNA sequencing analyses have supported the hypothesis that this group should be allied to the higher indusiate ferns.Within the genus Polypodium, isozymic and restriction site analyses demonstrated that interspecific genetic identities are quite low, suggesting that sequences of the conservative rbcL gene would be appropriate for addressing open systematic questions.Average infrageneric sequence divergence (1.87%) was sufficient to generate reliable species differences, and the skewness test of randomly generated trees suggested that the data were non random and probably phylogenetically informative.A stric:t consensus of the eight most parsimonious trees supported the monophyly of the P. vulgare complex, and decay analysis showed that primary tree branches were well supported.Most of the phylogenetically informative nucleotides were at third codon positions.Neotropical Polypodium species were chosen a priori as a close out-group, and emerged as a sister group to the P. vulgare complex.Polypodium amorphum + P. appalacliionum formed a clade that was morphologically supported by the synapomorphic feature of sporangiasters in the sori.Although the indication that P. glycyrrhiza was related to the Asian species P fauriei was not unexpected, the close association of these two species with P. scouleri was quite surprising, and provided insights on the possible origin of the latter species through adaptation to stressful habitats.Whereas the long held hypothesis of a close association between P. australe and P. macaronesicum was upheld, the rbcL sequence data c:ould provide no insights on the phylogeny of the enigmatic Hawaiian endemic, P. pcllucidum.Pleopellis ttiyssanolepis, until recently classified as a Polypodium, was solidly allied to Pleopeltis mocrocarpa var.complanata.It is anticipated that future molecular analyses will provide additional insights on the evolutionary history of the Polypodiaceae.",

    "abstract": "Among lower vascular plants, the establishment of new individuals and populations is largely dependent on the transport of spores by prevailing winds (Tryon, 1970; Wagner, 1972). Since long distance dispersal may require prolonged exposure of spores to unfavorable conditions, spore longevity has a major impact on species migration and distribution. The degree to which spores remain viable for long periods also determines the applicability of many biosystematic techniques to herbarium specimens (Windham & Haufler, 1986). Although an understanding of spore longevity is thus critical to investigations of several biological phenomena, little is known about the factors affecting prolonged spore viability in ferns. Previous studies have shown that the spores of various pteridophyte species differ greatly in their ability to germinate after storage at ambient temperatures (Dyer, 1979). Two major groups of ferns have been identified on the basis of spore longevity (Lloyd & Klekowski, 1970): those with green spores containing active chlorophyll (mean viability of 48 days), and those with non-chlorophyllous spores (mean viability of 2.8 years). Most studies of the factors affecting spore longevity have compared these two groups. For example, Lloyd & Klekowski (1970) suggested that high water content, elevated respiratory rates, and the absence of a desiccation-resistant spore wall might account for the short viability of chlorophyllous spores. Since viability declines rapidly in Equisetum spores even when they are protected from desiccation (Hauke, 1963), the intensity of respiratory activity seems to be the limiting factor in this case. Although these studies may explain the lack of long-term viability in green spores, they shed little light on factors controlling longevity in the majority of fern taxa with nongreen spores. Depending on the species, non-chlorophyllous fern spores remain viable for periods ranging from several months (Lloyd & Klekowski, 1970) to nearly 100 years (Johnson, 1985). Both temperature and humidity are known to influence longevity (Okada, 1929), but a variety of other factors may also be involved. Although differences in respiratory rate seem relatively minor in this group (Okada, 1929), they may prove significant when calculated in terms of years or decades. Thus, ploidy level could be an important factor because polyploids tend to show lower respiratory rates (Levin, 1983). In addition, the lower surface/ volume ratios of polyploid spores would reduce the relative exposure of cytoplasm to the unfavorable environment surrounding the spore. For herbarium specimens traditionally used in spore longevity studies, this unfavorable environment may include a variety of physical and chemical treatments used for preservation and insect control. All of these factors have the potential to affect",

This taxon belongs to a major lineage (marattioid ferns) that, in most recent phylogenetic analyses, emerges near the base of the monilophytes. We used fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate organelles, rolling circle amplification (RCA) to amplify the plastid genome, followed by shotgun sequencing to 8X depth coverage, and then we assembled these reads to obtain the plastid genome sequence. The circular genome map has 153,901 bp, containing inverted repeats of 21,053 bp each, a large single-copy region of 89,709 bp, and a small single-copy region of 22,086 bp. Gene order is similar to that of Psilotum. Several unique characters are observed in the Angiopteris plastid genome, such as repeat structure in a pseudogene. We make structural comparisons to Psilotum and Adiantum plastid genomes. However, the overall structural similarity to Psilotum indicates either wholesale conservation of genome organization, or (less likely) repeated convergence to a stable structure. The results are discussed in relation to a growing comparative database of genomic and morphological characters across the green plants.",

From this summary it may be concluded that the habitat of Diellia is a transient one, both edaphically and biotically, which occurs constantly but sporadically, both in time and area, through the steep and dryer wooded gulches of the Hawaiian Islands. It may be surmised that the apparent rarity of the genus is due to the relatively small areas that such suitable environments occupy at any one time. The disappearance of the genus from some of its former localities may be due to the removal of disturbing influences which provided appropriate edaphic and biotic conditions. On the face of present evidence it does not follow that the genus is on the verge of extinction. Because its habitat is transitory, it has probably always been rare and local!

This study was undertaken in order to assess the relative growth rates and reproductive potential of S. cooperi and the native Cibotium species. Field measurements of growth rates, fertile frond production and leaf traits were made monthly over the course of one year. Sphaeropteris cooperi had a significantly higher growth rate, both in terms of height increase and frond production, and maintained four times more fronds than the native Cibotium species. The mean annual height increase of the invasive tree fern was 15 cm compared to 2 to 3 cm for the native tree ferns. The leaf mass per area of S. cooperi was significantly lower than that of the native Cibotium species, and the leaf life span was significantly shorter, suggesting that the cost of construction of the invasive species' fronds was relatively low. Sphaeropteris cooperi also produced significantly more fertile fronds per month than the native tree ferns. These differences in life history characteristics may help explain the rapid spread and success of S. cooperi in Hawaii.",

    "abstract": "The definition, description, and identification of Isoetes species has always been difficult. This is primarily the result of an overall morphological simplicity and extreme phenotypic plasticity that combine to reduce the number of stable and therefore diagnostic characters. Such aspects of the biology of Isoetes have, historically, resulted in rather diverse specific treatments and circumscriptions. Recent studies in the genus have tended to emphasize previously overlooked characters and to apply both modern experimental techniques and the principles of population genetics in order to resolve many of these inconsistencies. Investigations utilizing cytological data, germination and hybridization studies, and protein electrophoresis have shown that over the range of a species its boundaries vary due to clinal variation, non-patterned geographical variation, interspecific hybridization, and the production of fertile allopolyploids. Such approaches have greatly increased our understanding of the dynamics of this genus. At the outset, it should be stated that it is not the objective of this paper to discuss the theoretical implications, or the limitations and benefits of the various species concepts that are currently in existence. Such discussions are numerous and can be found throughout the pages of many of the major systematic journals such as Systematic Botany, Systematic Zoology and Biology and Philosophy. Rather, this paper is designed to illustrate both the current and the historical application of the various species concepts in pteridophytes with particular reference to Isoetes. It is hoped that the reader will come away with an appreciation of the progressive nature involved in the elucidation of species and for the (practical) necessity of applying multiple species concepts during any given systematic inquiry (see also Zander, 1985). To illustrate such processes the following examples will be presented: the I. storkii aggregate of Costa Rica; the I. melanopoda complex of the southeastern United States; and the Isoetes species of northeastern North America. As a prelude to these examples, a brief review of the species concept and a discussion of the role of herbarium material will be presented. Species concepts.-For the purposes of this paper, the species concepts of consequence are: the typological species concept (TSC), the morphological species concept (MSC) and the biological species concept (BSC). The TSC is associated with all poorly known groups. Typically it is associated with rare or at least rarely collected species and is almost always employed when only a single collection is known for the species; i.e., simply, the species is circumscribed upon the only materials available-the type.

    "abstract": "Uses of herbarium specimens for biosystematic research are being extended by new techniques, and those described here have been exploited only in the past few decades. Not only do dried and pressed pteridophyte specimens provide such classical gross data as geographical, ecological, and morphological, but microscopic and chemical data as well. Specimens on herbarium sheets often yield hypotheses of hybridity by morphology alone, based on the phenomenon of intermediacy (W. Wagner, 1983), in which the characters of higher plant hybrids tend to have expressions lying between those of the parental species: If one has ovate leaves, and the other lanceolate leaves, the hybrid has more or less ovate-lanceolate leaves. The hybrid's characters are not necessarily in the middle; some may be closer to one parent, some closer to the other. Probably most investigations of hybrid pteridophytes begin in the herbarium, where specimens showing interspecific intermediacy are encountered. We call such specimens because they do not fit either presumed parent. Whenever they are found we examine their spores. Interspecific pteridophyte hybrids fall into three categories as regards spore production, namely (a) sterile hybrids that have defective spores (e.g., Fig. 1), (b) fertile hybrids (either introgressant or, much more commonly, allopolyploid) that have normal viable spores, and (c) apogamous hybrids that produce unreduced spores. We are not concerned here with fertile hybrids, except for those that are apogamous (e.g., in the United States, Pteris x hillebrandii and Asplenium x heteroresiliens). Obligately apogamous hybrids can usually be recognized because some or most of the sporangia have only 32 spores that are viable; those with 64 spores show abortion (various combinations are also possible; cf. Manton, 1950). Apogamous intertaxa involve one apogamous and one sexual parent. Non-hybrid taxa with normally 32 or 16 spores per sporangium might be confused with apogamous hybrids but these can be recognized because the reduced spore number is regularized, characteristic of all sporangia, and the spores are non-abortive. Examples of 32- or 16-spored sporangia in normal sexual species are found in a wide diversity of genera (e.g., Ceratopteris, Cheilanthes, Lindsaea, Alsophila, Sadleria). Allopolyploid sexual hybrids behave like ordinary species, even though they are actually hybrids, and many of these are frequent or common; they are recognized by their spore size, usually larger than that of their parents. Not all spore abortion is associated with hybridity (see below under Additional Perspectives). Nearly all spore samples from normal species show at least some deviant spores. It is not unusual to find as much as 10-20 percent of spores",

    "abstract": "William J. Hooker's generic concepts for ferns essentially dominated the taxonomic community for the latter half of the nineteenth century. We now see that his genera, based almost solely on soral and venational characters, were nearly as artificial in conception as those of Linnaeus' sexual system for flowering plants. With the recognition in this century that some superficially similar groups such as the thelypterids and dryopterids were not at all closely related, the Hookerian dream of easy and obvious fern genera was permanently undermined. Today, even in complex groups, there is still resistance to the elucidation of genera based on nontraditional characters. Although conservatism is generally a cardinal virtue in taxonomy, the maintenance of very large, complex genera seems cumbersome for cases in which natural and discrete groupings of more manageable size can be demonstrated and defined by multiple, correlating characters. In my paper on Cochlidium (Bishop, 1978), I suggested that the only rational alternative to recognizing radically revised generic concepts in the Grammitidaceae is the inclusion of all species of the family into a single genus. Workers in at least two subsequent publications have adopted this approach for New World species (Tryon & Tryon, 1982; Proctor, 1985). The necessarily detailed studies to support more workable and hierarchic generic concepts in the family have proceeded rather slowly. But both Parris, from her studies of Indo-Malaysian species, and I, in my investigation of Neotropical groups, have become convinced that well defined, natural genera can be delimited among these ferns (Parris, 1984, 1986). As to the ease of generic recognition, those who wish to constitute the entire family Grammitidaceae as a single genus are recognizing a genus based on spore and sporangial characters, whereas the natural groupings within the family are to be founded on the more easily observed features of trichomes and general morphology. Among the larger grammitid ferns, the presence or absence of hydathodes seems to be a conservative character. In the Neotropics, the great majority of anhydathodous species probably constitute an allied group. The only Neotropical anhydathodous grammitids not part of this greater alliance are Grammitis graminea, G. turquina, and those few species of Grammitis sensu stricto in which the hydathodes are reduced to the point of extinction. In addition to lacking hydathodes, ferns of the alliance in question have concolorous scales, generally coriaceous fronds, and rather weak laminar setae. Another interesting character found among these ferns is the tendency for the base of the rachis or the distal stipe to be geniculate. This character is found among the hydathodous grammitids only in Grammitis asplenifolia and its immediate relatives.",

The study site is located 100–200 m from the Gulf coast in the understory of a semideciduous lowland forest dominated by trees of Enterolobium and Ficus. Four leaf parameters: leaf growth of main and secondary axes, number of living leaves, leaf production and leaf mortality were scored monthly and correlated with two climatic factors: monthly mean temperature and precipitation. Sixty percent of the 37 individuals were supported on lianas, dead wood or shrubs. Smaller, unsupported plants with a height of less than 2.5 m had a mean number of 1.9 ± 0.27 leaves and produced 3.7 ± 0.52 leaves per year and did not become fertile. Over 50 % of the leaves died within the first 3 months, whereas over 10% lived for 12 to 30 months, resulting in a mean leaf life span of 5.6 ± 0.7 months. All leaf parameters were seasonal with the exception of the growth of the main axes. During the rainy season, leaf growth of secondary axes and leaf mortality increased approximately threefold and leaf production rose twofold. Correlations between climatic factors and leaf parameters were strongest within a time lag of one month. The strongest correlation was found between precipitation and the growth of secondary axes, indicating that water is the limiting factor. One to five dormant buds developed on 17.7% of the leaves contributing to 40.3% of the total leaf growth. The potentially long life span of the climbing leaves and the outgrowing dormant buds make this species a successful pioneer in disturbed vegetation and a competitive weed in Mexican vanilla plantations.",

    "abstract": "Longisections of xylem were studied with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for roots of Angiopteris, upright axes of Psilotum, and rhizomes of eight species of leptosporangiate ferns of diverse habits and varied ecological preferences. In contrast to earlier studies using macerations, razor-blade sections of fixed material from living plants were prepared. All materials studied showed porose or reticulate pit membranes present on presumptive end walls of tracheids. Contrasting non-porose pits were observed on lateral walls of some tracheids. Tracheid to parenchyma pit pairs may have porose pit membranes on the tracheid side and nonporose pit membranes on the parenchyma side; thus degree of porosity in a section can represent the degree to which one primary wall or the other is pared away. Reticulate pit membranes on tracheary element end walls are evidently widespread in ferns. Such cells should not be considered vessel elements, although the reticulate pit membranes suggest a degree of transition toward the membrane-free perforations of typical vessels. True vessels (pit membranes absent in perforations) do occur in roots in a limited number of fern genera. The preparation methods of the present study produced results freer from artifacts than did macerations, and interpretations must be altered accordingly. Reports of lateral, multiple, and interrupted perforation plates in ferns are probably the result of loss of pit membranes due to the oxidative action of maceration and should be rejected. Likewise, \"pit dimorphism\" (alternately wide and narrow pits) and \"striate\" (corrugated) pit membranes in ferns represent artifacts. True vessel elements in ferns probably always have secondary wall architecture of end walls different from that of lateral walls.",

None of the earlier reports by Campbell and du Buysson gave any indication that darkness was required for germination. In soil cultures, 0. moluccanum, 0. vulgatum, and B. ternatum germinated in a few days, which is a period comparable to that for spores of the Polypodiaceae (Campbell, 1907; du Buysson, 1889). Young gametophytes of O. vulgatum and B. ternatum were illustrated by du Buysson (1889) with filamentous and two-dimensional growth habits which are similar to those for polypodiaceous gametophytes. Consequently, the present study of additional species was carried out in axenic culture to determine how the requirements for germination and the type of early gametophyte development for these species compared with the results from previous studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS Spores of eight Ophioglossaceae species, Botrychium biternatum (Sav.) Underw., B. dissectum Spreng. var. dissectum, B. lunarioides (Michx.) Swartz, B. matricariifolium A. Braun, B. virginianum (L.) Swartz, Ophioglossum engelmannii Prantl, and 0. vulgatum var. pycnostichum Fern. and var. pseudopodum (Blake) Farw., were used in this study. With the exception of the spores of B. matricariifblium and 0. vulgatum var. pseudopodum, which were from Ontario, the spores were collected in the southeastern United States. Voucher specimens are on deposit in the Vanderbilt University Herbarium (VDB). The techniques of Whittier (1973) were employed. The spores were sown on 15 ml of nutrient medium in culture tubes with a diameter of 20 mm. The tubes had screw caps which were tightened to reduce moisture loss. The nutrient medium was composed of Knudson's solution of mineral salts, minor elements, FeEDTA, and 0.6% agar (Whittier, 1973). The medium was supplemented with 0.5% sucrose and had a pH of 6.3.

    "abstract": "The dependence of spore germination on light in most species of ferns was established by nineteenth century biologists including Borodin, Schmidt, Kny, and Beck (see the excellent review of Sussman, 1965). However, there are conflicting reports on the ability of spores of certain species to germinate in the dark. For example, Borodin (1865), Schulz (1902), and Life (1907) were unable to demonstrate the germination of spores of Anemia phyllitidis in the dark, although Schelting (1875) claimed that it occurs. The light requirement for germination in various species has been found to be complex. Ability of spores to undergo dark germination may vary, for example, with age (Laage, 1907), with pretreatment at various temperatures (Heald, 1898; Schulz, 1902), or with exposure to various plant hormones. Reliable action spectra for light-induced promotion and inhibition of germination in species of Dryopteris and Osmunda (Biinning and Mohr, 1955; M\\ohr, 1956; Mohr et al., 1964) show maxima at the absorption maxima of phytochrome. Gibberellic acid stimulation of dark germination, reported by Schraudolf (1962), was the first true case of a specific replacement of a light requirement in spore germination. Kato (1955) reported a gibberellin stimulation of germination in Dryopteris erythrosora and Cyathea sp., but this consisted merely of gibberellin promotion of rhizoid and protonemal growth in light. M'ore recently Naf (1966) has confirmed Schraudolf's observations and reported that dark germination is stimulated in Lygodium japonicum by gibberellic acid and in Anemia phyllitidis by an antheridogen-B preparation as well as by gibberellin. Naf also claimed a weak stimulation of germination of L. japonicum by antheridogen-B and by the medium upon which L. japonicum had been growing.

These are now so well known that it is necessary to say only that in the sexual life cycle, a diploid sporophyte gives rise to haploid spores, which form haploid gametophytes. The latter produce haploid eggs and sperms, and upon fertilization, these yield new diploid sporophytes (Fig. 1A). In the obligate apogamous life cycle, details of which were established by D6pp in 1932 and later confirmed by Manton (1950), the sporophyte produces diploid spores which form diploid gametophytes. The gametophytes tend to form antheridia with viable sperm but few or no archegonia. Production of a new sporophyte is accomplished simply by proliferation of cells from the diploid gametophyte (Fig. 1B). Other methods of reproduction in ferns are known, such as the various types of vegetative offsets from sporophytes or gametophytes, but no spores are involved. Only two basic patterns of reproduction involving spores, briefly described above, are known to occur.",

Tryon investigated the patterns of neotropical fern diversity and discovered that sites of exceptional richness and endemism are found in five predominantly montane regions. Here, we revisit these sites with the aid of contemporary methodologies. We integrate phylogenetic, ecological, climatic, and occurrence data to better understand what factors contribute to the patterns of fern diversity throughout the neotropics. With this dataset we are able to reassess Tryon's neotropical hotspots fifty years later and take one step closer to understanding the processes governing the distribution of fern species. We recover six hotspots of neotropical species richness and endemism that closely mirror those delineated by Tryon. Like Tryon, we find that hotspots are found predominantly in montane regions with more climatic space compared to surrounding areas. Patterns of species richness and lineage diversification can largely be explained by the extent of available habitats, especially in association with montane ecosystems. We also show that patterns of species assemblages across the neotropics are largely dictated by distance and elevation. In synthesis, we propose that, in addition to migration and persistence of relictual lineages, patterns of species richness and endemism in the neotropics are driven by in situ speciation in montane regions.",

Except for the investigations of Hurel-Py (6), little of the work along these lines has been with members of the Pteridophyta until recently. Wetmore and his group have worked with larger forms, particularly Adiantum (11, 12, 13). The advantages of working with a smaller form, especially one which is aquatic in habit, are numerous. Probably the two most important are 1) the saving in space, and 2) the ability to work with either solid or liquid media. The recent work of Allsopp with Marsilea sporelings (1, 2, 3) has made valuable contributions to this field, using a small aquatic fern as the research tool. Work with Marsilea, however, involves sterilization of the sporocarp, maintenance of suitable conditions for the opening of the sporocarp, liberation of the spores, development of the gametophyte, fertilization, and excision of the tiny embryo from the female prothallus. Although the results obtained from the development of sporelings from a given sporocarp have been uniform, still genetic variation has to be taken into account as a factor. Also, for the investigator not accustomed to working with ferns and not in a position to replenish his supply of experimental material, a fern that can be maintained as a clonal stock in a vegetative state would be preferable.

    "abstract": "Mountains are the global centers of fern diversity and at the same time strongly affected by climate change, raising the question of how fern species and communities will respond to these changes. In the present review, which also includes our own unpublished data, we first outline the challenges of identifying distributional boundaries in ferns. We suggest that the elevational ranges of many fern species are determined by geographical constraints such as low mountain tops and sea level, as well as habitat availability rather than by climate. We then show that climate-range limits of ferns are driven by numerous physiological processes, not only involving the effects of cold and drought stress at high elevations, but also of drought stress coupled with high temperatures at low elevations, and possibly even of such poorly considered factors as low frost tolerance at low elevations in the absence of snow cover. Finally, there is also some evidence for biotic limitations, such as interspecific competition and the negative influence of leaf litter, especially in species-rich assemblages without extreme climatic factors. Overall, we find that elevational distributions of ferns are determined by a broad suite of factors, many of which do not involve physiological tolerance to climate or only indirectly so, and therefore that reactions of ferns to climate change will likely be species- and context-specific. We also emphasize the paucity of studies focusing both on the physiological limitations for fern growth and reproduction, and on biotic interactions affecting fern distributions. To overcome these knowledge gaps, we advocate a range of further studies, including resampling of old vegetation plots, lab experiments, and transplantation experiments, on both gametophytes and sporophytes.",

    "abstract": "In general, evolution may manifest itself in two ways in a group of plants. There may be progressive changes which lead up to a higher level and there may also be segregative changes giving rise to characters which are simply different in kind. By the development of segregative characters new groups or branches arise which may go through a series of progressive changes or steps paralleling more or less closely those which are appearing in the original group. In classification, therefore, it becomes important to recognize what is a low type from what is a high type of plant as well as what characters are persistent in the given group and, therefore, of phylogenetic value. The easiest way to decide on the relative positions of two plants is to look past the characters they may possess to the hereditary properties that produce these characters. For it is often true that an apparently simpler organ or organ complex represents the activity of a much more complex heredity than a more complicated organography which may merely represent repetition. Low types have fewer, more generalized, functional activities and high types have more specialized, complex, functional activities. Besides looking into the characters and the heredity of the plants under consideration themselves, a comparison must also be made with plants admittedly higher in the scale and with those lower. Applying these principles to the living species of Equiseta gives an arrangement nearly opposite to that which has been in vogue for a long time, and shows that",

    "abstract": "Tests were conducted to evaluate the effects of various sterilization procedures on spores of Cyathea delgadii stored under different conditions with the intent of developing a strat- egy of ex-situ spore conservation of this declining species. Although the percentage of germination after two years of storage was relatively low for all storage and sterilization parameters, dry storage at -12?C resulted in the best survival rate. Elimination of bacterial and fungal contaminants was best when the spores were washed, treated with calcium hypochlorite, incubated, filtered, and washed again before sowing on medium containing Nystatin. The spores of some tree ferns in the Cyatheaceae lose their viability after a few weeks of storage (Page, 1979). The viabilility of Cyathea delgadii Sternb. spores is already decreased after only two months storage at 12?C and low humidity (Randi and Felippe, 1988a) and percent spore germination is signif- icantly decreased after six months of storage under the same conditions (Mar- condes-Ferreira and Felippe, 1984). In general, it is advisable to store fern spores at low temperature and low humidity, sometimes with the use of des- iccators (Dyer, 1979a). More recently, storage in darkness at room temperature and high humidity (imbibed) has been advised for some species (Lindsay et al., 1991). Before storing imbibed spores in the laboratory or before germination of spores stored dry, there is the need to sterilize them. Several chemicals have been used for this purpose (Dyer, 1979b), and either sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) or calcium hypochlorite (Ca(OCl2)J4H2O) are the most commonly used. Unfortunately, most treatments that kill contaminant fungi and bacteria also reduce fern spore germination. Different concentrations of chemicals and duration of application have been used. Before germination, it is advisable to incubate the spores in darkness for a period of time: the fungi and bacteria start to grow and become more sensitive to the chemicals used for sterilization (Voeller, 1964; Schedlbauer, 1976). The objective of this investigation was to study different sterilization meth- ods and storage conditions in order to develop a procedure for maintaining a source of viable spores of Cyathea delgadii for ex situ conservation, because this species is rapidly disappearing from the Brazilian forests as consequence of commercial exploitation.",

In each of these cases, the gametophytes have the characteristic of producing gemmae by which they maintain local populations vegetatively and independently of the sporophyte generation. Species of Vittaria, the shoestring ferns, also have gemma-producing gametophytes. In the continental United States, Vittaria is represented by three species. In peninsular Florida, V. lineata (L.) Smith is common on trunks of cabbage palms in both gametophyte and sporophyte stages. Here gametophytes produce the gemmae characteristic of the genus, but also produce sporophytes in a normal sexual life cycle (Farrar, 1974, 1978). Gametophytes of the common Central American species, V. graminifolia Kaulf., have been collected from bases of beech trees in southern Alabama (Farrar & Landry, 1987). In the Mountains and Plateau regions of the eastern United States, a third species of Vittaria is represented by the gametophyte stage only. It is distinct from the gametophytes of the other two species. It is a common and conspicuous, though often unrecognized, component of the vegetation of cool, moist, heavily shaded outcroppings of non-calcareous rock. A detailed description of these plants and their habitat has been presented by Farrar (1978) along with a discussion of unsuccessful attempts by Farrar and others to induce these plants to produce normal sporophytes in culture. It is this species, commonly known as the Appalachian Gametophyte or Appalachian Vittaria Gametophyte, for which we propose the new Latin binomial, Vittaria appalachiana.",

    "abstract": "All land plants are continually exposed to a wide variety of microorganisms ranging from those which are beneficial to those which are pathogenic. Most plants remain remarkably healthy, and this seems to be especially true of ferns, which reportedly are rarely subject to diseases (Braid, 1940; Hutchinson, 1976; Bandoni, pers. comm.). It is now generally recognized that the resistance of plants to pathogens (and other predators) is mainly due to their containing fungicidal and bactericidal secondary compounds. The few surveys which have been carried out on ferns have confirmed that they do contain such antibiotic substances (Maruzzella, 1961; Khrisagar & Mehta, 1972; Lynch-Brathwaite et al., 1975; Banerjee & Sen, 1980; Cooper-Driver et al., in prep.). One major class of secondary compounds with known antimicrobial activity is the phenolics, which range from simple phenols to complex polymeric tannins (Harbore, 1982, pp. 230-264). Their main role in plants appears to be as protective compounds against fungi, bacteria, and viruses (Friend, 1979; Swain, 1979). For example, the flavonoids present in the farinose exudate on the leaf surfaces of some ferns have antimicrobial properties (Chowdhury et al., 1974; Wollenweber, 1978). Simple phenolics, such as p-hydroxybenzoic, protocatechuic, and vanillic (hydroxybenzoic) acids, and p-coumaric, caffeic, and ferulic (cinnamic) acids (Fig. 1) have been shown to be present in the fronds of ferns (Bohm & Tryon, 1967; Bohm, 1968; Cooper-Driver, 1976) and to play an important role in the ecology of Bracken (Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn) by inhibiting the germination and growth of neighboring plants (Stewart, 1975; Glass, 1976; Gliessman & Muller, 1978). Such acids are also known to have inhibitory effects on feeding by insects (Jones & Firn, 1979). The concentration of these acids in the leaves is known to vary quantitatively during growth and development (Glass & Bohm, 1969; Cooper-Driver et al., 1977; Jones, 1983), and thus must affect the antimicrobial, allelopathic, and anti-insecticidal properties of the plants differentially during the growing season. Simple phenolic and cinnamic acids must also play a major role in the defense of fern gametophytes against pathogens, particularly since more complex phenols, such as flavonoids, have been shown to be absent during the pre-antheridial stage (Petersen & Fairbrothers, 1980). However, it has been reported that fern prothalli are readily susceptible to several species of off' fungi, like Pythium species (Gregor, 1938, pp. 141-154), and gametophytes grown in pure culture can be readily invaded by Botrytis cinerea, Pythium debaryanum, and Rhizoctonia solani (Hutchinson & Fahim, 1958). Gametophytes grown in pure culture appear to be more susceptible to molds and damping off diseases than to the more specific pathogens of angiosperms, Fusarium solani and Verticillium dahliae (Hutchinson, 1976). In angiosperms, many of these",

    "abstract": "Lygodium microphyllum (Cav.) R. Br. (Schizaeaceae) was first reported as an adventive in Florida about a decade ago by Beckner (1968). The plants were known to Beckner from three collections in Martin County near Jonathan Dickinson State Park and a single collection in Palm Beach County from Delray Beach. These climbing ferns should no longer be considered adventive, since they are now naturalized in both these counties. On the fringes of their range, the plants occur mostly in small clumps, while toward the center of the distribution near the Loxahatchee River and Loxahatchee Slough (Fig. 1), Lygodium may cover acres. One colony in Palm Beach County (Sect. 12, T44S, R41W) was one-quarter of a mile long and about 200 yards wide in January 1978. In Florida, the plants are confined to wet, disturbed sites. We have found them only near canals, rivers, ditches, in disturbed swamps, and other sites which have standing water for a large part of the year. We have not determined when the plants were introduced, although the oldest collection we have seen was made in February 1958 (R. A. Long, FLAS). The apparently oldest center of dispersal for L. microphyllum is in the Loxahatchee River area. Large and seemingly old colonies are abundant, suggesting that the plants have been there longer than the past two decades. Another, apparently younger, focal point is in southeastern Palm Beach County. Perhaps the small colony (Fig. 1) was started by the plants being cultivated in nurseries in the 1950's. If, as we have assumed, the ferns first became established in the Lower Loxahatchee River area, how they were dispersed upstream is unknown. Spores might have been spread accidently by birds, since young plants often appear first in small isolated patches on the margins of cypress heads. Two other members of the genus have been reported in Florida, L. japonicum (Thunb.) Swartz and L. palmatum (Berh.) Swartz. The former is an Asian fern naturalized from the Carolinas to Texas (Radford et al., 1968; Correll &Johnston, 1970). An old collection of L. japonicum in Dade County was considered to have escaped on vacant lots, but we suspect that it was only persistent from cultivation. We have not seen recent populations in southern Florida. Lygodium palmatum is considered a native of the eastern United States, ranging from Massachusetts to the Carolinas and Kentucky (Radford, et al., 1968). Although reported in Georgia and Florida (Small, 1938), we have seen no specimens.",

However the distribution and diversity patterns of different growth forms (i.e., epiphytic vs. terrestrial ferns) have not been broadly quantified. We compared the distribution and diversity patterns of epiphytic pteridophytes on the trunks of six individuals of the emergent canopy tree species Hyeronima alchorneoides (Euphorbiaceae) to those of terrestrial species at La Selva Biological Station in Heredia province, Costa Rica. A total of 21 species of epiphytic and 20 terrestrial ferns was recorded, with only one species found as an epiphyte and as a terrestrial species. Epiphytic species also exhibited increasing species diversity with increasing trunk height. Epiphytic species exhibited predictable patterns of distribution along the trunk and were easily grouped into high-trunk, low trunk, or bimodal categories. In terms of percent cover and number of species, simple-leaved ferns dominated the epiphytic growth form, 13 of 21 species, whereas ferns with compound or dissected leaves dominated the hemi-epiphytic and terrestrial floras with 20 of 20 species. These results indicate that there are significant functional differences in the ecology of epiphytic and terrestrial ferns and that reciprocal establishment is difficult and extremely rare.",

A. C. Smith (1930) later transferred another such species, C. connellii, to the genus.Copeland (1947), however, removed such species to the genus Grammitis, basing his concept of Cochlidium strictly on the coenosoral character.Morton (1967) rightly deplored the artifice of Copeland's larger genera in the Grammitidaceae.His remedy was to dissolve his predecessor's genera into a single, very large genus Grammitis, recognizing the former groupings as equally artificial sections.From my understanding of the family, I believe that consis-",

Plants were grown under laboratory conditions at 25 ± 2°C with a light intensity of 120 μmol/m2/s, and a 14 hr photoperiod. Salvinia's growth, expressed as frond production and plant fresh weight doubling time, was significantly increased with increasing nitrogen concentration from 1.0 mg/l to 100.0 mg/l in the growth media. The increase in growth rate was independent from the variation in phosphorus concentrations. However, the highest growth rate was obtained for days 1 through 7 when the levels of both nitrogen and phosphorus were elevated 100 fold (100 mg/l N and 10.0 mg/l P) from that of control treatments. This treatment also resulted in the highest photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll α and b content, carotenoids and anthocyanins concentrations. Nitrogen and phosphorus concentration did not influence soluble sugar (SS) accumulation. Starch and total-nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) accumulation was significantly lower in treatments receiving elevated levels of nitrogen or phosphorus when compared to the control.

We interviewed 50 adults of different age, sex, and origins to obtain information on local knowledge and management practices of royal fern. Osmunda regalis is locally considered a highly efficient remedy. The rhizome has been traditionally employed in Cantabria mainly for the treatment of bone fractures, joint disorders and rheumatic and arthritic pain. Its consumption prevails in rural areas but it is also employed in towns and cities and its demand has led to small-scale marketing. More than half of the interviewees (54%) had only passive knowledge about their medicinal uses while the rest of informants (46%) were consumers, collectors or sellers (22% ‘collector-consumers’, 6% ‘non collector-consumers’, 4% ‘collector-sellers’ and 14% ‘non collector-sellers’). People from villages harvested O. regalis for their own consumption and expressed concern about overexploitation by a rising demand from urban areas, whereas people from cities were unaware of the ecology of the fern. The scarcity of the fern has led to rural residents to develop local management practices that contribute to the species conservation. These practices included keeping the location of the fern secret, not harvesting the complete rhizome for not killing the plant and allowing its regeneration, and cultivating the species in home-gardens. The inclusion of local knowledge in harvesting regulations might result in environmental norms accepted and internalized by the local population.",

In the 1955 Pharmacopoeia of India this plant is replaced by the allied species, D. odontoloma (Moore) C. Chr., D. marginata (Wall.) Christ, and D. schimperiana (Hochst.) C. Chr., and in the 1966 Pharmacopoeia of India by D. odontoloma, D. marginata, D. chrysocoma (Christ) C. Chr., D. ramosa (Hope) C. Chr., and D. barbigera (Hook.) Kuntze. Lycopodium clavatum is included in the Indian Pharmaceutical Codex (Mukerji, 1953) and in the proposed Indian Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia. Equisetum arvense L. is included in the U.S.S.R.

Dispersing spores widely and successfully is critical to establishing populations–both in terms of production and dispersal distance–yet literature with direct observation of these variables is scant. We double the number of studies directly observing dispersal in fern species by conducting spore trap experiments on Adiantum pedatum and Deparia acrostichoides, which grow together at a site in southeastern Ohio, U. S. A. In interpreting these results, we summarize the literature on spore production in ferns and examine the contribution of phylogenetic history to the variation in spore production across ferns. We corroborate findings that the vast majority of spores produced are dispersed within 2 m of the parent plant. Additionally, spore production in ferns varies widely between species but shows some phylogenetic conservatism and is correlated to frond area. We conclude that gametophyte (and sporophyte) establishment over distances greater than 3 m is governed by rare spore dispersal, but the sheer number of spores produced increases the probability of this event occurring and the establishment of sporophytes is likely dependent upon gametophytic traits. In ferns as a whole, differences in spore production are related to differences in frond area, but may also be related to overcoming genetic complications involved in long-distance dispersal.",

Drawing upon the availability of recently sequenced fern and lycophyte genomes we investigated these dynamics and placed them in the context of vascular plants. We found that similar to seed plants, median LTR-RT insertion times were strongly correlated with haploid nuclear genome size. Fern and lycophyte species with small genomes such as those of the heterosporous Selaginella and members of the Salviniaceae had recent median LTR-RT insertion times, whereas species with large genomes such as homosporous ferns had old median LTR-RT insertion times intermediate between angiosperms and gymnosperms.

For the past few years I have been engaged in cytological studies and experimental hybridization within the genus, involving both European and American material, in order to study the evolutionary processes and attempt to elucidate some of the taxonomic problems. The knowledge gained from an investigation of the Dryopteris spinulosa complex in Europe has already been published (Walker, 1955) ; stated briefly, this shows that in Europe there are three allotetraploid species, cristata (L.) A. Gray, spinulosa (0. F. Muell) Watt and dilatata (Hoffm.) A. Gray, together with two diploid forms of D. dilatata, one found in Britain and on the continent of Europe, the other in Madeira. These two diploids are very different in their division of the blades and in spore size, but studies of meiosis in experimental hybrids indicate that they are descendants of the same ancestral diploid, that which is common and part parental to both spinulosa and dilatata. A detailed report on the results obtained from a study of North American material of Dryopteris is in preparation for publication elsewhere, but perhaps the following will be of general interest to readers who have met with the taxonomic problems in this genus. Cytological investigation of cristata and spinulosa (typical) from the eastern United States shows that",

They traverse its length and are responsible for the principal types of vegetation, their distribution patterns, and for the richness and the diversity of the flora as well. The Altiplano is the high central land from 10,000 to 14,000 feet elevation. It may be rather flat although usually it is broadly rolling; where it is penetrated by valleys there is considerable relief. It is bordered, except in the north, by a broken chain of high mountains many of which rise to 18,000 feet or more and support permanent snow fields and glaciers. These highlands are relatively cool and dry and the vegetation consists of grasslands, sedgelands, semi-desert shrubs, and cacti. Locally small woods, especially of Polylepis, may be found. Above the limit of agriculture, at about 13,000 feet up to the limit of vascular plant life at about 17,000 feet, is the Puna where the cold prevails and low cushion plants are the principal botanical feature.",

    "abstract": "Ferns are a group of plants that illustrate many changes in taxonomic concepts which are useful in establishing systems of classification and in the delimiting of genera and species. Linnaean genera were distinguished on such gross morphological features as the shape, size, and placement of the sori. Later, stelar anatomy became an important criterion. Then such items as venation, origin of the sorus, indusium, development of the sporangium, scales, hairs, glands on the indusium, chromosome number, and, to a lesser extent, spore morphology were used to separate species. This is not a definitive paper on the use of spore morphology in fern taxonomy but rather an assessment of the role that may be attained by this much neglected field. concept of the structure and the terminology applied to different portions of the spore is quite varied. Douglas H. Campbell (1905) described spore structure as follows: The young spores are thin-walled, but later the wall becomes thicker and shows a division into two parts, an inner layer, which generally shows a cellulose reaction and is called the endospore (intine), and an outer more cuticularized coat, the exospore (exine). In addition, a third outer coat (perenium, epispore) is very generally present. Structurally, the spore consists of a protoplast, the living portion encased in a thin layer, the intine, which is surrounded by the exine. This in turn is generally enclosed by one or more layers which have been termed perispore, epispore, perine, or sclerine by various authors. There is no unanimity of usage among those interested in spore morphology. It was recognized early that differences in the number and orientation of cleavage planes gave rise to two types of spores from the spore mother cell, namely, the tetrahedral and bilateral spores. These were so named because, in the case of the former, three planes or faces were common to the proximal side of the spores tetrahedral or bilateral, and Coniogramme with spores 6",

    "abstract": "The viability of the spores of the Osmundaceae is considered to be of short duration, as seems to be the case generally with chlorophyll-bearing spores. Under ordinary conditions of keeping spores this is undoubtedly true; the viability is measured in days and weeks rather than in months and years, as may be the case with many spores without chlorophyll. However, Lagerberg' found that the spores of Osmunda regalis L. may be viable for two months; and Gerhardt2 gave the results of some tests made on spores of 0. regalis, but did not state the conditions under which the spores were kept. He found that the germination time increased with the age of the spores: spores three days old germinated in one day; 34 days old in four days; 130 days old in seven days; 150 days old in 20 days; and no germination in 225 days. In the early summer of 1947, when some plans for an extensive study of the gametophyte of the Osmundaceae required viable spores in the autumn, it seemed desirable to try to keep spores by the method of refrigeration which has been successful with pollen grains. To obtain a later collection than might be available to the author, fertile fronds of O. Claytoniana L. were sent June 12, 1947 by Dr. Hannah Croasdale, from Hanover, New Hampshire to Woods Hole, Massachusetts. They arrived in fresh condition wrapped in damp paper toweling and in a cardboard box; they were at once put into an electric refrigerator. Some fertile pinnules of 0. regalis collected",

    "abstract": "The genus Isoetes has long presented systematists with some difficult problems. Because of the morphological simplicity of the plants (apparently a derived rather than a primitive condition2) and the lack of constant and striking differences in outward form from species to species, taxonomic differentiation has, perforce, been based primarily on the configuration of the gynospore walls. Correlations of other characters have been mostly unsuccessful. An additional difficulty is that collections from many regions have been scanty, likely due to the inconspicuousness of the plants rather than to their rarity. In few parts of the world have the quillworts been more intensively collected and studied than in the northeastern United States; yet even here many entities remain poorly understood. With this in mind, the present attempt is made to reorganize the taxonomy of the Isoetes riparia complex, so as to bring out more clearly the natural relationships involved. Isoetes riparia and its apparent relatives are usually included in the somewhat arbitrary and artificial section Cristatae, characterized by crested rather than tuberculate, spiny, or reticulate gynospore-prominences. Within the section, sub-groups cannot be clearly differentiated, as there are exceptions to most separating criteria. Generally speaking, the I. riparia complex can be distinguished by the plants each having 2 corm-lobes (exception: I. riparia var. amesii); by an amphibious habitat with accompanying constant presence of stomata, which",

In 2011, another wet year, 63 aboveground plants were recorded. In the following two drought years, the number returned to zero and has remained low in subsequent years.

We used 500 m2 (50X10 m) plots, 10 each in primary forest, secondary forest, and abandoned pasture, to measure the density and species distribution of tree ferns. Abandoned pasture and secondary forest had approximately equal tree fern densities, with density in primary forest significantly lower. Species richness was highest in secondary forest due to the mixture of early and late successional species. Pasture and secondary forest habitats were dominated by Cyathea caracasana; higher diversity recorded in abandoned pasture is due to high relative abundances of two subordinate species: Lophosoria quadripinnata and Dicksonia sellowiana. Primary forest was dominated by a single species, Cyathea planadae, with very low relative abundance of the other species recorded. The dominance transition during regeneration appears to begin after approximately 20 years of re- growth, suggesting that the disturbance mosaic and the resulting environmental heterogeneity in Andean forests is important in maintaining species diversity in tree ferns. Two recommendations for conservation emerge: 1) Conservation of tree fern diversity depends on the maintenance of a variety of successional habitats within the forest; 2) Tree ferns are an important component of species that colonize abandoned open sites in Andean forests. Their rapid growth rate and pref- erence for open habitat suggest that some tree fern species may be useful in restoration strategies in cloud forests.",

Loxoscaphe nested firmly within the Aspleniaceae, and Actiniopteris was placed with Onychium in the Pteridaceae. To help resolve conflicting contemporary treatments that either subsume Loxoscaphe species within Asplenium or segregate them as an independent genus, the rbcL sequence of L. thecifera was subjected to a more focused analysis involving all rbcL sequences available to represent the taxonomic diversity of Aspleniaceae. Loxoscaphe thecifera was sister to Asplenium griffithianum prolongatum, robustly and surprisingly nested within the clade of Asplenium species recognized as Asplenium section Thamnopteris, a group accepted by some as the segregate genus Neottopteris. These results indicate that there is presently no phylogenetic justification for accepting Loxoscaphe as a genus independent of Asplenium. Similarly Actiniopteris radiata, recently moved from the cheilanthoid to the taenitidoid group of Pteridaceae, was subjected to a more focused analysis in the context of an expanded set of cheilanthoid and taenitidoid species that included the first use of an rbcL sequence from the genus Anogramma and newly sequenced species of Onychium and Pteris. Actiniopteris is robustly grouped with two Onychium species in a clade sister to traditional taenitidoids and deeply separated from the cheilanthoids, supporting affinities previously suggested by spore morphology.",

The family includes no more than 400–500 living species but the group has evolved as an isolated lineage since the Early Devonian (390 Mya). Despite this ancient history, patterns emerging through the phylogenetic analyses imply that most diversification in this group is comparatively recent. The Lower Jurassic stem section Lycoxylon indicum indicates a minimum age for the split between Lycopodium and Lycopodiella at 208 Mya, and reticulate fossil spores from the Early Jurassic indicate that early cladogenesis in Lycopodium is of equivalent age. In the diverse predominantly epiphytic Huperzia group, biogeographic data indicates that 85–90 % of all living species result from cladogenic events postdating the final rifting of S. America and Africa in Mid to Late Cretaceous. The timing of these events coincides with the radiation of Angiosperms, and the diversification of epiphytic Huperzia was likely mediated by the development of broad leaved Angiosperm rain forests. Results indicate a single origin of epiphytism in Huperzia, but there have been at least two reversals to the terrestrial habit in the neotropics. The diversification of a large secondarily terrestrial clade, including about 80 montane high altitude species, was likely triggered by the Andean orogeny in the Mid Miocene, no more than 15 Mya.",

    "abstract": "Within the genus Trichomanes s.l., there exists a great diversity of gametophyte forms, none of which resemble the classical heart-shape of most ferns. Perhaps the strangest of these are the entirely filamentous forms found in subgenera Trichomanes, Didymoglossum, and others. In gross morphology, these gametophytes resemble the proteonema of bryophytes of some highly branched forms of filamentous algae. In fact, the earliest description of free-living Trichomanes gametophytes in the U.S. was by F. Wolle in his 1887 text Fresh Water Algae of North America. Wolle recognized the plants as probably a prothallus of a fern by the presence of numerous chloroplasts per uninucleate cell, short unicellular rhizoids, gemmifers, and gemmae. This combination of characters distinguishes sterile Trichomanes gametophytes of the filamentous type from both bryophytes and filamentous algae. Vegetative reproduction by gemmae, along with indeterminanat growth and branching of the thallus, allows gametophyte colonies of Trichomanes to persist indefinitely without intervention of the sporophyte generation. In 1963, Wagner and Sharp reported the existence of large colonies of independent Trichomanes gametophytes in sandstone canyons in southern Illinois. They assumed the gametophytes to be those of Trichomanes boschianum Sturm ex Bosch., the sporophytes of which occur sporadically in-southern Illinois and across the southeastern U.S. Subsequent investigations (Farrar, 1967, 1985; Farrar et al., 1981) revealed the presence of independent Trichomanes gametophytes throughout the eastern U.S., wherever extensive outcroppings of non-calcareous bedrock occur. Once recognized, these plants proved to be abundant and predictable elements of the flora of dark moist cliffs, often forming dense felt-like mats of 100 cm2 or more (Fig. 1). In their northeasternmost known station in central Vermont, Trichomanes gametophytes are approximately 1000 km from the nearest known site for sporophytes of T. boschianum and 1300 km from the nearest known site for T. petersii A. Gray. These are the only U.S. species of Trichomanes with temperate distributions of sporophyte plants. Although morphologically similar to the gametophytes of both of these species, independent gametophytes well removed from the the vicinity of either sporophyte are quite distinct from them genetically as shown by enzyme electrophoresis, sharing only 1 of 13",

Species appear to have evolved by divergence and allopolyploidy. The basic diploids I. hypsophila, I. taiwanensis, and I. yunguiensis and the tetraploid I. sinensis occur in China. Analysis of ITS sequences indicates that the Chinese Isoëtes species are part of an Australasian clade including I. brevicula from Western Australia and I. kirkii from New Zealand. Two distinct cloned sequences of the second intron of a LEAFY homolog were recovered from I. sinensis supporting the hypothesis that I. sinensis is an allotetraploid. One of the I. sinensis cloned sequences was similar to the I. taiwanensis sequence and the other cloned sequence was similar to the I. yunguiensis sequence identifying I. taiwanensis and I. yunguiensis as the likely parents of I. sinensis. Other cloned sequences recovered from I. sinensis were recombined parts of the two distinct sequences. Morphological evidence supporting an allotetraploid origin of I. sinensis is found in its larger microspore size and intermediate megaspore texture compared to I. taiwanensis, and I. yunguiensis.",

    "abstract": "Information about fern spore banks is restricted to the soil systems. As the dispersion of spores occurs by means of air, it is possible to have viable spores on tree bark. Thus, it is important to know if on this kind of substrate, which is thinner and apparently more susceptible to desiccation than the soil, the spores can survive for any length of time, forming transient or persistent spore banks. Samples of bark were collected from ten angiosperm trees in March 1997 and from fifteen trees in February and September 1998. The samples collected in March 1997 contained from 0.05 to 7.19 gametophytes cm−2 of cultured bark, those of February 1998 from 0.11 to 4.22 gametophytes cm−2, and in September 1998 from 0.32 to 5.0 gametophytes per square cm. Although the cerrado region is characterized by climatic seasonality, this seasonality was not observed in relation to number of viable spores on barks. As a consequence of the casual spore dispersion pattern, the bark spore bank has a random distribution among the trunks. Ten species were identified on barks collected in February 1998 and fifteen in September 1998, one of them epiphytic (Phlebodium areolatum (Humb. & Bonpl. ex Willd.) J. Sm.) and the others terrestrial species. Thelypteris was the most frequent genus in the analyzed samples. The results obtained show the potential for these substrates to retain viable spores that can participate in the regeneration process and population dynamics of the pteridophyte flora. Moreover, the existence of viable spores of terrestrial species on tree bark does not answer an important question—why do terrestrial species not establish themselves on trees?",

    "abstract": "The southern Mexican Volcan Chichonal, otherwise known as El Chichon, (17020'N, 93?12'W) erupted violently on 28 March 1982 at 2330 (local time), sending a column of ash and sulfur aerosol 16.8 km into the atmosphere. Further intermittent activity culminated in two major explosive eruptions on 3 April (1930 local time) and 4 April 1982 (0530 local time). During the final eruptions, column collapse gave rise to three major pyroclastic surges and flows that devastated 154 km2 of paratropical rain forest (sensu Wolfe, 1979) and agricultural land (Fig. 1). More complete descriptions of the eruptions are to be found in Varekamp et al. (1982), SEAN Bulletin (1982), Duffield et al. (1984) and Sigurdsson et al. (1985). The pre-eruption vegetation of the area consisted of a patchwork of secondgrowth rain forest and local crops, which included cocoa, bananas, coffee, and maize. Numerous epiphytic pteridophytes were to be found in the area, with Selaginella aff. schizobasis Bak. (Burnham 001, BM, MEXU), Blechnum occidentale L. (Burnham 09, BM, MEXU), and Pteris grandifolia L. (Burnham 065, BM, MEXU) as frequent components of the ground cover. The eruptions produced no lava flows, but trachyandesitic air-fall ash and pyroclastic surges and flows inundated a roughly circular area within a radius of approximately 6 km from the crater. The nature of the volcaniclastic deposits is described in detail in Sigurdsson et al. (1985). A particular feature of the eruptions was the large amount of sulfur ejected into the atmosphere (Thomas, 1982; Mroz & Sedlacek, 1982; Rampino & Self, 1984) and in the tephra (Varekamp & Luhr, 1982; Luhr et al., 1982). Chemical analyses of the tephra are given in Hoffer et al. (1982) and Cocheme and Demant (1983). High local annual precipitation (>200 cm) (Rzedowski, 1983) subsequently produced numerous erosional gulleys that have cut down, in some cases through several meters of volcanic debris, to the 1982 pre-eruption soil horizon. In February 1984 we spent four weeks in the Chichonal area. The purpose of our visit was to study the formation of potential plant fossil deposits associated",

Then, Copeland (1956) included some members of Pecluma in a generic treatment of the Grammitid Ctenopteris. That provided the impetus for three papers which supplied evidence that Pecluma species indeed belonged with Polypodium (Stokey, 1959; Wilson, 1959; Sota, 1963). A later revision of the individual species by Evans (1969) has facilitated a new examination of the relationships of the group, and I have come to the conclusion that those authors who reaffirmed an alliance with Polypodium are correct, but that Copeland's error may be partly excused on the grounds that Pecluma also has many features reflecting a shared ancestry with Ctenopteris, features that mark it as abundantly distinct from Polypodium. The most conspicuous of these differences from Polypodium are: rhizomes short and non-branching, paleae basally attached, axes terete, and fronds pectinate. From Ctenopteris, diagnostic differences are: spores neither trilete nor green, hairs never acicular from a broad base and not dark maroon, and stipes articulate. These and other characters are detailed below.",

    "abstract": "Since the genus Botrychium was last revised (Clausen, 1938), much research on it has been done, and many of our taxonomic ideas concerning the use of infraspecific categories (subspecies, variety, form) have changed (Wagner, 1960). Many Botrychium species can be distinguished only by subtle differences, and there is often high level of variability, even in single populations. In the little Moonworts, Botrychium subg. Botrychium, taxonomic difficulties are exacerbated by the small size of the plants and the tendency for the segments to become folded when pressed. To gain an idea of the distinctness of the species, careful field studies of sizeable populations are needed, and the specimens must be pressed so as to spread out the segments. Finding these usually rare and local plants requires a labor of love. Together with colleagues and students, we have spent an extaordinary amount of time exploring for Moonworts over the past several decades. Some of the fruits of this quest are described here. In making our taxonomic judgments, we have adhered to strict requirement of consistency. Plants from one locality to another must display the same characteristics. Likewise, the differences from other species must be consistent; there should be no connecting forms. We have emphasized the ability of two critical taxa to occur together in the same habitats without intergrading. Mixed populations have thus been of value in making decisions. We also have used the method of mutual associations-the ability of two taxa to maintain their differences in their separate habitats, even though their mutually associated relatives stay alike. Thus if taxon A grows with taxon C in one habitat, and taxon B grows with C in another, and if taxon C remains uniform in both habitats, then the differences between A and B are probably genetically fixed. The four new Moonworts described here have been studied in wild populations, and in all cases the evidence upholds their validity as discrete species. We treat each only briefly, but we hope that the description and comments will give other workers preliminary idea of their distinctions and also will lead to finding new populations. More detailed reports on all of these plants will be made in the future. The measurements are based upon the best-developed and most distinctive specimens from each of several collections. Small specimens may be hard to identify, and all of these species include tiny fertile individuals less than 3 cm tall. Spores were mounted in Hoyer's solution (Beeks, 1955) and measured along the largest diameter. The ranges represent the averages of several different collections.",

In this study, typical AM structures were observed in sporophytes of L. paniculatum and E. bogotense. The percentage of root length colonized by AM fungi ranged from 0 to 50% in the first species and from 0 to 22.5% in E. bogotense. Both species were facultative mycorrhizal and it was observed that the habitat and substrate seem to play an important role in determining the colonization intensity.

    "abstract": "The need for ecological data on ferns is becoming increasingly apparent as more effort is directed toward an understanding of the significance of their morphological and physiological diversity (Wagner, 1973). If detailed ecological studies of fern sporophytes have to date been too few, such studies on the gametophyte generation are almost non-existent. The reproductive cycle of ferns has been known for over a century, and more than a thousand articles on fern gametophytes have been published, half of these in the last quarter century (Miller, 1968; Nif, 1975; Nayar & Kaur, 1971). However, nearly all data on gametophyte growth and sexual reproduction have been based on laboratory observations. Several factors have contributed to this paucity of information on gametophyte ecology, but perhaps the most important has been a widely held notion that gametophytes cannot be found in nature, or if found, cannot be identified. Several recent studies have indicated to the contrary, that in situ gametophyte studies not only are feasible, but that they are essential for the integration of existing laboratory data into studies on the natural history of ferns (Cousens, 1973; Holbrook-Walker & Lloyd, 1973; Lloyd, 1974; Farrar & Gooch, 1975). To investigate further the feasibility of studying fern gametophytes in nature, we have begun a long-term observational study of fern reproduction in Woodman Hollow, a relatively isolated canyon in central Iowa, in which 13 species and 11 genera of ferns occur (see Table 1). This study is designed to answer the following questions. When are spores available for germination? When and where does reproduction occur and how is it influenced by microand macroclimates? When and by what breeding systems are sporophytes produced? Does sexual reproduction occur in nature on a regular basis for all species? Results of the first year of study (Farrar & Gooch, 1975) indicate that the data needed to answer these and other questions will be forthcoming. Here we report some unexpected data relevant to the question of when spores are available for germination. Observations made on the time of spore maturation and first release during the growing season gave results which were similar to those of Hill and Wagner (1974) for pteridophytes in Michigan. Differences found in the two studies were no greater than might be expected due to differences in latitude, climate, habitat, and seasonal variation. Our observations also support their estimate that most spores of a given species are released during a period of about two weeks. However, a two week period of maximum release, if taken as a guide to the duration of spore release, may be very misleading. Our observations at Woodman Hollow indicate that for most species, significant quantities of spores are retained on the fronds after the initial release period and may be dispersed during a much longer period. Only in Botrychium virginianum and Osmunda claytoniana were essentially all",

Wilce seems to have given the most attention to periodicity, for she says, arborescent and usually tufted species, determination of the age of the main upright axis is a simple matter of counting the number of seasonal 'leaf rings.' These mark the retardation or cessation of growth at the end of each season; with their small, crowded leaves, they might be compared to an angiosperm bud, but with the difference that the leaves of the lycopodiaceous 'bud' are persistent. (However, she did not report observing annual leaf rings on the rhizome of L. flabelliforme.) Colonies of five species of Lycopodium (L. lucidulum Michx., L. annotinum L., L. flabelliforme (Fern.) Blanch., L. clavatum L., and L. obscurum L.) growing at the Harvard Forest, Petersham, in central Massachusetts, were examined to determine their growth patterns and growth rates. Descriptions of the arrangement of the aerial shoots and rhizomes were made in the field. Measurements of annual growth of the aerial shoots and rhizomes were made in the laboratory on fresh specimens brought in from the field. The annual growth of the rhizomes of L. flabelliforme, L. clavatum, and L. annotinum was determined by locating the distinct microphyll compressions on the rhizome where the rhizome tip slowed down and then ceased growing in the fall and winter. Annual growth of aerial shoots can be determined in all species by noting the microphyll compressions on the shoot and branchlet axes. My observation that there are annual, externally visible microphyll compressions on the rhizomes of L. annotinum, L. clavatum, and L. flabelliforme, seems to be an original one. In L. annotinum the actively growing rhizome has straight microphylls, which are 5 mm long and 0.8 mm wide, spaced 13 mm apart. In late fall, the curved microphylls, which are about 7 mm long and 0.7 mm wide, are spaced 5 mm apart. In L. clavatum the actively growing rhizome has microphylls which are about 4 mm long and 0.8 mm wide at the base, spaced about 8 mm apart. In late fall the microphylls, which become longer and narrower (to 8 mm long and 0.5 mm wide), are spaced about 1.5 mm apart. In L. flabelliforme the shape of the microphylls does not change, but during active growth the rhizome microphylls are about 16 mm apart, whereas they are only 2 mm apart toward the end of the season. Lycopodium annotinum, L. clavatum, and L. flabelliforme have well-differentiated strobili and grow by a superficial rhizome just below the litter. Lycopodium annotinum has a sessile strobilus and leaves with aristate tips. Lycopodium",

It is evident from the studies by Iversen (1928a,b) that several of the characters used for the separation of many of these taxa are taxonomically doubtful, and there is reason to believe that a few are only occasional edaphic modifications. Some are evidently good races which ought to be treated at the varietal or subspecific level, whereas still others are undoubtedly very good species.

I quote from his reply:  Thank you for your offer of plants of Scolopendrium, but I think you need not send me any of them. As far as I know there are no outcrops of limestone around here, though plenty in the Baltimore region. Another reason, if you can forgive me for saying it, is that I long ago came to the conclusion that it is a bad practice to upset our successors by introducing plants in a region far outside their natural range. In 1902 I had a lot of plants of Polystichum Braunii, and put some of them in selected spots. Later when my botanical conscience got to work after somebody had expressed the same opinion as that in the preceding sentence, I went the rounds to remove all of the introduced plants.

These ranges are similar to those of the states to the north and are fully equal in scenic effects to those of Colorado, so familiar to tourists. Some of the mountains of southern New Mexico, by reason of their precipitous, naked slopes, exhibit beauties of coloration which are unknown farther north. In the more elevated ranges in midsummer the climate is nearly ideal, although at altitudes of only 7500 to 8500 feet the temperature is often uncomfortably low. The highest peaks reach an elevation of slightly less than 14,000 feet, but scores of others, even near the Mexican and Texan border, are well above 10,000 feet.",

The lower or southern division can be considered as a vast plain of great uniformity in its general features; gently undulating where the loose sedimentary strata of the Post-tertiary formation prevail, and broken .where the cherty ridges of the Tertiary and Cretaceious rocks offer greater resistance to erosion by water. The altitude of the State begins at sea level in the extreme south and rises gradually until more than 2000 ft. is reached in the northern part of the State. The flora of Alabama is unsurpassed by any of the surrounding states, with the possible exception of North Carolina, having about 5000 species and varieties recorded to its credit.

    "abstract": "-The abundance of viable fern spores in the forest floor of undisturbed central Pennsylvania mixed oak stands was assessed at various distances from hay-scented fern (Dennstaedtia punctilobula) spore sources before and after seasonal spore dispersal. Intact soil samples were collected at distances up to 50 m from large, reproductive fern communities and placed in a greenhouse to induce spore germination. Spore abundance was estimated by counting the number of gametophytes that germinated in the top 1 cm of samples. Hay-scented fern was the predominant or only fern species present on sites. Hay-scented fern has cordate, naked (glabrous) prothalli. Fewer than ten hairy (trichomatous) prothalli were germinated in all samples and only glabrous prothalli were counted. Sixty other samples collected from sites in the pre-dispersal season were allowed to grow for one year. Only one sample produced a sporeling that was not hay-scented fern. The majority of prothalli that developed were most likely hay-scented fern. Large numbers of viable hay-scented fern spores were found at all sample locations. Viable spores occurred in 98% of the samples, and site estimates varied from 7 to 15 viable spores cm-2 during the preand post-dispersal trials. Viable spores occurred at all distances within 50 m, the greatest distance sampled, from all sources. Highest abundance of spores always occurred within 4 m of the source and generally declined with increasing distance from a source. These data indicate that hayscented fern spores remain viable for at least one year, and the potential exists for the establishment of hay-scented fern from a viable spore bank in central Pennsylvania mixed oak or hardwood stands. Hay-scented fern (Dennstaedtia punctilobula (Michx.) Moore; Dennstaedtiaceae) is a common forest understory species in the northeastern United States and eastern Canada (Cody et al., 1977). In Pennsylvania, hay-scented fern is considered a forest weed, because it interferes with the regeneration of Allegheny hardwood and mixed oak stands (Bowersox and McCormick, 1987; Horsley, 1988, 1993; Horsley and Marquis, 1983). Dense, highly competitive colonies of hay-scented fern capable of excluding most other vegetation often become established in forest areas following harvesting or natural disturbances (Allen and Bowersox, 1989; Hall, 1955; Kolb et al., 1990). An inventory of Pennsylvania's forests completed in 1989 found that 30% of the areas sampled had sufficient fern cover to inhibit the establishment of hardwood regeneration (McWilliams et al., 1993). Recent studies have emphasized the importance of sporebanks in the colonization of sites by ferns (Dyer and Lindsay, 1992; Hamilton, 1988; Schneller, 1988). Under favorable conditions, spores of hay-scented fern can germinate to form prothalli (gametophytes) capable of reproducing sexually and produc1 Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

Once established, the sporophyte spreads aggressively from an underground rhizome (Anderson and Egler, 1988; Horsley, 1984). Soil disturbances associated with timber harvesting facilitate the establishment of hay-scented fern by creating favorable microhabitats for spore germination (Groninger and McCormick, 1992). Establishment of spore-origin hay-scented ferns occurs commonly on moist, exposed mineral soil or moss colonies along exposed banks of skid trails, in drainages, and on root mounds of trees overturned by wind, road construction or tree felling (Groninger and McCormick, 1992; Horsley, 1988). Because spore-origin hay-scented fern often contributes to the colonization of forest stands and subsequently interferes with hardwood regeneration (McCormick et al., 1992), it is useful to have an understanding of the spore bank, spore viability, and spore distribution of hay-scented fern. This study was designed to determine whether viable spores of hay-scented fern exist in the soil of undisturbed mixed oak stands of central Pennsylvania and to quantify the abundance of viable spores in stands adjacent to large, well-established populations of hay-scented fern relative to distance from a spore source. Abundance of viable spores was measured by counting the number of gametophytes that developed in soil samples collected from forest stands before and after spore dispersal. Fern species differ in the ability of their gametophytes and young sporophytes to persist and become established on sites (Peck et al., 1990). Although spore abundance cannot directly indicate future establishment of the species, the presence of a viable spore bank dormant in the soil infers a potential of these spores to further colonize stands. This is particularly true when stands are cut or otherwise disturbed and conditions are favorable for spore germination and sporeling survival. METHODS AND MATERIALS STUDY SITES.-The study was conducted at two forest sites in central and south central Pennsylvania. One site (Tram Road) was located in the Rothrock State Forest and the other site (Clear Shade) was located in the Gallitzin State Forest. Two plots were established at each site and were identified as TR1 and TR2 at Tram Road and as CS1 and CS2 at Clear Shade. Each plot was established adjacent to a reproductive population of hay-scented fern. The fern populations occurred along roadsides or in clearcut areas adjacent to undisturbed hardwood stands with little or no fern invasion. The Tram Road site was located along a southeastern facing side slope in the Ridge and Valley Province at an elevation of 365 m. The site was occupied by an 80 year-old, undisturbed, mixed oak stand with an average stand density of 20 m2/ha. Overstory species included northern red and white oaks (Quercus rubra and Q. alba), hickory (Carya spp.), yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), red maple (Acer rubrum), and white pine (Pinus strobus). Woody understory species included red maple, yellow birch, white pine, witch hazel (Hamamelis virginiana), and blueberry (Vaccinium spp.). The ground layer included woodland herbaceous plants, grasses, mosses and lichens.

Soils at the site were well to moderately drained, silt to sandy loams derived from sandstone, siltstone, and shale parent material (Hazleton-Laidig-Buchanan association) (Merkle et al., 1978). At Tram Road, one plot (TR1) was located in a hardwood stand directly adjacent to a hay-scented fern-dominated clearcut. The second plot at Tram Road (TR2) was located several hundred meters from TR1 along a road rightof-way adjacent to a 7 m wide and 60 m long patch of hay-scented fern. No other fern species was observed in the source patch at TR2. Scattered patches of New York fern occurred at TR2 in forest gaps at 25-50 m from the source. No other fern species was present and there was no invasion by any ferns beyond the source at TR1. The Clear Shade site was on a ridge top on the Allegheny Plateau at an elevation of 730 m. The site was occupied by an 80 year-old, undisturbed, mixed oak stand with an average stand density of 24 m2/ha. Overstory species included northern red oak, white oak, beech (Fagus grandifolia), yellow birch, sweet or black birch (Betula lenta), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), and red maple. Woody understory species included striped maple (A. pensylvanicum) and beech. The ground layer included ground pines (Lycopodium spp.), herbaceous woodland plants, grasses, mosses, lichens, and small populations of ferns. Soils at the site were well to moderately-well drained, silt to sandy loams derived from sandstone parent material (Hazelton-Cookport association) (Yaworski et al., 1983). At Clear Shade, the two plots (CS1, CS2) were located on opposite sides of an improved dirt road with a 3-4 m wide strip of hay-scented fern growing along both sides of the road. Hay-scented fern was the predominant fern species at the site with minor amounts of New York fern and wood ferns (Dryopteris spp.). Scattered patches of hay-scented fern or woodfern at CS1 and CS2 occurred in forest gaps at 25-50 m from the fern sources. At CS2, heavier invasion by ferns occurred where stands were thinned at 50-200 m from the",

    "abstract": "A significant portion of the stages of the life history of Botrychium, the gametophyte and juvenile sporophytes, are spent belowground. Surveys were conducted to determine the distribution and abundance of belowground gametophytes, juvenile sporophytes and gemmae of eight species of Botrychium. For each species, soil samples were collected in a 200 m2 area, sifted through a series of soil sieves, and centrifuged to separate the lighter plant material. Only 40% of the soil samples contained belowground structures revealing a patchy distribution. The gametophytes of B. montanum are most dense, followed by B. mormo with 738 and 728 gametophytes m−2 respectively. Botrychium hesperium also has a relatively high density of 478 gametophytes m−2. Botrychium gallicomontanum is the least dense with 10 gametophytes m−2. Botrychium campestre and B. gallicomontanum both have abundant gemmae and few gametophytes. The density of individuals in the belowground structure bank greatly exceeds the aboveground population. The size and health of the belowground structure bank is critical in sustaining the long-term aboveground population and in buffering it from extinction.",

    "abstract": "Cyathea caracasana is a common open-habitat tree fern in the Andes of Colombia.In full sun, stem growth rates are high (up to 2 cm/month) and individuals regularly produce spores.However, even the fastest growing ferns are overtopped by woody angiosperms after 10 to 15 years of natural forest regeneration.As individuals are overtopped, C. caracasana produces nearly vertical fronds with long stipes (commonly over 3 m] apparently to place the photosynthetic surface into the canopy.We compared stipe length and blade length and width among individuals growing in open sites and in the understories of two regenerating forests: one with a canopy of 20-25 m, and one with a canopy of 5-8 m.Stipes and blades were shortest in open habitat and longest in the low-canopy forest.Ferns in the high-canopy forest had intermediate measurements.Despite the change in frond length, the number of primary pinnae per-frond did not differ among the habitats sampled.This suggests that elongation cues are received late in the development of the frond.This conclusion is supported by a positive relationship between stipe length and the distance of the fern meristem below the canopy.Because both understory populations show stipe elongation relative to open-hapitat ferns, the cue to elongate is likely a low red/far-red wavelength ratio of the light received by the apical meristem.Extraordinary elongation is probably made possible by extra carbon resources available to low-canopy plants, which still have leaves in full sun.This sense and response mechanism allows individual plants to produce elongated fronds as their apical meristems are overtopped.Functionally, the long-stiped plants remain in full sun even after they are overtopped, thus they \"track\" their preferred, open habitat.Plant populations respond to environmental variation in several ways.When the environment fluctuates infrequently relative to the life span of individuals, adaptive segregation may produce differential response to environmental cues among separate populations.Consider variation in light environment.Sunadapted populations of Impatiens capensis L. showed enhanced growth in response to changes in the ratio of red (600-700 nm) to far-red (700-850 nm) light relative to shade-adapted populations (Dudley and Schmitt, 1995).Similar sun/shade segregation in growth response to red/far-red (R/FR) has heen observed in many angiosperm species in open [as compared to understory) communities (Morgan and Smith, 1979).In contrast, when the environment varies frequently relative to the life span of individuals, adaptive segregation cannot occur and individuals must rely on morphological and physiological flexibility (plasticity) (Thompson, 1991;Sultan, 1993;Ackerly and Bazzaz, 1995;Arens, 1997).In such cases, plants may change form or physiology to suit new conditions, for example switching from sun-leaf to shade-leaf anatomy (Arens, 1997).Alternatively, individuals *'track\" or follow their preferred habitat as it moves.Conventionally, habitat-tracking in plants has been applied to intergenerationa! migration (Davis et al.,",

The independent gametophytes of ferns and their morphological simplicity have enabled us to use them as experimental objects in certain areas of plant growth and development. However, viability of spores of different ferns varies enormously with periods ranging from a few days to a few years (cf. Miller, 1968). Spores deteriorate during storage as revealed by reduction in their germination percentage (Conway, 1949; Stone, 1961; Klekowski, 1970; Bir & Goyal, 1981) and in the pace of gametophyte development after germination (Towill & Ikuma, 1975). The changes during spore germination involve mostly the breakdown of storage reserves present in the spores. The studies on the loss in viability of spores during storage are not well documented. The aim of the present investigation is to determine the physiological and biochemical changes that take place in spores during storage. Results on spore germination, protonemal development and biochemical changes during germination of spores of Pteris vittata L., a fern common on the Indian subcontinent, are presented here.",

Our results suggested that for generally inferring mating systems operating in nature, agar-based laboratory studies of gametophytes lead to the same conclusions as would observations of field-collected gametophytes.

Jeffrey and Hicks (1925) and Jeffrey (1937) attributed variation in size and shape of megaspores, lack of protoplasmic content in microspores, and lagging chromosomes during microsporogenesis to hybridization in Isoetes from Nova Scotia. Boom (1980) artificially crossed several Isoetes species. Subsequently, he proposed six interspecific hybrids from southeastern United States (Boom, 1982). However, Kott and Britton (1983) believed that there was insufficient evidence to support interspecific hybridization in northeastern North American Isoetes, and that either ethological or sterility barriers exist among most taxa. Data are presented here to document the natural occurrence of an interspecific hybrid in Isoetes. Hybrids between Isoetes echinospora and I. macrospora were discovered in Neva Lake, Langlade County, Wisconsin. These plants possess megaspores that are more variable in size, shape, and surface ornamentation than typical megaspores of I. echinospora and I. macrospora. The origin of I. echinospora x macrospora is supported by evidence from spore morphology and viability, chromosome counts made from root tip squashes, and electrophoresis of leaf enzymes.",

For our first experiment, plants from high light roadsides were collected and subjected to artificial scale removal and then exposed to super-saturating pulse of light for 30 min. We found that leaves with their scales removed exhibited significantly greater photoinhibition than leaves with scales intact. Leaves with intact scales recovered fully after twelve hours whereas those with scales removed remained photoinhibited. Scale density on the adaxial side of leaves was positively correlated with light intensity.

The fertile veinlets are only irregularly prolonged and fused with the next distal sterile veinlet. The largest plants of Z. longipilosa exhibit a similar venation pattern, but the smaller plants show only irregular fusion of the sterile veinlets, as is the case of the smallest plants of Z. mathewsii. The species with veins most regularly free are Z. dudleyi and Z. eminens. However, in these the sterile veinlets are often forked and irregular, and marginal fusion is not uncommon. Irregular anastamoses are seen in various species of Ceradenia subg. Filicipecten. The most common type involves the connivence of a shortly prolonged fertile veinlet with the sterile fork of the same vein. Costal areolation formed by the fertile veinlet's fusion with the next distal sterile veinlet or the marginal connivence of sterile veinlets is quite rare. Except at the very base of the pinnae of certain species, even the sterile veinlets are rarely forked distally. It is of note that Z. werffii and large examples of Z. longipilosa, both usually with intramarginal veins, are smaller than larger examples of Ceradenia, so that the argument that areolation in these ferns is a direct response to larger size is vitiated.

Specimens and DNA samples were not available for Cerosora and Nephopteris, so they were excluded. Three species were chosen as outgroups: Pteris multifida, P. quadriaurita, and Coniogramme fraxinea, all of which are restricted to the Old World. A robust phylogeny was generated based on 26 morphological characters, 578 base pairs of the plastid gene rps4 and partial data from the intergenic spacer rps4-trnS. The results reject the hypothesis of monophyly of the subfamily as presented by Tryon et al. (1990).

    "abstract": "Probably no group of modern ferns or fern-like plants as poorly understood as the Ophioglossales. Interpretations of the fertile segment (sporophore) and the unusual stele (eustele?) have troubled botanists for many years. Even the relationships of the order as a whole are in doubt. At the genus and species level, there has been little agreement, and the taxonomy still up in the air. E. P. St. John (1949) grappled with some of these problems and gave a theory to explain them, based upon the subterranean gametophyte, which he believed inhibits hybridization and outcrossing. He stated that hybridization, or even cross-breeding within the species, almost impossible and that as a result, the species tend to be very widely distributed. One of the outstanding peculiarities of this group of plants, he wrote, is that while they are of world-wide distribution the number of species very small. Local endemics may be geographic variants of other species. According to St. John, the species of the Ophioglossaceae are closely related, and the course of evolution usually indicated by transitional and juvenile forms. Through selfing of the subterranean gametophytes a trivial variation may form a colony, and such divergent forms might persist so long as they meet minimum requirements for survival. Now, over a third of a century after St. John's interesting proposals, we question a number of his points on the basis of many new data. We find no evidence that subterranean gametophytes inhibit hybridization and outcrossing. Indeed, 17 hybrids are known in Lycopodium, 1 in Psilotum, and 12 in Botrychium (Wagner et al., 1985) plus two additional Botrychium hybrids described belowall taxa with subterranean gametophytes. The idea that the species of Ophioglossales are generally widely distributed not supported by the data; only a few have truly broad distributions, such as Botrychium lunaria, B. virginianum, and Ophioglossum nudicaule. Most species have narrow ranges, e.g. B. subbifoliatum, endemic to Hawaii, B. lunarioides, southeastern United States, B. oneidense, northeastern North America, B. echo, southwestern United States. The true ranges were obscured by the crude taxonomies of a third of a century ago. Botrychium boreale became much delimited geographically when it was found that the Pacific Northwest plant so-named belongs to another species, B. pinnatum. We used to believe that B. ternatum occurred both in Asia and in North America, but we now know that the American plant a distinct species, B. rugulosum, a narrow endemic, known only in the Great Lakes region from Montreal to Minnesota (Wagner & Wagner, 1982). It not true that members of the Ophioglossales lack diversity. St. John mentions Helminthostachys and Cheiroglossa as distinctive genera, but what about such distinctive elements within genera as Ophioglossum bergianum or 0. pen-",

    "abstract": "One of Carl Christensen's many important contributions to fern taxonomy was demonstrating that Dryopteris, as defined around the turn of the century, was a vast, unrelated assemblage of ferns (Christensen, 1913, 1920). He indicated this diversity by dividing Dryopteris into 11 subgenera, using characters such as pinnule arrangement, hair type, and scale type that were not widely employed or appreciated by his predecessors and contemporaries. Ever since his work on Dryopteris, the trend has been to raise Christensen's subgenera to the generic rank or to treat them as subgenera in genera other than Dryopteris. In some cases, even his informal species groups have received generic status. This paper deals with one such grouping: the D. subincisa group of Dryopteris subg. Ctenitis. Nowadays, all pteridologists recognize Christensen's subgenus Ctenitis as a distinct genus, Ctenitis. Within Ctenitis s.l., one of Christensen's informal groups, comprising the species allied to Ctenitis protensa, was recently established as the genus Triplophylium by Holttum (1986a). He provided evidence that Triplophyllum is more closely allied to Tectaria than to Ctenitis. Another informal group, that of Dryopteris subincisa, was made a section of Ctenitis by Tindale (1965) and a genus by Holttum (1986b), as Megalastrum. We agree with Holttum that Megalastrum deserves generic status, as it is phenetically and cladistically distinct from Ctenitis. Furthermore, we are not aware of any species that is ambiguous with regard to placement in either Megalastrum or Ctenitis.",

Interspecific variation of plant size and biogeographic range of the fern species are not related to herbivore damage. Insects may perhaps attack fewer ferns than angiosperms, but there is no evidence that ferns are generally less damaged than angiosperms.",

    "abstract": "Since Fankhauser's discovery of Lycopodium annotinum gametophytes in 1873, the sexual plants of Lycopodium have been sought repeatedly, and yet they remained elusive. There are now only 27 species for which gametophytes (19 subterranean, 8 surficial) have been found, representing fewer than 7% of the species. The continuing rarity of gametophytes cannot be attributed to a lack of searchers in temperate areas, although since most club-mosses are tropical it does point in part to the geographical separation between most botanists and most species of Lycopodium. But the gametophytes of even such common temperate species as L. tristachyum, L. digitatum, L. appressum, as well as those of the less common North American plants such as L. porophilum an L. prostratum, either never have been described or have been described so poorly as to render discussion almost meaningless. This lack of knowledge is due partly to the infrequent occurrence of the gametophytes and further to the fact that the more frequently encountered temperate species have subterranean gametophytes. Detection of the latter is dependent upon finding attached emergent sporophytes (Fig. 2). That they can be found and sometimes even in great numbers is amply illustrated by Spessard (1922) and Eames (1942). In this paper we report finding a community of nearly 500 gametophytes in a Jack Pine plantation in Michigan representing five (or possibly six) species of Lycopodium: L. annotinum, L. clavatum, L. digitatum, L. lucidulum, and L. obscurum. Lycopodium dendroideum also may be present but is apparently indistinguishable gametophytically from L. obscurum. A key to these species is given below. Lycopodium digitatum has not been reported from nature previously (Wilce, 1965; Bruce, 1976) and its naturally occurring gametophytes are described here for the first time. Whittier (1977) has reported gametophytes of this species from culture.",

    "abstract": "The quillworts, Isoetes (Lycopsida, Isoetales), constitute a heterosporous family of about 60 species recognized by botanists since the time of Linnaeus as having fleshy, two-, three- or four-lobed corms with a crown of spirally arranged, ligulate microphylls and numerous dichotomizing roots that emerge in series along the median furrow(s) of the corm. Vertical stem growth in Isoetes results from a shoot apical meristem that produces sterile and fertile leaves and a central core of primary vascular tissue. Expansion growth is effected by the activity of a lateral meristem or cambium that encloses the primary vascular cylinder. During growth in girth, the original corm structure is maintained by radial displacement and seasonal loss of the outer, older leaves, roots, and corm tissue. Sexual reproduction involves the formation of micro- and megasporangia, the spores of which develop endosporically into male and female gametophytes. Water-mediated cross fertilization produces daughter sporophytes. Developmentally, young sporophytes exhibit a distinct change in their overall morphology (Paolillo, 1963). During the first 10-15 plastochrons, leaves are produced alternately on either side of the embryonic shoot apex. During this stage, the apical meristem produces neither cauline vascular tissue nor primary stem growth; thus the vasculature of these distichous juveniles consists of a sympodium of traces to leaves and roots on either side of the shoot apex and median furrow. The resultant two-ranked leaf arrangement is lost, however, as soon as the apical meristem becomes large enough to initiate leaf primordia in a spiral sequence. Apparently, this apical enlargement also is responsible for the differentiation of the vascular core and the concomitant inception of vertical stem growth. Vegetative propagation is rare in Isoites. Goebel (1879) reported it in I. echinospora Dur. Goebel (1905, p. 431) also reported adventitious plantlets on I. lacustris leaves in a sporangial or sub-sporangial position in sterile specimens from the Vosges Mountains of France. Similar sterile but viviparous plants of I. lacustris were reported from Windmere, England by Manton (1950, p. 255). The developmental origin of such epiphyllous plantlets is not understood and is in need of investigation. Branching in the upper portions of Isoetes axes, another mechanism of vegetative reproduction, also has been reported (Motelay & Vendryes, 1882; SolmsLaubach, 1902; Eames, 1936, p. 51), and a recent developmental study has revealed basal branching in two species of Isoetes (Karfalt & Eggert, 1977). With the exception of branching and bud-formation, the quillworts traditionally have been considered as a morphologically uniform family of pteridophytes. The discovery of the Peruvian genus Stylites (Amstutz, 1957), however, has expanded",

The morphological AM colonization pattern of all investigated species was of the Paris-type. The mycelium of dark septate endophytes (DSE) was found in 19 species (58%), and was observed both in the roots of plants that were colonized by AMF and were devoid of AM association. However, in both cases the percentage of root colonization by these fungi was low. Exceptions were Asplenium serra, Elaphoglossum erinaceum, Lellingeria prionodes, and Lycopodium thyoides, where abundant DSE hyphae were observed. Our results are the first detailed report of both AMF and DSE associations of these plant species. Moreover, the mycorrhizal status of 27 plant species is reported for the first time.",

    "abstract": "As much as any other people the Japanese appreciate and continue to utilize a variety of their native wild plants as specialty foods. The suitability of a number of species of their rich island flora for emergency food must have been learned in earliest times. This knowledge culminated in the production of so-called famine herbals, which were illustrated books describing wild plants that could serve as food in periods of scarcity. Such herbals appeared in Japan principally in the 17th and 18th centuries (Bartlett & Shohara, 1961). The fact that the Japanese have been essentially the exclusive occupants of their archipelago for centuries also helps to explain the widespread knowledge of native plants and their uses which persists even today in that very modern and highly industrialized nation. In contrast, in the United States where urbanization has been the rule, the familiarity and use of edible wild plants that formerly existed is rapidly being reduced to book knowledge. A recent residence in Japan (19661970) demonstrated to me that a surprising number of native edible plants are still known and harvested for food in rural Japan. These are not only used locally, but are made available, often in modem packaging, to urban residents either in specialty food shops in the major cities or more frequently at small tourist centers or spas that exist throughout the islands. Among the best known and most popular of wild vegetable foods are the tender croziers of certain ferns. Most common are those of the cosmopolitan and weedy Bracken (Pteridium aquilinum var. latiusculum), called in Japanese. Croziers of the native Royal Fern (Osmunda japonica) known as Zenmai are also appreciated. Although several other species of Osmunda having esculent croziers are native to Japan, including 0. asiatica (the Asiatic equivalent of O. cinnamomea) and 0. claytoniana, no reference is known to me of their use in that country. This seems curious, for the young shoots of both the Cinnamon Fern and the Interrupted Fern of North America have been recorded as edible (Stone, 1903). In one or another of its varieties the ubiquitous Bracken has been used as an occasional wild food source in many parts of the world and especially in Japan. Sturtevant has summarized these uses (see Hedrick, 1919). In Japan the fiddleheads or croziers of Bracken have probably been long used as a green vegetable in spring and were noted as edules by Thunberg (1784). Additionally, the rhizomes of this species are sometimes dug for the production of starch for food or for making paste (Takashima, 1964). Most Japanese are familiar with Warabi croziers as a specialty food, although perhaps they are unaware of the possible toxicity of these shoots as reported below. According to Takashima (1964), selections of wild Bracken having superior food quality were made during the last decade of the past century and these",

The number of species is large; Christensen (1907, 1913) recognized about 120, and 55 have been described since then. Many undescribed species remain. The size of the subgenus in terms of both the number of good species (perhaps 200) and the number of basionyms assignable to the subgenus (ca. 400) makes it desirable that an infrasubgeneric classification be achieved before a revision of closely related species groups is undertaken and before additional species are described. Christensen made no attempt to subdivide subg. Amauropelta (his Dryopteris subg. Lastrea), but he did recognize small groups of closely related species. As a result of my studies, I feel that the species fall naturally into nine more or less distinct groups, to be given the rank of section. There are relatively few basionyms that must remain unplaced, either because of intermediacy between sections or because type material has not yet been seen. I have attempted to account for all basionyms (based on New World specimens) that should be included within the circumscription of subg. Amauropelta. No doubt a few have been missed, especially infraspecific names. The search has been difficult because species have been described under so many different genera and because of the huge number of species in Thelypteris s.1. (perhaps 1000). An asterisk following a name in the enumeration of basionyms indicates that I have seen type material. I thank R: E.

Despite the abundance and importance of epiphytes in forest dynamics, little is known about AM in these plants. Abundant epiphytes are present in the Valdivian temperate forests of South America, where ferns are one of the most important components of the epiphytic vascular flora. The aim of this work was to analyze the occurrence of AM in sporophytes of obligate and facultative epiphytic fern species in a Valdivian temperate forest of Patagonia, Argentina. We examined the roots of 10 epiphytic fern species. Roots of 66 sporophytes were collected from tree trunks and branches between 0.5 and 2 m height above the ground and were stained by using a modified Phillips and Hayman (1970) method. Of the 10 species examined in the present study two were found to be obligate epiphytes, six were facultative epiphytes and two could not be classified because few individuals were found. Most of them lacked AM structures, except for seven Hymenophyllum sporophytes which were rooted in soil and possessed scarce knobby hyphae and structures similar to coils and vesicles. Abundant dark septate fungi were observed within the cortex of all samples. The absence of AM in epiphytes may be explained by different ecological or taxonomic reasons, but in this study we suggest that root morphology may be an important factor influencing mycorrhizal behavior in ferns.",

In Bower's (1926, p. 268, 1928, p. 5) system they were includedin the Dicksoniaceae in a scheme which separated that family from the Cyatheaceae. Conard (1908) believed that Dennstaedtia belonged in the Polypodiaceae, as it was separable from the Cyatheaceae on characters of the annulus, antheridium, and prothallium. Separation of the tree ferns into Cyatheaceae and Dicksoniaceae was maintained by Holttum (1949). He placed the Dennstaedtiaceae in a central position as a large, complex family including 81 genera. Holttum's Dennstaedtioideae was considered the most primitive of 11 subfamilies. Later Holttum and Sen (1961) demonstrated a close relationship between Cyathea, Dicksonia, Culcita and Cibotium on the basis of the development of the sorus. This removed the main objection to uniting the tree ferns into one family, but Dennstaedtia was regarded as belonging to a different group of genera, even though there is evidence of some relationship with the tree ferns. Holttum and Sen (1961) did not attempt to answer whether the above genera should be considered as belonging to subfamilies of a single family or remain as separate families, but Holttum (1963, pp. 71-72) placed them in three subfamilies of the Cyatheaceae. The stipe anatomy of the dennstaedtioid (including pteroid) and cyatheoid ferns shows greater structural complexity than that of any other extant group of ferns.

An international collaborative project team undertook the first plot-based inventory of vascular plant species' elevational distribution in northern and northwestern Myanmar in 2012, 2013 and 2014. At elevational gradients in northern and north-western Myanmar, four 400 m2 plots were sampled at intervals of 200 m in natural or little-disturbed forests and alpine thickets. We recorded all ferns and lycophytes from 132 plots, producing a total of 3,978 specimens. Based on these collections we present a list of fern and lycophyte species. A total of 299 species from 72 genera and 24 families were identified. This pilot project is a contribution to the upcoming Flora of Myanmar and provides a baseline dataset of the region to set priorities for conservation and the gazetting of protected areas.",

    "abstract": "Veracruz, with 542 recorded species, is the third richest state in Mexico in terms of total fern diversity. Field work, herbarium studies, and a revision of literature during the last decade revealed 22 new state records. Five of these belong to Elaphoglossum, four are filmy ferns, and three are grammitids. Most of the new taxa were collected in the endangered humid montane and pine-oak forests of the central and Los Tuxtlas area during recent research projects. Another 13 species, mainly within Elaphoglossum and Selaginella, have been published as new records in the literature. Whereas several of these might possibly be confirmed in the future, others form part of poorly known species complexes that require specific studies, and we consider them as doubtful or unverified. Our study highlights the need of more fern inventories in remote and mostly unexplored areas, as well as revisions of national and local herbaria, both of which may reveal additional species new to science or range extensions.",

A compilation of the plants in the chroniclers' accounts has been made by Fortunato Herrera and Eugenio Yacovleff in their paper, El Mundo Vegetal de los Antiguos Peruanos. The earliest of these in which a plant, Malz, can be recognized with certainty is a letter written in 1533 by Hernando Pizarro, brother of the conqueror, Francisco, giving his impressions of the country and people. I have examined the records cited by Herrera and Yacovleff containing references to ferns except for the earliest, an anonymous paper, Relaciones Geograficas sobre Quito, 1573. Here Doradilla is mentioned and has been identified as Notholaena nivea. In reference to Trembladera they quote the original work and I translate-- In the region of Quito there are always herbs although much taller in warmer places than in cold, and withered in summer, except an herb called trembladera, which is more or less a yard in height; it has nodes and internodes similar to fennel and its branches although thicker . and they identify this as either Equisetum bogotense or E. giganteum.

Materials and MethodsThe plant material under investigation is the epiphytic fem Microgramtm squamulosa (Kaulf.)Sota (Polypodiaceae), which grows on trees of Tipuana tipu Benth.(Fabaceae), used as ornamentals in streets in the suburb of Bcla Vista, City of Sao Paulo, Brazil.Aerial stems, both with and without galls, were collected and packed in damp closed plastic bags for purposes of transport.Analysis of the external morphology was based on",

Each year it is enriched when new units are incorporated, and impoverished when they are lost by predation, loss of viability, or by germination. Soil was collected in three microhabitats of the gallery forest of the Panga Stream, at four depths, in the wet and the dry seasons. In general, independent of the season, 'dike' samples presented lower numbers of viable spores when compared to samples from the 'middle' and 'edge' of the forest. The number of viable spores and the number of fern species represented decreased with depth. At the end of the dry season, the number of viable spores decreased only in the first centimeters of the soil. Viable spores of thirteen terrestrial species were registered in the soil of this gallery forest. The presence of viable spores in the soil after six months drought and in deeper soil layers shows the existence of a persistent soil spore bank in the gallery forest of the Panga Stream.",

Polyploidy characterizes the intragametophytic-selfing species, whereas the intergametophytic-mating taxa are diploid. The duplicated loci of polyploid taxa may mitigate the expression of recessive lethal alleles caused by intragametophytic selfing, whereas genetic load probably maintains the mating systems of the intergametophytically mating taxa. Enzyme electrophoretic patterns of fixed heterozygosity support allopolyploid origins of C. phyllitidis and P. aureum and confirm their intragametophytic mating systems. Antheridiogens, present in both groups, may promote intergametophytic mating in diploids through promotion of the early development of male plants in gametophyte populations and bisexuality in isolated gametophytes of polyploids if these gametophytes delay or do not attain insensitivity to their own antheridiogen. In the polyploids, antheridiogens may also alleviate low genetic variability through promotion of occasional outcrossing. The perennial, clone-forming habit of epiphytic Polypodiaceae increases the duration and the physical space occupied by derivatives of a single spore, thus expanding the chance of interaction with a later migrant. Genetic load, duplicated genes, and antheridiogens, together with a perennial and clone-forming gametophyte growth habit, interact to produce successful breeding strategies of these epiphytic species.",

    "abstract": "The genus Culcita C. Presl contains several species of dicksonioid ferns. Before 1922 these species were included in Balantium Kaulf., then regarded as typified by Balantium culcita (L'Her.) Kaulf. (now known as Culcita macrocarpa C. Presl). Maxon (1922) demonstrated that Balantium should be typified by B. auricomum Kaulf., a synonym of Dicksonia arborescens L'Her., the type of Dicksonia. Balantium is thus a synonym of Dicksonia. Culcita is the correct name for the segregate genus typified by Dicksonia culcita L'Her. ( = Balantium culcita). Culcita macrocarpa is found in the Azores, Madeira, Spain, and Portugal (Fraser-Jenkins & Lainz, 1983). It is closely related to C. coniifolia (Hook.) Maxon, of tropical America. Also included in Culcita are several species from Australasia and the Philippines. This latter group of species was first associated with Balantium when Diels (1899) and Copeland (1908, 1909) added the species Balantium stramineum (Labill.) Diels, Balantium dubium (R. Br.) Copel., and B. javanicum (Blume) Copel. to that genus. Maxon (1922) recognized eight species of Culcita. Differences in soral characters led him to create a new subgenus Calochlaena for two of these species, the Australian C. dubia (R. Br.) Maxon and an alleged new species from Fiji, C. blepharodes Maxon, which we believe is a synonym of C. dubia. Although Maxon regarded such species as C. straminea and C. javanica as typical Culcita, not Calochlaena, more recent authors have enlarged subg. Calochlaena to include all of the Australasian species (Copeland, 1947; Holttum & Sen, 1961; Holttum, 1963, 1964). These authors apparently were not aware that this was not Maxon's original subgeneric concept. Significant differences between members of the two subgenera of Culcita have frequently been reported. These include differences in anatomy (Davie, 1918; Holttum, 1963; Holttum & Sen, 1961), in spore morphology (Gastony, 1981), and in chromosome number (Manton in Holttum & Sen, 1961; Manton in Holttum, 1963; Roy & Holttum, 1965). These have prompted suggestions that the genus may need to be divided (Holttum, 1963; Roy & Holttum, 1965; Gastony, 1981; Tryon & Tryon, 1982). The need for taxonomic reassessment of Culcita became evident to us in the course of an anatomical survey of the tree ferns (see White, 1984). In the present paper we summarize evidence for the generic distinctness of the two groups and erect a new genus for the species of subg. Calochlaena. Culcita thus becomes restricted to the two species C. macrocarpa and C. coniifolia.",

    "abstract": "Numerous methods are available for the sterilization of fern spores (see Dyer, 1979). Many of these methods are inefficient in terms of time and spore loss and require bulky equipment such as a centrifuge or vacuum filtration units. We present an easy and effective method for spore sterilization that requires no specialized tools or equipment, other than a sterile area. We have used the method presented here routinely to sterilize Ceratopteris richardii Brongn. spores. In addition, this technique has worked with spores of Lygodium, Pteridium, and other species of Ceratopteris (unpublished data). The basic innovation in this method involves the removal of liquid from a spore suspension in a conical centrifuge tube by means of a Pasteur pipet while leaving the spores in place. This method requires the following supplies: 1) sterile Pasteur pipets (Fisherbrand? borosilicate glass, 53/4 inches) with square-cut ends that are not cracked or chipped; 2) sterile pipet bulbs (natural rubber dropper bulb); and 3) sterile conical centrifuge tubes (Pyrex? No. 8060, 15 ml). To accomplish spore removal, insert a pipet with attached bulb into a conical centrifuge tube that contains a liquid and spores and suspend the spores in solution by bubbling air into the liquid. While continuing to bubble air, gently, but securely, seat the pipet tip onto the base of centrifuge tube. A slight rotation of the pipet may assist seating, but excess downward or lateral force will crush the pipet tip. Squeeze the pipet bulb to force additional air out of pipet, then slowly release the bulb to aspirate liquid into the pipet; most spores should collect at the base of the centrifuge tube and not be drawn into the pipet. This procedure has been incorporated into the following generalized spore sterilization and sowing method. Spore preparation.-These procedures can be performed outside of a sterile area. Transfer spores into a conical centrifuge tube and presoak them with distilled water for 16 hours. We routinely dry-sterilize (120?C, 2 hours) centrifuge tubes to eliminate cross-contamination of spore stocks and minimize contamination from the tube. If the spore source is exceptionally dirty or contaminated, wetted spores may be transferred with a Pasteur pipet to a clean sterile centrifuge tube immediately prior to sterilization. This significantly reduces the amount of coarse debris that may harbor and shield contaminants during sterilization. We prepare and sterilize from 2 to 250 mg of Ceratopteris spores per tube, depending on the desired sowing density and number of cultures to be sown. Spore sterilization.-All procedures for spore sterilization and spore sowing should be performed in a sterile area using standard sterile technique. All materials that come into contact with spores should be sterilized. To avoid contamination, use a clean sterile pipet and pipet bulb for each step. To sterilize spores, remove the presoak solution using the method described",

    "abstract": "This study of five populations of Botrychium dissectum was initiated in 1977 as part of a general environmental monitoring program at the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station. The Botrychium populations were discovered in the course of general flora surveys. Plants of this species were remarkably common in old fields and second growth woodlands on the site; therefore, I decided to monitor these populations in several successional habitats and their fate over several years. Part of the rationale of this study was simply that populations of Botrychium dissectum were observed in several plant communities that I could reasonably expect to remain undisturbed at a protected site. The study area is located in the Susquehanna River valley, 8 km north of Berwick, Salem Township, Luzerne County, in east-central Pennsylvania. Botrychium dissectum produces a single leaf each year from a short underground rhizome. This leaf emerges in mid to late summer, unfolds, and, if a fertile segment is present, spores are shed in early autumn. The fertile segment then withers, but the vegetative blade remains throughout the winter and following spring, senescing as the new leaf emerges. It should be emphasized that if this leaf is damaged or lost, the plant has no photosynthetic organ until the next summer. If the first leaf is damaged as soon as it emerges, occasionally plants will produce a small second leaf. Although this study was initiated with the idea of following the fate (longevity) and production of fertile fronds of plants in several populations, the study has been sidetracked by the discovery that many of the plants were eaten in the autumn soon after the leaf emerged and expanded. The plants have high survival under these conditions; this will be the chief topic of this paper.",

    "abstract": "Olfersia Raddi (Dryopteridaceae) consists of a single species, 0. cervina (L.) Kunze, which is widely distributed in forests of the neotropics. This species differs from all other dryopteroid ferns by its numerous, fine, parallel veins that connect at their tips by a submarginal vein. Other features that distinguish 01fersia from many dryopteroid ferns are its strongly differentiated sterile and fertile leaves, simply pinnate sterile lamina, entire pinnae, and conform apical pinna. Olfersia is morphologically most similar and cladistically most closely related to Polybotrya, a genus that also has strong sterile-fertile leaf dimorphism. Most recent pteridologists have placed Olfersia in Polybotrya; however, Olfersia differs by the characters noted above and lacks the unique stem anatomy of Polybotrya. This paper, an outgrowth of my work on Polybotrya (Moran, 1986), is based on a study of about 550 herbarium sheets that represent approximately 335 individual collections from 29 herbaria (see Acknowledgments). I spent seven months collecting Olfersia and Polybotrya in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela and was able to study living plants of Olfersia in each of those countries. Important observations were made about the biology of Olfersia that would have been impossible to discern from herbarium specimens, such as the duration of fertile leaves on the stem, the orientation of sterile vs. fertile leaves, and how often the plants were terrestrial or became scandent. Herbarium, cytological, and anatomical material were also collected during field work.",

One way of increasing the number and kinds of subterranean gametophytes for study is to grow them from spores in axenic culture. Two types of subterranean Lycopodium gametophytes, carrotand disc-shaped, have been grown in axenic culture on nutrient media containing minerals and sugar. The structure of these gametophytes was essentially the same as that for gametophytes from nature (Whittier, 1977, 1981). Lycopodium lucidulum represents a third type of subterranean gametophyte. Its gametophytes are axial, white, and fleshy (Spessard, 1922) and do not resemble the discor carrot-shaped gametophytes of L. obscurum and L. digitatum respectively which have been previously grown in culture (Whittier, 1977, 1981). The main goal of this study was to grow this third type of subterranean Lycopodium gametophyte in axenic culture, and to compare its morphology to gametophytes of the same species from nature.",

Only one or two species of circumantarctic distribution are possibly common to both centers. Morphologically the genus is fairly well defined, but the limits of individual species are much less obvious. Copeland (1947, p. 57) suggested that about 45 species should be recognized, although more recent investigations indicate that this is probably an underestimate. Particular problems arise in widely distributed, polymorphic taxa. These difficulties are compounded by the widespread and persistent misapplication of well known names such as H. punctata (Thunb.) Mett. and H. tenuifolia (Forst. f.) Berh. and because many critical taxonomic features, notably the lamina and rachis hairs, are often poorly preserved or lost from old specimens, including many type collections. The present paper is concerned with some of the wider implications resulting from a recent study of Hypolepis in Australia and New Zealand (Brownsey & Chinnock, in prep.). Although some of the ideas expressed here are speculative, they are put forward now in the hope of stimulating further research, particularly cytological investigation, into critical members of this group of ferns.",

    "abstract": "The symbiosis of Azolla and Anabaena is the only known association of a pterophyte with a cyanophyte. Anabaena azollae is found in all species of the aquatic heterosporous fern Azolla. It is enclosed within a small, basal cavity of the upper green lobe of the bilobed, alternate leaves. Very rapid propagation of the intact Azolla is generally achieved by fragmentation, but may occur by germination of algal-infected sporocarps (Rao, 1935; Smith, 1955, pp. 371-383). In many. temperate and tropical regions, Azolla is considered a pest because it can cover a farm pond or rice paddy rapidly (Sculthorpe, 1967). However, it has long been cultivated as a green manure for rice crops in southeast Asia (Moore, 1969). This latter use provides the basis for the recent intense interest in this unique symbiosis. The algal symbiont is a nitrogen-fixing organism that behaves much like Rhizobium species do in their symbioses with legumes. Studies on the factors affecting the growth of the Azolla-Anabaena symbiosis are relevant to research on nitrogen-fixation and also weed control. Previous laboratory studies on nitrogen-fixation have employed A. filiculoides Lam. or A. caroliniana Willd. (Ahmad, 1941; Peters & Mayne, 1974). However, of the six New World species, A. mexicana Presl is the major representative of the central and western United States (Svenson, 1944). The present study was conducted to characterize the optimal environment for growth of A. mexicana. By virtue of environmental preferences or a more controllable or rapid growth rate, this species might provide a better and more convenient model than larger land plants do for studies of symbiotic nitrogen fixation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Studies in the natural environment.-Growth ofAzolla mexicana was studied in a small, 2 ha pond in southwestern Jackson County, Illinois. This pond, in the Mississippi River flood plain, is fed by runoff from low alluvial plains and swamps delimited by levees. The environmental factors recorded at each observation were light intensity (Weston photometer), light quality (IL 150 Photometer, International Light, Newburyport, MA.), photoperiod, air temperature in the shade and in the sun, and water pH and surface and bottom temperature. Total plant cover of the pond surface and the percentage contributed by A. mexicana were also recorded. Plant cover was determined by the line intercept method from photographs of the pond surface (Canfield, 1941). Laboratory studies. - Plant material was collected from the pond on 18 June 1975. It was separated and washed clean of other aquatic plants. All subsequent",

    "abstract": "Most homosporous ferns produce hermaphroditic, haploid gametophytes which arise from a single haploid spore by a series of mitotic divisions. As a result, the male and female gametes from a single gametophyte are genetically identical, barring mutations. Therefore, sporophytes produced by self-fertilization (fusion of sperm and egg from a single gametophyte) can be considered to be genetically homozygous. Although most species produce gametophytes which have the capability for hermaphroditism, several factors of their reproductive biology influence the probability of self-fertilization occurring. These factors include time of maturation of archegonia relative to antheridia, orientation of archegonial necks, density and spatial arrangement of gametophytes (especially when coupled with an antheridogen or other chemical substance which increases the number of unisexual male gametophytes in the population), and presence of deleterious recessive genes which are lethal or sublethal in the homozygous condition (genetic load as used here) and which can prevent production of viable sporophytes following selfing (Klekowski & Lloyd, 1968; Klekowski, 1969a, 1971; Lloyd, 1974a, b, c). Due to the ability of fern gametophytes to form completely homozygous zygotes, it is possible to screen sporophytes for deleterious recessive genes which are active following syngamy and in the first stages of sporophyte ontogeny (Figs. 19-23). These genes are usually expressed as abortive zygotes, abortive embryos which appear as swollen tissue within the archegonium, small and abnormal sporophytic tissue, or abnormalities in the production of the first few fronds or roots (Ganders, 1972). Data of this type, when correlated with gametangia ontogeny, antheridogen studies, and population dynamics of the gametophyte generation have allowed us to sample populations of plants and to determine their probable mating systems and relative degrees of genetic heterozygosity. To date, only a few species have been sampled intensively, including Osmunda regalis (Klekowski, 1970a, 1973) and Ceratopteris thalictroides (Klekowski, 1970b). In some cases it has been possible to predict patterns of population variability and to correlate specific mating systems with specific ecological parameters (Lloyd, 1974b). Two levels of mating are recognized in homosporous ferns, intragametophytic and intergametophytic. Intragametophytic selfing is by definition self-fertilization within single gametophytes with the resulting intralocus genetic homozygosity. Intergametophytic mating results in various levels of heterozygosity depending on the origin of the gametes. Fusion of gametes originating from separate gametophytes but these in turn from spores of a single sporophyte (inter-",

    "abstract": "Although the stems of ferns tend to be of only one basic type-the rhizomethere are a number of striking variations known, both in internal structure and in gross morphology. In size alone, rhizomes vary from the massive upright trunks of certain tree ferns down to the almost filiform structures of many filmy ferns. Very few species of ferns have evolved dimorphic stems showing division of labor. Some do have differentiation into short shoots and long shoots, i.e., those with short internodes and those with long internodes. Where dimorphism occurs, it is associated functionally, as a rule, either with vegetative propagation or with storage. For example, the Ostrich Fern, Matteuccia, has compact, upright, frondbearing stems and elongate, horizontal stems. The latter enable the plant to form large colonies or clones. Similar, but even narrower and more specialized stolons are found in some species of sword ferns, Nephrolepis. Most examples of drastically modified stems, such as the strongly flattened rhizomes of Myrmecophila and Lecanopteris or the tuber-like bodies of Nephrolepis, Polypodium, and the plants to be described below, are epiphytic. Furthermore, they seem to be associated with storage and possibly even symbiotic relationships with ants. Indeed, except for those ferns which have obviously solid tubers, practically all of these plants have been referred to as ant-plants or myrmecophytes, whether or not any obligatory relationships with ants have been observed or experimentally demonstrated. The plant to be described in this article is a little-known epiphyte with dimorphic stems (Fig. 1): ordinary polypodioid rhizomes and drastically modified, potatolike hollow tubers. Hagemann (1969, fig. 1) has recently illustrated and described the structure of these tubers in some detail, but he did not concern himself with the broader comparisons of the plant in respect to its other peculiarities and taxonomic relationships. In our investigations of Solanopteris we have discovered a number of distinctive characters which are described here for the first time.",

    "abstract": "Acrorumohra subreflexipinna, an endemic fern of Taiwan, has been suspected to be a hybrid species. The aims of this study were to detect possible multiple origins of this species, determine the genetic variation in different populations, and clarify their lineages. One nuclear and three organellar DNA fragments were sequenced to determine parentage of this putative hybrid and to examine genetic differentiation among populations. Sequence data support the conclusion that A. subreflexipinna arose from the hybridization of A. hasseltii and A. diffracta, and the hybridization was uni-directional, i.e., based on the assumption of maternal inheritance in organellar DNA, the former was its maternal species while the latter was its paternal source. A convincing interpretation is that the female gametes of A. hasseltii gametophyte could be fertilized by the male gametes from apogamous A. diffracta. Unique nuclear alleles present in different populations of A. subreflexipinna and A. hasseltii demonstrated that hybridization occurred many times independently. The nuclear haplotypes present in A. subreflexipinna were subsets of those found in the parental species, and A. subreflexipinna always had lower haplotype diversity than A. hasseltii at sympatric sites. Our results show that any genetic variation of A. subreflexipinna came from its parents and that it maintains this significant genetic variability because of recurrent hybridization.",

Such studies have largely omitted pteridophytes. Owing to the alternation-of-generations life cycle, certain problems arise concerning physiological divergence within groups of pteridophytes. The success of pteridophytes in a community is obviously limited both by the successful establishment of free-living gametophytes and the survival of sporophytes. Thus, the habitat requirements for spore germination and prothallial growth are critical factors for the success of the plant. Physiological divergence between populations or species, as a result of selective pressures of ecologically different habitats, should be apparent in both phases of the pteridophyte life cycle. Farrar (1967) found fern gametophytes reproducing independently in the southern Appalachians, far north of the normal ranges of their sporophytes. Conway (1953) stated that there are few records of finding sporelings of Pteridium aquilinum in Scotland, even though the sporophytes are common and spore production is heavy. She suggested that spores are released late during the growing season and that Pteridium sporelings are more susceptible to frost than are those of other species observed. Conway also noted that sporelings are subject to attack by soil insects and fungi. These two studies suggest that the gametophytic and sporophytic phases of a plant can have different habitat requirements and that one phase of the life cycle can be",

    "abstract": "Between 5% and 10% of fern species are non-sexual. The non-sexual or apogamous type of life cycle is now known in over 80 species among such genera as Adiantum, Asplenium, Cheilanthes, Dryopteris, and Pteris. This form of reproduction bypasses the regular sexual fertilization of egg by sperm, and the details of the pattern were worked out by W. Dopp and Irene Manton in particular (reviewed by Mehra, 1961). The sporophyte and the gametophyte have the same chromosome number. The typical fusion of egg and sperm that occurs in the archegoniuii is lacking. The new fern plant simply grows out of the tissue of the prothallus as a bud. If the chromosome number of the sporopllyte is, for example, 87, the spore will have the same number, the prothallus the same number, and so on. The only change in chromosome number occurs just before spore formation, when there is usually an automatic doubling of chromosome number in the spore mother cells. Instead of producing the normal 16 spore mother cells with 87 chromosomes, the spore-cases produce 8 mother cells with 174. Normal spore formation follows, producing only 32 spores, not the typical 64. If doubling does not occur and there are the usual 16 spore mother cells, the 64 spores which result in a regularly apogamous fern are abortive and will not germinate normally. Thus doubling is required, and the good spores are only those which occur 32 per sporangium. Because of these spore products it is not necessary to make cytological studies to judge in general whether a given fern is apogamous or sexual. By merely looking through the microscope at sporangia from dried herbarium sheets it is",

Rhizome morphology in the Dennstaedtiaceae is relatively well known, yet its anatomy has been poorly explored. We performed morpho-anatomical studies on 26 taxa from eight genera, mostly from Brazil, Japan, and New Zealand. Among the studied species, the main rhizome type is long-creeping with alternate phyllotaxy and a solenostele s. str. The exception is Blotiella lindeniana, which has ascending rhizomes with radial phyllotaxy and a dictyostele. A polycyclic solenostele was found in Dennstaedtia (“Patania”) cornuta, D. (“Patania”) dissecta, and two subspecies of Pteridium arachnoideum. Lateral-line aerenchyma characterized Blotiella lindeniana, Histiopteris incisa, Hypolepis spp., Paesia spp., and Pteridium arachnoideum subspp. The position of sclerified parenchyma in the cortex and pith varied among species. Our data enabled us to hypothesize evolutionary patterns of rhizome evolution in extant lineages of the Dennstaedtiaceae. The “Monachosorideae” has retained ancestral conditions: short-creeping to ascending rhizomes with dictyostele s. str. In the “Hypolepidoideae”, two notable changes occurred in Blotiella and Pteridium (in which the solenostele evolved into a polycyclic solenostele). In the “Dennstaedtioideae”, one notable change occurred in Dennstaedtia (“Patania”), namely parallel evolution with Pteridium (in which the polycyclic solenostele has also evolved). We present illustrations, morpho-anatomical descriptions, evolutionary inferences based on the available phylogeny, and supporting tools for studying the taxonomy, systematics, phylogeny, and paleontology of the group.",

In order to assess alpha diversity patterns of ferns in this zone, we analyzed changes in their assemblages along an elevational gradient from 300 m to 3,000 m in the Sierra de Juárez, Oaxaca, and compared the results with similar studies conducted in Central and South America. We report the most detailed plot-based elevational gradient study on ferns in the region and provide detailed data on species abundances and elevational ranges. In 121 plots of 20 × 20 m, we found 195 fern species, with the highest species numbers recorded at mid-elevations (1,100–2,200 m) and lower richness at both gradient extremes. This hump-shaped pattern was mainly driven by epiphytes, which contributed about 40% to the total species richness and had wider elevational ranges than terrestrial species, which contributed 38% to the total richness, and were more or less constant at low to mid elevations about 2,500 m, followed by a gradual decline. Overall, richness per plot was low compared to other elevational gradients within the tropics closer to the Equator. This decline of species richness towards the subtropics and temperate regions appears to be rather abrupt within Central America, but additional data are needed to close the remaining gap of knowledge between Costa Rica and Mexico.",

This station is in one of the areas of greatest abundance of this fern in Ontario, as I realized later while preparing a map of its range. In the spring of 1951, I discovered what was believed to be a new station for the Hart's-Tongue along the Niagara escarpment south of the Forks of the Credit River in Peel County. This is an extension of some twenty miles from the most southerly station reported at that time. However, during the fall of 1953, another discovery by my friend Professor F. P. Ide and several of his students added a second station still farther south along the escarpment at Mount Nemo in Halton County. In an effort to determine whether the Hart's-Tongue",

Since my attention has shifted to other genera, a brief report on the results of this earlier work may be made. Helene Woronin,l in a paper dealing with apogamy and apospory, published a sketch of Notholaena trichomanoides showing glands on the edges and under surface of the prothallia and also on apogamous growths in Pellaea nivea. Recently, Alice F. Tryon2 published a sketch of a Notholaena Standleyi prothallium showing wax glands on the edge of the prothallium. My work shows that the wax production of the capitate glands varies considerably with the species and with the conditions under which the prothallia are grown. The prothallia of Notholaena Aschenborniana, N. californica, N. candida, N. Galeottii, N. Grayi, N. Lemmonii, and N. Standleyi present a grayish or moldy cast in a uniform nutrient solution. A single stray prothallium of a non-wax-gland-bearing species may be recognized at a glance. Notholaena neglecta also has these glands, but bears them less consistently; they are present in the region of the sinus and on the tips of serrate edges.",

Therefore, they often use a combination of chemical defenses as protection against herbivores. In this review, we summarize the distribution of five groups of biomolecules that may act as chemical defenses of ferns: phytoecdysteroids, flavonoids, thiaminase, cyanogenic glycosides, and alkaloids. For each of these biomolecules, we briefly discuss their biosynthesis, mode of action, and currently known taxonomic distribution in ferns, and include examples to illustrate their observed concentrations in different fern tissues. We conclude with a discussion of ferns that accumulate heavy metals, which may also serve in their defense against herbivores. Finally, we discuss research gaps to encourage future research in this widely understudied and ecologically important field of investigation.",

Kaulfuss republished it in his Enumeratio of the ferns collected by Chamisso, 1824, page 85, where two species are named, X. serrulata (Swartz) and X. myosuroides (Swartz). These are small ferns, with paleate rhizomes, narrow, pinnatifid or pinnate fronds, with a single simple or forked vein in each segment, and one exindusiate sorus on each fertile segment. It may be added that the pedicel is a single row of cells, that the annulus is of about 14 indurated cells, and that the spores are tetrahedral. The essential generic character was the restriction of the sori to a more or less entire apical portion of the frond. There are six known species which conform to this strict original definition-four in America of which one ranges across Africa, one in Hawaii, and one in New Guinea. The distribution is flagrantly discontinuous, but it is still probable that they form a natural group. The enlargement of the genus, to include species otherwise much like X. serrulata, the type, but without the differentiation of the fertile apical portion of the frond, is an idea as old as the genus. In an appendix to the Enumeratio, p. 275, Kaulfuss himself included a species, X. setosa, without such differentiation. Almost immedi-",

The fungi occur not only as parasites, but as symbiotic forms in the roots, as epiphytes on fronds and stems, and in a wide and bewildering variety as saprophytes or scavengers on all parts of dead and dying plants. Even the prothallia of ferns are attacked and destroyed by a number of the lower fungi. Seymour in his standard Host of the Fungi of North America lists approximately 200 species of fungi as growing on nearly 100 fern species-an array of enemies to make the stoutest fern quail! Pteridium, the common Bracken, for example, is host to some 30 fungi, a number of them distinctly parasitic. A forthcoming supplement to the Index will increase this record substantially. The interrelationship, as alternate rust hosts, which exists between the wheat crop and the barberry and between our white pines and currant bushes to their mutual disadvantage has been thoroughly publicized. It is not so well known, though unfortunately only too true, that a considerable number of North American ferns and our fir forests are involved in a similar rust fungus complex.

    "abstract": "The star-scaled cloak ferns, including Notholaena sinuata and its allies, are a relatively small group of New World xerophytes whose generic affinities have been the source of considerable debate. The first member of this group was described in 1806 as Acrostichum sinuatum Lagasca ex Sw. Although the sporangia of the star-scaled cloak ferns follow the veins for a short distance, they are not truly acrostichoid and subsequent authors (e.g., Presl, 1836; Domin, 1913) assigned A. sinuatum and its relatives to the cheilanthoid-gymnogrammoid alliance now included in the family Adiantaceae. Many of the genera in this alliance are poorly defined and the star-scaled cloak ferns have historically been placed in three different genera: Gymnogramma, Notholaena, and Cheilanthes. Gymnogramma is now considered invalid for the reasons discussed by Underwood (1902), and most recent authors have assigned the sinuata complex to Notholaena (Tryon, 1956; Hevly, 1965; Lellinger, 1985). However, this generic placement has not been universally accepted, and there is a growing tendency to include the star-scaled cloak ferns in the aggregate genus Cheilanthes (Mickel, 1979; Mickel & Beitel, 1988; Tryon & Tryon, 1982). The dispute over the proper generic treatment of the sinuata complex led us to undertake a series of biosystematic analyses culminating in a taxonomic revision of the group (Benham, 1989). In this paper, we present the suite of characters that uniquely defines the star-scaled cloak ferns and discuss the rationale for recognizing this group as a separate genus, distinct from either Notholaena or Cheilanthes.

    "abstract": "In United States, four genera of ferns are known to exist as independent gametophyte populations (Farrar, 1967). They are able to persist, in isolation from sporophytes of species, by vegetative reproduction, including production of gemmae. Their apparent inability to produce normal sporophytes has led to considerable difficulty in species identification. The earliest vouchered collection of Hymenophyllum gametophytes in southern Appalachian Mountains is one by Mary Taylor. She described plants as growing far from one of stations for Hymenophyllum tunbrigense. The widespread occurrence of independent Hymenophyllum gametophytes in North and South Carolina was first reported by Farrar (1967). He, at that time, presumed gametophytes (Figs. 1-6) to be the same species as sporophyte Hymenophyllum (L.) J. Sm. which grows in South Carolina. Subsequent publications either supported this possibility (Farrar, 1985) or remained uncommitted regarding their identity (Wagner et al., 1970). However, rarity (Wagner et al., 1970) and relative sterility (Farrar, 1971) of H. sporophytes in Appalachians, has always been difficult to reconcile with frequent occurrence of independent gametophytes. Furthermore, Taylor described gametophytes in her collection as decidedly different from prothallia that I think are those of H. tunbrigense (pers. comm. to W. R. Maxon, 13 Oct., 1936). There are several problems in determining whether these gametophytes are H. or not. Most studies of Hymenophyllum gametophytes (Atkinson, 1960; Goebel, 1888; 1905; Holloway, 1930; Stokey, 1940; 1948; Stone, 1965), have concentrated on development rather than on distinguishing features of mature prothalli. Few studies have specifically described characters of H. gametophytes, and those that we have been able to find included no helpful figures (e.g. Janczewski & Rostafinski, 1875; Richards & Evans, 1972). Also, Farrar (1971) was unable to grow H. gametophytes in culture, and therefore did not obtain experimental data regarding gametophyte form and growth requirements and responses that would have been useful in this study. The discovery of a single juvenile sporophyte of a second Hymenophyllum species in United States (Wagner et al., 1970) further calls into question",

The physiological basis for the fern's restriction to this xeric environment is unclear. In this study, C. feei spores were subjected to a broad range of temperatures, pH, and light intensities, to varied light qualities, and to different moisture levels. Results indicate that C. feei spores can germinate under a wide variety of conditions. However, data suggest that spore germination optima and optimal conditions for protonemal growth overlap narrowly.

Cohen (1966, 1967, 1968) developed models of seed and spore dormancy describing the environmental conditions favoring its evolution.

The results showed that T. dentata has expanded its distribution into highly urbanized areas in Osaka Prefecture and has reached southern Kyoto Prefecture and central Shiga Prefecture. The distribution of T. dentata populations thus seems to have expanded northward based on comparisons with the distribution that was determined in the 1980s. Because the fern's habitat types were mainly the side walls or bottoms of drainage channels, crevices in stone walls and roadsides, the urban matrix has not served as a barrier to the expansion of the range of T. dentata; on the contrary, it may be serving as a type of heat island corridor that is facilitating the spread of this species.",

The study was conducted during one sporing season at three altitudes (400, 600, and 800 m). In both species spore maturation occurred in autumn and may be controlled by the previous accumulation of photosynthates. Spores were not released until late winter owing to a requirement for dry weather conditions. Dispersal took place later at higher altitude, due to lower temperature and higher humidity. This gradual liberation of spores along an altitudinal gradient is important for the endemic Azores bullfinch Pyrrhula murina (a bird that feeds on spores in winter), providing food over an extended period.",

Local artisans use the adventitious roots that surround tree fern stems as substrate to make handicrafts. In this region, tree ferns regenerate abundantly in disturbed areas such as roadsides, in which they suffer high mortality due to weeding and other road maintenance activities. Transplantation of young tree ferns from these areas to safe sites could contribute to the ex situ conservation of the species. The sale of transplanted tree ferns could also provide local families with an additional source of income. We identified and estimated the abundance of all tree fern species that occurred along roadsides in this region. We evaluated the viability of transplanting young tree ferns of Cyathea divergens and Alsophila firma to different conditions of light availability. While only 30% of the individuals naturally growing along roadsides survived for 1 year, C. divergens transplants experienced 73.3 and 86.7% survival and A. firma transplants experienced 93.3 and 40% survival when planted in safe sites under open canopy and in 50% shade, respectively. Transplants of C. divergens produced more fronds and grew faster in height than transplants of A. firma. Individuals of both species transplanted to 50% shade produced more fronds and grew faster than conspecifics transplanted to open canopy areas. Transplantation proved to be a low time- and cost-demanding strategy to promote conservation of native tree fern populations while providing local people with a potentially profitable alternative to replace handicraft production.",

    "abstract": "The genus Selaginella has been a popular subject of study for over 100 years. Its unique and still enigmatic organ, the rhizophore, has attracted many investigators; aspects of the plants' reproduction have been studied by other workers. Since heterospory represents a major step in the evolution of the seed, Selaginella has been a favorite example in plant morphology courses. Many papers have been published on the genus. Although several general morphological and anatomical studies have been made (Hieronymus, 1902; Harvey-Gibson, 1894; Steel, 1923; Wardlaw, 1925; Zamora, 1960), very few of the approximately 700 species have been thoroughly investigated. Recent authors have discussed its spores (A. Tryon, 1949; Hellwig, 1969), sporangial arrangement (Horner and Arnott, 1963), and the root and rhizophore in light of new evidence (Webster and Steeves, 1963, 1964). Certain other morphological features have been pointed out in the taxonomic treatments of Alston (1955) and R. Tryon (1955). Several stelar types have been described in the genus (HarveyGibson, 1894). By far the most common types are the ribbonshaped monostele and the bistelic type (two separate round protosteles). More elaborate stelar patterns have been recognized: (1) three or more stelar ribbons in all stem axes; (2) two ribbons in the rhizome and one in the erect stem with a ventral round bundle; and (3) a solenostelic rhizome and polystelic erect stem. During a course in the biology of tropical pteridophytes in Costa Rica for the Organization for Tropical Studies (Mickel, 1967), the senior author preserved material of Selaginella exaltata (Kunze) Spring, a species notable for its large size (Fig. 1). Plants may reach more than a meter in height, with megaspores up to 1.5 mm in diameter. There is no creeping rhizome. The stem is erect, reaching a diameter of 5 mm in the lower internodes and 8 mm in the swollen nodes (sites of stem ramification), and is supported by several rhizophores up to 35 cm long and 2 mm in diameter. 123",

The means by which this and other species of Marsilea reach isolated habitats is unknown. Guppy (1906) suggested that Marsilea might be dispersed by adhering to the external surfaces of birds. However, this apparently never has been demonstrated. Brown, Larson, and Bold (1964) found that spores of some terrestrial ferns may be dispersed by wind. Both these methods of dispersal seem unlikely for Marsilea because of the size and weight of the sporocarps. Recent investigations have shown that many fresh-water organisms incapable of active overland transport may be effectively dispersed via the intestinal tracts of migratory water birds (Proctor, 1959, 1962, 1964). In most cases resistant eggs and spores account for the ability of organisms to withstand passage through the intestinal tract. Although intact sporocarps have been found in the stomachs of various birds (McAtee, 1939), it is not known whether sporocarps will pass unharmed through the entire intestinal tract. Neither is it known whether the spores are sufficiently protected by the sporocarp wall to retain their viability after passage. To determine the effects of avian digestion upon the viability of Marsilea spores, sporocarps of M. mucronata were fed to 5 species of water birds. Six killdeer (Charadrius vociferus), 2 mandarin ducks (Aix galericulata), 2 wood ducks (Aix sponsa), 2 Chiloe widgeons (Anas sibilatrix), and one mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) were used. Sporocarps fed to ducks were mixed with either chopped aquatic vegetation or small grain. Killdeer were fed sporocarps",

It grows only in lowland country and is adapted to a temperature of about 80?F all through the year, having continuous growth. The status of Cystodium as a genus distinct from Dicksonia, another genus of tree ferns, has often been questioned. Recent morphological and cytological studies by Holttum (1963) and Roy and Holttum (1965) indicate that the two genera are indeed distinct. Christensen (1938) and Copeland (1947) considered Cystodium to be probably derived from Dicksontia. The anatomy of Dicksonia is now well known (Holttum and Sen, 1961, and Sen, 1965), but this is the first detailed account of the anatomy of Cystodium yet published. Material was collected by Prof. R. E. Holttum during his visit to New Guinea in 1963, and was sent to us by Mr. J. S. Womersley of the Department of Forests at Lae. Specimens were fixed in FAA, and the usual method of paraffin sectioning was followed. Sections were stained with Orange G and Safranin.

Some 200 species are attributed to it, but the actual number must be very much smaller. Like most ferns, these plants are exceedingly variable and many of the variations have received specific names. Many segregate genera have also been proposed, mostly on characters of venation, among them being Sagenia, Pleocnemia, Dictyopteris, Bathmium, Dryomenis, Podopeltis, Cardiochlaena, and Arcypteris. These have long been recognized as synonyms, but two of them (Pleocnemia and Arcypteris) have recently been recognized by Holttum (1951a, 1951b) as distinct genera, chiefly on venation characters. Some additional segregates may possibly be recognized among the Old World species, but it does not appear practicable or necessary to segregate any American species. This genus was long known under the name Aspidium Swartz, and it was so treated in the Index Filicum. However, Aspidiunm Swartz was an illegitimate (superfluous) name when published, and it attained a wide usage in different senses (for Dryopteris, Polystichum, or Nephrolepis, in addition to Tectaria) and was thus a source of confusion. A proposal to conserve it in the sense of Tectaria was rejected by the Pteridophyta Subcommittee of the International Committee on Nomenclature in 1954.",

Each hybridization event marks the union of divergent parental gene copies, or homeologs, and the formation of an independently derived lineage. Little is known about the effects of recurrent origins on the genomic composition and phenotypic variation of allopolyploid fern taxa. To begin to address this knowledge gap, we investigated gene expression patterns in two naturally formed, independently derived lineages of the allotetraploid fern Polypodium hesperium relative to its diploid progenitor species, Polypodium amorphum and Polypodium glycyrrhiza. Using RNA-sequencing to survey total gene expression levels for 19194 genes and homeolog-specific expression for 1073 genes, we found that, in general, gene expression in both lineages of P. hesperium was biased toward P. amorphum—both by mirroring expression levels of P. amorphum and preferentially expressing homeologs derived from P. amorphum. However, we recovered substantial expression variation between the two lineages at the level of individual genes and among individual specimens. Our results align with similar transcriptome profile studies of angiosperms, suggesting that expression in many allopolyploid plants reflects the dominance of a specific parental subgenome, but that recurrent origins impart substantial expression, or phenotypic, variation to allopolyploid taxa.",

The lack of adequate distinguishing morphological characters in the leaves and stems, as well as the frequent cases of hybridization and polyploidy, makes the identification of species very difficult. Usually the spores provide the best characters for distinguishing species within Isoëtes, but these can vary in size because of polyploidy and hybridization. In this work we studied the variation in size of both mega- and microspores, and the relationship between size and ploidy level. We also present the first chromosome counts for seven species that are endemic to Brazil: I. goebelii (2n = 33), I. martii (2n = 44), I. maxima (2n = 22), I. organensis (2n = 66), I. ramboi (2n = 44) I. smithii (2n = 44), and I. spannagelii (2n = 22).

To model the dispersal of biological propagules (e.g., spores, pollen) it is necessary to measure their terminal velocity (Vt) in air. In this study, we used a new method based on video image analysis to measure Vt of spores of seven fern taxa. The average Vt of fern spores was 7.0 cm s−1, but varied among species from 1.6 to 11.3 cm s−1. Similar values were reported previously for airborne particles of mosses and seed plants. Spores of Danaea nodosa and Lophosoria quadripinnata had a lower Vt than other spores of similar size, perhaps owing to their surface ornamentation that increases their drag coefficient, or an air cavity, which diminishes their density. The reliability of the video image analysis method used here on fern spores was verified by comparing observed and theoretically calculated Vt of glass beads of known diameter and density. This method also allows the observation of spore behavior (e.g., rotation) as they move through the air. Because the method is relatively easy and inexpensive, it can promote future aerobiological research on other biological airborne particles as well.",

    "abstract": "Athyrium esculentum (Retz.) Copel. is one of the species of ferns that has suffered the most in nomenclature, having been by different authors attributed to at least eight different genera (Hemionitis, Diplazium, Asplenium, Anisogonium, Microstegia, Callipteris, Digrammaria, and Gymnogramme). It extends from Polynesia to India, growing as a straggling weed in marshy, or just moist, areas which are not necessarily shaded. A. esculentum lacks the elegance of most other species of Athyrium and consequently is not favoured as an ornamental fern, although it is comparatively easy to cultivate and is one of the most important of ferns as human food. The tender leaves of the plant are used as a vegetable in preparing tasty salads, pickles, etc. Comparatively little is known regarding the gametophyte of Athyrium esculentum or for that matter any species of Athyrium. In view of this, spores were collected from plants growing at the National Botanic Gardens (Lucknow) and sown in September, 1955, on sand beds irrigated from below and maintained in a glass house. The technique followed is as described earlier (Kachroo & Nayar, 1953; Nayar, 1954). The spores of A. esculentum (Figs. 2, 3) are bilateral,1 anisopolar, with a single linear short proximal laesura, of medium size, monolete, concavo-convex in equatorial view, with one of the equatorial ends narrower than the other and with a brown scabrate exine (having small irregular elevated patches). The exine pattern (Fig. 1) is discernible only in acetolysed and bleached preparations. The average size of the spores is P 29.16 ?, E1 44.00 . and E2 30.24 x. The size variations are: P 25.00 to 32.50 1, E1 39.50 to 50.50 /u and E2 25.00 to 36.00 ji. In culture the spores germinate within a week. The first",

    "abstract": "that only three basic species-Asplenium montanum, mountain spleenwort, A. platyneuron, ebony spleenwort, and A. rhizophyllum, the walking fern-have generated a large series of hybrid ferns, some sterile and some fertile, now numbering, in total, nine different taxa, one of them occurring in two cytological forms. The ones known as fertile plants are A. bradleyi (A. montanum x platyneuron), A. ebenoides (A. platyneuron x rhizophyllum), and A. pinnatifidum (A. montanum x rhizophyllum). Those known only as sterile plants are A. bradleyi x platyneuron, A. ebenoides (sterile form), A. ebenoides x platyneuron, A. trudellii (A. montanum x pinnatifidum), A. bradleyi x montanum, A. gravesii (A. bradleyi x pinnatifidum), and A. kentuckiense (A. pinnatifidum x platyneuron). To this rather overwhelming list, we now have an additional hybrid to be described here. We also have a unique plant collected in the wild in West Virginia some years ago, the identification of which now seems to be possible. The new hybrid is a backcross of Aspleniumn ebenoides (A. platyneuron x rhizophyllum) with one of its parental species, A. rhizophyllum. It is the first record of A. rhizophyllum being involved in a secondary hybridization. The initial hybrid, A. ebenoides, is probably the best known of all hybrid ferns, in part because its hybrid nature was a controversial matter for many years before the plant was produced artificially in culture, and in part because it is so well known to fern students as an odd146",

Bernh., because of the presence of bulblets on the frond. This identification was later recognized as incorrect, since in most other characters the plant strongly resembled Cystopteris fragilis (L.) Bernh. In the matter of leaf form and size and shape of the indusium, the specimens fall within the range of variability known for C. fragilis. The presence of the bulblets and minute white glands on the frond could not be ignored, however, so specimens were sent to Mr. C. A. Weatherby of the Gray Herbarium. He promptly replied that the specimens represented an undescribed variety of Cystopteris fragilis, but recommended more field study and the growing of the plants from spores and bulblets. This work was completed during the spring of 1949. Mr. Weatherby and the author had begun writing a joint paper on the new variety when the untimely death of Mr. Weatherby left the task in the author's hands.",

As some of my readers may remember, that is a steppe region of low rainfall, originally covered with a stunted and sparse xerophytic forest and now largely given over to the cultivation of wheat, barley, maize, and legumes, or in the drier parts, especially the hills, to pasture or the raising of wood for fuel. Rains are scanty, occurring only in winter (May to October), but are then often violent. Agriculture is carried on mostly by means of irrigation. The water comes from the great snow-fields of the Andes, which here reach a maximum altitude of 7,000 meters in Mt. Aconcagua, the highest peak in America, and various lesser summits. Ferns are rare, not only in number of species (only about 30), but also in number of individuals. No species is at all conspicuous in the landscape; one finds only some xerophytic forms under trees or between rocks, and a few mesophytic species in moist ravines, through which small streams run and in which forests of considerable height, requiring much more water than the vegetation of open lands, are able to maintain themselves.

Dr. William R. Maxon had worked up the ferns for the second edition of Britton and Brown's Illustrated Flora. Dr. Maxon had been invited to prepare a revision, but he did not feel up to it. I accepted and forwarded the completed manuscript in December, 1948 (some corrections and additions were forwarded in January, 1950). The work, although it covers the same ground as Dr. Maxon's treatment, is essentially my own, for all the descriptions and keys were redrawn. Dr. Maxon would perhaps not always agree with my treatment. Now that Dr. Gleason's work is about ready to be published it seems desirable that I should give in advance some explanation of my treatment of certain groups, especially since a few new combinations are needed. I am reviewing elsewhere Professor M. L. Fernald's new Gray's Manual of Botany, which covers essentially the same range as Dr. Gleason's Flora. Those who are hoping for a complete agreement in the taxonomy and nomenclature of the species are going to be disappointed. It is perhaps inevitable that independent workers will not come to the same decisions, even on a group as well known as the ferns of the eastern United States. Naturally in some genera there is complete agreement between Dr. Fernald's treatment and my own; in most of the larger genera there is more or less disagreement.

Environment: Rooting in mud in shallow water at margin. Usually submerged but often aquatic and even entirely terrestrial. All the plants are rather small, but many of them bear sporangia packed with mature spores. A careful examination of these specimens revealed features approximating those of the Peruvian species I. Lechleri Mett. as described by A. Braun (Verh. des Bot. Verein fur Brandenburg. 4. 1862.) It is to be noted in this connection, that Braun's I. socia and I. Karstenii, the latter from Venezuela (loc. cit.), were, apparently with Braun's concurrence, united with I. Lechleri by Motelay and Vendryes (Actes Soc. Linn. Bordeaux. 36. 1883.) These forms are alike in showing smooth megaspores and complete velum. The other Peruvian species, I. triquetra A. Br. is without velum and has tuberculate megaspores.

    "abstract": "Spores from four species of Huperzia, three species of Lycopodiella, and three species of Lycopodium were germinated in axenic culture. The ten species included species with subterra- nean mycorrhizal gametophytes and others with surficial photosynthetic gametophytes. The germi- nation of spores from species with mycorrhizal gametophytes was slow, but much faster than pre- viously reported. It occurred in the dark in a few months for most species instead of years as reported by Bruchmann (1910). Although species of Lycopodiella are expected to have rapid germination, spores from two species had slow germination. It appears that not all the species of the Lycopodi- aceae with photosynthetic gametophytes exhibit rapid spore germination as reported by Treub (1884). Germinating the spores of the Lycopodiaceae in axenic culture is difficult. It generally takes a considerable length of time and the percentage of germi- nation is low (Whittier, 1977, 1981; Whittier and Webster, 1986). Efforts over the years to germinate these spores under more natural conditions (i.e., on soil) have demonstrated that spores of the Lycopodiaceae fall into two classes according to how rapidly they germinate (Bierhorst, 1971). The spores of spe- cies with subterranean, mycorrhizal gametophytes germinate slowly (Bruch- mann, 1910; Barrows, 1935) and those of species with photosynthetic, surficial gametophytes germinate more rapidly (DeBary, 1858 (see Chamberlain, 1917, or Barrows, 1935) and Treub, 1884, 1888). Studies on the germination of spores from species of the Lycopodiaceae with mycorrhizal gametophytes provide limited information (Table 1). Bruchmann (1910) germinated the spores of Lycopodium selago L. (Huperzia selago (L.) Bernh. ex Schrank & Mart.), L. annotinum L., and L. clavatum L. in soil cul- tures. Barrows (1935) investigated spore germination with Lycopodium com- planatum L. var. flabelliforme Fernald (L. digitatum Dill. ex A. Br.) and ob- tained 16% germination after one year. More recent attempts to germinate these spores have been carried out in axenic culture (Table 1) but less than 0.1% of the spores germinated. It is probably advantageous for spores forming subterranean gametophytes to germinate slowly and be down in the soil before gametophyte development starts. Indications from earlier studies (Whittier, 1977, 1981; Whittier and Web- ster, 1986) are that spores producing mycorrhizal gametophytes only germinate in the dark, which would stop germination until the spores are covered by soil. However, why these spores of the Lycopodiaceae need long times in the dark before they germinate and why they have such low percentages of germination is not understood. In other pteridophytes with mycorrhizal gametophytes, spore germination is more rapid and can exceed 50% after a few months in axenic culture (Melan and Whittier, 1990; Whittier and Braggins, 1994).",

Smith has fragile, ephemeral, sphaeropteroid indusia surrounding inframedial to medial sori, which are typ- ical of many Cyathea; however it is unusual in possessing a creeping stem. Decumbent stems (above-ground rhizomes) bearing adventitious roots and buds give rise to narrow, glabrous upright shoots upon which three or four twice-pinnate-pinnatified fronds are typically displayed. Cyathea planadae is very common and patchily distributed in the understory of primary forest habitats in montane forests. The species is also noteworthy for an apparent association with an ant species, which appears to feed from pads of tissue at the base of the pinnae. Tree ferns of the family Cyatheaceae are a common, abundant, and ecolog- ically important part of the flora of montane and premontane wet forests in the Andes of Colombia. Taxonomic note of this group was first made in the mid eighteenth century with initial floristic surveys of the Andes by Spanish botanists such as Jose Celestino Mutis (Diaz-Piedrahita, 1991). A taxonomic revision of Cyathea and related genera in the Andes was undertaken in the 1960s and 1970s by Rolla Tryon and his students. Recent and ongoing studies",

These species have been variously treated in the literature. Many early authors placed all Andean laevigate-spored specimens in Isoëtes lechleri, a central Andean species, while one later author recognized up to eight northern Andean species distinct from I. lechleri. This research represents a revisionary study to determine the number and identity of the taxa in this complex. Multivariate and descriptive analyses of morphological data and chromosome counts were performed. Five species are recognized including the previously described I. karstenii and I. palmeri. One variety is transferred from I. lechleri to I. karstenii (I. karstenii var. anomala). Three of the recognized species are newly described: I. fuliginosa, I. hemivelata and I. precocia. Chromosome counts revealed that I. karstenii and I. precocia are diploids (2n = 22) and that I. palmeri is tetraploid (2n = 44). Estimates of chromosome number based on spore size for I. fuliginosa and I. hemivelata indicate that they are polyploid (2n ≥ 44).",

    "abstract": "Sceptridium dissectum, the most variable North American grapefern species, demonstrates variation in degree of blade dissection, blade color, pinnule shape, and pinnule margins. Historically, various morphologies have been included within S. dissectum. For example, Clausen's monograph recognized five infraspecific taxa in S. dissectum, of which only the morphologies of variety dissectum and obliquum are currently retained. However, the taxonomic status of the two varieties has been debated. We used ISSR (Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat) markers to assess the genetic distinctness of S. dissectum var. dissectum and var. obliquum in 17 Ohio populations. Five ISSR primers generated 69 reproducible loci. In UPGMA analyses and AMOVA, S. dissectum var. dissectum individuals did not cluster separately from var. obliquum individuals, nor did individuals from the same population cluster together. ISSR markers revealed levels of population genetic structure in S. dissectum similar to levels detected by previous isozyme investigations. Our results concur with recent treatments of S. dissectum that do not formally recognize infraspecific taxa, and may bring into question current species circumscriptions in Sceptridium. We illustrate the use of ISSR markers for examining taxonomic boundaries in Sceptridium.",

    "abstract": "The preceding papers have presented a wide array of investigative approaches centered on the dynamics of population phenomena in ferns. Collectively, these studies have addressed all phases of the fern life cycle: spore production and dispersal, gametophyte establishment, mating mechanisms and their evolution, and both genetic and demographic attributes of sporophytes. Represented in these studies are some of the shifts in emphasis and approach that characterize recent trends in population ecology: attention to all stages of the life cycle (including the challenging and important study of gametophytes in nature), coordination of field data with laboratory studies (e.g. isozyme analysis, tests for antheridiogen response, estimation of genetic load), and development of theoretical models that predict outcomes of dynamic processes (e.g. evolution of mating systems) based on biological features of the organisms being modeled. Taken together, these studies begin to draw a picture of how ferns and other pteridophytes establish and maintain populations in nature, a picture that as yet is incomplete. While recent investigations have taken us strides forward in our understandings of fern populations, additional knowledge will emerge only after considerably more effort. With the goal of encouraging such effort, we would like in this symposium summary to point out the potential for additional research that will deepen our understanding of the biology of ferns as representatives of plants and of organisms in general. Below, as we order our thoughts principally along life history stages, we will attempt to bring together some of the concepts generated by the symposium papers, and also to identify areas of uncertainty that are of particular interest for future investigation.",

    "abstract": "The silverback and goldback ferns of the genus Pityrogramma Link are striking, graceful plants of small to medium size, well known to fern fanciers for their beautiful white to yellow farinose indument. Tryon & Tryon (1982) classified the in the tribe Taenitideae of their broadly circumscribed Pteridaceae Reichb. (= Adiantaceae (C. Presl) Ching; see Pichi Sermolli, 1986) and the taxa were last revised taxonomically by Tryon (1962), who recognized 14 species. Among the goldback and silverback ferns, the complex of species indigenous to the southwestern United States and adjacent Mexico has excited the greatest controversy, both with respect to species number and affinities of the group. Tryon (1962) followed Weatherby's (1920) disposition of the taxa as four varieties of a single species, P. triangularis (Kaulf.) Maxon. Alt & Grant (1960), however, recognized three distinct species based on Weatherby's varieties, P. pallida (Weath.) K. & V. Grant, P. viscosa (D. Eaton) Maxon, and P. triangularis (with only two varieties). The California Flora (Munz & Keck, 1968) followed the single species scheme in the general text, but recognized three species in the supplement, and also included mention of two other varieties of P. triangularis described since the work of Alt & Grant (1960). At the generic level there has been growing recognition that the southwestern complex is anomalous within Pityrogramma. Tryon (1962) pointed out that this departs in several morphological characters from the relatively uniform central group of species in the genus and suggested that this specialized relative of Pityrogramma proper might merit generic recognition. He chose to treat the taxa as a single genus, however, to emphasize the similarities (rather than the differences) between the groups. More recently, Tryon & Tryon (1982) suggested that the southwestern complex might be better classified in the tribe Cheilantheae rather than the tribe Taenitideae, but postponed formal taxonomic segregation from Pityrogramma until the group's affinities became better known. During studies leading to treatments for the genus Pityrogramma for the Flora of North America Project and the Ferns and Fern Allies of the Southwestern United States (Windham & Yatskievych, in prep.) we also concluded that the P. triangularis complex should be segregated from Pityrogramma. This paper is intended to review the rationale for distinguishing these two morphologically",

Typically the haploid complement of n= 11, or a multiple thereof, has been reported (Love et al., 1977; Kott & Britton, 1980). Polyploid series range from 2n = 22 to 2n = 110. The aneuploid I. durieui is notable in having the lowest chromosome number in the genus, with 2n = 20. Several taxa from India, including I. coromandelina Linn. f., I. panchananii Pant & Srivastava, I. indica L. Rao, and I. pantii Goswami & Arya, are reported to possess one or two supernumerary chromosomes (Goswami, 1975; Pant & Srivastava, 1965). Only Stylites gemmifera Rauh [= Isoites andicola (Amstutz) L. D. Gomez] shows a strong deviation from the presumed base number of x= 11. According to Rauh and Falk (1959), the diploid number for this species is ca. 58. Mexico, Central America, the Antilles, and tropical South America, with over fifty taxa, are exceptionally rich in Isoites. In addition, the morphological diversity in these taxa is perhaps greater than in any other part of the world. Among the neotropical species, only the count for I. andicola has been reported (Rauh & Falk, 1959). As part of an overall systematic revision of the Neotropical Isoetes, the chromosome numbers of several species were studied and are reported here. Some of these counts have been previously mentioned in Tryon & Tryon (1982), at which time I ascribed a count of 2n=44 in I. ticlioinsis H. P. Fuchs nom. nud. to I. lechleri Mett.",

This compendium is based on collections made from those of Cuming in 1841 to our recent survey of the karst forests of the Rajah Sikatuna Protected Landscape (RSPL) and vicinity during November, 2003 to February 2004. A total of 169 species in 63 genera and 27 families are reported here for the island, of which 91 species are new additions. Twenty-one species are Philippine endemics, five of which are previously known only from types or from very few collections. They are Ctenitis boholensis, C. humilis, Pteris whitfordii, Antrophyum williamsii, and Lomagramma merrillii. Bohol is the type locality of five fern names, namely, Ctenitis humilis, C. boholensis, Cyclosorus glaber and Thelypteris sevillana (= Pneumatopteris glabra), Cyclosorus boholensis Copel. (= Sphaerostephanos acrostichoides), and Diplazium petiolare. Two species in the genera Oleandra and Ctenitis and several specimens of Selaginella remain undetermined. Nineteen previously reported species have not been recollected or in some cases, their taxonomic identities are doubtful. Prior to this study, only one fern specimen from Bohol was accessioned at the Philippine National Herbarium (PNH). All historical collections are currently deposited in herbaria in the U.S.A. and Europe. Boholanos have successfully maintained the integrity of the wild populations of ferns, especially those species that are heavily collected in other parts of the Philippines for their ornamental value.",

    "abstract": "Asplenium platyneuron B.S.P. Prel. Cat. Anth. Pterid. 3. 1888. The combining authority for this species usually is cited as ex D. C. Eaton. Dr. Stephen Smith (pers. comm.) has pointed out to me that Eaton (1878, p. 21) accepted A. ebeneum Ait. as the correct name for the Brown-stem Spleenwort. He wrote, the Linnaean name for the present fern is unquestionably the oldest, it is scarcely probable that those authors who are disposed to insist upon an inflexible law of priority will attempt to replace the name which has been accepted by nearly all botanists for nearly a century by one so utterly inappropriate as platyneuron. Yet, lest they should do so, it may be worth while to note that this fern was named Asplenium plaltneuron by the late Mr. Oakes of Ipswich, in a marginal note in a copy of the old 'Flora Virginica,' now in my possession. Therefore, the combination attributed to Eaton clearly is a ntomen provisorimn. Despite Eaton's publication of the combination, the earlier epithet platyneulron did not displace the more familiar ebeneium with any regularity for about twenty years. The impetus for change was provided by Underwood in Britton and Brown (1896, p. 23), who made the transfer properly and cited the basionym and Aiton's name in synonymy. However, Underwood is antedated by Britton, Sterns, and Poggenburg, who cited the species as A.splenliuln (A. ebelnelim, Ait.). Although they did not cite a literature reference, platyneuron, (L.) must be considered a valid indirect reference. Therefore, the correct combining authors apparently are B.S.P., unless the combination was made validly in some obscure local Flora published between January 1878 and 25 April 1888. One would have thought that Underwood, being a fern specialist, would have made the combination prior to Britton, but such is not the case. At the time Britton, Sterns, and Poggenburg made the combination, Underwood (1888, p. 104) maintained the epithet ebeneun; he did not adopt platyneuron in his writings until five years later (Underwood, 1893, p. 104).",

    "abstract": "The classification of the monotypic tree fern genera Metaxya and Lophosoria has undergone several revisions. Early taxonomists placed these genera, with the dicksonioid group, in the family Cyatheaceae (Diels, 1902; Christensen, 1906; Maxon, 1912). Bower (1926) stressed the importance of soral position and placed these primitive genera in the family Protocyatheaceae. Later workers (Christensen, 1938; Copeland, 1947) included the two genera in the Cyatheaceae, but excluded the dicksonioid group from that family. Based upon morphological, developmental and anatomical data, Holttum and Sen (1961) again placed Metaxya and Lophosoria and the dicksonioid ferns into the single family Cyatheaceae. More recently, Tryon (1970) revised the classification of the Cyatheaceae, excluding members of the Dicksoniaceae. He recognized Metaxya and Lophosoria as distinctive genera and placed them in an independent position at the base of his phyletic scheme for the family. In this study, the anatomy of Metaxya rostrata (H.B.K.) Presl and Lophosoria quadripinnata (Gmel.) C. Chr. is elucidated and an attempt is made to determine whether the proposed phyletic relationship between these two taxa and the squamate genera of tree ferns is supported by anatomical data. Developing shoot tips of M. rostrata and L. quadripinnata were collected in montane and lowland rainforests in Costa Rica. The plant materials were killed and fixed in formalin-acetic acid-alcohol (FAA) and sectioned on a macrotome (Lucansky, 1976a). The slices were partitioned into manageable sizes, dehydrated in a tertiary-butyl alcohol series and embedded in paraffin (Johansen, 1940). Sections (10 f(m) were made and stained in a safranin-fast green series. Stained sections were photographed with a Nikon M-35S camera, whereas entire slices were photographed with a Pentax 35 mm single lens reflex camera. Voucher specimens are deposited in the herbarium of Duke University.",

    "abstract": "A new species of the fossil fern Pelletixia Watson and Hill (1982) has been identified from fragments of pinnules discovered in sediments belonging to the Lower Cretaceous Potomac Group of Maryland. The locality was exposed in a stream bank at high flood stage during a tropical storm in 1972. Subsequently, material was collected from the site for several years until erosion by the stream completely destroyed the locality. The material described here is placed in a genus previously known only from the Wealden beds (Lower Cretaceous) of England. The Potomac Group and Wealden Formation have been shown to have many plants in common (Hueber, 1982), and so it is not surprising to find an additional example of a genus reported only from these two localities. Locality and Stratigraphy.-Pelletixia amelguita was isolated as pinnule fragments from material brought to the U. S. National Museum of Natural History by Mr. Howard Hruschka. He had collected the material from a high, newly eroded bank along Paint Branch about one mile north of the University of Maryland campus in College Park, Maryland (Washington East Quadrangle 7.5 minute series topographic sheet, 39?00' W lat., 76056' N long.). The plant-bearing strata are in Zone 1 of the Potomac as defined by Doyle (1969) and are probably of Barremian-Aptian age within the Lower Cretaceous. The stratum whence came the specimens described herein is probably the same which produced the rhizome of the fern Loxsomopteris anasilla J. Skog (1976). The age of the specimens is approximately 130 million years. Materials and Methods.-The clay matrix was bulk macerated in 48% hydrofluoric acid. The residue was thoroughly washed with several changes of water until acid-free, sieved, and then sorted under a dissecting microscope for all sizes of material (Hueber, 1982). The specimens were examined under a Wild M-5 dissecting microscope, photographed, and then drawn using a camera lucida attachment. One specimen was air dried and mounted on the surface of a 12 mm cover glass that had been thinly coated with white glue. The cover glass was attached to a SEM stub with silver paint, coated with gold-palladium, and observed with a JOEL JSM-35C scanning electron microscope at the Palynology Laboratory, United States Geological Survey, Reston, Virginia. The specimen was cracked open on the stub and recoated to release some spores after the first viewing indicated the presence of sporangia and spores. Unfortunately, the inclusion of thymol granules in the water used for separating material did not prevent the second specimen from being destroyed by bacteria and fungi. This problem has also been noted by Hueber (1982) for material of the same age from a different locality. Photographs were taken with a Wild M-5 dissecting scope with 35mm camera attachment using Kodak Plus-X Pan film or with the SEM using Polaroid Type 52 positive-negative film.",

    "abstract": "Anemia Swartz is a genus of leptosporangiate ferns consisting of approximately 90 species. The genus inhabits tropical and semitropical latitudes in Africa, India, and the Americas, with two species reaching the United States. Anemia generally is divided into three subgenera: Coptophyllum, Anemiorrhiza, and Anemia. The present study deals with a scanning electron microscopic examination of spores of six species of subg. Coptophyllum, four of which are endemic to the Planalto region of south-central Brazil. Subgenus Coptophyllum has been monographed by Mickel (1962), who noted spore morphology as viewed with a light microscope. Previous studies of Anemia spores also include the work of Erdtman (1957). The spores of Anemia are unique among ferns in their tetrahedral shape and surface pattern of conspicuous ridges separated by striae. Protuberances or ridge extensions occur where the ridges join the trilete scar. The present study was undertaken in an attempt to discover morphological details not visible in light microscopy that might be of taxonomic value. While I was the field assistant to Dr. William R. Anderson on the 1973 New York Botanical Garden Expedition to the Planalto region of south-central Brazil, I collected spore samples of various Anemia species. All were air-dried. Spore samples of six species, 18 specimens altogether, belonging to subg. Coptophyllum were mounted on aluminum studs with double-adhesive tape and coated with a thin (200-400A) layer of gold-palladium. The samples were then examined at 15 kv and photographed using the JEOL JSM-U3 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) of the Electron Microscopy Center, Texas A & M University. To best facilitate comparisons, proximal, distal, and ornamentation micrographs were included for all species examined. Measures and magnifications are based upon those indicated by the instrument. Although absolute accuracy in magnification is rare in the SEM, relative measures between the spores can be assumed to be correct.

The spores of the seven species are of typical shape (trilete, tetrahedral) and they exhibit Cyathea-type germination. The gametophytes undergo Adiantum-type development with occasional Drynaria-type development. Filaments are usually 2–3 cells long. The normal adult prothalli are cordate and thalloid with prominent cushions in the middle of the two wings. Prothalli are usually bisexual and antheridia form earlier than archegonia. Lingulate, strap-like and branched prothalli easily grow on the crowded improved Knop's agar media, which produce notches late and produce more antheridia. In distilled water, filamentous prothalli only produce antheridia. The shapes of the mature prothalli of Sphaeropteris brunoniana and Alsophila austro-yunnanensis are distinct among seven species. Multicellular chlorophyllous hairs appear on dorsal or ventral surfaces in the archegonial region near the notch when the prothallus matures, and the hairs are scaly when they get old. Hairs of the prothallus are like those on the juvenile sporophyte fronds. Vegetative proliferations of old protahlli have been observed.",

    "abstract": "The conservation of pteridophytes presents a demanding challenge because many species in the world are thought to be threatened with extinction, as they are very sensitive to environmental disturbance. Ex situ actions provide an important conservation strategy, so the Germplasm Bank of Tuscia Botanic Garden, with the Herbarium UTV (Tuscia University, Viterbo–Italy), has undertaken a project for the conservation of threatened pteridophytes of the Italian flora, like Osmunda regalis, the Royal Fern, a species with chlorophyllous spores that is declining in Italy because it is linked to vulnerable habitats. As a part of the project, this work presents first results of in vitro reproduction of the Royal Fern using spores from exsiccata (UTV samples collected and dried in 1989 and 2001). Our results also highlight the value of herbarium specimens in biodiversity conservation, providing a useful method to reproduce species that are threatened or extinct in the wild, at least at a local level, so as to plan eventual reintroductions using the native germplasm.",

    "abstract": "The majority of ferns have determinate leaf ontogeny, which makes them suitable for a hierarchal system of leaf terminology to describe dissection and gross morphology. Gleicheniaceae are distinct among fern families because nearly all species have indeterminate and pseudodichotomously forking leaves. Given these two characteristics, the hierarchal system of leaf terminology is inappropriate and cumbersome to use. Therefore, Holttum (1957), Tryon and Tryon (1982), Andersen and Øllgaard (1996), and Lellinger (2002), among others, developed specialized leaf terminology to describe the morphology of Gleicheniaceae leaves. Although each system is sufficient, comparisons among the different systems are cumbersome and confusing. To reduce confusion and simplify, we propose a new leaf terminology system that: 1) is universal to all taxa in Gleicheniaceae, 2) is more useful to apply to partial-leaf herbarium specimens, and 3) clarifies the ambiguity of having multiple leaf terminology systems.",

Gametophytes of Osmunda regalis were grown in multispore populations on C-fern nutrient enriched agar containing 0, 1 nM, 1 µM, and 1 mM kinetin. Higher concentrations of exogenous kinetin reduced gametophyte size (area), disrupted correlations observed in the control between rates of apical notch formation and thallus widening, increased the proportions of asexuals and males, decreased the proportion of females in the population, and correspondingly increased male reproductive effort (antheridia per unit thallus area) and decreased female reproductive effort (archegonia per unit thallus area) compared to the control. Low concentrations of exogenous kinetin increased the proportion of females compared to the control. In the control, thalli with a comparatively deep apical notch tended to be wider (relative to their length) and possess a more circular silhouette relative to thalli with a comparatively shallow apical notch; however, these morphological parameters were independent of gametophyte size and gender. Thus, variance in the rate and planes of cell division and patterns of cell expansion and differentiation, most likely genetic in basis, were observed in the control, and the observed effects of exogenous kinetin were more than a simple “push” towards a phenotype already present in the control.",

Arid and semi-arid zones make up about 50% of Mexico's land area; hence, the objectives of this study were (1) to undertake an inventory of fern and lycophyte species present in a region of central Mexico covered mainly by xerophilous vegetation (Valle del Mezquital, Hidalgo); and (2) to analyze patterns of morphological variation of the species found with respect to environmental conditions. Monilophytes and lycophytes were collected in all vegetation types identified within the study area along an elevation gradient between 1200 and 2800 m. For each species, growth substrate, life form and foliar strategy were recorded, and ten morphological characteristics were evaluated in order to determine their variation and correlation with elevation, rainfall, temperature and vegetation type. The data obtained were analyzed using univariate and multivariate techniques. Ten families, 25 genera and 72 species of monilophytes; and one family, one genus and eight species of lycophytes were identified. Quercus forest had the highest species richness of lycophytes and monilophytes followed by arid tropical scrub. The most common life forms by substrate were epipetric and terrestrial, the latter represented by chamaephytic, cryptophytic and hemicryptophytic life forms. Most species showed a xeromorphic foliar strategy, as a consequence of prevailing dry conditions. An analysis of morphological leaf characteristics of the species revealed patterns of variation and covariation, primarily related to vegetation type, which are linked to differences in temperature and moisture conditions along the studied elevation gradient. Monilophytes and lycophytes, like other groups of plants, have developed a set of morphological adaptations, which may function together or in various subsets and at different degrees of efficiency to enable plant species to cope with the environmental conditions in their habitats.",

Germination of spores was obtained both in vitro and on soil, but the production of sporophytes from gametophytes did not begin until over two years after the spores were sown. In vitro cultures of both sporophytes and gametophytes were established, but sporophyte production from gametophytes has thus far only been observed on soil. Both in vitro-grown gametophytes and sporophytes survived cryopreservation using the encapsulation-dehydration procedure. Preculture on ABA-containing medium increased survival of sporophytes after cryopreservation, but good survival of gametophytes was observed with or without ABA. The use of Green Globular Body-like sporophyte tissue demonstrates the use of this tissue for fern cryopreservation. The success of these protocols demonstrates that in vitro methods can be applied to the propagation and preservation of A. scolopendrium var. americanum, and possibly other fern species with similar growth forms. Propagated plants could assist in restoration of the species and cryopreservation could be used to preserve germplasm of such propagated lines into the future.",

The tree ferns Alsophila firma, Cyathea divergens and Lophosoria quadripinnata coexist in a cloud forest in Mexico; the first is abundant in creeks, the second occupies slightly open places, and the third prefers more open sites. We hypothesized that the distribution of these species would be correlated with their germination patterns. To test the hypothesis we evaluated the effect of light, water potential and canopy openness on spore germination. Spores were incubated under different light filters modifying red∶far-red ratio or light intensity, water potential was modified with polyethylene glycol solutions and distinct canopy openness were selected in the field. No germination occurred in darkness, and it was low under red light and far-red light; however, all species germinated at a very low photon flux density (PFD, 0.04 µmol m−2 s−1). The decrease of water potential from 0 MPa to −0.7 MPa reduced germination in all species, from 98.6% to 72.2% in L. quadripinnata, 66.4% to 18.9% in A. firma and 74.2% to 4.1% in C. divergens. The increase of the canopy openness reduced the germination capacity of the three species, but L. quadripinnata was the least affected. The germination requirements of the three tree fern species were partially related to the distribution of the sporophytes in the cloud forest.",

Reed, 1953) and is most commonly met with in South Indian localities along with three other species, namely: I. dixitei Shend., I. sahyadrii Mahabale and I. sampathkumaranii Rao. Apart from South India, I. coromandelina has been reported to occur in Serampur (Bengal, cf. Ekambaram and Venkatanathan, 1933), Bombay (McCann, 1934), Banaras (Bhardwaja, 1935) and Baroda (Gaekwad and Deshmukh, 1956) from where a new variety has been described. Recently Bhambie (1957) has reported its wild occurrence at Meerut (N. India), the exact location being about four to five miles north of Meerut, on the Meerut-Mowana road, where it is fairly common on field margins during the monsoons and dries up in winter. The present cytological observations concern only the Meerut gatherings. The morphology of the genus as a whole is being dealt with by Dr. S. N. Bhambie; the cytology was investigated by the writer in August and September 1956, 1957, and 1958 with the kind permission of Prof. V. Puri. Almost all the fixations of the wild as well as the material kept in the greenhouse were made in 1:3 acetic-alcohol by Dr. S. N. Bhambie, to whom the writer is very grateful. Extensive examination of the material has revealed the presence of only megasporangiate plants at Meerut. Curiously enough, Bhambie (1957) too, who has studied many more individuals, has only recorded the megasporangiate material thus far. As Prof. Puri tells me, microsporangia have so far not been observed in any of the individuals studied at Meerut. Therefore, the present account is limited to only the megaspore-mother-cells. The number of megaspore-mother-cells per sporangium is usually very small, which evidently renders this difficult cytological material. The usual acetocarmine squashes (cf. Manton, 1950) have been obtained and made permanent by McClintock's (1929) technique. 99",

There is no question that this filmy fern is Mecodium wrightii (v. d. Bosch) Copeland. Mecodium iwrightii was originally described by van den Bosch1 on the basis of a specimen collected by C. Wright at Hakodate, in Hokkaido. The known range of distribution has been from Saghalien2 and the southern Kuriles3 to Kyushu and southern Korea. The headquarters of its distribution lie in the central and northern districts of Honshu, usually at altitudes lower than 11500 meters. In Shikoku and Kyushu it is found, rarely, at 500 to 1000 meters elevations. In the regions where M. wrightii is most abundantly found, it is usually growing on the bases of the trunks of large trees, especially of aged Cryptomeria japonica (Pl. 8, 9), in humid dense mountain forests. These substrata are in general moist and mossy. In northern Honshu and Hokkaido, it grows mostly on mossy rocks or cliffs in shade and usually in places with high humidity. Viewed in the vertical distribution, it grows, even in Hokkaido, at altitudes higher than 1000 meters, but it has never been collected in the alpine regions of central Honshu, where M. polyanthos is occasionally found.

    "abstract": "Examples of reticulate evolution are known from throughout the tree of life, but are particularly common in ferns due to their unique reproductive biology and few prezygotic reproductive barriers. However, untangling the complex evolution history of these groups can be challenging. Often, several different types of data are needed to understand the full story of reticulate evolution; for example, chloroplast markers trace maternal inheritance, while nuclear markers complete the picture by suggesting paternal inheritance. Next generation sequencing can provide thousands of nuclear loci, which are informative for estimating reticulate evolutionary histories. The model fern genus Ceratopteris is known to have cryptic allotetraploid taxa, and hybridization is common between many species in the genus. To better understand the patterns of hybridization and reticulate evolution in the genus, we constructed a split network analysis using thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms from samples collected throughout the pan-tropical range of Ceratopteris. Our split network organizes taxa based on genomic similarity, revealing potential introgression between lineages. Combining this analysis with Patterson's D to measure gene flow, as well as contributions by previous authors, we show extensive hybridization and reticulate evolution in Old World Ceratopteris, and also provide evidence for natural hybridization events involving the model species C. richardii.",

    "abstract": "Ferns are the second most diverse group of higher plants on the planet. However, the metabolic processes of these plants, as well as their reaction to the influence of various environmental factors, benefit from new investigation. In seed plants, an important role of the lipid fatty acid (FA) composition in plant response to a variety of environmental conditions has been repeatedly demonstrated. In this paper, the composition of FAs in the epiphytic ferns, Platycerium bifurcatum and Asplenium nidus, and the terrestrial fern, Asplenium trichomanes was analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. The data obtained clearly indicate that epiphytic ferns have several distinctive features in the composition of their FAs. They are characterized by a high level of saturated FAs (about 50%) and a great variety of very-long-chain FAs (VLCFA). This strongly contrasts with the FAs composition in the terrestrial fern in which unsaturated FAs prevail. High levels of saturated fatty acids, in particular palmitic acid (16:0), together with a high VLCFA content, can be a necessary component in complex interactions with microorganisms. Thus, the specific FA composition of P. bifurcatum and A. nidus may act both as a protective mechanism against the penetration of bacteria and pathogenic fungi, and as a mechanism for the interaction of the epiphytes with saprophytic fungi. It is likely that the composition of FAs in the epiphytic ferns is determined by their habitat and plays an active role in the interaction of plants with their environment.",

    "abstract": "The smooth scouring rush, Equisetum laevigatum, is the only species of Equisetum endemic to North America and thus should have a special place in the affections of American pteridologists. Unfortunately, however, there has been so much confusion concerning this species that most botanists, amateur and professional, are uncertain about whether they actually know it. As part of a recently completed monographic study of the genus Equisetum subgenus Hippochaete,1 I devoted special attention to this species, and wish to discuss the results of that study. In 1840, Nicholas Riehl collected a smooth-stemmed scouring rush along the banks of the Mississippi river below St. Louis, which Alexander Braun named E. laevigatum in 1844. A fruiting specimen of Riehl's collection is to be found in the New York Botanical Garden herbarium and another is in Vienna. George Engelmann, having seen Braun's manuscript apparently, went out along the Mississippi banks to collect this new species. The specimens he collected in August, 1843, have since been mistakenly considered the type. They are without cones and show the autumnal condition of the species, with colored sheaths reminiscent of those in E. hyemale. However, all have the internal structure as well as the smooth stems characteristic of E. laevigatum. In 1902, A. A. Eaton described a new Equisetum intermediate between E. hyemale and E. laevigatum, which he named E. hyemale var. intermedium. According to Eaton it had the external appearance of the former species and the internal structure of the latter species. He stated that Milde, certainly, and A. Braun, probably, based their descriptions of E. laevigatum partly on this plant. Eaton later (1903) described another new Equisetum of this alliance, E. funstonii.",

    "abstract": "In a recent issue of this journal, Rapp (1954) presented a rather complete review of the older literature bearing on the toxicity of Equisetum to horses. Unfortunately, Rapp apparently did not have access to some recent work in veterinary medicine, in which the actual poison of bracken and Equisetum is shown to be an enzyme, thiaminase, which destroys vitamin B, (thiamin) in the gastrointestinal tract of the horse, whereupon the animal dies of an avitaminosis. In a paper by Evans et al. (1951) it is shown that the symptoms of bracken -incoordination, rough coat, and nervous disorders-are accompanied by a very low level of thiamin and a high level of pyruvate in the blood. These are definite indications of deficiency of thiamin. Injections of 50-100 mg. of thiamin per day brought rapid recovery of horses which had already gone down. After partial recovery, such horses would again sicken and die if they were kept on a bracken and hay diet with thiamin withheld. In the same paper, it is also shown that the enzyme thiaminase is present not in bracken but in Dryopteris Filix-mas, Equisetum arvense, and E. palustre. In all probability, it will be found in other ferns and horsetails as well. Osebold (1951), in a paper on bracken poisoning in cattle, stated that no alkaloids, phytotoxins, saponins, or glucosides could be found in bracken. to only one rock, which I venture to predict 95",

While so near Sand Mountain, in Alabama, where I had done considerable collecting among the spleenworts and some other rare ferns, I took a few days off to drive back and explore again some of the stations where I had found rarities. Tennessee has excellent roads, which make automobile travel a pleasure. So one morning we left Nashville on Primary no. 1, which is an asphalt road running east to Knoxville. I intended to take no. 2 at Murfreesboro, but by mistake I kept on no. 1 until I was several miles east of that city. When I discovered I had taken the wrong road I decided not to turn back, but to continue on no. 1 until we reached McMinnville and thern turn south and cross Cumberland Mountain, as I was told there was a good road. From McMinnville we drove south 20 miles before we ascended Cumberland Mountain. At the top of the Mountain there is a summer resort, and a large hotel has been erected. We stopped at this place, called Beersheba Springs, and I explored the cliffs below the hotel for ferns. I found Dryopteris marginalis quite plentiful on the way up the mountain. On one rocky ledge just below the hotel I noticed Camptosorus rhizophyllus and Asplenium ebeneum growing, and, as I looked closer, I found a good-sized plant of the hybrid, Asplenium ebenoides. I took four of the largest fronds and left the plant growing, as I did not wish to destroy the only station I knew of for that fern in Tennessee. I decided I had made a good find, and then proceeded over the asphalt road toward Monteagle, at the south 22",

The region is generally level to rolling and has a gentle slope to the southwest. It is drained by many small streams running into Burt Lake two miles to the South and thence into Lake Huron. The topographical outlines of the region are due to the joint action of the moving ice and flowing water during the glacial period. The climate, as in nearly all the upper part of the lower peninsula, is rigorous in winter and subject to very frequent, sudden and extreme changes of temperature, as much as 50 degrees F. variation being recorded for a period of 24 hours. This sort of weather undoubtedly has much influence on the vegetation exposed above the snow, but since the ferns are covered with a dense layer of snow they are well protected from early winter until late spring. With the melting of the snow, the ferns begin growing vigorously and continue well into the summer. The early summer's climate is ideal for the growth of ferns. Showers are frequent and, combined with the average temperature of 68 F. to 70 F., no better place can be found in the extreme northern parts of the Central States for the collection of wild ferns. Moraines thoroughly permeate the whole region in all directions and to a large extent determine the flora. Topographically considered, and for convenience, the region will be discussed under the three following topics: (1) The Pine Plains, (2) The Hardwoods and (3) The Bogs.",

Taking a few necessaries (which includes a kodak in my case) I was off. Owing to lack of information, poor connections, indirect roads and slow schedules, to say nothing of taking a train in the wrong direction, I was a long time on the way, and arrived very late one evening, but providentially landed in one of the best hotels in the place. Next morning, I discovered I was in a live, little city of some thirteen thousand, instead of in a country town, as I had fancied before starting.

The student of living ferns, if he collects his material in the field, has the opportunity of examining it to the minutest detail, from the ecological conditions under which it grew, its internal anatomy and development, to its frond outline, nerve characters, and fruit production. If it be worth while it may be grown artificially through its complete life cycle back to the spore-producing stage again. Yet, in spite of this seeming perfection of detail, all students well know the differences of interpretation that constantly arise. From the limits of families, genera and species, to the faintest subspecies and hybrid, there are, or may be, opposing views.",

Some of the variations found in this genus have been found as wild forms but the large majority are only known from their occurrence under cultivation in florists' greenhouses. They are none the less of interest to students of wild forms not only because of their intrinsic interest, but because in some cases they show differences similar to those existing between distinct species of wild ferns. In other words, we have in the variations of Nephrolepis an illustration of one possible way in which species may have been differentiated. In about fifteen years more than fifty distinct forms have arisen from one species, Nephrolepis exaltata. Of course these fifty new forms are not all separated inter se by what would be considered specific differences. Some of the forms very closely resemble each other, but it is a most interesting fact that in some such cases the very similar kinds have a very diverse origin, a circumstance which probably often finds a parallel among wild forms, and which indeed may explain the anomalous distribution of a fern like Asplenium platyneuron, in America and South Africa, not to cite others. It is also safe to say that the welldistinguished varieties among this group of fifty would, if brought in separately from the tropics, be readily accorded specific rank. It may be added, that, paradoxically, the variations of this one species have gone beyond the commonly accepted generic limits of Nephrolepis. The variations to be considered here have all arisen from the one species, N. exaltata. Other species of Nephrolepis have also given rise to somewhat similar",

Its topography is much broken, consisting of low hills reaching two or three hundred feet above sea level. There is much woodland, largely of oaks and deciduous trees of northern species, in low ground largely of Magnolia grandiflora L. Ravines-quite dry while I was there-abound, on the steep banks of which ferns grow in profusion. It was along one of these that I came upon a considerable colony of Asplenium angustifolium Michx., growing in company with Asplenium filix-foemina (L.) and Dryopteris patens (Sev.).

It is scarcely to be expected that this vast number of species were all derived from the same ancestors, and I have thought it possible, by a detailed examination of a large number of species, to find out whether the species really are all congeneric or not. I believe I have succeeded in solving this question. While older authors considered a single character, as, for instance, the shape of the sori, indusium, venation, as sufficient for distinguishing genera, we are nowadays inclined to see the best generic characters in the general habit and growth of the species, and it must be granted that by considering these characters the prime ones, we have reached a much more natural arrangement of the ferns than before.

It is clear, however, that some of the widely distributed types split up into readily recognizable forms,' marked by good structural and vegetative characters, and that in many instances what might, with scant material, appear a chance variant is in reality a well characterized constant form throughout a given area, needing only to be studied in the light of ample collections to obtain recognition as a sharply defined species. The West Indian specimens, for example, had been characterized vaguely as belonging to a few variable species; yet a critical study of a large amount of material has shown' that for the most part the plants fall readily within the rather narrow limits of numerous species.

The fern is, therefore, by no means limited to calcareous rocks; it must get lime from some source, however, for analysis of the ash obtained by burning its leaves showed the presence of 30% or more of this constituent.

Furthermore, A. nidus was a horticultural introduction and is now naturalized.

Though these ferns do not possess many distinct characteristics, the shape of the midrib and the detail of the scales are diagnostic. We provide an overview of bird's-nest fern diversity in Hawai'i, a key to identify native and non-native taxa, recommendations for specimen preparation to improve visibility of diagnostic characters, and a discussion of future research directions.",

Its invasiveness is attributed, in part, to its fast growth rate that allows it to climb rapidly on neighboring vegetation and large reproductive output via aerially distributed spores that are borne on fertile leaves. We conducted a field study to determine the within-plant distribution of the biological control agent, Floracarus perrepae (Acariformes: Eriophyidae), the vertical distributions of fertile leaves, and to evaluate the potential productivity-reproduction tradeoff in L. microphyllum. The 3 m vertical trellises were spatially segregated with galls formed by F. perrepae at the bottom of the trellises and reproduction (i.e., the development of fertile leaves) at the top of the trellises. Galling occurred on 81% of leaves in the bottom stratum versus 40% of leaves in the uppermost stratum of the trellis. Conversely, only 16% of leaves in the bottom stratum versus 76% in the upper stratum were fertile (bore sori). With increasing biomass (i.e., larger plants) fewer reproductive leaves were noted, indicating a trade-off between growth and reproduction. This association was twice as strong in the very largest plants versus the smaller plants. Further, the potential for this productivity-reproduction tradeoff to be impacted by biological control agents may be illustrated by the strong negative correlation between galled leaves and fertile leaves. Lygodium microphyllum thus appears to compensate for mite damage by redirecting energy to regrowth instead of reproduction.",

Kuhn and Nephrodium filix-mas Rich.(= Dryopteris filix-mas (L.)

    "abstract": "Tree ferns are a characteristic growth form of tropical cloud and wet montane forests. In the Hawaiian Islands, native species of tree ferns are important components of rain forest ecosystems. Hawaiian rain forests and other native ecosystems are vulnerable to invasion by introduced plant species, especially with disturbance (Stone & Scott, 1985: Loope & Mueller-Dombois, 1989). Although 26 species of alien pteridophytes have become naturalized in Hawai'i (Hobdy, 1991; Wagner, 1950), not one was listed among the 86 most aggressive plant invaders of native Hawaiian ecosystems (Smith, 1985). This paper documents the distribution and ecology of the tree Cyathea cooperi, native to northeastern Australia, that has escaped from cultivation and is now naturalized in rain forests of several Hawaiian islands. It also provides some details on one invasive population on eastern Haleakala volcano on Maui island. Tree ferns occur predominantly in two families, Cyatheaceae (700 spp.) and Dicksoniaceae (30 spp.), and less commonly in other families, e.g. Blechnaceae, Dryopteridaceae, and Thelypteridaceae. In the Hawaiian Islands, native tree ferns occur in the families Dicksoniaceae with 5-6 endemic species in the genus Cibotium, Blechnaceae with 4-6 endemic species in the genus Sadleria, and several small tree species in the family Dryopteridaceae (Wagner, 1981, 1990; Lamoureux, 1984). Tree ferns in the large cosmopolitan genus Cyathea, known in Hawai'i as tree fern, have been in cultivation in the Hawaiian Islands at least since the 1960s (Neal, 1965) as ornamentals at homes and botanical gardens. Cyathea is widely planted locally since it is a hardy, attractive species, evocative of tropical settings, and is faster growing and more tolerant of warmer, drier conditions than native Hawaiian tree ferns (Cibotium spp.) Hawai'i's Australian tree fern has long been identified in Hawaiian botanical literature and the horticultural trade as Cyathea australis (R.Br.) Copel. (Neal, 1965).",

During a nine-month observation period these moths infested 87% of the ferns and 41% of their leaves. The damage caused by the moth larvae consisted of galleries bored into the petioles and rachis; however, this did not affect maximum leaf size. The galleries form a microhabitat that later can be colonized by ants. Among ten ant species found, two introduced tramp species, Tapinoma sessile and Wasmannia auropunctata were the most common ones. Because it does not produce domatia or extrafloral nectaries to attract ants directly, the giant leather-fern becomes an involuntary myrmecophyte by harboring ants in the moth-constructed galleries.",

    "abstract": "This paper deals with the Lunaria Group of moonworts, in particular the taxa that cluster around the Mingan moonwort, Botrychium minganense Victorin. We define the Lunaria Group as those moonworts with fan-shaped leaflets that more or less resemble B. lunaria (L.) Sw. The pinnae of the trophophore (leafy portion) may be fan-shaped, wedge-shaped, and/or spoonshaped, the veins dichotomous and lacking a distinct midrib, in contrast to the Lanceolatum Group in which the pinnae are linear, lanceolate, or ovate, the veins pinnately arranged and having a midrib. Whether or not these are truly natural groups is not yet known. It is possible that the flabellate pinna structure may result from homoplasy, rather than similarity by descent from a common ancestor. For example, the American winter grapefern, Botrychium lunarioides (Michx.) Sw., belongs to a very distinct section (Sceptridium) of the genus Botrychium but its pinnae have the same structure as B. lunaria. Frere Marie Victorin's (1927) publication of his new species, B. minganense, met with prolonged disagreement. By some it was associated with B. onondagense Underw., which is now considered to be a mere deep shade form of B. lunaria. Clausen (1938) believed that B. minganense freely intergraded with B. lunaria, and Morton (1952) wrote that the two taxa were scarcely distinguishable. Fernald (1950) reduced B. minganense to the status of a barely separable form. In 1952, W. Wagner & Lord (1956) studied the plants involved, in their natural habitats, and concluded that Victorin had actually been correct, and that B. minganense differs from B. lunaria in no less than 14 characters, including the chromosomes which number n = 90 rather than n = 45. Our more recent investigations confirm that, although widespread, B. minganense is endemic in North America, but B. lunaria is not only circumboreal, but occurs also in the southern hemisphere. Except for one species, B. boreale Sim, endemism in moonworts is practically unknown in the Old World. There are, however, only a few species. In North America, on the other hand, there is a remarkably diverse assortment of moonworts, including 14 endemics already published plus two more to be described here. The members of the Lunaria Group of moonworts now known in the United States and Canada include B. lunaria, B. minganense, B. crenulatum W. Wagner (Wagner & Wagner, 1981), and B. ascendens W. Wagner (Wagner & Wagner, 1986). The distinctness of the new ones discussed below has been solidly documented in only the past three years although it had been suspected earlier. A brief key to mature plants of this group is given here in the hope of promoting general interest and efforts by field workers to discover new populations of these rare and usually local plants.",

The plants were grown under laboratory conditions of 25 ± 2°C, a light intensity of 120 μmol m−2 s−1, and a 14-h photoperiod. After seven days of exposure to the Cu, Salvinia growth decreased gradually with an increase in Cu concentration resulting in a significant decline at 3.0 mg l−1Cu. Similar results were obtained after 14 days of exposure. However, calculating growth using fresh weight showed a significant decline at 2.5 and 3.0 mg l−1. After 14 days exposure, CO2 assimilation decreased as the Cu concentration increased in the growth media. This decrease in CO2 assimilation coincided with a similar decrease in photosynthetic pigments. Uptake of Cu significantly increased with the increase of Cu concentration in the growth media. This study demonstrated the potential of Salvinia to remediate Cu in concentrations 100 times what is currently found in freshwater environments.",

    "abstract": "One of the most distinct taxonomic groups in the genus Selaginella is the series Articulatae, comprised of about 40 taxa endemic to Latin America, one species that is in South Africa, the Azores and Latin America, and several that are restricted to Southeast Asia. This heterophyllous group, first described by Spring (1850) and maintained in later classifications by Hieronymus (1901) and Walton and Alston (1938), takes its name from the articulations located just below each bifurcation of the stem. These appear either as dark-colored swellings in living material or as dark constrictions in some dried specimens. Other morphological characteristics that unify the group are: (1) each strobilus has only a single (or rarely two) basal megasporangia; (2) each enlarged fertile megasporophyll is subtended by one or more enlarged sterile leaves; (3) the megaspores are exceptionally large and have high crestoreticulate muri; (4) the microspores are pale (usually buff to tan) and have ornamentation of sharp spines on their exines; and (5) the aerial roots arise dorsally from the stem. Also, about three-fourths of the taxa in the series have bistelar or multistelar stem anatomy, a feature not found elsewhere in the genus. During a taxonomic survey of the Articulatae, a previously undescribed type of microsporangium was found to be another unifying feature. A survey of nearly all of the articulate taxa and many non-articulate ones supported this generalization. An explanation of the survey and a description of the microsporangia follows.",

However, the pigments that contribute to this coloration are not known to have been identified. Harborne (1965) has identified a number of anthocyanins (3-deoxyanthocyanidins) found in the ferns Adiantum, Dryopteris, and Pteris. The purposes of this paper are to report on the identification of the anthocyanins in Azolla mexicana Presl and to describe the environmental factors which may influence this coloration. On 15 and 28 July 1975, I collected specimens ofA. mexicana Presl from a pond in southwestern Jackson County, Illinois. Some specimens were identified by W. Carl Taylor and me by their sporocarps, and regular and SEM photographs were made. Others of the collection were washed of epiphytes, blotted dry of excess water, and placed directly into a solution of 1% HC1 in methanol. The extracted pigments were separated by one dimensional paper chromatography employing three solvent systems [BAW (n-butanol: glacial acetic acid: water, 4:1:5, top layer), 1% HC1 in water, and Forestal (acetic acid: conc. HC1: water, 15:3:82)] on Whatman #1 chromatography paper (Harbore, 1967). Pigment spots were identified by visible and UV radiation and by comparing Rf values and coloration with those of published reports (Harbore, 1967). Tentatively identified anthocyanin spots were then cut out and extracted in 1% HCI in methanol and the resultant extract assayed with a Beckman DBGT Spectrophotometer to determine peak wavelength and height ratio.",

    "abstract": "Several authors (Scott & Hill, 1900; West & Takeda, 1915; Osborn, 1922; Duthie, 1929) mention that the corms of various species of Isoetes grow beneath the soil surface. Osborn gave the depth at which he found the corms of the adult plants as about two cm; some of the specimens of I. nuttallii supplied to me by Miss Vesta Hesse apparently grew at about the same depth, as indicated by the extent of the non-green, proximal portions of the sporophylls. Duthie reported finding corms at depths as great as 5-6 cm. Osborn and Duthie both worked with terrestrial species; I have found no references in the literature indicating the depth at which the corms of any aquatic species occur. However, the corms of aquatic species of Isoetes (mainly I. tuckermanii) that I collected from several localities in New Jersey, Connecticut, and Massachusetts generally were buried so that the upper surface of the corm was about level with the surface of the substrate. Where the plants grew on fairly coarse gravel, their corms were only partly buried. Observations on spore dispersal and gametophyte growth indicate that the gametophytes of some and probably all Isoetes species live on or near the surface of the substrate, but no suggestions appear in the literature as to how the sporophytes become buried. In some cases sedimentation is apparently partly responsible for the corms becoming buried in the substrate, but this did not appear to be significant around the plants at most of the localities where I collected them. In October 1971 and in September 1972 detached sporophylls of the aquatic I. tuckermanii were seen floating on Ames Long Pond in eastern Massachusetts. The same has been observed with sporophylls of I. bolanderi (Robert Dennis, pers. comm.). It is likely that water movement regularly detaches the bouyant, air filled sporophylls of the aquatic species as they begin to decay at the end of the growing season. As the sporophylls decay further, the sporangia and/or individual spores sink to the bottom, where presumably the gametophytes and sporelings develop. Isoetes tuckermanii sporelings in Ames Long Pond do indeed develop at or near the surface of the substrate, although their exact position was difficult to determine because of the extremely loose nature of the highly organic muck in which the plants were growing. In at least one terrestrial species (I. drummondii), spores are deposited on the soil surface (Osborn, 1922), and therefore it is possible that the gametophytes and sporelings also develop on the surface. Duthie (1929) reports that the spores of terrestrial species are dispersed in the soil by earthworms. Even if the germination of spores originally deposited upon the surface were delayed until they had somehow become passively buried, it seems unlikely that the sporelings of any species could survive at the depths at which adult corms are found, for the limited food reserves of Isoetes megagametophytes requires that the sporelings become nutritionally self-sufficient at an early age. The first few leaves of the sporeling are very",

    "abstract": "The sexual nature of Equisetum gametophytes has been problematic for many years and is still not settled. Hauke (1967) and Duckett (1970) gave good reviews of earlier studies on Equisetum gametophytes. There is now general agreement that some spores grow into small, sparsely plated,' antheridial gametophytes and others into larger, copiously plated, archegonial gametophytes. The latter subsequently produce antheridial lobes, and thus become bisexual (Hauke, 1969; Duckett, 1970, 1972). Antheridial gametophytes are usually shorter-lived than archegonial or bisexual gametophytes. There is a red pigment associated with antheridium formation, either in antheridial gametophytes or in antheridial lobes of bisexual gametophytes (Hauke & Thompson, 1973). LaRoche (1967) disagrees with the interpretation of bisexuality in Equisetum. He believes that the gametophytes are dioecious, and vegetatively propagate a second gametophyte generation, which may differ sexually from the first. Davis (1973) states that sex in Equisetum is environmentally induced and not genetically fixed, and Duckett (1970) more or less concurs. In an attempt to understand sexual determination in Equisetum gametophytes, various workers have grown them in culture under various conditions (Schratz, 1928; Orth, 1934; Wollersheim, 1957a, b; Hauke, 1968, 1969, 1971; Duckett, 1970, 1972; Ram & Chatterjee, 1970; Davis, 1973). LaRoche (1967) studied E. arvense gametophytes grown on various media, with varying pH and other external conditions. His results were expressed in time of development of antheridia, archegonia, and sporophytes, and he never spoke to the relative numbers of one sex or the other. Duckett (1970, 1972) was directly concerned with the percentage of antheridial gametophytes. Using isolated cultures in test tubes, he studied nine different species of Equisetum and the influence of three different media on their sexual development. His cultures were maintained for a year or longer. Ram and Chatterjee (1970), using both isolation cultures and mass cultures, studied the effects of pH, percent agar, yeast extract, chemical growth regulators, crowding, varying sucrose concentrations, and light intensity. They reported results as percent male, female, bisexual, or vegetative. Stephan (1928) apparently was the first to grow Equisetum gametophytes on agar in a defined medium. He was also the first to study the effect of light quality and intensity on Equisetum gametophyte development. Klebs (1917) earlier had studied the effect of blue and red light on fern gametophyte development (see the review of experimental studies on fern gametophytes by Miller, 1968). Orth (1934) used isolation cultures of Equisetum arvense and E. fluviatile to test the effect of a",

    "abstract": "Since the original description of Diplazium delitescens Maxon, no one has seriously questioned its generic disposition. However, a preliminary study of herbarium material of this uncommon neotropical species suggests that it might be better placed in Asplenium. Maxon relied chiefly on the back-to-back arrangement of linear sori in ascribing this species to Diplazium. In contrast, spleenworts generally have only single, linear sori on the ultimate veins. Although soral arrangement is the primary (and usually most reliable) character used to separate the two genera, I report here a survey of additional characters that provide good evidence for transferring D. delitescens to Asplenium. Sporangia.-The species of Asplenium consistently have one-rowed sporangial stalks, at least at the base (Bower, 1928, p. 140; Tardieu-Blot, 1932, p. 363) and sporangial capsules that often split divaricately at the tip of the fully extended or backwardly flexed annulus. Diplazium delitescens possesses both these characteristics (Fig. 1). Other species of Diplazium have shorter, twoor three-rowed sporangial stalks, with annuli often not extended and capsules not splitting divaricately at the tip, e.g., D. werckleanum Christ (Fig. 2). I have been unable to find any reference to this distinctive type of sporangial opening in Asplenium, but I believe it may be a very useful character in distinguishing asplenioid species from other groups of ferns. The number of annular cells inAsplenium is generally higher than in Diplazium. Tardieu-Blot (1932, p. 364) reported 15-20 annular cells for species of Diplazium and 20-25 annular cells for species of Asplenium. Copeland (1947, p. 147) listed Diplazium (inAthyrium) as having an of 12-20 (commonly 16) thickened cells, whereas Asplenium was described as having an usually of 20-28 cells. I have made five counts each onA. laetum Swartz (Breedlove 33893, DS), A. abscissum Willd. (Breedlove 22178, DS), A. harpeodes Kunze (Breedlove 22504, DS), and A. auriculatum Swartz (Breedlove 22506, DS); these species averaged 23, 20, 21, and 20 annulus cells per sporangium, respectively. Diplazium franconis Liebm. (Breedlove 22421, DS), D. lonchophyllum Kunze (Breedlove 22461, DS), D. acutale Fee (Breedlove 22760, DS), and D. werckleanum Christ (Breedlove 33664, DS) all averaged 15 annular cells per sporangium. Diplazium delitescens (Breedlove 33853, DS) averaged 21 annular cells per sporangium, which agrees with Asplenium. Spores.-Diplazium delitescens spores have numerous, sharp folds in the perispore (Fig. 3), and are similar to, or even indistinguishable from, spores of several species of Asplenium from southern Mexico and Central America, e.g., A.",

    "abstract": "The genus Anogramma comprises six or seven species characterized by the annual habit of the sporophytes and the remarkable perennating mechanism of the gametophytes. Goebel's studies (1877, 1889, 1905) indicate that the gametophytes of A. leptophylla and A. chaerophylla are proterandrous and develop a positively geotropic growth, the Fruchtsprosse or archegoniophore, which eventually bears the archegonia. The distal end of this archegoniophore becomes a food storage tubercle which enables the gametophyte to survive environmental adversity. Goebel reports that upon resumption of favorable conditions, dormant embryos develop quickly by drawing on the reserve foods, or the tubercle gives rise to a new prothallial surface. All published reports of this perennation mechanism in Anogramma have apparently been based on Goebel's laboratory cultures of these two species alone. Nor have Goebel's observations been verified throughout the extensive ranges of these species, except for a brief comment by Mehra and Verma (1960) on Indian A. leptophylla and Proskauer's (1964) interesting observations on Australian material of the same species. In an effort to determine the universality of this perennating mechanism in Anogramma, a comparative study of gametophyte development in all available species is underway in our laboratory.",

    "abstract": "The diversity and broad scope of the publications of Conrad Morton will strongly influence floristic, revisionary and nomenclatural studies of ferns. His series of papers on Thelypteris particularly show his many interests and accomplishments. The taxonomic work in the subgenus Meniscium (1938) is one of several done in collaboration with W. R. Maxon, his predecessor in Pteridology at the Smithsonian Institution. The paper on the classification of Thelypteris (1963b) shows his concern with the taxonomy of the whole group, while that on West Indian Thelypteris (1963a) shows his interest in ferns of the Caribbean area, and the one on California Thelypteris (1958) his attention to the ferns of his native state. His studies of fern types (1967a) and of the Michaux Herbarium (1967b) are important sources of information dealing with nomenclature and typification. This selection of his publications, over a period of thirty years, provides invaluable information on Thelypteris. We draw upon these in our study, particularly in relation to the nomenclature of Thelypteris palustris. The three species of Thelypteris-the Marsh Fern, T. palustris, the New York Fern, T. noveboracensis, and the Massachusetts Fern, T. simulata-have been found growing together at many different sites during our field studies in New England, over the past ten years. Thelypteris palustris grows in the wettest places that are usually inundated during part of the year. Thelypteris noveboracensis grows in drier sites, and T. simulata is usually in deep shade in wet, peaty soils, often in association with Sphagnum. Particular search has been made for plants intermediate between the species, but none have been found. Study of the materials of the three species in the Gray Herbarium, the Herbarium of the New England Botanical Club, the Pringle Herbarium, and the United States National Museum also yielded no specimens considered to be intermediates. The three species are distinctive and there is no evidence of hybridization between them. The distribution of the three species in eastern North America is shown in Fig. 1. Thelypteris palustris is the most wide-ranging species, T. noveboracensis does not extend as far south or west, and T. simulata has a rather restricted range. It has a notable disjunct station in the Driftless Area of Wisconsin (Hartley, 1965). Each of the species has close relations to the west. The same variety of T. palustris occurs in eastern Asia, T. noveboracensis is related to T. nevadensis of western North America and to T. beddomei and T. nipponica of eastern Asia, and T. simulata has close affinities with T. glanduligera and T. japonica of east-",

Comparisons are made with related and confusing taxa, B. campestre, B. crenulatum, B. lineare, and the American genotype of B. lunaria. Newfoundland plants display a high level of fixed heterozygosity and large spore size, indicating they are allotetraploid, and supporting suggestions that B. ascendens is derived from ancient hybridization between B. crenulatum and the B. lineare/campestre complex. The current distribution of Botrychium ascendens and its putative parents suggest it probably originated in western North America and migrated across northern Canada to Newfoundland.",

Among the different species, Platycerium coronarium, P. platylobium, P. ridleyi and P. wallichi are found in Peninsular Malaysia, and P. coronarium is considered the most attractive ornamentally. Platycerium coronarium is an epiphytic fern, bears a gigantic morphology and is native to tropical areas of South America, Africa, Southeast Asia, Australia and New Guinea. Platycerium coronarium nests on the upper branches of the tallest trees in the forest. Due to having a uniquely-shaped fronds, they are famous for ornamental purposes, where they can be found in gardens, especially in tropical regions. Detailed morphological studies of this species are lacking. In the present work, data are reported aiming at defining both the macro- and micro-morphological characteristics of intact and in vitro P. coronarium. Data from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed similar ultrastructures of both types of leaves, i.e., the presence of multicellular trichomes on both the abaxial and adaxial surfaces. Sunken stomata were also detected on the abaxial surface of the leaves. In addition, tissue culture studies were done to obtain an efficient regeneration system as well as to serve as an approach for conservation. Successful regeneration of sporophytes from gametophyte explants were observed in MS medium supplemented with 1.0–1.5 mg/l GA3 and 30 g/l sucrose, at pH 5.8 under 16 hours light and 8 hours dark.",

The test of Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) against Escherichia coli, Staphyloccocus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, C. krusei and C. tropicalis was evaluated using the microdilution method, resulting in inhibitory concentrations ≥ 1024 µg/mL. Using a subinhibitory concentration of 128 µg/mL of EELV, the modulatory potential of the extract was tested against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates, resulting in synergism when combined with Gentamicin and actually altering the phenotype of S. aureus from sensitive to resistant. The extract also increased the effect of the kanamycin against S. aureus. This was the first report of modulatory antibiotic activity by a member of Lygodium.",

    "abstract": "Glyphosate, a systemic herbicide, is used against weeds in agricultural fields as well as against invasive plants in pastures, forest plantations, and urban environments. Its frequent and widespread use can negatively impact the surrounding natural non-target vegetation following the accidental drift of spray droplets, leaching, or persistence as residues in the soil. Because ferns possess a life cycle with independent sporophytic and gametophytic generations, herbicides may cause a different impact on each life stage. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of four concentrations of glyphosate (0.33, 0.65, 2.72, and 10.89 g active ingredient L-1) and water as control treatments on spores, gametophytes, and two sporophyte size classes of one native (Blechnum appendiculatum Willd.) and two introduced fern species in Mexico (Macrothelypteris torresiana (Gaudich.) Ching and Thelypteris dentata (Forssk.) E.P. St.John). Spore germination was evaluated 10 days after herbicide treatment and the percentage of remaining green tissue was measured at 7, 30, and 90 days after herbicide treatment. Plant survival was determined at the end of the experiment. Glyphosate suppressed spore germination nearly completely and increased tissue discoloration of all green life stages at higher concentrations and after longer time intervals. After 7 and 30 days, small sporophytes of all three species were significantly more discolored than gametophytes and large sporophytes at concentrations ≤ 0.65 g a.i. L-1, although after 90 days differences among life stages were no longer significant, and no life stage survived at concentrations ≥ 2.72 g a.i. L-1. At the lowest concentration (0.33 g a.i. L-1), however, 50–69% of the plants of all three species and life stages survived after 90 days post-treatment. Macrothelypteris torresiana was significantly more tolerant to glyphosate than the other two species during the first 30 days after treatment, mainly because of its less damaged small sporophytes, perhaps due to a thicker waxy cuticle that may initially reduce herbicide absorption in this species. We conclude that even glyphosate concentrations of 0.33 g a.i. L-1 may negatively impact natural spore banks of ferns and result in mortality of 31–50% of all green life stages. Such negative effects may also eliminate at least the most susceptible fern species in habitats that are frequently exposed to such glyphosate concentrations.",

Eight previously recorded populations were found to have been extirpated. Decline in natural populations of C. pteridoides has resulted from the destruction or complete loss of its primary habitat. Analysis of 17 parameters of water quality indicated that differences in pH and dissolved oxygen might be principal factors determining the distribution and occurrence of C. pteridoides. The sites of the extirpated populations had higher water pH values than those of the sites of the extant populations (p < 0.05). The value of dissolved oxygen concentration at the sites of the extirpated populations was lower than at the sites of the extant populations (p < 0.05). The degeneration of primary habitats, a decline in the area of wetland coverage and deterioration of water quality caused by human activities are identified as the likely key factors responsible for the reduction in C. pteridoides populations. Because the habitat and population characteristics of eleven remaining populations were different, different sites should adopt different conservation methods as appropriate. Some small populations could be conserved by establishing conservation areas; other relatively large populations could be conserved by establishing nature reserves.",

We show that C. crispum and C. herbaceum are the correct names for two of the species, and we designate lectotypes for these two names. The third species, which ranges from Brazil to Argentina and Paraguay, lacks a name and is here newly described as C. atlanticum. Two of the previously used names, C. acrocarpon and C. wacketii, are considered synonyms of C. crispum. The remaining names, C. lapathifolium and C. minus, appear to be of uncertain application. Based on our field studies, C. atlanticum and C. herbaceum are primary hemiepiphytes. Our finding constitutes the first report of this growth habit in the genus. The third Brazilian species treated herein, C. crispum, varies in growth habit, being either terrestrial, primary hemiepiphytic, or holoepiphytic. The spores of the three species are uniform and typical of the genus; they do not provide any distinguishing characters for the species.",

In this paper, the association between some climatic features and patterns of geographic differentiation in American tree ferns was evaluated. For this, the occurrence ranges of 190 species were plotted and then analysed using track analysis. Here we identify six generalised tracks that span the main highland regions of tropical America: the Andes, the Guyana Highlands, the Brazilian Atlantic coast, lower Central America, the Greater Antilles, and upper Central America-Mexico. We did not find an association between cloud forest habitat and the differentiation pattern revealed by generalised tracks in Central America. Instead, these patterns are congruent with well-documented geological boundaries in the region. Climatic variables associated with cloud forest habitat were extracted from each generalised track and subjected to ANOVA, showing that most tracks have equivalent climates. The Andean track showed significant climatic differences with the Brazilian and Guyanan tracks, which were associated with main habitat discontinuities. From these results, we propose that historical isolation has been important in promoting geographical differentiation in tree ferns and that differentiation by dispersal cannot fully explain the large-scale geographical patterns observed in tree ferns.",

Twenty-two prothallia were collected at this station, one alone bearing a prominently developed sporeling. A few days later a single prothallium of the same species with an emerging sporophyte was found at a station close by. Shortly afterward a find of a number of prothallia of L. alopecuroides, many with sporelings attached, was made in a wet spot bordering a swamp at Weekstown, Atlantic County, New Jersey. On October 19, 1938, the original station and other colonies of L. alopecuroides along the border of the same bog were searched, and this and subsequent searches yielded 60 gametophytes. On the same day it was discovered that Lycopodium carolinianum L. covered a portion of the floor of the same bog. Careful search was made, and prothallia of this species also were found abundantly, both with and without sporelings attached. A station of Lycopodium adpressum (Chapm.) Lloyd & Underw. in an old sand pit with damp, savannah-like bottom at Crowleytown, Burlington County, New Jersey, was selected for search on October 22, 1938. Seven gametophytes and considerable sporeling material were collected. These finds were made at typical stations of the mature plants in the pine-barren region of southern New Jersey. They appear to form the first records for gametophytes of these species and, further, the first notice of gametophytes of the aerial type in America. 53",

It is the largest of the numerous artificial islands in Gatun Lake, covering approximately six square miles, and being about three miles in diameter, with a very irregular shore line of nearly 25 miles. Before water was turned into the Canal, this area formed a part of the hills bordering the Chagres River. It is now separated from the mainland on one side by only a narrow channel (one of the French diversion canals) ; on the other side stretches the wide expanse of the lake, along whose farther shore runs the railroad that traverses the Isthmus and connects the cities of Col6n and Panama. The topography is irregular. There are numerous hills, often with steep sides and separated by gullies or ravines through which flow small clear streams. The highest point is 537 feet above sea level, and 450 feet above the average level of Gatun Lake. The name Barro Colorado signifies red clay, and, considering the nature of the soil, it is a highly appropriate name. Most of the island is covered with a dense forest, altogether typical of the lowlands of the Atlantic slope of Central America. Probably it is not a truly virgin forest, since there can be little land close to the Canal from which trees have not been cut at one time or another; but in a region so favorable for plant growth openings made by clearing, if not too extensive, are invaded",

    "abstract": "While collecting woody plants for the Arnold Arboretum, west of the Mississippi River, in the autumn of 1923, I spent several days in October on Magazine Mountain, in Logan County, Arkansas. This proved to be an extremely interesting locality both for its ligneous and herbaceous plants. Amongst a few of the latter class collected were two ferns, which I did not at once recognize (as familiar species for that part of the country). These turn out to be Dennstaedtia punctilobula (Michx.) Moore and Woodsia scopulina D. C. Eaton, both of which, so far as I know, have not been found before in the state nor in that region. Magazine Mountain is an isolated flat-topped eminence, rising about 2000 feet above the surrounding valleys, and with its summit reaching a height of about 2800 feet above sea level. The formation is Pennsylvanian sandstone and shale. The mountain sides are steep, and the summit is bounded by a rim of precipitous bluffs in most places. On the north side these attain in places a perpendicular height of perhaps 200 feet or more, with remarkable accumulations of talus at their base. The top of the mountain is a level tableland, about seven miles in length and from a quarter to three quarters of a mile wide. Deciduous woods, with a small percentage of yellow pine (Pinus echinata), and with many small prairie openings, characterize the general region. The slopes of the mountain are heavily wooded, especially on the north side, where most of the rarer species occur. Oaks, hickories, sweet and black gum, red and sugar maple, linden, cucumber tree, buckeye, chinquapin and many other trees constitute the forest. The herbaceous growth shows much diversity at different levels, and 39",

The woods were full of singing birds and blooming flowers, and the ferns were flaunting high their lacey fronds welcoming the lover of nature to their haunts. For two reasons I made this trip. One was to explore new territory, and the other was to revisit Bucks Pocket, Ala., where I had found Trichomanes petersii, to see how it looked in spring-time, also to get live specimens for members who had requested them. I left home at daylight traveling at a brisk walk to see how far I could go in an hour. After covering three miles I crossed Miller creek, where, just a mile below I knew was the beautiful fall under whose protection grew large patches of Trichomanes boschianum Sturm, and where today I would not be surprised to find Trichomanes petersii establishing itself, for on my return I set several bunches of that fern which I brought back with me from Bucks Pocket. I walked another mile before the first hour had expired. Four miles in one hour is not so bad. After crossing Miller creek I came upon a colony of pitcher plants, Sarracenia catesbaei Ell. I had found them before but here were some nice specimens a few of which I put in my press. Traveling on for several hours I came to the town of Rosalie. By this time it was nearly noon. After eating a hasty lunch I passed on and came to Brier creek where a little surprise was awaiting me. By the roadside I saw several trilliums which were new to me. After",

I discuss my initial work on discovery of new species of Botrychium and the utilization of enzyme electrophoresis as an early methodology for establishing species' individual genetic characterization and their relationships among species, emphasizing the importance of codominant nuclear markers for detection of allopolyploid parentages. I review the unusual predominance of allopolyploidy in Botrychium and discuss possible reasons for this relative to breeding systems, and describe a new pathway for overcoming hybrid sterility without polyploidy. I discuss the inadequacy of wind as a universal dispersal mechanism in Botrychium, and suggest avian dispersal as an under-appreciated spore dispersal mechanism. Throughout I note unresolved issues of Botrychium biology and suggest areas of needed research. Lastly, I discuss the unique characteristics of Botrychium that have allowed this lineage to persist through universal ecological disruptions and massive extinctions and compete successfully in modern ecosystems, and the morphological similarities of its descendants to early land plants.",

    "abstract": "The gametophytes of homosporous pteridophytes, being free-living and independent of the sporophyte, experience an immediacy with the external environment unique among the gametophytes of vascular plants. As a result, the environment directly influences the demographics of homosporous fem gametophytes, particularly their distribution, development, and mating systems. Because most homosporous fern gametophytes are photosynthetic, require light to germinate, and develop gametangia sequentially, environmental factors that alter the quantity and quality of light to neighboring spores and gametophytes may stimulate asynchronous germination, growth, and sexual maturation. The influence of environmental factors upon the population biology of fern gametophytes may be augmented by the production of antheridiogens. The meristematic gametophytes of some species have been shown to produce antheridiogens or as yet unspecified metabolites that generate effects (induced germination in darkness, precocious maleness, and delayed development of a notch-meristem) in ameristic neighbors (Naf, 1963, 1975; Schedlbauer & Klekowski, 1972; Hamilton, 1989; Haufler & Gastony, 1989; Schneller, et al., 1990). In some species, individuals with notch-meristems are insensitive to antheridiogen (Niif, 1963). In such species, asynchronous growth and development among neighbors is essential for an antheridiogen to influence the gender composition of a population. Microvariation in soil topography may alter the availability of light to spores and their ensuing gametophytes. Spores shed on well-illuminated regions of a heterogeneous soil profile are likely to germinate early compared to less-illuminated neighbors. The resulting gametophytes will mature rapidly, and through the action of an antheridiogen, influence the germination and sexual expression of neighbors in poorly illuminated regions. Because antheridiogens are water soluble and of uncertain stability in the environment (Naf, 1963), and because homosporous fern gametophytes require water for fertilization, the proximity of neighboring gametophytes may be another important determinant of gender composition and mating systems. For example, the probability that colonizing gametophytes are reproductively isolated is associated with a higher probability of selfing, resulting in genetically homozygous progeny without genetic load (Lloyd 1974a, 1974b; Crist & Farrar, 1983; McCauley, et al., 1985; Soltis, et al., 1988; Peck, et al., 1990; Holsinger, 1991; Watano & Masuyama, 1991). Alternatively, in taxa producing dense gametophyte populations, close proximity may facilitate interactions between neighbors, leading to outcrossing mating systems, high levels of genetic load, and heterozygous sporophytes (Lloyd, 1974a, 1974b, 1988; Singh & Roy, 1977; Duckett & Duckett, 1980; Soltis & Soltis, 1986, 1987; Soltis, et al., 1988; Holsinger, 1991). Thus, by decreasing distances between neighbors, dense spore-rain may amplify the influences that asynchronous germination and development have on the sexual expression and mating system of a population and low densities of spore-rain may result in distances too large for interactions among gametophytes (Cousens & Horer, 1970; Tryon & Vitale, 54",

As more species have been included in these investigations, it has become evident that one set of cultural conditions is not effective for all species. For the species examined to date, darkness is needed for spore germination and sugar is necessary for growth of these nonphotosynthetic gametophytes. However, variations in the mineral content, nitrogen source, and temperature are needed to promote or allow gametophyte formation from spores in some species (Whittier, 1981; Melan & Whittier, 1990). Since variation exists in the requirements for gametophyte development in culture for the terrestrial species, an examination of the conditions necessary for gametophyte development of an epiphytic species was undertaken. It seemed appropriate to determine if there was anything unusual about the conditions that are necessary to obtain gametophytes of epiphytic species from spores. Ophioglossum palmatum, an epiphyte native to the United States, was selected for testing. In Florida, this Ophioglossum typically grows on cabbage palms (Mesler, 1975), however there is one report of it growing on saw palmettos (Nauman & Moyroud, 1986). The objectives of this study were to determine the requirements for spore germination, the pattern of early gametophyte development, and the possibility of raising mature gametophytes in axenic culture.",

Net photosynthesis occurred throughout the study indicating a potential for movement of fixed carbon from wintergreen fronds to other parts of the plant. Nitrogen and phosphorus content in the old fronds did not change through spring, thus no evidence for net retranslocation of these nutrients from wintergreen fronds to the rest of the plant was obtained.

    "abstract": "Primary divergence may be defined as differentiation among populations of homoploid organisms caused by natural selection; it often results in the formation of new species or subspecies. This definition excludes the relatively instantaneous processes of polyploidy and hybrid species formation. Monographers of pteridophyte genera name and describe species and have perforce been the individuals forced to deal with problems of primary divergence and the delimitation of species. Since scant literature exists addressing species concepts for pteridophytes, we have contrasted specific examples of usage from modern systematic treatments by various workers. We examined a sample of 50 monographs completed during the last 50 years by 36 authors (Table 1). Only 12 (24%) of these monographs contained any explicit discussion of the criteria for the species concepts and/or infraspecific categories employed, so that our analysis of these topics is based largely on inference. We perceive that three general types of species concepts have been used singly or in concert by pteridologists: the biological, morphological, and (for lack of a better term) concepts. The biological concept is used here in the somewhat restricted sense of genetic intersterility between species and states that if two taxa can cross to produce fertile offspring, then they are the same species. This concept has rarely been used in fern systematics because data on cross-fertilization is difficult to obtain. Hennipman and Roos (1982), however, used the ability of gametophytes to cross as evidence for reducing four taxa accepted by Hoshizaki (1972) as species to subspecies or varieties of Platycerium bifurcatum, even though the subsumed taxa were geographically and/or ecologically distinct. In contrast, the morphological concept is the recognition of discrete taxa on the basis of breaks of form, with no knowledge of the ability to hybridize. Of course, what constitutes such morphological discontinuities can be quite subjective and contentious. This concept is the tacit species concept of most fern monographers who have worked from herbarium specimens alone. The look-alike concept is similar to the morphological concept (and might best be considered a subset of it) in that both delimit taxa by morphological discontinuities. It differs, however, in that it classifies taxa hierarchically as species or varieties based upon relative morphological similarities-an author may classify two morphologically distinct entities as varieties because they look alike, when by strict morphological criteria they might otherwise have been treated as separate species. An example is the Lycopodium obscurum complex studied by Hickey (1977). He clarified the taxonomy of this group by showing that a new taxon, L. isophyllum, was morphologically distinct from L. obscurum and L. dendroideum. Hickey classified isophyllum as a variety of L. obscurum rather than as a separate species, because of closer resemblance of",

The longest frond height, frond quantity, fresh and dry mass, and RGR were observed in plants growing in 10% of irradiance. Plants kept under 100% irradiance died after 3 days, and under 50% and 75% irradiance they died gradually after 30 days. The fresh mass/dry mass ratio was higher at 3% and lower at 30% irradiance. The levels of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll were higher in the plants grown at 3% irradiance. The levels of chlorophyll did not vary between 10 and 30% irradiance, with the exception of chlorophyll a, which was lower under 30% irradiance. The chlorophyll a/chlorophyll b ratio did not vary among treatments.

It is this mimicry, coupled with the occasional intergradation between L. obscurum var. obscurum and L. obscurum var. isophyllum, that is largely responsible for the belief that there is complete intergradation between L. obscurum and L. dendroideum. The general morphology and growth habit of all three taxa are so similar that in the individual descriptions mention will be made only of those characters where significant differences have been noted. All of the taxa dealt with in this paper share the following characteristics: Subterranean rhizome clothed with sparse, broad and rounded, scale-like leaves; rhizome anisodichotomously branched with 1 upright leafy aerial shoot and 1 usually weak secondary rhizome produced each year; aerial shoots 8.0-19.0 (mean 12.5) cm from soil level to the base of the strobili, with 3 or 4 lateral branch systems along the aerial axis, each system dichotomously branched 3 or 4 times to produce 8-16 lateral branchlets. Growth of the entire aerial shoot system is also similar in the three taxa. It continues for 4-5 years, and microphyll constrictions are present throughout the aerial portions. Dichotomous branching in the lateral branch systems is concentrated in the second growth season, with occasional dichotomies formed during the third growth season as well. Leaves of the lateral branchlets are normally 6-ranked and in two pseudowhorls of three leaves apiece, producing a phyllotactic fraction of 2/6. All leaves are strongly decurrent.

Sequences were assessed as evolutionarily neutral (Tajima's criterion D = −0.80683, P > 0.10 and Fu and Li's test D* = 1.42648, P > 0.05; F* = 0.76638, P > 0.10). Eight haplotypes were identified based on a statistical parsimony algorithm. A high level of haplotype diversity (h = 0.618) and a low nucleotide diversity (Dij = 0.00208) were detected in A. podophylla. Populations from Hainan shared common haplotypes with those from Guangdong. A network and a NJ tree constructed from cpDNA haplotypes both suggested a close genetic relationship among populations distributed in Hainan and Guangdong. Observed FST (=0.10537), gene flow Nm (=2.12), AMOVA (Only 0.49% of variation was partitioned among regions, P = 0.09), and DNA divergence data consistently indicated that no geographical differentiation occured at the interregional level. Geographic isolation has not yet resulted in population differentiations within A. podophylla populations in Hainan and Guangdong. Phylogeographical patterns of atpB-rbcL haplotypes demonstrate a ‘star-like’ feature, which means that populations of A. podophylla have experienced population expansion, and, since then there has been insufficient time to form a more complicated population structure. The majority of haplotypes coalesced near the tip of the NJ tree, indicating recent coalescence events as well. Moreover, a demographic signature of population expansion was detected by mismatch distribution analysis of atpB-rbcL sequences of A. podophylla.",

    "abstract": "Mature gametophytes of Botrychium from nature have been described for several species, including B. dissectum (Bierhorst, 1958), B. japonicum (Nozu, 1954; Nishida, 1955), B. lunaria (Bruchmann, 1906), B. obliquum (Campbell, 1921), B. simplex (Campbell, 1922), and B. virginianum (Jeffrey, 1898; Bierhorst, 1958). The gametophytes are subterranean and are tuberous or somewhat elongate to button-shaped. They vary from 1-3 mm to 5-6 mm long, and even reach 1.5-2 cm in some species. The possession of a dorsal ridge in which antheridia are embedded is a typical feature of all the known species. The gametophytes have an associated endophytic fungus, the presence of which presumably is essential for continued growth under natural conditions. Botrychium spores appear to have a dormancy that is not easily overcome. To date, only the spores of B. virginianum (Campbell, 1895), B. ternatum (du Buysson, 1889), and more recently of B. dissectum (Whittier, 1972, 1973a) have been germinated, the last species in axenic culture. The morphology of the B. dissectum gametophytes cultured by Whittier (1972) fits the description for B. dissectum from nature, except for the presence of the endophytic fungus. Sucrose and other additives in the medium presumably replaced the contribution of the fungus under natural conditions. The gametophytes, when sexually mature, were only a few millimeters long. Whittier (1973a) has shown that light inhibits spore germination in B. dissectum. He found that a minimum of 3-4 weeks in darkness is necessary for germination to occur after eight weeks in culture. Increasing the length of the dark period increased the percentage of germination. It is interesting to note that Whittier (1973b) showed that six months of darkness were required for the germination of Psilotum spores. In this paper we will describe the morphology of Botrychium multifidum (Gmel.) Rupr. gametophytes as grown on a defined medium in axenic culture. The gametophytes of B. multifidum have never been observed carefully in nature.",

Iwatsuki (1961) confirms this identification and briefly discusses the general habitat and distribution of the species. Specimens of Mecodium wrightii collected by my bryological colleague, Dr. W. B. Schofield, are the basis for the following notes and observations. The sporophyte of this fern has been collected several times at Dawson Inlet, Graham Island, and in the summer of 1966 Dr. Schofield collected abundant fruiting material at the head of Van Inlet, which is the next large inlet north of Dawson Inlet (Plate 1B). In 1961 Schofield (1962) collected a puzzling hepatic-like plant that was growing freely on wet cliffs on the mainland about 100 miles northeast of Dawson Inlet. Careful study of his material (Schofield 13945) satisfied him that it was not a bryophyte, but was more likely a hymenophyllaceous gametophyte. In 1965 an ample collection of similar material was made on Biorka Island, Alaska, by Dr. A. Mathieson. This plant is now known from seven different localities. Despite the different seasons of collection the plants are remarkably uniform in morphology; all are surely the same kind of plant. The thallus is consistently one cell thick with no differences in cell shape except for those of the margin that may develop into rhizoids. It is",

In order to determine whether any of the Pteridophytes require boron, a true fern, Dryopteris dentata (Forsk.) C. Chr., and a club moss, Selaginella apoda (L.) Fern., were selected. For the former, very small sporophytes, with well-developed roots and a degenerating prothallus still present, were obtained in the University greenhouses. For the latter, terminal pieces of growth, approximately 5 cm. in length, were collected, taking care to use pieces whose aerial roots had not made contact with the soil. This precaution avoided the necessity of removing soil particles which might have contained boron. Both types of plants were raised on quartz sand in plastic containers. The sand had been treated with 10% sulfuric acid, and then thoroughly leached with demineralized water and, later, quartz-distilled water. Quartz-distilled water was also used in the nutrient solutions. The cultures were placed under a plastic-covered frame in the greenhouse to increase the humidity around the young plants and to prevent possible contamination of boron from dust or from the tap water spray applied to nearby plants.

Plants of D. geniculata held an average of 8.11 ± 2.16 leaves that were produced and died at similar rates of 4.44 ± 2.16 leaves y−1 and 4.20 ± 2.28 leaves y−1, respectively. Leaf lifespan was 24.7 ± 7.5 mo for sterile leaves and 5.6 ± 0.6 mo for fertile leaves. Leaf production and fertility increased with rainfall, but decreased with temperature, because of the local climate, which is characterized by higher rainfall during the colder winter months. On the other hand, leaf mortality increased during drier and hotter months. Leaf production and fertility of other species were fit into three categories and compared with D. geniculata. The leaf phenology of D. geniculata neither coincided with species at the same site nor with species within the same family (Marattiaceae), indicating that even coexisting or closely related species can adapt individually to the macro- and microclimatic parameters of their habitats.",

Therefore, it seems likely that aquaporins would have a key role in water balance in xerophytic ferns, particularly in the gametophyte stage. To investigate the role of aquaporins in desiccation avoidance in xerophytic ferns gametophytes, Cheilanthes lanosa gametophytes were poisoned with micromolar mercury solutions, which block aquaporin channels, exposed to several osmolytes, and quantified the efflux of water from the cells was quantified. Results strongly suggest that aquaporins may very well play a role in water balance, but also pose some questions concerning the ability of the protonemal stage to fully manage water flow.",

We sequenced four plastid regions (rbcL, rps4, rps4-trnS spacer, and trnL-F spacer) from 223 accessions across ca. 38 species. Our goals were to: 1) attempt to identify problematic Marsilea specimens from the southeastern U.S., and 2) assess species delimitation using molecular data. Florida specimens previously identified as M. aff. oligospora do not match true M. oligospora (native to the western USA), and might represent an undescribed native species. The molecular data fail to resolve many species as monophyletic within the New World Marsilea section Nodorhizae. The data reveal two strongly supported clades within section Nodorhizae 1) A western U.S. /Mexican clade; and 2) A U.S. Gulf coastal plain/Florida/Caribbean clade. This DNA/morphology discordance suggests that these taxa either may have hybridized extensively or that the number of Marsilea species within these clades may be overestimated. Either case warrants the addition of nuclear data sets and reevaluation of the species boundaries within the genus.",

This paper attempts to summarize much of this information. The species known to have been used by the western North American Indians north of Mexico are discussed below. The botanical nomenclature is according to Munz (1959). LYCOPODIUM CLAVATUIM L. Club-moss. Although there is no evidence for use of this species by western Indians, Frye (1934) reported its spores were collected for dusting on open raw wounds and chafed infants. The spores are very fine and light, which enables them to repel water and prevent stickiness. Lycopodium selago L., a related species in the northwest was used by Indians as an intoxicant. The stem was chewed and the juice swallowed. It is said that three plants produced a mild intoxication whereas eight plants stupified the user. EQUISETJM ARVENSE L. Common horsetail. The major use of the horsetails was as an abrasive in polishing bows and arrows (Murphey, 1959). However, it was sometimes dried and burned and the ashes used on sore mouths.

While reference genomes have been completed for Azolla filiculoides and Salvinia cucullata, they lack transformation capability. Meanwhile, other ferns including Marsilea vestita, Adiantum capillus-veneris, Pteris vittata, and Ceratopteris richardii have transformation methods, but lack genomic resources. Nevertheless, as genome sequencing becomes increasingly more affordable, we believe that M. vestita and C. richardii can become powerful fern models, which represent heterosporous and homosporous ferns, respectively.",

No existing fern book, he points out, contains anything of the sort which is up to date or approaches completeness;1 he thinks a full enumeration would be of use to those interested in the variations of our ferns, in naming their finds and generally in orienting themselves. What follows is the first installment of an attempt to meet this request. If, on trial, it proves really to meet a need, it will be continued. Some preliminary explanation of method is necessary. It is assumed that the different species are known; only sufficient description of them is given to indicate the typical form. If a species is not mentioned at all, that means that no varieties have been described under it. Except in some special cases, no account is taken of varieties which have been regarded as such by some botanists and as species by others-Thelypteris cristata var. Clintoniana, for instance. These, as a rule, are sufficiently accounted for in the books. Some recently proposed species, however, the status of which is still in doubt, are discussed. In species common to both America and Europe, only forms known to occur in the former are included. It must be remembered, however, that many American forms were first described by European botanists; reference to their works will consequently often be made.

    "abstract": "There is considerable evidence that fern prothallia are like many other plants in that they will extend their lifespan if kept from reproducing. Most fern gametophytes produce sporophytes within a few months after spore germination, and then die. In 1927, Mottier (5) reported keeping alive the prothallia of Osmunda Claytoniana L. and Pteretis nodulosa (Michx.) Nieuwl. for 3? and 4 years, respectively. He concluded from his study that the continuation shoots of prothallia are able to grow indefinitely. Further evidence at Marietta College substantiates this finding. In the fall of 1938 several kinds of fern spores (Adiantum pedatum L., Asplenium platyneuron (L.) Oakes, Camptosorus rhizophyllus (L.) Link, and Polystichum acrostichoides (Michx.) Schott) were sown on a sterile inverted flower pot filled with Sphagnum. The pot had been placed in a deep culture dish containing Knop's nutrient solution; over it a glass bell-jar was placed after the spores were sown. During the next few months, hundreds of prothallia appeared, forming a rather dense covering over most of the pot. At one time, in the early stages, the culture was invaded by molds; these fungi were eliminated by spraying the pot lightly with a fresh weak solution of potassium permanganate, and by occa. sionally adding a few small grains of the same chemical to the nutrient solution. Except for this spraying, the culture received all its moisture by capillarity from below. The bell-jar served not only to keep the atmosphere humid, but also to keep out air-borne contamination. Because of overcrowding, watering by subirrigation, and perhaps the application of potassium permanganate solution, very few gametophytes ever produced sporophytes. 109",

    "abstract": "Although Jeffrey (1937) provided a convincing cytological and morphological argument for the existence of hybrids between natural populations of Isoetes in North America over 50 years ago, a systematic and broadly-based investigation of this phenomena has been undertaken only recently. Boom (1980; 1982) showed that various eastern North American species could be hybridized in culture. On the basis of herbarium studies he also reported several naturally occurring hybrid combinations. Taylor et al. (1985) established geographical, cytological and electrophoretic evidence for the existence of naturally occurring Iso6tes hybrids. They showed that the uncommon northeastern North American diploid taxon I. x eatonii Dodge is a sterile hybrid between I. echinospora Dur. and I. engelmannii A. Br., and they made in vitro hybridizations between these parental species. Two other naturally occurring Iso6tes hybrids from northeastern North America have been recently discovered. Taylor and Luebke (1988) reported I. x hickeyi (I. echinospora x macrospora [lacustris]) from Wisconsin and Britton & Brunton (1989) identified I. x dodgei A. A. Eaton (pro sp.) as I. echinospora x riparia Dur. from Ontario, Quebec, Vermont and New Hampshire. All of these interspecific hybrids were initially detected by their production of irregular megaspores which are more varied in size, shape and surface ornamentation than megaspores of parental species. This paper describes another Isoetes hybrid from northeastern North America. it is believed to be the result of hybridization between I. engelmannii and I. riparia. Nine plants of this hybrid have been found, each demonstrating combinations of the characters expressed by Isoetes hybrids, viz, plants with hybrid vigour, aborted spores of variable size and shape, and spores with surface ornamentation patterns more or less intermediate between the putative parents (Jeffrey, 1937; Taylor & Luebke, 1988; Britton & Brunton, 1989). Further evidence supporting the hybrid nature of this taxon comes from its chromosome number, its sporadic occurrence within the partially sympatric ranges of its putative parents and its constant association with one of its parents at each station.",

    "abstract": "Several techniques have been described recently for germinating spores of aquatic species of Isoetes which grow in lakes, ponds, and streams in eastern North America. Boom (1980) used glass vials containing sterile sand and pond water in which he successfully raised sporelings of I. engelmannii, I. flaccida, I. macrospora, and I. riparia. Kott and Britton (1982) germinated spores of I. acadiensis, I. echinospora, I. macrospora, I. riparia, and I. tuckermanii in small vials half filled with distilled water. However, many of their vials became contaminated with fungi that destroyed the viability of the megaspores. Sam (1982) germinated megaspores of I. engelmannii in an inorganic nutrient medium supplemented with Nystatin to inhibit fungi. Webster (1979) described a technique for germinating spores of Selaginella that is similar to the following procedure we use for Isoetes. We have been culturing plants from spores of Isoetes acadiensis, I. echinospora, I. engelmannii, I. hieroglyphica, I. macrospora, I. riparia, and I. tuckermanii for use in germination and hybridization experiments for several years. The aquatic species of Isoetes are ideal pteridophytes for germination and hybridization experiments. Their sporangia are large and contain many spores. Megaspores and microspores are borne in different sporangia on separate leaves. If necessary, unopened sporangia can be excised from sporophylls intact and surface cleansed to eliminate extraneous spore contamination. Thus, megaspores and microspores can be completely isolated for controlled breeding experiments. Also, their spores readily germinate in demineralized water and gametophytes and sporophytes develop normally for several months without supplemental nutrients. Spores are obtained from plants collected in September and October, since plants harvested earlier in the year may not have mature, viable spores. Isoetes hieroglyphica and I. macrospora retain their spores through the winter, so mature spores of these species can also be gathered in the spring. Megaspores are cleansed of microspores in a sieving apparatus made of plastic tubing approximately 10 cm long and 2.5 cm in diameter. An 8 cm square of 0.27 mm sifter mesh (available from Carolina Biological Supply Company) is fitted to one end of the tubing with a rubber band. The sieving apparatus, containing megaspores, is attached to a water faucet using plastic strapping tape. Spores are washed with a steady flow of cold water for 30 minutes, followed by a one minute rinse with sterile, demineralized water. Although megaspore surfaces appear clean after the above treatment, unopened sporangia are preferred for crossing experiments because there is less chance of contamination from microspores. Intact sporangia can be excised from",

In 1967 Morton wrote, Evidence ... has been accumulating in recent years that there are two major groups of species-those centering around the true Polypodium, as typified by P. vulgare L., and those belonging to Grammitis Swartz and some closely related small genera. Ching (1940) created a family, Grammitaceae, to accommodate these dwarf polypodies. In 1947 Holttum recognized the family, which he revised to Grammitidaceae, and later wrote (1955), There are no intermediates between them and any true Polypodiaceae, and a close relationship seems very doubtful. After treating them, in 1947 and previously, as members of the Polypodiaceae, Copeland came to believe the group should have family status (1951). In her revision of Grammitis in New Guinea, Parris (1983) placed the genus in Grammitidaceae and gave a history of the family classification. Most authors have accorded the grammitid ferns family status, but W. Wagner (1973) retained them in a subfamily, the Grammitidoideae of the Polypodiaceae, and Tryon and Tryon (1982) placed them in a tribe, the Grammitideae of the Poly",

    "abstract": "The polyphenolics of the Appalachian Asplenium complex (Smith & Harborne, 1971; Harborne et al., 1973) confirmed in all respects the concept of reticulate evolution in the species complex which had been proposed by Wagner (1954) on the basis of morphology and hybridization and chromosome studies. For example, A. montanum Willd. contained four C-glycosylxanthone compounds which were present in all hybrids containing the A. montanum genome. It has now been discovered that a parallel situation occurs in the chemistry of a group of European spleenworts, namely the Asplenium adiantum-nigrum complex. Asplenium adiantum-nigrum L. is an allotetraploid derived from A. cuneifolium Viv. and A. onopteris L. (Shivas, 1969). Asplenium onopteris is also a diploid progenitor of the tetraploid A. balearicum Shivas, the other diploid parent being A. obovatum Viv. (Shivas, 1969; Lovis et al., 1972). Thus, A. onopteris is analogous to A. montanum, the diploid ancestor of the tetraploids A. bradleyi D. C. Eaton and A. pinnatifidum Nutt. The analogy is further supported by the presence of C-glycosylxanthones in A. onopteris, A. adiantum-nigrum, and A. balearicum (Fig. 1). The European spleenworts are well known cytologically and morphologically (Lovis, 1977; Walker, 1979), but chemically they are virtually unknown. Several species have previously been surveyed for the presence of xanthones and proved negative: A. adiantum-nigrum (from Spain), A. ruta-muraria L., A. septentrionale (L.) Hoffm., A. trichomanes L., and the related species Ceterach officinarum DC. and Phyllitis scolopendrium (L.) Newm. (Smith & Harborne, 1971). A later reinvestigation of A. adiantum-nigrum indicated the presence of a xanthone-Oglycoside (Imperato, 1980). This particular compound had a 1,3,7,8-hydroxylation pattern in contrast to the 1,3,6,7-hydroxylation pattern of the C-glycosylxanthones found in the Appalachian spleenworts. It also had its sugar molecules attached by an oxygen linkage rather than by a direct carbon-carbon linkage as found in the C-glycosylxanthones. Imperato (1980) suggested that the absence of xanthones in the Spanish sample of Smith & Harborne (1971) may be due to phytogeographical factors.",

    "abstract": "A fusinized fern rhizome from the Lower Cretaceous beds of the Patuxent Formation (Potomac Group) in College Park, Maryland, is here described as a new genus and species. This rhizome is the first from a locality that was uncovered after the flooding of tropical storm Agnes in 1972. Locality and stratigraphy.-In June 1972, flooding that followed a tropical storm uncovered Cretaceous clays containing plant remains in College Park, Maryland, near Washington, D.C. The predominantly grey to dark grey color, sandy lithology, and mica content of the outcrop, as well as its geographic position to the west of overlying Arundel and Patapsco strata, indicate its placement in the Patuxent Formation (L. J. Hickey, pers. comm.), the lowest of the three of the Potomac Group. A preliminary examination of a pollen preparation from the fossil-bearing bed is consistent with its placement in Zone I of the Brenner (1963) and Doyle (1969) classifications. The age of this zone is probably Aptian, but may range into the Barremian (Fig. 1). Materials and methods.-Many fossils of gymnosperms and ferns corresponding to forms described by Fontaine (1889) and Berry (1911) occur in the clay lens, mainly as small fragments. Although some fragmentation probably occurred prior to fossilization, numerous planes of slippage (slickensides) in the clay are evidence of internal motion subsequent to burial. The clay material containing the plants was maintained in a wet condition until further preparation was possible. It was bulk macerated in hydrofluoric acid. Larger plant fragments were sieved out; then the smalle: fragments were sorted under a dissecting microscope. Some of the remaining residue was centrifuged and prepared for pollen and spore analysis. Fragments for sectioning were embedded in plastic, either in Epon 812 (50% A and 50% B mixture) or in Spurr Firm Embedding Medium. Sections were cut on a rotary microtome and mounted on microscope slides in Canada balsam. Observations and photographs were made using a Wild M-5 microscope and a Nikon S-Kt microscope with a combination of transmitted and reflected light. Photographs utilized Kodak Plus-X Pan film. Description.-The well-preserved rhizome is approximately 2 cm long and 5 mm in diameter, with several roots (2.6 mm in diam.), two nodes, and a covering of hairs (some pointed and some blunt) that is more dense at the nodes. The carbonized remains of the rhizome are preserved as fusain (Schopf, pers. comm.) of a type not derived through fire (Schopf, 1975). The cell walls are opaque, brittle,",

Onoclea sensibilis differed significantly from the wintergreen ferns in morphology and physiology for almost every parameter measured. Interspecific differences were also observed within the wintergreen group. Dryopteris intermedia differed most within the wintergreen group and showed more similarity in physiology to O. sensibilis.

    "abstract": "Asplenium trichomanes L. is an aggregate species of world-wide distribution. Diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid (in Australia and New Zealand) cytotypes are known, the first two of which are polymorphic. Only a few of these forms have botanical names. We use here the nomenclature and typification of Lovis (1964). Love and Kjellqvist (1972) and Love and Love (1974) suggested assigning specific rank to the diploid and tetraploid cytotypes, following Rothmaler (1966, p. 5) and So6 in Fuchs (1963). In principle this is acceptable, but it is very impractical because there are many cases in which even specialists are unable to differentiate between the cytotypes with confidence when dealing with herbarium material. According to Carvalho e Vasconcellos (1968), both the diploid A. trichomanes subsp. trichomanes (sensu Lovis, 1964) and the tetraploid subsp. quadrivalens D. E. Meyer (1962) are assumed to grow in the Azores, but Pinto da Silva in Palhinha (1966) was more cautious. He quoted Lovis' opinion of that time: However, the only form of A. trichomanes from Azores yet studied alive is a peculiar form, and requires more study before it can be given an accurate taxonomic treatment. Franco (1971, p. 23) did not differentiate between the subspecies. Wilmanns and Rasbach (1973, p. 326) stated that most specimens differ from Central European A. trichomanes subsp. quadrivalens by brightness, longer pinnae, and stronger teeth.

The following also report A. anceps Lowe ex Hook. & Grev.: Bolle (1866, p. 215), Milde (1867, p. 64, sub A. trichomanes var. anceps f. azorica), Drouet (1866, p. 131), Sauer (1880, p. 43), Trelease (1897, p. 172, sub A. trichomanes var. anceps f. azorica), Palhinha (1943) and Benl and Sventenius (1970, p. 447). We suspect that all these reports are wrong because of confusion with A. azoricum. We have not seen the specimen that Bolle quoted, but he stated that the only specimen from the Azores he had seen, which was collected by A. Braun, showed a more pronounced dentation at the tip and acroscopic side of the pinnae. This is typical ofA. azoricum, and we suspect that his specimen was indeed that species. Milde's type and sole specimen is A. azoricum. Sauer did not mention any specimens, but cited only Azores. We have seen two specimens of Drouet (BM), 11 out of the 19 specimens cited by Trelease, and all five quoted by Palhinha. None is A. anceps. Benl and Sventenius based their record of A. anceps on the literature mentioned above (Benl, in litt.). So far we have been unable to detect any specimen of A. anceps from the Azores in any herbarium.",

MATERIALS AND METHODSField data from 25 localities were collected from New Jersey south and west along the coastal plain to Louisiana.Materials were preserved in FAA, FPA, or CRAF IV for anatomical preparations.Microtome sections were prepared of seven strobili, five peduncles, 12 rhizomes, and five roots.Paraffin technique was employed and sections were cut 8-15 /xm in thick.These were then stained using Sharman's (1943) technique or safranin-fast green (Johansen, 1940, p. 80)_ Cytological material was placed into a saturated, cold, aqueous solution of paradichlorobenzene and transferred (usually after an hour) to Newcomer's solution (Newcomer, 1953) at room temperature.The vial containing the Newcomer s solution and cytological material was then transferred after an hour into a freezer until examined.The chromosomes were prepared by the squash technique and were mounted in and stained by a 1:1 solution of Hoyer's mounting medium (Beeks, 1955) and acetocarmine.The preparations were made permanent by nng-",

    "abstract": "Near the turn of this century Thelypteris torresiana (Gaud.) Alston, a fern new to the United States, was collected in Seminole County, Florida. Small (1938) mentions that it was first collected in Florida by T. L. Mead about 1906; however, a specimen of this taxon collected by A. A. Eaton, dated May 1904, is among the collections at the United States National Herbarium. Both the Mead and Eaton collections came from the vicinity of Oviedo in Seminole County, and on the label of the Eaton specimen a note was added that the plants were escapes from cultivation. Although the early collections were identified as Dryopteris setigera (Blume) Kuntze, the nomenclatural status of this fern has been clarified by Morton (1962), Ching (1963), Reed (1968), Holttum (1969), and others. True Dryopteris setigera is a rare Asian species, probably neither cultivated nor naturalized in the New World. The American collections, erroneously identified as Dryopteris setigera, are Thelypteris torresiana, a combination made by Alston in 1960 based on Guadichaud-Beaupre's Polystichum torresianum from Guam. In a recent study of Old World species of Thelypteris sensu lato, Holttum (1969) maintains the combination Macrothelypteris torresiana (Gaud.) Ching in his revision of the Thelypteridaceae. Until knowledge of this family is further refined, I have followed a more conservative generic treatment. After 1904-1906, when the first collections of Thelypteris torresiana were made in Florida, there were no additional reports of this fern from the southeastern United States until it was located in Polk County, Florida in 1922. A few years later it turned up in Volusia County (1924) and in Manatee County (1926), both in central penisular Florida. Another ten years elapsed before it was recorded for Highlands and Orange Counties, Florida. In 1938, Small wrote that it was appearing spontaneously in many remote localities and in great abundance. The first record of the occurrence of Thelypteris torresiana in a state other than Florida was in 1948, when L. C. Crawford located a population in Conecuh County, Alabama. A few years later it was reported from the Coastal Plain of Texas (Newton County) by Correll (1951). It seems likely that by this time T. torresiana would have been present also in southern Georgia, southern Mississippi, and Louisiana, although stations in these states were not discovered until 1959, 1961, and 1968, respectively.",

Drought stress decreased leaf growth and photosynthetic capacity, and hence reduced total mass, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area ratio (LAR). Dry matter allocation into the root fraction, however, increased with decreasing soil moisture. Leaf relative water content (RWC) decreased as soil water depletion, but the differences were insignificant. Such results might be the result of a physiological balance between the demand for water by the leaves and the water uptake from soil by the roots. The decrease in stomatal conductance (gs) effectively controlled water loss and maintained intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) under drought stress. The increase in proline content might contribute to osmotic adjustment, and hence sustained cytomembrane integrality in structure and function under drought conditions.",

Plasmodesmata connect the egg and the ventral canal cell, but are absent between the egg and the jacket cells. During maturation, a separation cavity forms around the egg. However, a pore region, persistently connecting the egg and the ventral canal cell, is reported for the first time. Subsequently, an osmiophilic egg envelope is formed, from a combination of the products of sheets of endoplamic reticulum and osmiophilic bodies in the egg cytoplasm. The absence of this envelope from the region where the egg and ventral canal cell were formerly interconnected produces a fertilization pore, which is believed to be an entrance for the sperm penetrating the egg. In the mid stages of egg maturation, the nucleus envelope produces extensive evaginations which then appear to be sequestered into the egg cytoplasm recalling a similar phenomenon in the eggs of other ferns. Degeneration of the neck canal cells is associated with the secretion of copious mucilaginous material.",

Kuhn and perhaps three or more other species, each of limited range in the ChinaJapan region; some pteridologists detect as many as 16 species. The genus has been associated with the woodsioid, tectarioid, athyrioid, and thelypteroid ferns by different taxonomists, and in some cases even by the same taxonomist at different times. Morphologically the genus is little known except for some aspects of H. crenatum published by Hayata (1927), Mehra and Loyal (1956), Loyal (1960), and Iwatsuki (1964a, b). Since the descriptions of these authors contain some discrepancies, we thought it worthwhile to reinvestigate the morphology of H. crenatum and to see whether the morphology of this plant could yield some additional clues as to the relationships of the genus. Material for this study was collected growing in rock crevices from Chakrata (Central Himalaya) and was then cultivated in the fernery of the National Botanic Gardens. Spore morphology was studied using standard palynological techniques, as described by Nayar and Devi (1964). Prothalli were grown on sterilized nutrient agar medium in petri dishes maintained at 24 =t 2? C and at about 600 ft-c intensity, as described by Nayar (1962). The source was fluorescent day light lamps for 12 hours in each day. Vascular organization of the rhizome was studied from steles excavated mechanically from the rhizome, as well as from reconstructions based on camera lucida drawings of serial microtome sections. THE RHIZOME is thick, creeping, cylindrical, bears several dormant branches on the ventral surface, and is densely covered by basally attached, golden brown, lanceolate, thin-walled paleae about 30 X 3 mm (Fig. 3) mixed with profuse, unicellular, papillate, glandular hairs (Fig. 7).

Matteuccia struthiopteris segregates globally into minimally divergent (0.3%) Eurasian and American lineages. These two clades have little to no variation even at large geographic scales. Within hemisphere, patterned genetic variation was evident only in the AFLP data and only locally. Genetic variation within Vermont was greater within the westward-trending Winooski River watershed than in the Passumpsic River watershed, which drains east into the Connecticut River. We suggest that historical factors have created this pattern; a Mississippi Valley Pleistocene refugium for the American lineage of the species seems plausible.",

A significant difference was observed between the numbers of gemmlings and sporelings. Most seedlings derived from gemmae, which critically influenced the population regeneration. The reproductive ability of gemmae became stronger from the 4th year of gemma growth. In the cultivation test, gemmae were planted in three different soil media, i.e., habitat soil, sand and humus. No significant difference was found in the gemmation rate among the three media, but the survival rate in sand was significantly lower than in the other two media. We also investigated the morphology of the gemma and gemmling growth pattern of H. serrata. The results may reveal the contributing role of gemmae in reproductive strategies, and be helpful to the resource protection and cultivation of H. serrata.",

The four Hawaiian species are endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. The goals of this paper were to determine the relationships among the Cibotium species, determine whether the Hawaiian species are monophyletic, and infer the dispersal pathway likely responsible for delivering an ancestral Cibotium species to the Hawaiian Islands. Molecular phylogenetic analyses based on four coding and five non-coding plastid DNA sequences supported Hawaiian Cibotium as monophyletic, suggesting a single colonization of the Hawaiian Islands. Hawaiian Cibotium are most closely related to species in Mesoamerica. If the ancestor of Hawaiian Cibotium dispersed to the Hawaiian Islands via wind dispersed spores, our analyses suggest the trade winds or storms delivered spores from Mesoamerica or the Hawaiian Islands were colonized first by a species from Asia, followed by subsequent dispersal to Mesoamerica from Hawai'i. Our analyses do not allow us to favor one hypothesis over the other.",

(Ophioglossaceae), an obligate mycorrhizal fern restricted to specialized volcanic habitats, predominately pumice, in the Cascade Range of central and southern Oregon and northern California. The fragmented distribution of this threatened species and its absence from suitable habitat is of conservation concern. At eight subalpine and one alpine site, plots with and without B. pumicola were compared for biotic and abiotic variables. Botrychium pumicola populations occurred with diverse perennial plants. Nearest neighbor analysis showed a clumped dispersion of B. pumicola with associated plants. Botrychium pumicola spores were found in soils of seven plots with and two without B. pumicola. In plots with B. pumicola, soil potassium was higher while soil density and soil temperatures were lower than in plots without B. pumicola. Airborne spores, collected in spore traps, were dispersed up to 10 m from source plants. Microsite factors (soil nutrients, soil density, nearest neighbor dispersion) and dispersal limitations are likely key factors influencing the distribution of Botrychium pumicola. Narrow spore germination requirements combined with dispersal limitations may influence population expansion of obligate mycorrhizal ferns such as B. pumicola.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the chemical composition of essential oils from two chemically unexplored fern species, Anemia hirsuta and Anemia raddiana. These species were collected during the day in ravine banks of Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. Fresh leaves of the ferns were individually turbolized with distilled water and submitted to hydrodistillation in a Clevenger-type apparatus for three hours. The essential oils obtained were subjected to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry for identification. Nine compounds were identified in Anemia raddiana essential oil, accounting for 81.3% of the total oil, where the sesquiterpene β-selinene (46.8%) was the major compound. Thirteen compounds were identified in Anemia hirsuta (92.3% of the total oil) and the sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene was the major compound (48.7%). No similarity was observed between the chemical profile of essential oils obtained from A. hirsuta and A. raddiana. Likewise, extremely low similarities (≤6.2%) were observed between these species and three previously published profiles of Anemia tomentosa var. anthriscifolia.",

    "abstract": "As one of the worst invasive alien plant species in China, Ageratina adenophora has caused serious economic losses and reduced the diversity of native species, possibly due to allelopathic interactions. However, we have little knowledge of its effects on ferns. In Petri dish bioassays, the effects of the aqueous leachates from roots, stems and leaves of A. adenophora on spore germination and gametophyte development of Neocheiropteris palmatopedata were investigated. All leachates inhibited spore germination and rhizoid growth of N. palmatopedata. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects increased with increasing leachate concentrations, and root leachates exhibited the greatest inhibition. Possible inhibitory causes are discussed in the present study. Additionally, the gametophytes of N. palmatopedata treated with the leachates of A. adenophora did not show morphological differences compared with the control. This result differs from previous studies investigating morphological changes in other fern species when associated with A. adenophora. Varying sensitivity of different fern species to the same allelochemicals of A. adenophora may partly be responsible for this difference.",

The primary difficulty is inherent -the very large number of species concerned. There are good characters for the species, in habit, size and cutting, venation, texture, pubescence, and sori, but scarcely any guide as to which characters are more significant than others. Most of the characters seem to be varying independently, but detailed studies might show correlations that would be taxonomically significant. Christensen's key is unusable in practice, for it is fundamentally based on size. The primary division is Tertiary veins 1-10jugate as compared with Veins 12-25-jugate. It will be noted that there is no place for the plants with the veins 11-jugate! It is not, as would be theoretically possible and as might be envisioned from the key, that one species with segments 10 mm. long would have 5 pairs of veins and another species with segments of the same length 15 pairs, in other words the veins being distant in some and close in others; there is some variation in the distance of the veins, it is true, but not a great deal, and in any case this has not been studied. (If it were, the proper way to express it would be by giving the number of veins per centimeter rather than the number per segment.) No, the number of pairs indicated by Christensen depends primarily not on the distance of the veins from each other but on the total length of the segments, and thus in turn on the size of the plant.

    "abstract": "One of the challenges when working with the genus Isoëtes is the scarcity of in-depth comparative analyses of its morphological characters. This paucity of analyses relates in part to the long-held conclusion that most of the characteristics associated with the traits of the genus aside from spore morphology, are too variable to be informative. As a result, our understanding of morphological variability among species of Isoëtes is underdeveloped. Recent workers have attempted to address this deficiency by examining the glossopodia of the ligule, a structure unique among living taxa to Isoëtes and its sister genus, Selaginella. The glossopodium is embedded in the adaxial surface of the microphyll, and has shown evidence of interspecific variability in the few studies in which it has been examined. However, these prior works were limited to qualitative comparisons. The present study compares 3D reconstructions of the glossopodia of three species, Isoëtes howellii, I. bolanderi and I. nuttallii, using morphometric analyses in addition to more traditional qualitative comparisons. MANOVA of measurements obtained from 3D reconstructions of the glossopodia show significant differences in size while elliptical Fourier analysis of these reconstructions demonstrates differences in shape among the species. These analyses provide a repeatable, statistical framework for future work on the glossopodium and potentially other traits in Isoëtes.",

For ferns LMA is at the lower end of the range for seed plants and increases with leaf longevity. Data concerning morphological and anatomical traits of ferns and their relationship with LMA are quite limited. The objectives of this study were to (1) break down LMA into anatomical components; and (2) analyze the trade-offs between anatomical and morphological leaf traits, which determine LMA variations for three evergreen ferns. Seven morphological and 16 anatomical leaf traits of Polystichum setiferum, Polypodium interjectum and Asplenium scolopendrium growing outdoors in the Botanical Garden of Rome were analyzed using light microscopy. LMA was not significantly different between the considered species (4.55±0.55, 4.34±0.47, 4.28±0.41 mg cm−2 respectively) and it was in the range of other evergreen fern species. The morphological and anatomical structure of all species was significantly different and reflected environmental adaptation of species to their natural habitats. In particular, total lamina thickness was163±16.1 μm (P. setiferum), 244±33.7 μm (P. interjectum) and 336±32.2 μm (A. scolopendrium); leaf tissues density ranged from 127±16.9 mg cm−3 (A. scolopendrium) to 277±37.1 mg cm−3 (P. setiferum); intercellular air space varied between 23.2±2.07% (P. interjectum) and 41.8±1.61% (A. scolopendrium). The overall results highlight that LMA is an integral feature that can be obtained by different anatomical structure.",

There is no specimen of the species in the Linnean Herbarium in London, but in the herbarium of Dillenius, preserved at Oxford, the writer has had the privilege of examining the specimen which formed the basis of the description and figure in the This specimen, which is thus the type, is stated by Dillenius to have been collected in Carolina by one Marcus Catesby. The sheet on which it is mounted contains three other specimens of Lycopodium: one of L. inundatum, one of L. alopecuroides and another which may also be L. alopecuroides. The sheet, in fact, represents the plants portrayed on pl. 62 of the Historia. Although in figure 6 of the plate the figure of our species is shown bearing three fruiting spikes, the specimen itself possesses only one. This may be a case of artists' license, since the spikes certainly appear to be unnaturally crowded in the figure. There is no doubt, however, that the specimen is an American one and the figure an accurate representation of it.",

We stopped to examine some rock shelters formed in Pottsyille sandstone along the southern edge of the West Fork of the Sipsey River about five miles east of Double Springs. Growing in fissures and along the ground we found a number of ferns such as Trichomanes Boschiawnum Sturm, Asplenium pinnatifidum Nutt., Athyriuum asplenioides (Michx.) Eaton, Thelypteris normalis (C. Chr.) Moxley, Polystichum acrostichoides (Michx.) Schott, Osmunda regalis L., 0. cinnamomea L., and a specimen which was sent to Dr. Wherry for identification. Dr. Wherry turned the identification over to Mr. George Proctor; who identified the specimen tentatively from Christensen's monograph of Dryopteris as Dryopteris pilosa (Mart. et Gal.) C. Chr. He took a few sprigs to the National Herbarium, where he and C. V. Morton compared it with Mexican material. They found it to match almost exactly a specimen of D. pilosa (determined by Maxon), collected near Mesa Correo, Chihuahua, Mexico, LeSieur 1144 (USNH 1,638,030). Mr. Morton and Dr. Wherry suggested the possibility of a new varietal status and Dr. Wherry suggested a new combination under Thelypteris. A loan of specimens was requested from the National Herbarium and the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, designated in this paper by US and PH respectively, for my study of this fern. Examining 41 specimens of Mexican and Guatemalan material, the writer found very little variation in specimens of D. pilosa and D. pilosa var. procurrens (Fee) C. Chr. except in size.

It was found in the island of Atka, one of the Aleutian Islands, in 1932 by a member of a Swedish expedition to Alaska and the Islands. The leader of the expedition, Mr. Eric Hulten, well known for his great work on the flora of Kamtschatka and now curator of the Botanical Museum at Lund, Sweden, placed the whole collection of Pteridophytes made in the Aleutians in my hands for determination. Besides several common temperate or subarctic species the collection contained a few tufts of a Polystichum, which I at once regarded as a new and very interesting novelty. I described it as P. aleuticum and my description with photograph was recently published by Mr. Hulten together with other new species from the islands.1",

Station E, West White Lake Substation, has been covered with the blastings of quarrying operations. The writer was able to rescue some of the plants, a few of which were planted in the Jamesville Woods region. The remainder were sent upon request to Dr. McFarland at the University of Kentucky. While it is probable that the colony is entirely destroyed there is a possibility that a few plants may have survived as was apparently the case in the Split Rock region several years ago. A very careful survey of the region will be made as soon as the quarrying work ceases. The excavations are being continued along the ridge between this station and station C, the Green Pond Substation. Before the end of the season this colony will also be blasted out. Fortunately, through the recommendation of Dr. Homer D. House, State Botanist, the New York State Museum, of which Dr. John M. Clarke is director, came to the rescue and offered financial aid necessary to move all the plants in this colony to a place of safety. When the work was started it was seen that",

Further search will doubtless reveal some lowland species and the dry Gasconade cliffs should add several to the list. The most interesting find to date is Ophioglossum Engelmanni. On June 20, the writer found, in a hollow one mile west of Rolla, several thousand plants of this species, many of which were in fruit; on some plants the spikes had turned brown and on others had not yet attained the length of the leaf. Fertile plants three or four to eight inches long were found. The pitted dolomite mentioned above here forms a low cliff, back of which, away from the branch, is a small bench carved from the cotton rock. On this bench, for about one mile down the hollow-the distance examined-the adder's tongue was very abundant among the rocks, growing in a dry, sterile soil. A few plants were found in the narrow bottom near the stream where the rock ledge dips below the water. Onoclea sensibilis.

Although records of the more important species have already been published in Rhodora (XV. 158-163, 200-201 (1913); XVI. 38-41 (1914)), my friend, Mr. Harold G. Rugg, has suggested that notes on the fernworts collected might prove of interest to readers of the JOURNAL. In the following notes I have accordingly included records of all the species collected, rare or common. My first month, from July to midAugust, was spent at Essex Junction, a railroad junction near Burlington, of some local fame as the scene of frequent railway accidents, and the rest of the time at Swanton, a small town about four miles below the Canadian border. Both towns are situated on large sandy deltas formed in glacial and slightly post-glacial times by the Winooski and Mississquoi Rivers, and deposits of limestone or marble with their characteristic species occur in both localities. A number of ferns, common enough at both places as they are nearly everywhere in the East, may be dismissed with a mere listing of their names. These are Adiantum pedatum, Dryopteris cristata, D. marginalis, D. spinulosa, D. spinulosa var. intermedia, D. Thelypteris, Asplenium filix-femina, A. Trichomanes, Cystopteris fragilis, Onoclea sensibilis, 0. Struthiopteris, Polypodium vulgare (collected at 4000 ft. on Mt. Mansfield), Polystichum acrostichoides, Pteris aquilina, Woodsia ilvensis, Osmunda Claytoniana, and 0. regalis. Dryopteris Boottii, D. cristata var. Clintoniana, and the splendid D.

As this roadside was undisturbed by scythe or grazing cattle, I am unable to account for this re-appearance each year.

I have since seen Mr. S. B. Parish's statement in the Fern Bulletin, xii: 9, 1904, that the reference of P. flexuosa to California is almost certainly erroneous. Last year in another canyon in the same range of hills I found another plant that very much resembles the one I found before, as I now remember it. I have also recently seen what purported to be a specimen of P. flexuosa and my plant is most certainly not that species. Neither does it agree with our common P. andromedaefolia (Kaulf.) Fee.

Here all the elements essential to a luxuriant fern growth seem to occur in just the right quantities. A constant supply of heat and moisture and an altitude ranging from sealevel to 7428 feet have resulted in the development of a large number of species. The island is approximately 150 miles from east to west and 50 miles from north to south. A ridge of mountains runs from east to west through the center of the island and it is among these mountains that the greatest number of ferns are found. In my brief visit to Jamaica in the winter of 1916, my fern collecting was chiefly confined to the mountainous regions of Cinchona and Hollymount. Cinchona is the name given to a vast tract of land, ranging in altitude from 4500 feet to 6100 feet, embracing a portion of the Blue Mountain Range slightly to the northwest of Blue Mountain Peak. An unsuccessful attempt was made by the Jamaican government some years ago to introduce quinine (Cinchona) here. This was one of the tropical stations of the New York Botanical Gardens for some years. At the time of my visit it was unoccupied and the Director of the Public Gardens very kindly placed the several well-built buildings, including a laboratory, at my disposal. Sir John's Peak, situated in the reservation, is the second highest mountain in the island. The trail leading from the buildings at 4900 feet altitude, to the summit, passes in part through dense, moist forests and in part skirts the sides of mountains through territory exposed to the sun's rays.

Much of the writer's time was given to collecting plants and he found many of interest to him, especially since he had never before had an opportunity to botanize so far north. While the area explored was not very large, a number of rather rare plants were discovered, as well as several which show slight extensions of range, judging from the lately published Flora of the Vicinity of New York. Thirty-six species of ferns and fern allies were observed, surely a large number for any area of the same size in temperate North America, and probably others were overlooked. While none of the species are rare, it seems worth while to publish some record of them, especially since two represent southward extensions of range, according to Miss Slosson's treatment of the group in the work just mentioned. The settlement of Clove occupies the broad, open valley of one of the heads of Fishkill Creek, which runs southward. Abruptly on the east and west rise two ranges of low mountains.

In 1911 the writer spent ten days at Chama, for the purpose of collecting plants, and in August and September, 1914, in company with Mr. H. C. Bollman, he camped for four weeks along the Brazos River, near the mouth of the canyon proper. Although the camping expedition was primarily a vacation trip, a large collection of plants was secured, several of which were not known previously from the State. The most interesting group in the region is the ferns. During recent years large collections of plants have been made in many parts of New Mexico, and since most collectors pay particular attention to ferns a large number are known to occur in the State.

In the following year Mr. Herbert Goddard, then a resident of Decorah, Winneshiek County, sent the writer a collection he had secured in the vicinity of his home. During the years from 1899 to 1902 the writer had a valued correspondent, Mr. Ellison Orr, who resided at Waukon, Allamakee County. Mr. Orr's fine specimens were accompanied by many valuable critical notes. From these sources of information the following article has been written. This portion of Iowa possesses for Iowans a peculiarly quiet scenic beauty, being the most broken or rolling, and the most wooded of any portion of the State. Iowa as a whole is a broad expanse of gently undulating prairie, with the characteristic flora modified by civilization. In northeastern Iowa there are more high hills, rugged cliffs, deep ravines, perennial springs, piny woods, and rapid flowing streams than are to be found in any other region of the same size in the State. Being the least affected by cultivation, many natural park sites are available, some of which are destined to be utilized in the near future.",

It has been thought best to assemble the various collections as well as possible this year, as the amount of material secured on these various trips and the number of localities visited will enable us to publish a fairly comprehensive and complete list of the flora of a considerable part of Ontario lying to the north and northwest of Lake Superior. During 1916 we went again to Sioux Lookout, about two hundred miles northwest of Lake Superior, remaining there over a month and working that region over quite thoroughly. In 1917 we spent the first half of the summer along the line of the Canadian Northern Railway, east of Lake Nipigon, stopping first at Longuelac, a station at the north end of Long Lake, and distant about seventy-five miles east of Lake Nipigon and an equal distance north of Lake Superior. This region is one of little relief, there being much spruce muskeg from which rise the low rounded hills and rolling lands of rounded rocks and glacial soils. The second stop of 1917 was at Jellicoe, about half way between Longuelac and Lake Nipigon, approximately on the divide between the Hudson Bay and the Lake Nipigon drainage; the region being one with extensive sand-plains (glacial terraces) from which rise rounded rocky hills of considerable size and into which the Blackwater River has excavated a deep and often lake-like channel.

    "abstract": "The person who has lived in New England all his life is usually anxious to escape the typical New England slush and mud season of April-the betwixt and between, as it were. For such a person, seeking a refuge where he may find agreeable weather and a place in which to botanize, sunny Bermuda has its attractions. Yet he must not expect to find Bermuda always sunny, and he must be willing to experience seasickness. For the fern student alone, Bermuda may be disappointing. Instead of a great number of luxuriant ferns, as one might expect, the island boasts of only twentyfive species and varieties, according to an article by the late B. D. Gilbert in the Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club [25: 593-604. 16 D 1898]. Doubtless this list of Gilbert's, which I found extremely helpful, may need some corrections and some additions. In the library at Hamilton, Bermuda, I consulted two or three books relating to the flora of the islands. Of these the most valuable were the botanical volumes of the Reports of the Challenger Expedition. Some of the Bermuda ferns are extremely rare, and fortunate indeed is the botanist who finds them all. Bermuda has so many attractions that I was able to give but little time to ferns alone. Yet, in my desultory collecting I succeeded in finding specimens of all the species mentioned in this article. Undoubtedly the most abundant fern in the islands is the little maidenhair, Adiantum bellum Moore. This rock-loving fern is found everywhere, growing on walls, in stone quarries, around the caves, and in almost every roadside cut. In dry exposed places the fronds are barely two or three inches long. Nevertheless these small fronds are very heavily fruited. Whenever this fern is found in moist, shady places, as in the cave regions 16",

It is not even Trichomanes Petersii with not much more than a pinna of leaf tissue and leaves one cell thick. These are perhaps the simplest ferns in the United States from the standpoint of size and structure. The simplest known fern is a native of the tropical East Indies, a species of the genus Monogramme Schkuhr, M. dareaecarpa Hooker. In this plant, each leaf has but one vein and one fruit dot or fruiting line, set in a groove along one side of the leaf. The placing of the sporangia was responsible for the original specific name, dareaecarpa, after Darea, a group of ferns generally placed under Asplenium. The plants are epiphytic and grow mixed with mosses on the bark of trees: The stem, like the leaf, has a single solid wood fiber traversing it, only a few cells thick. The relationship of Monogramme is with the fern tribe Vittarieae. Vittaria, a single species of which, V. lineata, occurs in Florida, always has two lines of sporangia while Monogramme has but one, but in venation, the largest species of Monogramme is almost a duplicate of the smallest Vittaria.",

    "abstract": "The gemmiferous firmosses, containing the type species of Huperzia, Huperzia selago, are distinguished from the other members of Huperzia by concave-sided spores and specialized lateral branches consisting of gemmiphores and detachable gemmae. The species of the group hybridize and the hybrids possess abortive spores with spore fragments and undivided spore mother cells. In the past the systematic treatment of the species in this group has been unsatisfactory because no one has recognized the intermediate sterile hybrids. These can reproduce vegetatively by gemmae, often forming large populations. Undetected hybrid taxa muddle species boundaries by obscuring and combining the already subtle characters that differentiate species. The obviously abortive-spored hybrids have remained undetected by most botanists. Careful field study of sympatric populations of species and hybrids over the range of the taxa, as well as examination of over 6000 herbarium specimens, has resulted in the present alignment of species boundaries and the recognition of a new species, Huperzia appalachiana, in eastern North America. First, we will review the range and characters of the common firmoss species, and then present the range and characters of Huperzia appalachiana. Looking at the three major areas of overlap (the northern Appalachians, the southern Appalachians, and the north shore of Lake Superior), the consistency of characters will be examined as well as of hybrids. The shining firmoss, Huperzia lucidula, is an eastern North American endemic of moist conifer and deciduous forests and swamps, always with some shade. Common in the northern and eastern parts of its range, it extends north of the Great Lakes up into the boreal forest, south in the Appalachians to Georgia and Alabama, west in shaded moist sandstone ravines of Missouri and Arkansas and to the edge of the deciduous woods in Minnesota. It is a robust plant of indeterminate growth habit; the individual stems continue growing indefinitely, becoming decumbent with age and eventually rotting away at their base. The leaves are in annual zones of longer leaves and shorter leaves. The shortest leaves are bud leaves produced at the end of the growing season in the form of winter bud. In H. lucidula, the leaves of the two portions are similar in size and reflexed position. The long leaves are widest beyond the middle with serrate margins and, importantly, have no stomates on the upper surface. The gemmiphores and the gemmae are relatively large. The lateral lobes of the gemmae are broadly obtuse with an apiculate tip. The spores are relatively small, averaging about 25 gm.",

    "abstract": "The green spores of Equisetum normally are viable for only short periods of time. Thus, these spores are available to produce gametophytes for brief periods during the year in many parts of the world. Over the years efforts have been made to keep the spores viable for extended periods of time. In this study, ripe cones of E. hyemale were stored frozen at -70?C. This procedure extended the viability of the spores for more than a year, and 37% of the spores stored frozen for a year germinated and formed gametophytes. Green spores of pteridophytes usually have short viabilities and some of the shortest are reported for Equisetum (Lloyd and Klekowski, 1970). The best possibility to obtain substantial spore germination is to use spores from re- cently opened cones (Hauke, 1969). Fresh spores are easier to collect from tropical species of Equisetum because ripe cones are available essentially all year (Hauke, 1969). This is not the case for species from the temperate zone, because their cones are ripe for only short times during the growing season. Outside the tropics, fresh Equisetum spores are unavailable for most of the year. Efforts have been made to extend the viability of Equisetum spores so that living spores are available for a greater portion of the year. Castle (1953) stored sporangia and spores of E. arvense in a sterile nutrient solution at 5?C. Spores stored in this manner remained viable for three months. Hauke (1969) tried freezing dry and wet spores or storing wet spores at 80C. The best of these procedures, wet spores at 8?C, kept the spores of E. myriochaetum alive for 1.5 months. Duckett (1970a) stored ripe cones of E. arvense in sterile nutrient solutions at 4?C. Germination was obtained after two months of storage but none occurred after five months. Jones and Hook (1970) placed freshly shed spores of E. telmateia in bottles, added 2-3 cm of glycerine, capped the bottles, and stored them at -10?C. The percentages of germination were 54, 74, and 37 for spores stored under these conditions for 1, 2, and 3 years respectively. The technique of Jones and Hook (1970) was superior to the others for main- taining the viability of Equisetum spores. However, recovering the spores from the glycerine is somewhat involved. The spores have to be washed out of the glycerine with nutrient solution or water before they can be placed in culture. The present study was carried out in an effort to devise a simpler procedure for storing and sowing Equisetum spores.",

    "abstract": "Sphenomeris with 11 or probably more species, Lindsaea with about 150 species, and Tapeinidium with 17 species, together with their related genera, constitute the Lindsaea-group (Kramer, 1971) or the family Lindsaeaceae (Tagawa & Iwatsuki, 1972). The family is nearly world-wide in moist warm areas, and is characterized by the combination of creeping, so-called lindsaeoid-protostelic or solenostelic rhizomes, uni- or multiseriate scales, simply or compoundly pinnate or rarely simple fronds. The sori are terminal on one to many veins, submarginal or nearly marginal, short or elongate along lamina margin, and indusiate. Spores are trilete, less often monolete. Three sporogenetic and reproductive modes are common in the higher leptosporangiate ferns (e.g., Walker, 1979). One mode involves sexual reproduction and production of 64 haplospores from an archesporial cell in each sporangium through four mitoses followed by meiosis. The other two modes involve agamosporous reproduction and production of 32 diplospores. In the meiotic agamosporous or Dopp-Manton-type, three mitoses and a meiosis occur to produce spores in tetrads, while the mitotic agamosporous or Braithwaite-type involves four mitoses and a modified first meiotic division to produce spores in diads (Manton, 1950; Evans, 1964; Braithwaite, 1964; Lovis, 1977; Walker, 1979, 1985). In the agamosporous modes, diplospore formation is accompanied by non-reduction of chromosome numbers. The cytotaxonomy and reproductive biology of Lindsaeaceae are still controversial and even confusing. Based on gametic chromosome numbers and 32spored sporangia, Kurita & Nishida (1963) assumed that two Japanese species of Sphenomeris, S. chinensis Maxon and S. biflora Tagawa, are agamosporous, and further that S. biflora is a haploid agamosporous fern. Similarly, with 32-spored sporangia, the Japanese species, S. chinensis and S. gracilis (Tagawa) Kurita as well as Lindsaea lucida Bl. (Mitui, 1968, 1973, 1976), were also considered agamosporous. On the other hand, Momose (1967) reported that normal antheridia and archegonia are formed in S. biflora and S. chinensis, showing no evidence for agamosporous reproduction. No cytological evidence is available for the presence or absence of alternation of nuclear phases associated with either sexual or agamosporous reproduction in Lindsaeaceae. The basic chromosome number also has not yet been confirmed for Sphenomeris and related genera, because different or approximate numbers (n = 47, 94, c. 94, c. 100, c. 147) have been reported for S. chinensis from various parts of the world (Manton & Sledge, 1954; Mehra & Khama, 1959; Roy & Pande, 1962; Kurita & Nishida, 1963; Wag",

This observation was consistent with the previous report that polyploid species of Isoetes are allopolyploids. Meiosis was generally similar in both megaspore and microspore mother cells, but differences were observed. Due to the smaller size of the microspore mother cells, during prophase I, chromosomes are not as dispersed as those in megaspore mother cells. Cytomixis was observed in all stages of meiosis in microspore mother cells, but it was not seen at any stage of meiosis in megaspore mother cells. Cytomixis, lagging chromosomes, chromosome bridges, chromosome fragments, and micronuclei, observed during meiosis in I. sinensis, can affect sexual reproduction, but it does not appear to be a major cause of population decline in this species. The major cause of decline is habitat degradation from human disturbance. The few remaining populations of the Chinese quillwort are fragmented and the numbers of individuals contained in these populations dwindle as a result of habitat degradation. Conservation efforts are needed to save I. sinensis from extinction.",

Our allozyme data suggest that the Canarian A. ceterach population is not completely genetically isolated from the European ones. The holotype of Ceterach aureum var. parvifolium, formerly regarded as an octoploid taxon, proved to be A. ceterach, leaving the octoploid without a correct name. The recently described A. octoploideum shows monomorphic, presumably fixed heterozygosity for a combination of the patterns seen in A. ceterach and A. aureum at four loci (Aat, Skdh, Me, and Pgi-2) confirming its allo-octoploid nature. It most probably originated by chromosome doubling in a tetraploid hybrid between A. aureum and A. ceterach or via the union of their unreduced gametes. Pgi-2 indicates multiple origins of the allo-octoploid, implicating recurrent gene flow from tetraploids to octoploids.",

Although a strong case can be made that the presence of the sporangia will affect the physiology of the frond, only one study could be located that investigated this phenomenon. Thus, ecophysiological (and some morphological) features of fertile fronds were compared with those of sterile fronds of the subtropical epiphytic fern Pyrrosia lingua in Taiwan. Fertile fronds were thicker than sterile fronds, a result of the presence of the large sori. Stomatal sizes and densities did not differ between the two types of fronds. The osmotic potential of liquid expressed from the fertile fronds was more negative than that of the liquid of sterile fronds, although this may be an artifact due to a matric effect of the released spores. No differences in chlorophyll concentrations (area basis only) and a/b ratios were found between sterile and fertile fronds. In situ rates of net CO2 exchange of the fertile fronds were substantially lower than those of the sterile fronds. Similar stomatal conductances and internal CO2 concentrations in the sterile fronds indicated that the efficiency of the photosynthetic apparatus was lower in fertile relative to sterile fronds. The results of this study indicate that the presence of sori on fronds of the epiphytic fern Pyrrosia lingua reduces the photosynthetic capacity of these fronds and, most likely, the productivity of plants harboring many fertile fronds.",

    "abstract": "Isoetes L. is a genus of lycopods consisting of at least 60 species, and is of worldwide distribution. Members of this genus are small, herbaceous, perennials and are aquatic, amphibious, or terrestrial. Isoetes is sometimes referred to by the common name of Quillwort, which refers to its elongate, quill-like leaves. Because its grass-like or rush-like habit often makes it difficult to discern from surrounding vegetation, it is often overlooked in the field. Due to its rather peculiar morphology, Isoetes has been the subject of some interesting statements. Linnaeus (1754, p. 486) described the staminate and pistillate flowers of Isoetes as incomplete and solitary in the axils of the leaf bases. Engelmann (1878) stated, species of Isoetes are the simplest vascular plants known. The tufted, quill-like leaves of Isoetes arise from a thick, flattened, corm-like, underground axis. A sporangium is located adaxially at the base of each fertile leaf; just above the sporangium is a small, flat, generally triangular ligule. The outer wall of the sporangium may be more or less covered by a flap of tissue called the velum. Isoetes is heterosporous, producing megaspores or microspores in sporangia on separate leaves. Monographers have used characters of the habitat, ligule, velum, and sporangium in the taxonomy of Isoetes. In addition, the size and ornamentation of the megaspores have often been used to separate the various taxa more precisely. The recognition of Isoetes melanopoda Gay & Durieu and 1. butleri Engelm. as distinct species has been questioned by a number of workers, from Pfeiffer in her monograph of the Isoetaceae (1922) to Evans in Manual of the Vascular Flora of the Carolinas (1968). Most recently, the validity of . butleri as a species has been questioned by Kral (1973, p. 367), who stated that leaf, ligule, velum, and corm characters all vary too much for accurate delimitation of the taxa. However, the spores of these two species normally do differ in size. The megaspores of I. butleri are usually greater than 480 ,/m in diameter, whereas those of 1. melanopoda are usually less than 450 ,tm across. It should be noted, however, that intermediate spore sizes do exist in both species. Since recently collected material from Arkansas and Illinois proved difficult to identify with certainty using the traditional morphological characters, the authors decided to examine both megaspores and microspores of these two taxa under the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Spores for examination were chosen from authentic or type material located in the Missouri Botanical Garden (MO) and from Arkansas, Illinois, and Missouri collections which, by the standards of previous monographers, fit either I. melanopoda or 1. butleri. The spores were prepared for examination by mounting them on double-sided plastic tape and",

In most cases, these revisions are the most usable or even the only treatments available. Crabbe (1960, 1969) lists and indexes Alston's publications. For the Americas, Alston's first treatment was for Brazil (1936), followed by Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay (1939), the West Indies (1952), and continental North America south to Panama (1955). At the time of his death, Alston had amassed data on some 120 species found in tropical South America excluding Brazil. The manuscript he left was incomplete and contained a number of new species.

Copel. Investigations have continued concerning the naturalness of the genus Microgramma, its delimitation, and its relationships with other groups of neotropical Polypodiaceae, especially with Pleopeltis and certain other simple-bladed species of Polypodium. All this will be discussed in a future publication, giving various morphological details for as many species as possible of this problematical genus. De la Sota (1960, pp. 69-71) mentioned the heterogeneity of M. vacciniifolia specimens, especially those found in the forests along the banks of the Rio de La Plata and its minor tributaries. Between those specimens and the ones from the remainder of the species' area (Brazil, Paraguay, eastern Bolivia, and northeastern Argentina) there are differences in rhizome scale morphology and in frond size, texture, dimorphism, and venation. A recent, careful analysis of the specimens growing in the forest communities along the Rio de La Plata, or on cultivated trees in its vicinity, has led to the conclusion that these specimens are a new species directly related to M. squamulosa and M. vacciniifolia. This newly recognized entity is fertile and is entirely intermediate in morphology between the aforementioned species. This fact, coupled with its geographic distribution and with a significant difference in stomate and spore size, are arguments in favor of a hybrid origin for this taxon, followed presumably by chromosome doubling. The characters which distinguish the hybrid and its putative parents are as follows:",

The species was known neither from the country nor from the whole Carpatho-Pannonian Region (also known as Carpathian Basin) previously. Its habitat is situated on a roadside bank, cut into an unstable rhyolite surface, above the valley of the Creek Kemence near the village of Pálháza. The fern is a cosmopolitan taxon restricted to humid environments and is considered to be an oceanic-suboceanic (Atlantic) element in Europe. The occurrence in Hungary is located more than 1000 km from the closest populations, thus, this is one of the most remote inland occurrences of this (sub)oceanic species. This striking presence of the fern may be due to the peculiar microclimatological conditions of the habitat, which are described here in order to give an exact explanation for this outstanding occurrence. The chromosomes were also counted in some individuals of the Hungarian population and were found to be n = 26II for each sample.",

The number of species recognized for this genus varies according to different authors from one to four. The goal of this work was to provide a systematic revision of the genus Salpichlaena in order to contribute to the knowledge of the fern biodiversity in America. For this purpose morphological, anatomical and palynological characters were analyzed in material from the geographical distribution of Salpichlaena. Herbarium specimens were treated according to the standard techniques for LM and SEM studies. The type specimens and the original descriptions were consulted to determine the applications of names. Two species are recognized, S. volubilis (Kaulf.) J. Sm. and S. hookeriana (Kuntze) Alston. Salpichlaena hookeriana differs from S. volubilis by pronounced foliar dimorphism (the fertile pinnules are much reduced), the presence of foliar buds on sterile basal pinnules, ovate costular scales and the presence of glandular hairs on the abaxial surface of the costa. The spores are monolete in both taxa, with rugulate-granulate perispore and superficial spherules. Salpichlaena volubilis is widely distributed in Central and South America, from Guatemala and Caribbean Islands, up to southern Brazil and Bolivia, across a wide altitudinal range of 200 to 1900 m. Salpichlaena hookeriana grows from Colombia, Venezuelan Guyana, Suriname, British Guiana, North Brazil to Peru and Bolivia, at altitudes up to 800 m. The diagnostic characters, illustrations and distribution maps of both species are given.",

    "abstract": "Marsilea quadrifolia, an amphibious fern, has the ability to develop heterophyllous, aerial and submerged leaves. In contrast to submerged leaves, aerial leaves have trichomes on both surfaces. To examine if the presence of trichomes can reflect excess light and hence reduce the risk of being damaged by excess light, we compared the optical properties and chlorophyll a fluorescence, in particular the maximum PSII photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), of M. quadrifolia leaves with trichomes (intact) and those having trichomes removed (de-trichomed). Photosynthetic gas exchange measurements were also conducted to quantify transpirational water loss and instantaneous water use efficiency (WUE) of M. quadrifolia intact and de-trichomed leaves. The results showed that removal of trichomes neither affected the optical properties in the visible part of the solar spectrum nor the midday depression of Fv/Fm values of leaflets. In contrast, significantly increased in transpiration rates and decreased rates in WUE were found in de-trichomed leaflets in comparison to intact ones. These results imply that the presence of trichomes is of more importance in reducing water loss than in reflecting light and protecting M. quadrifolia against the potentially damaging effect of photoinhibition in aerial environments.",

This was an attempt to determine the distribution range of this plant as influenced by these selected environmental factors. The first experiment was carried out for 14 days under controlled environments, with a light intensity of 120 µmol/m2/s and 14 h photoperiod. Plant growth was the highest at 23 and 35°C, in comparison to those grown at 15°C. The chlorophyll concentration was less influenced by the temperature than by the growth; however, carotenoid concentration at 35°C was significantly higher than those obtained from the plant grown at 15°C. Salvinia acclimation to cold temperature possibly included an increase in athocyanin and soluble sugar concentrations. The second experiment was carried out under greenhouse conditions, 25–27°C and various light intensities ranging between 80 to near 700 µmol/m2/s in order to determine the light saturation curve. Salvinia was shown to have a wide range of acclimation ability to various light intensities ranging from 80 to near 700 µmol/m2/s.

Gametangia were of the normal type described for leptosporangiate ferns. In C. pilosa populations the gametophytes produced at first instance a high proportion of female gametophytes, few male gametophytes developed and most of the female gametophytes became bisexual with time.

Three species are recognized, one of Sikkim, Annam, and Malaya, another of the Philippines, and the third of New Caledonia. Bower (1928, pp. 213-218) was much impressed by the diplodesmic vascular system of the reduced fertile lamina of C. tricuspis (Hook.) Christ, and he made a somewhat detailed study of the sporophyte, concluding that it represents a primitive form in the polypodioid phylum, along with Cheiropleuria and Dipteris. Holttum (1954, p. 211) and Copeland (1947, p. 179) regard the genus as probably related to Crypsinus. Fertile material of this rather rare genus is not easily obtained, and little is known regarding the spores and prothalli. Tn October, 1964, Prof. R. E. Holttuml sent me a bit of a fertile frond of C. tricuspis that was cultivated at Kew (originally collected in Malaya). Spores from this sample were promptly cultured on Knop's Agar medium (Nayar, 1962a) maintained at a temperature of 24 ? 2?C under a light intensity of 600 ft-c. No prothalli grew to the point of archegonium formation, although they were in culture for nearly a year. Further samples of spores were obtained in 1965, but again the prothalli could not be maintained long enough to produce archegonia. Spores (stored in plastic bags in a refrigerator) lost their viability in about two months. Techniques followed in the study of the spores are the same as reported earlier (Nayar, 1964; Nayar and Devi, 1964a). For the study of fresh spores, samples mounted in acetocarmine were used in addition to those mounted in glycerine jelly.",

Wherry (1964, p. 62) treats it as a hybrid and indicates that its spores are aborted, which they are not; his illustration of plumula fits dispersum better than plumula, which he does not illustrate. Polypodium ptilodon represents what regional authors and collectors have construed as P. pectinatum. Polypodium pectinatum L. has long been a source of confusion, particularly in the Caribbean area, and it has been treated as consisting of numerous and variable forms.

Within the ramets, the number of fertile fronds increased with the number of sterile fronds and with the mean height of ramets. Light seemed to promote fertility, as the number of fertile fronds decreased with increasing canopy cover. Fewer and smaller fronds were found in plots with high forest canopy cover. Our results showed that O. regalis performed best in conditions of full sunlight but can persist and recruit young sporophytes under closed canopy. As many marsh and lake environments have disappeared or been altered by human activity, more populations were located under high canopy cover in the forest than in open habitats. Deer grazing caused a significant decrease in fertile fronds, in total frond area and in ramet height, but the number of ramets and sterile fronds were unaffected. In conclusion, plant density and frond traits of O. regalis responded differently to the availability of light and to grazing.",

    "abstract": "In the Korean Peninsula, the current distribution of the warm-temperate and subtropical vegetation (including many homosporous ferns) is limited to southern coastal areas. Paleoecological data suggest that during the Last Glacial Maximum this vegetation retreated to glacial refugia putatively located in southern Japan and/or southern China, followed by a post-glacial recolonization. Two broad scenarios of post-glacial recolonization could be hypothesized: extant Korean populations are derived from multiple source populations (i.e., from multiple refugia); alternatively, they originate from a single refugium. To test which of these scenarios is more likely, we surveyed patterns of genetic diversity in eight (n = 307) populations of Cyrtomium falcatum from southern Korea. We found extremely low levels of allozyme variation within populations coupled with high among-population differentiation. These data best support the second hypothesis, and indicate that the current genetic diversity may be a consequence of post-glacial long-distance dispersal events and subsequent founder effects. In addition, restricted gene flow among the discontinuous populations of C. falcatum in southern Korea has likely contributed to the high degree of among-population genetic differentiation. From a conservation perspective, several populations should be targeted for both in situ and ex situ conservation, as C. falcatum exhibits a high degree of divergence among populations.",

The form of ligules is variable within each species but the overall shape (outline) is constant. The size of ligules may be influenced by environmental conditions. The presence of glandular cells at the margin of the tip of ligules indicates a water secreting function.",

    "abstract": "The monilophytes Blechnum spicant (L.) Sm. and Dryopteris affinis ssp. affinis (Lowe) Fraser-Jenkins show different reproductive strategies under in vitro conditions. While B. spicant exhibits asexual and sexual reproduction, with an antheridiogen system promoting outcrossing, D. affinis ssp. affinis reproduces only asexually through apogamy. Individuals of several populations of these species, collected in Principado de Asturias (Spain), were analyzed to test the influence of their mating system in the genetic variability displayed by each species. This study shows that the genetic diversity assessed in populations of each species collected in situ is in concordance with that expected according to their reproductive system previously observed in vitro. The genetic diversity found in D. affinis ssp. affinis was low and most of genetic variation can be attributed to differences among localities. This result indicates high fixation of the detected alleles within each locality, as expected for a clonal reproductive system. In the sexual species B. spicant the genetic diversity was higher. Our results confirm the importance of reproduction system in the genetic diversity present in populations of these fern species making essential to consider the definition and study of reproductive system and the associated consequences in the design of successful conservation actions.",

Unicellular glandular hairs were located on both margins and surface of the prothalli. The heart-shaped prothalli of C. caducum showed irregularly lobed margins with multicellular filamentous to wing-like extensions. One to several agamously formed embryos were found on a single mature gametophyte of C. inaequale but only one of these developed into a mature sporophyte. Young sporophytes possessed scales with one to several glandular cells. Antheridia were found in all three species, but archegonia were observed only on mature prothalli of C. fraxinellum, which were always located near the midrib of the cordate-thalloid prothallus. The rarity of archegonia and lack of evidence for the functionality of archegonia in these species raised questions about sexual reproduction in Cyrtogonellum.",

    "abstract": "Bolbitis and Egenolfia are Lomariopsidoid ferns of doubtful systematic position, relegated to the Aspidiaceae by most pteridologists (Ching, 1940; Copeland, 1947). They are small or medium sized ferns with dimorphic leaves, acrostichoid distribution of sporangia and dorsiventral epigeal rhizomes which may either be short creeping or long and sometimes climbing vertically on supports. During the course of a morphological investigation of some species of Bolbitis and Egenolfia it was observed that the characteristic dorsiventral type of solenostele of the rhizome (Holttum, 1954; Nayar, 1960) develops from the juvenile protostele in an unusual manner in these genera. The common type of development of solenostele from the solid cylindrical protostele in ferns by the formation of a central shaftlike pith connected to the cortical tissue through leaf gaps, is described by many workers (Bower, 1935; Gwyne-Vaughan, 1901). A variation of this type of development is reported in Danaea (Brebner, 1902). The present observations are based upon ten species of Bolbitis viz., B. costata (Wall.) Ching, B. crispatula (Wall.) Ching, B. deltigera (Wall.) C. Chr., B. diversifolia (Bl.) Schott, B. heteroclita (Pr.) Ching, B. presliana (Fee) Ching, B. semnicordata (Moore) Ching, B. subcrenata (Hook, et Grev.)

    "abstract": "Light intensity is among the major environmental factors determining the ecological distribution of any plant. The effects of light availability on aquatic plants continue to be discussed, as some species show higher growth under full sun conditions and other species show reduced growth. The aim of this study was to test the effects of different shade levels on ramets and clonal growth of the fern Salvinia auriculata. We hypothesized that the ramets grow better under shade conditions over time as in most land ferns. We performed a greenhouse experiment, putting plants under three treatments: control (0% shade), 30% shade, and 70% shade. We monitored the growth of individual ramets as well as clonal spread for 30 days. The number of new ramets (clonal growth) increased exponentially in the three treatments, however this number was higher in shade than in full sun plots. The size of floating leaves, submerged leaves, and rhizomes was higher under shade treatments compared to individuals under sun treatment. Our results showed that S. auriculata has a high growth performance under shade environments, including both clonal growth and the size of individual ramets, similar to most land ferns. This species appears highly plastic as it also thrives under bright sun, which appears to be a consistent pattern among fern species in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Because shade has been proposed as a treatment to control and manage aquatic plants, application of this treatment should be carefully considered depending of the species, especially when it involves aquatic fern species.",

This paper analyzes and discusses the different uses of these plants in three Priority Terrestrial Regions (PTR) of conservation in the state of Oaxaca in Mexico. Our objectives were to: 1) document the traditional knowledge and uses of Lycophyta and Polypodiophyta among ethnic and mestizo groups; 2) analyze the variation in the use of taxa among these ethnic and mestizo groups, in terms of altitudinal distribution and type of vegetation in habitats supporting these species. Fifty species and two varieties of useful Lycophyta and Polypodiophyta from 29 genera and 15 families, were recorded. Mazatecs, Zapotecs, and Mixes are the ethnic groups with the greatest number of records of useful species from these taxonomic groups. More than 68% of such species are recognized with common names in the local languages. There are two conditions of useful plants: 1) among species used by at least four ethnic groups, how do the uses vary from two to four; 2) related to species with at least four categories of use, which are used by few ethnic groups. More than half of the species are named in at least one language, which reinforces the fact that species are recognized, valued, and important in people's daily lives, including traditional ceremonies, beliefs. Eight categories of use were documented, with medicinal, ornamental, and handcraft being the most represented. 80% of the useful Lycophyta and Polypodiophyta were distributed above 1000 masl, mainly in montane cloud forest, Quercus forest and Quercus-Pinus forest.",

A synopsis of the fern communities of the montane and high altitude zones in Tajikistan is proposed. In the examined vegetation plots, species of 9 ferns, 58 angiosperms and 13 mosses were recorded. The most frequent ferns were: Cystopteris fragilis, Cheilanthes persica, Asplenium ruta-muraria, Asplenium ceterach, Adiantum capillus-veneris and Cryptogramma stelleri. Six plant associations could be distinguished: Cheilanthetum persicae, Cryptogrammetum stelleri, Soncho transcaspici-Adiantetum capilli-veneris, Asplenio-Ceterachetum officinarum, Asplenio-Cystopteridetum fragilis, and Asplenietum trichomano-rutae-murariae. The first three associations are described for the first time. The main factors determining the species composition of classified associations are elevation range, microhabitat humidity and moss cover.

Hieron. has long been considered a New World fern, being listed in the 1913 Supplement of Christensen's Index Filicum as from Florida, Brazil, and Ecuador. It was described by Hooker from plants collected in British Guiana in 1825 and placed in the genus Parkeria. John Smith transferred it to Ceratopteris in 1841, as C. Parkeri J. Smith. This fern has not been reported nearly as often as it has been collected, since it has been confused with C. thalictroides by many. Some authors have considered Ceratopteris a monotypic genus, as, for example, Christensen, who, in the Index Filicum, reduced all taxa to C. thalictroides. R. C. Benedict recognized four species and possibly others in his monograph of the genus in 1909. Ceratopteris pteridoides differs from C. thalictroides in the habit of growth, in the form of the leaves, and the kind of stipe. The accompanying illustration is of a plant from Florida. It has a short fleshy stipe which is widest at the base of the leaf and tapers downward; in some plants the stipe is decidedly swollen. The leaves are broadly deltoid in outline. The sterile leaf is usually simple and has broad basal lobes, the transitional leaves are deeply pinnatifid, and the fertile leaf is finely dissected into long narrow ultimate segments. This species is usually a floating fern, although it grows equally as well or better when rooted in mud. Plants growing in our laboratory that root in the mud do not differ in form from those that float in water.",

There are about 20 living species' throughout the world, but the specific differences are often subtle and the species tend to run together. An example is E. moorei of Europe, also called E. hyemale var. schleicheri and E. intermedium (of Schur, not Rydberg), which is intermediate between E. hyemale and E. ramosissimum and seems to intergrade into both. Manton, 1950, showed cytological evidence of the hybrid nature of this European species, as well as of E. trachyodon and E. litorale, both of which had been previously suspected of being hybrids. She wrote: The detection of three species hybrids among little more than a dozen representatives of the genus is a surprisingly large number, especially when the rarity of prothalli is remembered, and it suggests fairly clearly that speciation can still occur. In 1952, while attempting to identify the representatives of the genus Equisetum in northern Michigan, I became quite interested in the sect. Hippochaete, or scouring rush group, and have since adopted it as my doctoral thesis problem. Within this section there are several species that have been troublesome, including E. laevigatum. Part of this species was segregated into E. hyemale var. intermedium by A. A. Eaton, and called this because it was intermediate between E. hyemale and E. laevigatum. Schaffner later segregated those members of E. laevigatum with annual stems and blunt strobili as a new species, E. kansanum. Looking for additional characteristics by which to differentiate between these two species, I mounted their spores, and was greatly surprised to discover that all specimens from this area of Michigan that fit the description of E. laevigatum as 68",

Of the habitat Mr. Matzke writes, slopes are fairly steep, but the width of the pit is so great that there is little shading of the bottom, except in early morning and late afternoon. Consequently the fine soil at the base becomes alternately inundated in wet weather and more or less baked, though never completely so, in dry periods, cracking into characteristic 'cakes.' It was on this substratum that hundreds of gametophytes were found several hundred yards distant from mature sporophytes. Miss Walker (1921, 1931, 1937) studied the gametophytes of several species, some of which were growing in the wild. Other fairly recent reports on the morphological detail of Equisetum gametophytes include those of Kashyap (1914), Campbell (1930), Goebel (1930), Eames (1936), and Smith (1938). The Colonial Point Hardwoods represents a maplebeech forest climax area.

Guam specimens from either Safford or Hosokawa have not been seen, but probably belong with the plants discussed as C. gaudichaudii below.

The Alaskan form of the lady-fern, which occurs also in Newfoundland and Quebec, has been commonly called var. sitchense Rupr. ex Moore, Ind. Fil. 183. 1860. It has been overlooked that Moore did not recognize var. sitchense. This name appears only in the synonymy of var. cyclosorum, a name attributed to Ruprecht by Moore. Moore was the first author to unite these two varieties, and since he adopted the epithet cyclosorum and placed sitchense in synonymy, he must be followed, provided that these two names do refer to the same variety. It seems possible that cyclosorum as delimited by Ledebour (and Rupreeht) included some material of typical A. Filixfemina, but it was mostly based on the same form as sitchense. Consequently cyclosorum is the legitimate varietal epithet. However, Moore was in error in attributing the combination to Ruprecht, for Ruprecht published it as Athyrium Filix-foemina y Athyrium cyclosorunm, a binomial nomenclature for subspecies contrary to the present International Rules of Nomenclature. The first valid publication is that of Ledebourl9 as Asplenium Filix-femina y cyclosorum. As a subspecies, the plant ought to be known as A. Filix-femina subsp. cyclosorum (Ledeb.)

A chemical study, with special reference to the aluminum, iron, manganese, phosphorus, calcium, and potassium content, of several species which grow on soils of contrasted pH values has been undertaken. It was hoped to obtain in this way a possible explanation as to why individual species thrive only on soils with a limited range of reaction.",

(1987) reported that acid rain not only increased total soluble Al concentration, but also changed the affinity of organic and inorganic complexes with metals.Sprenger and Mcintosh (1989) showed that Al concentrations were elevated in both water and submerged aquatic macrophytes {Ranunculus ololeucos J. Lloyd, Luronium natans Raf.) in acidified waters.According to Stanley (1974), an addition of 92 |xmol 1Â l to well-buffered medium inhibited 50% of the root growth of Myriophyllum spicatum L. The toxicity of Al depends upon a number of factors, including pH and organic matter content (Tan and Binger, 1986).Aluminum toxicity increases at a pH below 5 because its solubility increases considerably.Of the different species of Al, AP^ is the only significant one that is found in freshwater at a pH of 4 or less (Poleo, 1995).In general, Al has been shown to interfere with cell division, decrease respiration rates, interfere with enzymes governing the deposition of polysaccharide in cell walls, increase cell wall rigidity, and decrease the uptake and transport of water and several elements including Ca, Mg, P, and K in plants (Foy et al., 1978).The earliest recorded use of lactic acid as a plant growth regulator was by",

    "abstract": "Studies of North American moonworts (Botrychium subg. Botrychium) during the past two decades show that there are some 24 species, described and undescribed, instead of the traditional interpretation of only six (e.g. Clausen, 1938). Four times as many species occur in North America as in the rest of the world. In addition, there are many varieties and forms. North America is clearly the world's center of diversity of moonworts (Cf. Wagner & Wagner, 1981, 1983, 1986, 1990a, 1990b). Many of the taxa are rare or very rare, some known from only one specimen from each of several localities, and many recognized only in the last two decades. Some evidently have very narrow total ranges such as B. acuminatum W. H. Wagner, B. gallicomontanum Farrar & Johnson-Groh, B. mormo W. H. Wagner, and B. pumicola Coville. At the other extreme are B. lunaria (L.) Sw., B. lanceolatum (Gmel.) Angstr., B. minganense Victorin, and B. simplex E. Hitchc., which are relatively common species. Of special interest are those species which have very large ranges but are sporadic with their populations being usually small and widely separated. Among these is Botrychium pallidum W. H. Wagner, which is sporadic with small colonies of few individuals in Colorado, Saskatchewan, Michigan, Ontario, and Quebec. Another is the remarkable two-spike moonwort B. paradoxum W. H. Wagner, known from British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Montana, Oregon, and Utah, with populations often made up of only one or several individuals. From the standpoint of comparative rarity, mere listings of provinces and states as done here can be misleading. If the actual populations are very small and sporadic, these taxa must be ranked as very rare and locally threatened or endangered. The situation is similar to that in the seedplants Plantago cordatta Lam. in much of its range (except for the eastern Ozarks), and the dwarf whorled pogonia, Isotria medeoloides (Pursh) Raf. For such widely scattered populations, it is interesting to speculate on their origin and how the species maintain themselves.",

    "abstract": "The genus Cibotium (Dicksoniaceae) comprises approximately ten species ranging from Assam to China and Papua New Guinea in the Old World, to Central America and Mexico in the New World, and Hawaii. The genus is distinguished from Dicksonia by the cartilaginous texture of the valves of the indusium, which are strongly differentiated from the lamina. This paper will review the Hawaiian species of Cibotium. Hybrids between the Hawaiian species are known and will be discussed in a subsequent paper. The Hawaiian flora is noted for its many polymorphic species, and the Cibotium species are excellent examples. There are few clear-cut characters that separate the species, and while two of them (C. menziesii and C. glaucum) do have characteristics that are prominent and helpful, the other two taxa have more subtle and variable characters, especially the nature and color of the hairs on the abaxial surface of the segments. In attempting to understand Cibotium in Hawaii, it became obvious that serious problems existed in the clear definition of the species, how many there are, their nomenclature, and their distribution. The original descriptions are incomplete, sometimes do not correlate with the type specimens, and allow for overlapping interpretations. The resulting nomenclatural confusion has caused authors to assign the wrong name, or to identify incorrectly the plant being discussed (Wick & Hashimoto, 1971; Ripperton, 1924). Because of this confusion, the Hawaiian species of Cibotium have been seriously misunderstood (Rock, 1913; Skottsberg, 1942; Ogura, 1930). Another troublesome problem has been that herbarium specimens of Cibotium are frequently inadequate for identification, often consisting of no more than a single pinna. At the minimum, a good collection must include the base of the stipe, with its pubescence, as much of the stipe as possible, a middle pinna, and also the distal portion of the frond. Of value also is a basal pinna, including the adjacent stipe, and a crozier, if available. The stipe and crozier can easily be cut in half longitudinally to assure easier pressing, faster drying, and the use of less herbarium space. An adequate single collection may fill as many as three to five herbarium sheets. The practice of collecting only a single pinna for an herbarium specimen should be abandoned, since it will often have little taxonomic value. TAXONOMIC HISTORY",

    "abstract": "-Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies of macerations reveal that vessels are present in both roots and rhizomes of Woodsia scopulina. In rhizomes, there is less differentiation between lateral walls and end walls. In both root and rhizome vessels, there are perforation plates both on end walls and on lateral walls; because of the grouping of tracheary elements, more than one cell facet at a cell tip can qualify as an end wall. Lateral wall perforation plates are less specialized than end wall perforation plates. Lateral wall perforations often have porose pit membranes, whereas end wall perforations often lack pit membrane remnants, especially in roots. Tracheids may be present in addition to vessels, but because one cannot see all facets of a cell and many cells are broken or overlain, absence of perforation plates on all tracheary elements cannot be established with certainty. Woodsia obtusa has less specialized vessels: end wall perforation plates have porose pit membranes, and lateral perforation plates are apparently lacking. Greater specialization of vessels characterizes adaptation to more seasonal habitats in angiosperms; this correlation appears to apply to ferns as well. Woodsia scopulina tends to occupy sites of higher latitude or altitude than those of W. obtusa. Vessels have been reported for ferns in the case of Pteridium (Russow, 1873; Bliss, 1939; Carlquist and Schneider, 1997a), and these reports have been widely accepted. Vessels were described in roots of Marsilea by White (1961, 1962), and the vessels he illustrates have clearly defined perforation plates. Vessels were claimed by Gwynne-Vaughan (1908) for several genera of ferns, but that report was discounted by Bancroft (1911). White (1962) suggested there might be vessels in ferns other than Pteridium and Marsilea, but he was appropriately cautious, because demonstration of presence or absence of pit membranes in end walls of tracheary elements by means of light microscopy, the tool available to him, is difficult or impossible. However, White (1962) singled out Woodsia (Dryopteridaceae) as a genus likely to have vessels (he designated them as presumptive vessels) in roots, although not in rhizomes. White cited eight Woodsia species has having slight differentiation of end walls (as compared to lateral walls) on tracheary elements, two as having medium differentiation, and one as having a high degree of differentiation. One of the two species cited with medium differentiation of the end walls was W scopulina D.C. Eaton. Because SEM is a definitive tool for showing presence or absence of membranes in pits on end walls and lateral walls of fern tracheary elements, we have elected to study with SEM the ferns most likely to have vessels based on differentiation between end walls and side walls as seen with light microscopy. In Pteridium (Carlquist and Schneider, 1997a), Woodsia ilvensis (L.) R. Br. (Carlquist and Schneider, in press), Microgramma nitida (J. Sm.) A.R. Sm. (Schneider and Carlquist, submitted), and Phlebodium and Polystichum This content downloaded from 157.55.39.25 on Mon, 25 Jul 2016 04:27:12 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms AMERICAN FERN JOURNAL: VOLUME 88 NUMBER 1 (1998) (Schneider and Carlquist, 1997), we have established the presence of welldifferentiated end wall perforation plates. We have also found lateral-wall perforation plates in these genera, although determination of what is an end wall and what is a lateral wall is not as easy in ferns as it is in angiosperms, where vessels are mostly in clear vertical series and do not form dense groupings, as they do in these ferns. In Woodsia obtusa (Spreng.) Torr. (Carlquist et al., 1997), we found end walls on tracheary elements with porose lysis of pit membranes, and therefore we claimed perforation plates as present; we did not see perforation plates on lateral walls in this species. Woodsia scopulina is of potential interest because the degree of differentiation of end walls of tracheary elements, according to the data of White (1962), is greater than in W. obtusa. If greater differentiation between end walls and lateral walls is present in W. scopulina, other tracheary element features that differ from those of W obtusa are potentially of interest. In our study of W obtusa (Carlquist et al., 1997), we were unable to determine the full extent of perforation plates because sections were used. Use of macerations in the present study permits better understanding of the three-dimensional nature of vessel elements. The fact that a number of ferns now prove to have vessels makes each genus and species in which vessels occur of potential interest. White's (1962) suggestion that vessels might be absent in rhizomes of Woodsia proves not to be true for at least some species. However, this finding leads to the question of whether rhizome vessels may be less specialized and more tracheidlike than root vessels. Also of potential interest is whether tracheids are present in addition to vessels in Woodsia. Differences among species with respect to vessel specialization of vessels are also of potential ecological interest, because more specialized perforation plates in monocotyledons and dicotyledons are associated with more highly seasonal availability of moisture (Carlquist, 1975). Woodsia scopulina occurs in areas that are cool to cold in winter, and where freezing might be a factor in water availability; warm summer temperatures and drought may characterize at least some of the localities. Brown (1964) documented the range of W scopulina from southern Alaska down the Rocky Mountains to southern California and Arizona, as well as along the northern part of the Great Plains: South Dakota, northeastern Minnesota, northern Saskatchewan, Ontario, and the Gaspe area of Quebec. He cited isolated stations in Arkansas and the Appalachian Mountain portions of North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. MATERIALS AND METHODS The plants of W scopulina used in this study were collected in the only known locality in Arkansas, Magazine Mountain in Logan County, during October, 1996. The collectors were Don Crank, Jim Peck, and Robbin Moran. Material was sent to us in fresh condition by George Yatskievych. Segments of roots, rhizomes, and petioles of several plants were preserved in 50% aqueous ethyl alcohol.

A few species, including O. crotalophoroides, appear to have gametophytes that mature rapidly. To determine how fast the gametophytes of this species mature, they were grown in axenic culture. The early sequence of cell divisions following germination is the same as for other species of the Ophioglossaceae. The formation of mucilage on the proximal cell of the young gametophyte and on the rhizoids of older gametophytes has also been reported for other members of the family. The spores of O. crotalophoroides have the second fastest germination, 8 days, for this family. Gametophytes of this species grow faster than gametophytes of two Botrychium species. The gametangia form on smaller gametophytes of O. crotalophoroides than on those of Botrychium. Rapid spore germination, rapid gametophyte growth, and smaller gametophyte size at maturity all contribute to the formation of sexually mature gametophytes in 6.5 months. This is the fastest gametophyte maturation reported for the family.",

Slagg (1932), in a study of microgametophyte development in S. kraussiana (Kunze) A. Br., germinated microspores on plaster of Paris blocks. A similar method for germinating both microspores and megaspores was described by Bold (1967). Bierhorst (1964) described methods for obtaining reproductive stages of Selaginella for classroom use. Webster (1967) described the induction of sporelings under greenhouse and field conditions. Wetmore and Morel (1951) germinated megaspores of S. pallescens (Presl) Spring in Mart. and S. flabellata (L.) Spring on nutrient agar under sterile conditions. Through the use of a medium supplemented with various growth factors, they were able to grow gametophytic tissue for several months. Despite the above procedures for germinating spores and obtaining sexual material of Selaginella, there is but one report of artificial crosses in the genus. Burgeff and Filippi (1957) made crosses between S. martensii Spring var. martensii and S. martensii var. variegata Hort. They sowed surface-sterilized megaspores and microspores together on nutrient agar in culture tubes and, after gametophytes had formed, flooded the cultures with water to achieve fertilization. After 30-40 days, sporelings appeared. Using this method, they studied the inheritance of variegation in S. martensii var. variegata. In this paper, a crossing technique differing in several respects from the one used by Burgeff and Filippi (1957) is described. Although it has been used successfully to repeat the crosses by Burgeff and Filippi, the technique was developed for making crosses with S. kraussiana and its varieties, and the following description is based on work with these taxa. Application of this technique to a study of inheritance of pigmentation in S. kraussiana var. aurea W. Bull will be the subject of a later report.",

The extremely rare, natural hybrid A. azoricum × A. scolopendrium is described as A. ×santamariae. It has been found at a single location on Santa Maria Island and is presumed to be triploid. A more frequent natural hybrid A. azoricum × A. onopteris, found at seven locations on the same island, is also new to science and is described here as A. ×diasii. It is confirmed cytologically as triploid with two genomes from A. azoricum and one from A. onopteris. Asplenium ×diasii and an experimental hybrid show that A. azoricum is an allotetraploid species. The parentage and directionality of hybridization for both hybrid taxa have been established using uniparentally inherited plastid genome markers.",

This species is restricted to SE Asia and grows exclusively at higher elevations in the submontane to montane zone. Previously, it has been reported from China, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam, but not from Thailand. A comparison of the plants from Thailand with those from the type locality of D. multispicatum in the Philippines (Mt. Santo Thomas near Baguio City, Province of Benguet, Luzon), where this species is still present, shows the plants from Thailand to be D. multispicatum. Like other Diphasiastrum species, D. multispicatum is a weak competitor and grows on (disturbed) immature soils on slopes with more or less open and low growing vegetation. We also present morphological evidence that Diphasiastrum multispicatum is distinct from Diphasiastrum complanatum s.s., which is a north temperate, circumboreal species (in northern and central Europe, Greenland, northern North America, Japan and northern Asia, excluding the tropics).",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the nutritional status of Pteridium caudatum (bracken fern) in a Neotropical region where this species occurs in acid leached soils. In this region there is a high availability of Al in soluble toxic forms, rendering P. caudatum an important weed associated with wildfire regimes. Water-soluble Ca, exchangeable Ca fraction, Ca bound to pectate phosphate, and bound to oxalate were evaluated from P. caudatum sampled from a burned parcel of land 94 and 270 days after an accidental fire, as well as from an unburned control parcel. Both sites were located in a tropical secondary savanna community in a successional mosaic of a cloud forest. The concentrations of total Ca, N, P, K, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Ni and Al, and their distribution in the plant organs were investigated. The study addressed the hypothesis that shoots should show low concentrations of Ca because a low cation capacity exchange has been reported in roots of Pteridium. We expected a low water-soluble Ca fraction because bracken has been defined in the literature as a non-calcicole plant. The exchangeable fraction and pectate phosphate bound Ca constituted 60 to 85% of the total Ca in pinnae and rhizomes, while the oxalate bound Ca constituted only 3 to 14% of the total Ca. Concentrations of Al as high as 248.3 mmol kg−1 were found in roots. Pinnae showed only 84.53 mmol Ca kg−1 and 5.62 mmol Al kg−1, and their Ca/Al ratio was 15 mol mol−1 contrasting with P. aquilinum from temperate regions where Ca/Al was 1440 mol mol−1, however the Ca/P was 2 mol mol−1 in both species. We conclude that P. caudatum behaves as a potassium plant (soluble K/Ca >>1) such as the grass-like families Poaceae and Cyperaceae and accumulates Al in the subterranean organs.",

    "abstract": "Probably a first adaptation of green plants to terrestrial life was the development of absorptive trichomes or rhizoids. The axis bearing these incorporated geotropic mechanisms and evolved a self-protecting pattern of mitosis at its apex, becoming a root. The recent work of Bierhorst (1968) and Roth (1963) in showing some relationships of Psilotum and Tmesipteris to the Filicales suggests the probability that all living vascular plants have descended from a single ancestor with roots, and that rootlessness in vascular plants is derived. Fern roots are usually very distinctive. The stele itself is nearly always colorless, but it is surrounded by one to several layers of heavy, brown, sclerified cortex. In many ferns the old cortex becomes a dense, almost black mass. In small roots there are usually only one or two sclerified cortical layers of cells surrounded by a layer of larger cells and usually a subepidermal layer with a more or less sclerified outer wall. In larger roots there are more cortical layers. The inner surface of the outermost cortical walls is likely to be studded with brown (phlobaphene?) tubercles; in extreme cases cortex, epidermis, and root hairs are full of such tubercles. Usually the impregnating material in the cortex is deposited in easily visible spirals with conspicuous pits between the gyres. In modern usage the term root-hairs usually refers to trichomes borne on roots, and rhizoids to absorptive trichomes borne on gametophytes or sometimes on sporophytic tissues. Both are believed to have the functions of absorption and anchorage. Traditionally, have been defined as trichomes borne on gametophytes and root hairs as trichomes borne on sporophytic roots or rhizomes (Haberlandt, 1909). However, Haberlandt did not know about the confusing similarities between the gametophytes and the subterranean axes of the sporophytes in the Psilotaceae, and in those days exaggerated importance was 107",

The middle of which finally develops into a neck canal cell, a ventral canal cell and an egg by two unequal divisions. During maturation, the egg cell becomes progressively isolated from the adjacent cells by forming a separation cavity, a casual wall and an egg envelope. Series sections show that a fertilization pore forms in the upper egg envelope. During maturation of the egg, the nucleus produces conspicuous evaginations. The phylogenetic relationship of the fern P. euphlebia is discussed according to the cytological features in oogenesis.

Thirty-two species of endangered pteridophytes in 21 families were found in Hainan Island, accounting for 8% of the 400 pteridophytes species there. Floristic studies showed that 9% of these 32 species are tropical, 50% are tropical Asian, 20% are pan-tropical, 3% are from East Asia, 3% from the Southern Hemisphere, and 15% are endemic to Hainan Island. Niche analysis showed that 21 of the 32 species (66%) are epiphytic or semi-epiphytic, while 11 (34%) are terrestrial. About 24 species of endangered pteridophytes are distributed in protected, conservation regions and the others are distributed partly in the conservation and non-conservation regions.

Results from our combined molecular and morphological analysis suggest the name P. montevidense should be applied to collections from the Central Andes south to Argentina, and east to Uruguay and the southernmost portion of Brazil. Most Brazilian plants determined as P. montevidense in herbaria are P. platylepis.",

    "abstract": "Scanning electron microscope (SEM) studies of xylem of three species of Equisetum reveal numerous details not previously reported on the basis of light microscopy. SEM images of thick (ca. 1 mm) sections reveal pit shapes, cell contexts, and microstructure of pit membranes. Pit shapes are remarkably diverse in comparison to those of ferns or conifers. Nodal tracheary elements are isodiametric to fusiform in shape, and have crowded circular (mostly) to elongate prominently bordered pits and uniformly thick secondary walls. Internodal tracheary elements, by contrast, have relatively large circular pits with inconspicuous borders. Secondary walls of internodal tracheids are thin, with thickenings that are annular, looplike, or of some intermediate form. Metaxylem internodal tracheary elements line the inner surface of carinal canals ( = proxylem lacunae), and many of the large circular (often crateriform) pits facing the canals may lack pit membranes, especially in E. giganteum and E. myriochaetum. Because dye experiments show that carinal canals can conduct water in stems of Equisetum, the fact that portions of tracheary elements facing the canals may have perforations (many of the pits in E. myriochaetum lack pit membranes despite careful handling techniques) is significant. This opens the possibility that internodal tracheary elements may, in some species, be vessel elements that permit conduction from the carinal canals of one internode to those of the next internode (carinal canals are not intercontinuous between internodes), aided by metaxylem tracheids of the nodal plates. Such vessel elements would not be the same as those reported by Bierhorst, who found vessels only a few vessel elements long in rhizomes.",

We determine: (1) if fern richness patterns are associated with water and energy variables that are predicted by the productivity-diversity hypothesis and (2) whether the pattern or strength of the relationship varies with taxonomic level. We present species richness maps for individual families of ferns and lycophytes allowing us to identify taxa with unique distributional patterns and taxa with patterns comparable to ferns in general. To accomplish these goals, we use data from the Flora of North America project for continental North America north of Mexico plus Greenland. We construct 479 GIS fern species range maps and tabulate fern and lycophyte richness in a gridded map with 2500km2 squares. We perform regressions of fern richness on water and energy climate variables (with squares as data points) in order to identify which variables most influence fern richness. We find that fern richness correlates with water and energy variables in ways consistent with the productivity-diversity hypothesis. A multiple regression model that includes mean annual temperature (MAT) and annual rainfall (RAN) explains 78.1% of the variation in fern family richness. The relationship between fern family richness and climate is stronger than the relationship between fern species richness and climate.",

In this study, a new protocol for in vitro regeneration of the leatherleaf fern was established. For spore germination, two culture media (MS and Knop) were assessed with presence or absence of 1g L−1 activated charcoal (AC) under different light and dark conditions. Frond, frond microcuttings, and prothallus explants were evaluated on Knop regeneration medium supplemented with 1g L−1 AC, 0.5% agar, pH 5.0 in combination with 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D: 0.0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mg L−1) and 6-benzylamino purine (BA: 0.0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mg L−1). For rooting, four levels of α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA: 0.0, 0.01, 0.1 and 0.2 mg L−1) were tested. After 18 days of culture, spore germination rate was 100% on Knop medium with AC and 8 h light/16 h dark. After 120 days of culture, sporophytes 1.7 ± 0.4 cm in length developed on Knop medium, while those spore-cultured on MS medium never produced sporophytes. From those germinated sporophytes, prothallus explants cultivated on Knop medium with AC and 0.5 mg L−1 BA showed the highest regeneration rate with 235.7 gametophytes. The best sporophyte rooting response was obtained with 0.01 mg L−1 NAA. Complete, regenerated sporophytes were obtained 183 days after culture initiation. By this procedure it would be possible to obtain up to 2 million sporophytes from one fertile frond. To determine the origin of the regenerated gametophytes, a histological analysis was performed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The analysis revealed that the gametophytes were regenerated from explant epidermal tissues on either the adaxial or abaxial surface.",

Finally, S. hyalogramma is only known from a single collection made in the State of Táchira, Venezuela, where it grows as an epipetric plant on mossy sandstone areas that may be severely deforested and, hence, it is tentatively considered Critically Endangered (CR) according to IUCN categories and criteria.",

We explored methods of in vitro propagation for resurrection species of Selaginella and identified a set of successful techniques. Our in vitro propagation system included two main steps: surface-sterilized megaspores were cultured alone on C-Fern agar medium for three weeks, followed by the addition of surface-sterilized microspores to the germinated megaspore cultures for co-culture. Sporelings of Selaginella eremophila and S. rupincola were observed after 2–5 weeks of co-culture, and all sporelings survived.

In the present study, we describe how the spore-holding capacity of bryophyte colonies contributes to the retention of pteridophyte spores in a vertical environment. Lycophytes did not grow at the sampling site; hence, we used Lycopodium spores to distinguish from any other pteridophyte spores that might have already been present in the wild. We dispersed aliquots of approximately 500,000 spores on vertically suspended bryophyte (both mosses and liverworts) colonies (5 cm × 5 cm) attached to ceramic plates. The bryophyte colonies included ten species (seven mosses and three liverworts), which have different characteristics in colony height, leaf length, and dry weight. Mudstone blocks and ceramic plates were used as control surfaces (5 cm × 5 cm). After simulated rainfall, we counted the number of spores retained in the colonies and controls. We found that the bryophyte colonies retained a significantly higher percentage of Lycopodium spores (90.7±7.4%) than the controls (ceramic plate: 7.5±20.9%; mudstone: 39.7±20.6%). The average values of retained spores within the bryophyte colonies correlated with their logarithmic values of dry weight per square centimeter (R2 = 0.62, P < 0.05). Leaf thickness and stem diameter were slightly different across species. Thus, dry weight value of bryophyte colony per unit area is very likely a simple function of number of stem-and-leaf units, which correlate closely with the surface area. Bryophyte colonies that have high surface area on which pteridophyte spores might be retained within a colony might provide a suitable environment for spore adherence in epiphytic and epipetric habitats.",

While in most species the sporophyte is the dominant, long-lived portion of the life cycle, in some ferns the gametophyte is capable of sustained vegetative growth, and a number of species produce sporophytes only in parts of their geographic range (a pattern known as the separation of generations). One such species is the Hawaiian filmy fern Callistopteris baldwinii, whose growth form varies across elevational gradients. This species occurs as independent gametophytes near sea level, produces dwarfed sporophytes at mid elevations, and at the highest elevations—where precipitation is greatest due to the orographic uplift of trade winds—it grows as large, mature sporophytes. We measured temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation for several populations of this fern on the island of O'ahu in Hawai'i to determine whether these environmental factors may influence the spatial separation of generations exhibited by C. baldwinii on the island. Our results indicate that temperature and precipitation vary across life stages of C. baldwinii, underscoring the key role environmental conditions play in the completion of the fern life cycle.",

According to the St. John hypothesis the tropical and subtropical ferns in Florida compose a relict of an earlier and far richer Oligocene island flora that once existed in what is now roughly the northwest quarter of the Florida peninsula. Much of this flora was, supposedly, exterminated during the Pleistocene epoch; a few species, however, migrated to the then recently emerged southern tip of Florida and a few were able to survive in habitats protected from the uncongenial climate. These species have persisted to the present time, constituting a relict flora declining under unfavorable climatic conditions.",

Trichomranes are roundish-oval or oblong from a narrowly cuneate base, in the hybrid they are triangular, with a truncate or very bluntly cuneate base, which merely lies close to the rachis. Also the margins are evenly denticulate, being thus intermediate between the undulate-crenate or lightly bicrenate margins of A. Trichomanes and the serrate, biserrate, or variously incised condition shown by A. platyneuron. Furthermore, although the indusia are ample and perfectly formed, the fronds having been collected at the season of normal maturity, the sporangia are very few, nevertheless, and are apparently abortive.

They appear to be the sole record of the species. No further specimens from Australia are in the British Museum nor in any of the Australian herbaria. Although botanists have collected ferns on Mount Lindsay quite recently, they have failed to locate this species again. However, much of the dense rain-forest on the slopes of the muntain must still be unexplored.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to demonstrate that stone walls are habitats for rare ferns and lycophytes in Japan. A survey on 47 Red Data Books (RDBs) published in each prefecture in Japan, revealed the descriptions of 47 fern and lycophyte species (equivalent to 6.5% of all native species of ferns and lycophytes in Japan) designated as near threatened or above in the RDBs and growing on stone walls in Japan. Eleven of these species were listed in the prefectural RDBs as well as in the national RDB of Japan. Overall, 40 species (85.1%) had a preferred original habitat of cliffs or rocky outcrops, and 24 species (51.1%) preferred the forest floor. The high number of identified species that prefer cliffs or rocky outcrops supports the Urban Cliff Hypothesis, which states that man-made structures such as urban buildings and walls serve as alternatives to cliffs, rocky outcrops, or screes as alternative habitat. However, in previous domestic studies that documented fern and lycophyte species growing in established hardscapes in Japan, the most frequently occurring species were mostly weedy or ruderal. As there are few studies on the composition of species growing on stone walls in Japan, more studies must investigate this aspect as well as examining the variation in species composition because of the differences in species pools, climatic conditions, or geological background.",

Some few weeks later my attention was called to two of these ferns which differed very much from the others in their short, rounded pinnae, but which were unmistakably polypodiums. Through the kindness of the collector, these two plants were given to me, and were transferred to a glass bowl where they were carefully watched to see what forms any new developing fronds might assume. Both plants survived the first winter and each produced several new fronds which were of unusual form but in which the pinnae and tips of the blades were more elongated. One plant died in July of this past year and the other, still alive, has been transferred from the covered bowl to an open receptacle, in hopes it may produce fronds more like those it possessed when first discovered. All available articles on the American forms of Polypodium vulgare have been carefully looked over, also Druery's excellent book on British Ferns and their Varieties, but I find no form described which approaches this one. In one plant the fronds were lacking tips except for a short projection of the rachis. In the other specimen the fronds terminated in an elongated tip; otherwise the 46",

Kuhn produced a substance that caused other, newly germinated gametophytes of this species to produce antheridia precociously and abundantly, with a subsequent delay in the formation of a meristematic notch and archegonial production.Since that time, the action, expression, and biochemical structure of this type of compound have been studied in some detail (for reviews see Voeller, 1964; Naf et al., 1975).Subsequent research has also demonstrated that three biochemically distinct general classes of antheridiogens are produced by taxonomically diverse species, best identified trivially by the capital letters A, B, and C, to denote biologically interreactive groupings (SchedIbauer and Klekowski, 1972;Haufler and Gastony, 1978).Antheridiogen A, first isolated from P. aquilinum (Dépp, 1950), affects gametangial development in gametophytes of some members of such diverse families as Blechnaceae, Cyatheaceae, Davalliaceae, Dennstaedtiaceae, Dicksoniaceae, Dryopteridaceae,",

This feature is due to minute, generally shortened, thickened, bent and tuberculate hairs, which we describe here as gnarled trichomes. Gnarled trichomes are consistently present in esculentum, even in plants with glabrous lateral veins, but are reduced in density in shade form fronds. Neither P revolutum nor P yarrabense (probably = P esculentum x P revolutum) has gnarled trichomes. South and Central American specimens of P aquilinum vars. arachnoideum and caudatum show either normally tapered or gnarled intervein trichomes, or entirely lack intervein hairs. If present, gnarled trichomes are generally short and strongly tuberculated in var. arachnoideum, but often longer with multiple bends and a hooked tip in var. caudatum. Development of the lower laminal indumentum in appears to involve three distinct but interacting morphogenetic fields comprising respectively the midvein surfaces, lateral vein surfaces and intervein areas. Further investigation is required to clarify whether vars. arachnoideum and caudatum are both polymorphic for presence versus absence and normally tapered versus gnarled intervein trichomes, or whether these taxa and their possible hybrids should be redefined. With masterly understatement, Page (1976) has written that, Pteridium has always proved a somewhat difficult genus within which to produce a satisfactory taxonomic treatment. Factors contributing to this difficulty include: i) the limited number of taxonomically useful characters applicable between the population and specific levels in the bracken ferns; ii) the frequent occurrence of intermediates between named forms (Tryon, 1941); and iii) the extraordinary phenotypic plasticity exhibited by the brackens in relation to local environmental conditions (Page, 1976). No world-scale taxonomic overview of has been undertaken since the work of Tryon (1941), reviewed by Page (1976). Recent studies of the brackens of Australia (Brownsey, 1989), Mexico (Mickel and Beitel, 1988), Venezuela (Ortega, 1990), and Europe (Page and Mill, 1995) have highlighted the need for such a global revision. It therefore seems appropriate to reevaluate those characters that have previously proven of diagnostic value in Pteridium, but which remain poorly understood, with the goal of achieving improved resolution of relationships. One such characteristic is whether the lower epidermis of the frond lamina between the veins is, or is not, farinaceous in appearance. Tryon (1941, p. 8) states of Pteridium: Some varieties have a farinaceous appearance on the lower surface of the ultimate segments. This is a minute epidermal outgrowth, occurring between the veins, which under high magnification resembles a sparsely branched coral fungus. It may be an excretion but is not affected by alcohol or dilute acid.

    "abstract": "Two species of Botrychium subgenus Botrychium (moonworts, Ophioglossaceae), Botrychium minganense Victorin and B. crenulatum W. H. Wagner, can sometimes be confused in the field, even by experts, because of their reduced morphology. Botrychium minganense can imitate B. crenulatum, which is more rare. They are afforded different degrees of protection on Federal lands, making the distinctness of these species a question of management, conservation, and systematic interest. The purpose of this study was to compare a morphometric analysis of these two species with an analysis of DNA markers from the same individuals, and to assess their distinctness under each method. Collections were made in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana from seven populations of B. crenulatum and 18 populations of B. minganense. Each plant was measured, emphasizing characters cited by authors in the original species descriptions. Canonical variate analysis performed on SAS separated the samples into two species groups with 32% overlap. RAPD genetic markers revealed more genetic variation than has previously been documented in moonworts. UPGMA cluster analysis of the similarity of RAPD profiles showed well-defined B. minganense and B. crenulatum clusters, but no distinct clusters within B. minganense that could be correlated with its morphological variability. Small samples of the moonwort species B. lunaria and B. simplex included for comparison also formed distinct clusters. Botrychium crenulatum had seven unique RAPD bands, and identification of B. crenulatum could be confirmed or ruled out with markers from one or two RAPD primers. Both B. crenulatum and B. lunaria have been suggested as possible diploid parents of tetraploid B. minganense. All RAPD markers absent in B. crenulatum but present in B. minganense were also present or polymorphic in B. lunaria, supporting B. lunaria as a possible parent. One very small population of B. minganense showed a monomorphic RAPD profile, consistent with inbreeding, but all other populations had multiple genotypes. Some plants of B. minganense clustered most closely with plants from populations up to 400 km away, suggesting that variation may be introduced into populations by occasional colonization by spores from distant sources.",

    "abstract": "On the basis of data from morphological and cytological analyses, Wagner (1954) suggested the concept of reticulate evolution in the Appalachian Asplenium complex, which was subsequently confirmed by Smith and Levin (1963) using chemical analysis. It is interesting to note in this regard that the morphological characteristics of the hybrids are generally intermediate between their parents, but that the chemical constituents of the hybrids show a total addition of parental attributes; Appalachian Asplenium plants clearly demonstrate additive inheritance of chemical characters. Recently it has been shown that the chemistry of European Asplenium adiantumnigrum complex is analogous to that of Appalachian Asplenium complex (Richardson & Lorenz-Liburnau, 1982). In spite of the foregoing studies, the chemistry of most species of Asplenium is not well known. In the present investigation, a new kaempferol tetraglucoside (I) and a new sulphate ester of 1-p-coumarylglucose (II) have been isolated from the fronds of A. septentrionale; moreover two other sulphate esters of hydroxycinnamic acid-sugar derivatives (III and IV) have been found in this plant material. Previous work on the chemical constituents of A. septentrionale has led to the identification of amino-acids (4-hydroxy-4-methylglutamic acid, 2-amino-4-hydroxypimelic acid and the corresponding lactone, N-acetylomithine) by Berti and Bottari (1968), keto acids (pyruvic, hydroxypyruvic, 2-oxoglutaric, 2-oxopimelic, and 4-hydroxy-2-oxo-pimelic acids) by Virtanen and Alfthan (1954), and cyanogenic glucosides by Hegnauer (1961).

    "abstract": "Woodwardia is a genus of rather large, terrestrial ferns with mostly ascending to erect rhizomes. The species native in the United States, however, typically have creeping rhizomes. The genus includes 11 or 12 species, is worldwide in its distribution, and is one of a comparatively few genera characterized by boreal distribution (Copeland, 1947). Three species of Woodwardia, commonly known as chain ferns, occur in Florida. Woodwardia virginica and W. areolata are native species which occur primarily on the Atlantic Coastal Plain and extend from Florida to Texas and northward to Nova Scotia. Scattered inland localities also exist for both species. Woodwardia radicans is native to the Old World, but is cultivated and has reportedly escaped in peninsular Florida (Small, 1938). All three species possess distinctive leaf venation, with elongate areoles arranged in chain-like fashion along the costae and/or costules. In W. areolata, an extensive network of areoles extends to the margins of the leaf, whereas in W. virginica and W. radicans the veins are simple and forked beyond the areoles and are free at the margins. Elongate sori also are arranged in chain-like fashion along the costae and/or costules in each species. Woodwardia virginica, the Virginia or Giant Chain Fern, and Woodwardia radicans, the European Chain Fern, were originally placed in the genus Blechnum (Linnaeus, 1771), although Smith (1793) later transferred them to his genus Woodwardia, with W. radicans the type species. Subsequently, Presl (1851) founded the genus Anchistea for W. virginica, although only the glandular indusia and the presence of a single row of areoles distinguish this species from the other species of Woodwardia (Morton & Neidorf, 1956). Today both species are typically included in the genus Woodwardia (Copeland, 1947; Wherry, 1964; Fernald, 1970; Lakela & Long, 1976). Some workers, however, still recognize the genus Anchistea (Radford et al., 1964; Small, 1938; McVaugh & Pyron, 1951). Woodwardia areolata, the Net-vein or Dwarf Chain Fern, was first named Acrostichum areolatum (Linnaeus, 1753). Smith (1793) included the species in Woodwardia (as W. angustifolia), although it was not until much later that Moore (1857) called the species W. areolata. Today some botanists (Fernald, 1970; Lakela and Long, 1976) use this name. Presl (1851), however, established the genus Lorinseria, and many taxonomists (Copeland, 1947; Small, 1938; McVaugh and Pyron, 1951) consider L. areolata to be the correct name for the species. Wherry (1964) felt that the completely areolate venation and marked dimorphism of this species justified its segregation into a separate genus. Much morphological data are available for these species (Shaver, 1954; Wherry, 1964; Small, 1938; Fernald, 1970), but comparative anatomical data are almost totally lacking. In this study, the anatomy of W. virginica and W. radicans is compared with that of W. areolata, and these data are correlated with the two taxonomic systems currently in use for these species. Plant materials of W. virginica and W. areolata were collected in Alachua County, Florida. Plants of W. radicans were obtained from the Strybling Arboretum in San",

This is one of the few host-specific preferences recorded among epiphytic ferns.

For instance, in S. ludoviciana stomata are restricted to a few rows adjacent to the midribs of the leaves (Fig. 5), whereas in S. apoda they are scattered throughout the laminae (Fig. 2). Also, examination of leaf clearings and scanning electron micrographs showed a high percentage of papillate cells scattered throughout the lower epidermis of S. ludoviciana leaves and very few, if any, on those of S. apoda (Figs. 2 and 5). Comparisons of the spores of the two species reveal other differences. Knox (1950) described the microspores of both species as being warty with crenate margins. Hieronymus (1900), however, distinguished the species by their microspore morphology, describing those of S. ludoviciana as smooth and those of S. apoda as warty, verrucose, or irregularly rugose. In our study, we consistently found the microspores of S. ludoviciana to be smooth and those of S. apoda to be warty when viewed with the light microscope, thus confirming Hieronymus' findings. When viewed with the SEM, the microspores of S. apoda can be described as rugulo-reticulate (Figs. 8 and 9) to verrucate. Terminology for these spore wall descriptions is based primarily on that defined by Harris (1955). In some specimens (Fig. 7) the spores of S. apoda are covered with small spicules or papillae. In S. ludoviciana the so-called smooth spores are in fact covered with short papillae or spicules (Figs. 10-12). Measurements of microspores from 16 specimens of each species failed to show a significant size difference (x = 26.47ium for S. apoda and x = 27.24,m for S. ludoviciana).",

Previous studies on Indian species have demonstrated small variations in glossopodia suggesting the possibility that this structure could have taxanomic use. Serial cross, paradermal, and sagittal sections of glossopodia from three different North American species, representing three ploidy levels, were made. Three-dimensional digital rendering of the glossopodia provided comparative data for the three North America species and allowed comparisons with previously published descriptions. In general, the shape of the glossopodium is similar in all three North American species. There are several structural differences among them, such as the shape of the cornua, the length of the medimoles, and the angle of the glossopodium relative to the leaf axis.",

    "abstract": "In the study of pteridophytes, the discovery of sexual plants is generally unusual. This is due in part to the small size of the gametophytes and in part to their commonly concealed habit. In the Lycopodiaceae alone, only 10% of the nearly 500 species have known gametophytes (Bierhorst, 1971). Discovering prothallia of pteridophytes under natural conditions is one of the most challenging problems of field botany. In this paper I wish to report the first record of Lycopodium inundatum L. gametophytes for North America and to discuss their characteristics and the circumstances of their discovery. The gametophytes of the Lycopodiaceae have interested botanists for almost a hundred years since the first discovery of naturally occurring gametophytes (Fankhouser, 1873). Our understanding of these plants, however, has been greatly hindered by the rarity of collections. The most important contributions to our knowledge were all carried out well over 50 years ago by only a few notable workers. They established the taxonomic distribution of the types of gametophytes and also the major stages in the development of the gametophyte and embryo. Treub (1884; 1886a,b; 1888a,b; 1890a,b,c) in Java described the gametophyte and embryo of L. cernuum L. and several other tropical species. Goebel (1887) found and described the gametophyte of L. inundatum L. in Europe. This is the only time the gametophyte of this species has ever been reported, as far as I have been able to determine. Probably the best known work on the prothalli of the Lycopodiaceae is that of Bruchmann, who essentially laid the foundations for the systematic study of these plants. It was he who first described (1885, 1898, 1908, 1910) in detail the gametophytes of the temperate species L. annotinum L., L. clavatum L., L. complanatunm L. (which may actually have been L. tristachyum Pursh according to Wilce, 1965), and L. selago L. Bruchmann also succeeded in growing the prothalli of L. annotinumi, L. clavatlilul, and L. selago from spores, which required in some cases 6-7 years to germinate and 12-15 years to mature. An excellent review of the early attempts to germinate the spores of Lycopodiunl species was made by Chamberlain (1917). Freeberg and Wetmore (1958), in their study of the culture of Lycopodiunm gametophytes in vitro, have summarized in greater detail than is done here the contributions of Bruchmann, Treub, and Goebel.",

    "abstract": "Axenic cultures-those which contain only a single species-of pteridophyte gametophytes are useful both for research and teaching related to genetics, physiology, morphology and systematics (cf. Mickel, 1971). For several reasons, pure cultures of these plants are preferable to mixed cultures obtained from natural habitats or from unsterilized spores. For the researcher, axenic cultures eliminate the unknown influences that would be introduced by contaminants and permit a greater degree of control over experimental variables. For the teacher and student, pure cultures of plants under controlled conditions increase the probability that specific plants will be available for study during the time, in the quantity, and at the stages of development desired. Indeed, the gametophytes of many pteridophytes are difficult if not impossible to obtain from the field at any time, especially for instructors working in large, metropolitan areas. Many of us have been forced to learn and teach about this important and interesting phase of pteridophyte life history from the limited material commercially available and from textbook descriptions. One factor that may limit the wider use of axenic gametophyte cultures is the need for transfer rooms or chambers in which to surface-sterilize spores and inoculate cultures. Even though small, relatively inexpensive, bench-top transfer hoods are available (e.g., Labconco tissue culture hoods), a sufficient number of these to accommodate all the students in a laboratory course may be difficult to provide. Over the years I have attempted to develop culture techniques which keep space and cost requirements to a minimum, thus enabling my students and me to culture a variety of plants and plant parts. This note presents a modification of some previously reported culture techniques (Basile, 1964, 1972) and their adaptation to the culture of pteridophyte spores. The resultant modification completely eliminates the need for transfer rooms or chambers and makes pteridophyte spore culture feasible even with modest facilities. MATERIALS",

Leaves for gas exchange measurements were selected to ensure a diversity of different exposures of the two leaf surfaces to direct sunlight. For most leaves of both species, photosynthetic rates were higher when the side of the leaf that typically received more direct insolation was illuminated during the gas exchange measurement. Higher rates of net CO2 uptake when one side of the leaf was illuminated, relative to rates when the opposite side was illuminated, were attributable to a greater biochemical capacity for photosynthesis, not to greater stomatal conductances. Based on the results of this study, the photosynthetic capacity of the two sides of the leaves of epiphytic ferns, for the most part, reflects the degree of exposure of each side of the leaf to direct sunlight, as has been found in similar studies of terrestrial taxa.",

    "abstract": "—In the homosporous fern Ceratopteris richardii, sex is not determined chromosomally. Rather, hermaphroditic gametophytes produce a hormone called antheridiogen, which induces maleness in undifferentiated gametophytes. The percentage of males increases with increasing density of gametophytes, presumably due to the cumulative effect of antheridiogen from multiple hermaphrodites.Some have argued that antheridiogen lessens competition between gametophytes. Such competition is expected to be most intense between hermaphrodites given that they support zygote, embryo, and sporophyte growth. Therefore, it is predicted that at lower nutrient levels, the effect of antheridiogen in inducing male gametophytes is greater than at higher nutrient levels.To test this hypothesis, C. richardii spores were sown over a range of densities (0.52/cm2 to 5.2/cm2) in four nutrient-level treatments (100, 50, 25, 12.5 percent of full-strength nutrient agar). Gametophytes were grown for four weeks at 28 degrees Celsius with a photoperiod of 14 L: 10 D. An ANCOVA found an overall positive relationship between gametophyte density and percentage of male gametophytes. However, the relationship between gametophyte density and percentage of male gametophytes did not differ among nutrient levels. Nutrient levels had no effect on the rate of male induction by antheridiogen. A post-hoc power analysis showed that the experimental power was 97%.",

However, several species, including Lycopodium clavatum, give rise to subterranean, nonphotosynthetic, mycorrhizal gametophytes and their spores germinate in the dark. Red light, like white light, inhibits the germination of these spores. Germination occurs after exposure to far-red light. The effects of far-red light are reversed by red light and those of red light are reversed by far-red light confirming the involvement of phytochrome. The active form of phytochrome, Pfr, inhibits germination in L. clavatum. It appears that this is a general phenomenon in seedless vascular plants with subterranean, mycorrhizal gametophytes because it is now known to occur in two species, L. clavatum and Ophioglossum crotalophoroides, from unrelated families. The photoinhibition of germination by white or red light insures that these spores germinate underground in nature providing improved chances of spores obtaining adequate soil moisture and mycorrhizal colonization of young gametophytes that are essential for continued development.",

Its distribution in western North America has been summarized by Lang (1969), who found the species recently for the first time in Oregon. Because of its striking resemblance to tufts of grass and its tendency to occur in very localized populations, it probably occurs in other as yet undiscovered places in the western United States; at present it is known there from the eastern slope of the Rockies from South Dakota and Wyoming south to western Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, and Baja California. In the Old World, Broun (1938) reports it from the British Isles, Europe, northern Asia, and the Himalayas.

As new facts are discovered about growth-regulating substances, the physiological mechanisms governing senescence are becoming increasingly apparent. All such mechanisms must be correlated with anatomical characteristics of the abscission zone, thus necessitating a thorough knowledge of the cell types and patterns in this region of the plant. Miihldorf (1925) summarized the work done in the lower groups and also referred to the comprehensive coverage given to the higher plants: Monocotyledons (Bretfeld, 1880; Fouilloy, 1899) and dicotyledons (Tison, 1900; Lee, 1911). There are, however, several gaps in the anatomical literature concerning abscission, and one noticeable omission is a thorough description of the disarticulation of the rachis from the rhizome in ferns. In one early work (Basecke, 1908) three categories were described: (1) The frond falls before clear abscission lines are formed; (2) Disarticulation occurs along a line of cells present from the youngest stages; and (3) The frond disarticulates along a separation layer formed during maturity. Pfeiffer (1928, p. 163) examined other groups in addition to the ferns and established twelve classes of abscission based on various combinations of three characteristics of the separation layer. These included cell morphology, time of differentiation, and physiological condition of the cells after disarticulation. Most ferns are placed in class I of this system, in which the separation layer is formed by obtuse parenchyma, is evident as",

Modern work on this phenomenon is summarized by Steeves and Briggs (1958) and by Briggs and Steeves (1959). The coiling is due to more active cell division and cell elongation on the abaxial (lower) side of the blade until the crozier bcomes dormant. The unequal growth on the abaxial side may be termed hyponasty. The unrolling of the croziers is due to more rapid and more total growth on the adaxial side of the blade. The unrolling is an epinastic phenomenon. Both coiling and uncoiling are independent of light and gravity. Thus mitosis and elongation seem to be the factors involved directly. However, auxins, diffusing from the young developing pinnae, play an important part in elongation. The following available species of the genus Cheilanthes exhibit circinate vernation: C. viscida (Fig. 7), C. wrightii (Fig. 8), C. siliquosa (Fig. 13), C. lanosa (Fig. 14), C. californica (Fig. 15), C. feei (Fig. 16), C. intramarginalis (Fig. 17), C. pyramidalis (Fig. 18) and C. parryi (Fig. 21). Other species in this category which are not figured are C. cooperae and C. kaulfussii. Non-circinate vernation has been known at least since 1854 (Newman, 1854).

We produced and analyzed double-digest restriction-site-associated DNA (ddRAD) sequences from six species of North American Dryopteris, including two allopolyploids and their respective diploid parents. The relationships of these species have been confidently established in previous studies, and our goal was to determine the extent to which RAD data are capable of identifying these known relationships. Analyses of the genetic structure in our samples reliably separated the diploids from one other, but in general each polyploid sample resembled one or the other of its progenitors, or had genetic variation unassignable to either parent. None of the polyploid samples had unambiguous genetic contributions from both known parents, as we had expected. These results may have been influenced by small overall sample size, different numbers of samples from the two diploid parents in each pair, and the large divergence times between the diploids. These are all potentially important issues to consider when designing similar studies, and our results therefore have useful implications for researchers interested in using a RAD approach to study polyploid complexes.",

    "abstract": "Compared to most other groups of vascular plants, ferns have been neglected with respect to the potential for nonnative species to invade native plant communities and displace native species. Targeted collecting in the Piedmont of northeast Georgia uncovered five nonnative ferns that represent range extensions or provide clear confirmation of naturalization. Examination of herbarium specimens from Georgia revealed that some earlier records, as well as some overlooked records, were based on misidentifications. The species involved (Cyrtomium fortunei, Deparia petersenii, Dryopteris erythrosora, Macrothelypteris torresiana, and Pteris multifida) are all introductions from temperate regions in East Asia and represent escapes from cultivation. Study of Georgia collections held in herbaria from throughout the Southeast allowed determination of the first appearance and subsequent range expansion of the five species over time. These data and information about mating systems, ploidy level, and ecological requirements of each species allowed inferences to be made about their probable spread in the future, including effects of climate change.",

    "abstract": "This study used existing databases to test the hypothesis that fern species harbor fewer pathogen species than angiosperm species. Analysis was limited to fungal pathogens because of their visibility and to herbaceous perennial dicots (forbs) because they have a similar growth form to ferns. From complete listings in the United States Department of Agriculture plant-fungal database, the number of pathogen species recorded on 200 randomly chosen ferns and herbaceous perennial dicot species were assessed. To control for differences in study effort, the number of citations to these species in the Web of Science was determined. The results showed that the major predictor of the number of fungal pathogen species known to occur on a plant species was study effort, but after controlling for this, the likelihood of a fern species being recorded as having a fungal pathogen species was much less than that for a forb. When pathogens were present, there were approximately 50% fewer pathogen species recorded on fern species than on forb species. This pattern is present even though fern species were cited on average more often than forb species, and it is consistent with impressions in the literature from studies in other parts of the world. Testable hypotheses to explain this difference are evaluated in the context of evolutionary processes leading to variation for pathogen incidence in different phylogenetic lineages, but the physiological or molecular processes that determine the higher resistance of ferns to fungal pathogens remain unknown.",

Among the pteridophytes, mycorrhizal associations are more frequent in the gametophytes than in the sporophytes. Gametophytes of many ferns and lycophytes exhibit obligate mycotrophy. Despite several benefits derived from the mycorrhizal fungi, very little work has been done surveying the distribution and diversity of arbuscular mychorrhizal (AM) fungi in pteridophytes. We intensified our studies in the roots of sporophytes of Christella dentata (Forssk.) Brownsey & Jermy (Thelypteridaceae) to understand the distribution of AM fungi in different parts of the main adventitious root and its lateral branches, along with percent root colonization. We also evaluated spore density of AM fungi in the soil and seasonal variations in the hyphal colonization and formation of vesicles and arbuscules. Root colonization was present in the lateral roots only and not on the main adventitious roots. Percent root colonization also varied in different parts of the lateral roots. The results indicated that root colonization percentage of AM mycorrhizal fungi varies not only by the growth stages of host plants but also by season. Soil spore count was highest in the winter and lowest during the rainy season. In addition to AM fungi, another type of root colonizing fungi, dark septate fungi (DSF) or dark septate endophytes (DSE), has also been recorded in the roots of C. dentata. Dark septate fungi with melanized hyphae and microsclerotia were documented.",

Many of the morphological characters used in delimitation of the cheilanthoid lineages and genera appear to be the result of convergent evolution, a result of adaptation to xeric environments. Faced with the apparent lack of sporophytic synapomorphies for the cheilanthoid subclades, farina production by gametophytes has been proposed as a character of possible phylogenetic utility. All the notholaenoid species observed to date produce farina in their gametophytes, but species of the other cheilanthoid clades (pellaeoids, hemionitidoids, and myriopteroids) do not. In this work we provide the first account of farina production in the gametophyte of a non-notholaenoid: two accessions of Argyrochosma nivea from different geographical localities were found to have farina on their gametophytes, suggesting that this gametophytic character is not a synapomorphy for the notholaenoids, and may have had several independent evolutionary origins.",

Perusal of papers dealing with the chromosome numbers of 85 species belonging to 22 genera investigated up to the present time (see Manton, 1950; Holttum 1954; Manton & Sledge, 1954; Mehra, 1961a; Nayar, 1958; Bir, 1906; Panigrahi, 1962; Panigrahi & Patnaik, 1961; 1962; and Patnaik & Panigrahi, 1963) reveals the following broad features about the cytological picture of the family. 1. The basic chromosome numbers in the family range from x=11 to x-=47, of which x=36 and x=-37 are more frequently prevalent, characterizing 14 and eight genera, respectively. 2. Five genera, viz., Drynaria, Pleopeltis (=Lepisorus), Polypodium, Goniophlebium and Pyrrosia, are characterized by both x=36 and x=37, whereas only Pleopeltis (=Lepisorus) reveals an astonishing array of haploid and diploid chromosome numbers, namely, n=22, 23, 35, 36, 47, 74, and 2n-39 in different species. 3.

Within recent years, however, my attention has been drawn to certain features of its growth and life history that deserve study. The following paragraphs present a report on two of these features. SPORE DISTRIBUTION.-Among our native northeastern ferns, the Sensitive Fern shares with the Ostrich Fern and the Narrow Chain Fern the distinction of producing fertile leaves that are sufficiently woody to persist as erect structures through the snow and ice of the winter season. At least in the Sensitive Fern the beadlike pinnules remain tightly closed until the spring season. Then they open and discharge spores at what probably is the most propitious season for spore germination. I am unable to say whether the other two species also carry undischarged spores through the winter. The stipes of fertile leaves on the Sensitive Fern and Ostrich Fern develop a very thick and woody condition during their growing season. In the Sensitive Fern the sporophylls always seem to be curved near or at their insertion on the rootstock. The base of the stipe often describes a curve of 180 degrees before attaining an erect growth. In mid-May of 1961 I had an excellent chance to observe the",

Although this was doubted by others, the fern was later discovered near Bedford, in Quebec a few miles north of the Vermont border, as reported by Mousley.8 In lectures on the plant geography of the eastern United States, the writer likes to show distribution maps representing species which because of their general distribution may be classed as northern, western, southern, and finally eastern. It was not easy to find a good illustration of the last category, but the bog fern proved to be an excellent one. Its range is most reasonably interpreted as corresponding to its former occurrence, and presumably evolution, on the land which extended from the North Carolina cape region to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland during fairly recent geological times. By the time that land mass had sunk beneath the sea this fern had migrated far enough west to escape annihilation, but its ancestors or connecting links with related entities failed to do so.",

    "abstract": "That interesting little elf of the plant world, the common Adder's Tongue (Ophioglossum vulgatum L.), has a wide distribution in both hemispheres, and in America it extends across the continent from Prince Edward Island to Alaska and as far south as Florida and eastern Texas. It is generally found in moist meadows and pastures in the northern states, and in rich woods farther south. The colonies are usually small, consisting of only a few or single plants, and in most parts of the country it is sufficient of a rarity to give a thrill of pleasure to the botanical explorer who has the good fortune to come upon it. A second species (Ophioglossum Engelmanni Prantl), which is not so familiar to most botanists, is found in the south-central and middle states, from Virginia to Texas and Arizona. This species was described in 1883,1 but it has frequently been confused with the common Adder's Tongue, although the two are easily distinguishable, and many specimens collected both before and since the publication of Prantl's description have been labeled Ophioglossum vulgatum and may still be found in herbaria under that name. Fresh material or herbarium specimens of Engelmann's Adder's Tongue can be distinguished from the common species by the distinctly apiculate tip of the sterile frond, which is always present in uninjured specimens, and by the finer secondary network of veins under the rather more fleshy epidermis. The plants are also usually more stocky, with shorter stem portion, and with the fertile segment, when present, less exserted.",

This paper is the outcome of special study of the literature; of comprehensive herbarium-work, in which all the important herbaria of the state were examined; and finally, of several years collecting in practically all parts of California.

    "abstract": "-Ultrastructural details of the mature pre-released spermatozoid of Selaginella australiensis are presented with a three-dimensional model based on these data. This sperm cell is highly elongated and coils for nearly three revolutions. A parallel band of spline microtubules runs around the periphery of the cell and forms the structural framework along which the four organelles are aligned. Numbers of microtubules in the spline begin with one at the tip of the cell and progressively increase to 19 toward the cell posterior. The locomotory apparatus consists of two staggered monomorphic basal bodies, referred to as the anterior and posterior basal bodies, and their corresponding axonemes. Typically, no remnant of the lamellar strip is visible in the mature spermatozoid. The anterior mitochondrion occupies over 1/ gyres at the front of the cell and as such is the largest organelle. It is inserted immediately behind the anterior basal body and underlies the posterior basal body/axoneme for over one revolution. The posterior axoneme is retained within the cell body over the spline and anterior mitochondrion. The nucleus extends approximately one gyre and is situated between the anterior mitochondrion and a smaller posterior mitochondrion. At the rear of the cell is a plastid that contains two large juxtaposed starch grains. Similarities of this cell with other lycophytes include the staggered monomorphic basal bodies and increase in spline microtubules from front to back. Commonalities with bryophyte and charalean spermatozoids include cellular organization and shape, and the lack of a lamellar strip in the mature cell. Selaginella is a key taxon in understanding the early events in land plant diversification (DiMichele and Skog, 1992). The fossil record of this phylogenetically significant genus dates back to the Carboniferous, making Selaginella second only to Lycopodium in geological age (Bierhorst, 1971). Living representation of this lycopsid is extremely diverse, with over 700 species worldwide (Webster, 1992; Valdespino, 1993). Yet, the precise placement of Selaginella in the plant kingdom is unclear. The paucity of detailed comparative studies on anatomical and ultrastructural features of lycopsids, and especially the ligulate taxa, has confounded resolution of relationships among these basal plant lineages (Garbary and Renzaglia, in press). Clearly, additional studies on this taxonomically complicated and phylogenetically crucial genus are warranted. Spermatogenesis has proven to be a rich source of phylogenetic information (Garbary et al., 1993; Mishler et al., 1994; Duncan et al., 1997; Maden et al., 1997). The major limitations in using male gametogenesis for phylogenetic reconstructions are the low numbers of organisms that have been investigated and the incomplete data sets for those taxa that have been observed. In bryophytes, much attention has been placed on elucidating the microanatomy of This content downloaded from 157.55.39.147 on Wed, 20 Apr 2016 04:41:16 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms AMERICAN FERN JOURNAL: VOLUME 88 NUMBER 1 (1998) the locomotory apparatus or blepharoplast (Carothers and Rushing, 1988; Renzaglia and Duckett, 1991). Few studies of developmental processes and mature cell structure have been undertaken (Vaughn and Renzaglia, in press). In pteridophytes, even fewer organisms and structural features have been documented than in bryophytes (Duckett 1973; 1975; Duckett and Bell, 1977). Ultrastructural observations of Selaginella spermatogenesis is limited to one species, S. kraussiana (Kunze) A. Braun. In gross morphological features, this spermatozoid bears an uncanny resemblance to those of bryophytes. Although an idealized reconstruction of the mature cell for this species was presented by Robert (1974), many details of the cellular organization remain unclear. Thus, we undertook an ultrastructural investigation of the mature sperm cell of a second species of Selaginella, S. australiensis Baker. Descriptions of precise structural features and a three-dimensional reconstruction of the cell based on these data are presented. Comparisons are made with motile gametes from a wide range of green plants, with emphasis placed on identifying similarities and differences among biflagellated gametes of Selaginella, Lycopodium sensu lato, bryophytes and Charales. MATERIALS AND METHODS Selaginella australiensis was collected in the rainforest on Mount Wilson, Blue Mountains, New South Wales, Australia, in October, 1991. Plants were maintained in the greenhouse and monitored for sporangial production. Mature microsporangia were dissected and placed on filter paper moistened with distilled water in petri plates. The plates were sealed with parafilm and placed in an incubator at 20?C with a 12 hr light/dark cycle. After 10 days, the cultures were examined daily until swimming sperm cells were detected. Because of differing rates of microgametophyte development among the several microsporangia per plate, cultures harvested at the first sign of mature spermatozoids generally contained all stages of spermatogenesis. Microsporangia were lifted from the filter paper and placed in microfuge tubes containing 6% glutaraldehyde in 0.05 M Pipes buffer (pH 7.4). Microspores were liberated from sporangia and gently cracked with the end of a flame-sealed Pasteur pipet. Without mechanical disruption of spore walls, fixative and resin will not penetrate the microgametophyte. After immersion in the primary fixative for 2-4 hr, the microspores were washed four times in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) and post fixed in 2% Os04 in the same buffer for 2 hr. Prior to withdrawing solutions, the spores were pelleted in a microcentrifuge for 30 sec. After washing with distilled water, the spores were en bloc stained in 1.0% aqueous uranyl acetate for 16 hr at 4?C. The specimens were rinsed in distilled water, dehydrated in a graded acetone series, replaced by propylene oxide, infiltrated slowly over approximately one week with 1:1 Spurrs/Embed 812 resin, embedded and cured at 60?C for 16 hr. Thin sections were collected on copper grids and post-stained with 2% uranyl acetate in ethanol and basic lead citrate for five min each. Grids were observed on a Philips 201 or Hitachi 7100 TEM. 2 This content downloaded from 157.55.39.147 on Wed, 20 Apr 2016 04:41:16 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms RENZAGLIA ET AL.: SPERMATOZOIDS OF SELAGINELLA All micrographs of cross sections are oriented as if viewing from the anterior of the cell, i.e., from the front of the MLS.

    "abstract": "-This paper presents a morphological and phenological study of the spores of the fern species of a preserved cerrado area, the Reserva Biol6gica e Estagao Experimental de Moji Guagu (Sao Paulo State), Brazil. Of the 40 fern species found in the Reserve, 9 occur in the cerrado, 35 in the gallery forest that surrounds the cerrado, and four species are common to both. Twentytwo species have monolete spores and 18 trilete spores. Spore rain was collected monthly at four localities: open cerrado, cerrado, gallery forest, and marsh. Spores of 16 species were present in the spore rain. The highest percentage of spores was found in the marsh and the lowest in the open cerrado. In all four localities, the highest percentage of spores was observed in the summer months of January and February. Pteridophyta can be found in all types of habitats (Raghavan, 1991), including very dry regions that may be subjected to periodic fires. The cerrado, Brazilian savanna, originally covered about 22% of the country, extending from the Equator to the Tropic of Capricorn. Much of the cerrado is subjected to prolonged and often severe winter drought lasting up to four months (Alvim and Araujo, 1952; Eiten, 1972). Esteves and Felippe (1985) described nine species of pteridophyta in the cerrado of the Reserva Biologica de Moji GuaSu, Sao Paulo state: Adiantum serratodentatum Willd., Anemia flexuosa (Sav.)

This cerrado area surrounds a gallery forest in which 35 fern species were found by Simabukuro (1995). Simabukuro et al. (1994) mentioned 36 species, but it was discovered later that Thelypteris linkiana (C. Presl) R.M. Tryon had been mistakenly identified; also Thelypteris brevisora (Ros.) Ponce is now known as Thelypteris dutrai (C.Chr. ex Dutra) Ponce. Four cerrado species were also present in the gallery forest: Microgramma squamulosa, Pleopeltis angusta, Polypodium latipes, and P. polypodioides var. minus. Thus, 40 species have been identified in the Reserva.

(1994) mentioned that Dicranopteris flexuosa (Schrad.) Underw., Pityrogramma trifoliata (L.) R.M. Tryon, and Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn var. arachnoideum (Kaulf.) Brade were invaders (weeds) of the gallery forest. In the marsh around the gallery forest were found Lycopodiella cernua (L.) PichiSerm., Pityrogramma calomelanos (L.) Link, Thelypteris interrupta (Willd.) Iwats., and Thelypteris serrata (Cav.) Alston. Only a few papers have dealt with spores of pteridophyta in pollen rain in Brazil: They were detected in very small quantities during August-October in a cerrado area in Aparecida, Goias (Salgado-Labouriau, 1973); they were also detected near the center of the city of Rio de Janeiro, with a predominance of Adiantum (Barth, 1975). This paper presents: 1) a detailed morphological study of the spores of the fern species from the gallery forest; 2) use of this spore data plus the morphological study previously published (Esteves and Melhem, 1992) to correlate the fern species of the Reserva Biologica de Moji Guagu with spore rain analyses over a period of one year. This is the first study of this kind carried out in Brazil. METHODS AND MATERIALS STUDY AREA (Fig. 1).-All 35 fern species were collected 1984-1994 on monthly visits to the gallery forest of the Reserva Biologica e Esta,ao Experimental de Moji Guagu (Simabukuro et al., 1994; Simabukuro, 1995). The species were identified by Dr. Paulo Windish (Sao Jose do Rio Preto, SP), Alexandre Salino (Belo Horizonte, MG), and Dr. Jefferson Prado (Sao Paulo, SP). The Reserve (22?18'S, 47?11'W) is located in Moji Guagu, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil (Eiten, 1963). The gallery forest is situated along the Cortado and Fundao streams. In addition to the gallery forest, the Reserve includes cerrado and marsh, and is surrounded by Pinus sp. plantations (Mantovani and Martins, 1993). In the cerrado, nine fern species occur (Esteves and Felippe, 1985). Forty total species of pteridophyta occur in the Reserve. SPORE MORPHOLOGY.-The morphology of the spores of the nine fern species that occur in the cerrado were studied previously (Esteves and Melhem, 1992). Of the gallery forest species, the majority of the spores are from herbarium specimens collected in the Reserva Biologica de Moji Guacu by Aldo Klein (AK), Eliana Akie Simabukuro (EAS), and Luciano Mauricio Esteves (LME), which are deposited in the herbarium of Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Brazil (UEC). The spore morphology of 31 species was studied (Table 1). Of the 35 species mentioned in Simabukuro (1995), five species (Microgramma squamulosa Pleopeltis angusta, Polypodium hirsutissimum, Polypodium latipes, P polypodioides var. minus) that also occur in the cerrado have been studied previously (Esteves and Melhem, 1992). The spores were treated by the acetolysis method (Erdtman, 1971) with the period of treatment adjusted for each species. The slides were gelatin-glycerin mounted according to Kisser (Erdtman, 1971). The spores were measured in 115 This content downloaded from 207.46.13.176 on Mon, 20 Jun 2016 05:57:57 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms AMERICAN FERN JOURNAL: VOLUME 88 NUMBER 3 (1998) 1:21.000 :.'.' :. -. i ...",

In Taiwan, I. taiwanensis DeVol grows submersed, but becomes emergent during short dry seasons. There are accounts of Isoetes plants being eaten by fish, birds, pigs, ducks, muskrats, cattle and humans (Pfeiffer, 1922), but in Taiwan, only ducks or other migratory birds are known to eat Isoetes (Chang & Hsu, 1977). In 1971, K. S. Hsu and H. C. Chang collected I. taiwanensis in Dream Lake, in the vicinity of Taipei's Yang Ming Shan National Park, at an altitude of 700m. Eight papers concerning this discovery have been published since 1972 (DeVol, 1972a, b, 1975; Chang & Hsu, 1977; T. C. Huang, 1981; S. E Huang, 1982; Huang & Chen, 1988). As part of a study on I. taiwanensis, spores were examined using a scanning electron microscope. Spores of three geographically proximate Isoetes species were also studied for comparison. A strategraphic pollen analysis was also made in Dream Lake sediments to determine the time of appearance of I. taiwanensis. MATERIALS AND METHODS",

    "abstract": "constitutes an earlier valid name for I. caroliniana. This emergent aquatic, diploid quillwort is known from nine states along the Appalachian Mountains and Pied- mont, growing in cold streams, mountain woodland ponds and in the saturated organic ooze of springs from central Pennsylvania to northeastern Alabama. It exhibits a distribution similar to several other endemic Appalachian pteridophytes. Disjunct populations are also known from the Coastal Plain of southeastern Alabama and Delaware. Although similar in appearance to I. engel- mannii, I. is typically distinguished by its raggedly reticulate megaspore ornamentation, its velum covering 50% or more of the unmarked sporangium wall, and spinulose microspores. George Engelmann (1867) described engelmannii A. Braun var. val- ida Engelm. (Isoetaceae) from a series of specimens collected between 1862 and 1867 by William Canby and Thomas Porter in Pennsylvania and adjacent Delaware. All material collected up until the publication date was labelled by Engelmann and others as Isoetes valida or Isoetes Engelm., ined., indicating that he initially considered this to be an undescribed species. In his treatment for the fifth edition of Gray's Manual of Botany (Engelmann, 1867), however, he revised that opinion in favor of a varietal designation. Al- though included in some subsequent nineteenth century treatments of I. en- gelmannii (e.g., Engelmann, 1882), var. was largely overlooked or con- sidered taxonomically insignificant by later taxonomists. Clute (1905), how- ever, almost casually raised it to species level in the belief that it and I. xea- tonii R. Dodge were synonymous. This interpretation was rejected by all subsequent investigators and I. (Engelm.) Clute was not even mentioned as a synonym of I. engelmannii in the review papers of Pfeiffer (1922) and Reed (1965). When Alvah A. Eaton described I. engelmannii var. caroliniana A.A. Eaton from material collected in the southern Appalachian mountains, he made no mention of Engelmann's earlier varietal segregates of I. engelmannii (Eaton, 1900). Eaton hinted that I. engelmannii var. caroliniana might well be a dis- tinct species, but he published no more on the subject. Pfeiffer (1922), Reed (1965), and Boom (1982) followed Eaton's conservative position in considering this a southeastern endemic variety of I. engelmannii. Individual author's in- terpretations of range and morphology varied widely, however, resulting in many specimens of several taxa being labelled with this name. Eaton's original suspicions that I. caroliniana warranted species status have been supported by recent investigations involving Scanning Electron Micros- copy (SEM) and allozyme electrophoresis (Duff and Evans, 1992; Luebke,",

    "abstract": "Interpretation of the polypodioid ferns has been a classic problem for pteridologists.The groupings are, with some exceptions, fairly clear, but whether they should be treated as subgenera of Polypodium or as distinct genera is a matter of considerable disagreement.There seems to be growing acceptance of their recognition as distinct genera (Smith 1981(Smith , 1985;;Tryon & Tryon, 1982;Lellinger, 1985; Mickel & Beitel, in press), although some authors continue to recognize Polypodium in a broad sense (Proctor, 1977(Proctor, , 1985;; Stolze, 1981).Some of the splinter genera in America (e.g., Campyloneurum, Niphidium) stand well apart from Polypodium s.s., but others are apparently very closely allied to Polypodium.This is especially so in regard to Pleopeltis, some members of which hybridize with species of Polypodium s.s.The best known example of this is Polypodium x leucosporum (=Polypodium lanceolatum x P. thyssanolepis), which was pointed out by Vareschi (1969) and described in detail by Wagner and Wagner (1975), who treated it and its parents within Polypodium.Recently, Anthony and Schelpe (1985) described a similar case in southern Africa, in which Pleopeltis macrocarpa (Bory ex Willd.)Kaulf.(=Polypodium | latum) with Polypodium polypodioides var.ecklonii (Kunze) Schelpe.The authors gave a hybrid intergeneric name to their hybrid species, x Pleopodium simianum Anthony & Schelpe.",

    "abstract": "Electrophoretic analyses of enzyme variation in plants routinely employ fresh leaf tissue. Extracts of such material are analyzed immediately or the leaves or extracts are preserved through freezing or lyophilization. The possibility that active enzymes may be obtained from dried pressed specimens for electrophoretic analyses has not been considered by population biologists or systematists. In the present study, however, we demonstrate that, in certain cases, electrophoretic investigations of pteridophytes can be extended to include dried sporophytic material. This expansion of the utility of pressed specimens from herbaria greatly enhances the potential of such material to contribute to biosystematic research. Numerous studies on the effects of dehydration on the anatomy, biochemistry, and physiology of desiccation-tolerant and desiccation-intolerant plant species have been reported (e.g., see reviews by Iljin, 1957; Todd, 1972; Crowe & Clegg, 1978; Bewley, 1979; Bewley & Krochko, 1982). These effects are complex, vary among species, and often depend upon the particular conditions of dehydration and rehydration, even within a taxon. In general, however, the studies have shown that desiccation-tolerant plants are capable of quickly restoring photosynthesis and respiration upon rehydration and, under certain conditions, desiccation-intolerant species may also resume these functions. Thus, it has been established that some dehydrated plants can preserve enzymes that are capable of continuing physiological activity upon rehydration. The present study was initiated following the observation that electrophoretic expression of enzymes had been obtained from leaf tissue of Asplenium platyneuron plants that inadvertently had been allowed to desiccate in plastic bags at 4?C (Figs. 1, 2). This led to a more extensive survey of dried pressed material of varying ages and from a variety of taxa.",

A comparison of the phenolic compounds in some species in the orders Isoetales, Lycopodiales, and Selaginellales (Vorin, 1972) showed only biflavones, whereas other members of the Isoetales and Lycopodiales had other types of flavones. Vorin (1972) also isolated the flavones apigenin and luteolin from European 1. delilei Rothm. and I. durieui Bory. Shortly thereafter, Vorin, Jay, and Hautville (1975) isolated the unique flavone, isoetin, in these same two species, and this clearly separated the quillworts from the lycopods chemically. In further work on four European species (I. durieui, I. delilei, I. lacustris L. and I. velata A. Braun), seven compounds were isolated: apigenin, luteolin, isoetin, selagin, chrysoeriol, tricin, and orientin (or isoorientin) (Vorin & Jay, 1978). Each species showed a specific grouping of these compounds. In other chemotaxonomic studies of Isoetes species from the southeastern United States, it was discovered that. very little taxonomic information could be gleaned from chromatographs (Matthews & Murdy, 1969, Boom, 1979). They considered that there was more variation between populations within a species than between species. The present phytochemical study was initiated to survey the patterns of the phenolic compounds as part of a larger taxonomic study of the genus Isoetes in northeastern North America (Kott, 1980).

    "abstract": "This report presents seventy years of census data for the central New York populations of Phyllitis scolopendrium (L.) Newman var. americana Fern., the American hart's-tongue. Phyllitis scolopendrium was first discovered in North America near Syracuse, New York, in 1807 (Maxon, 1900). Currently, populations occur in two rather distinct areas: along the Niagara Escarpment in Ontario (Soper, 1954), on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (Futyma, 1980), and in central New York (Faust, 1969); and in sinkholes in eastern Tennessee (McGilliard, 1936) and northern Alabama (Short, 1979). Phyllitis scolopendrium is listed as endangered in each state where it occurs; it is currently under review for listing as threatened or endangered in the United States by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The largest number of P. scolopendrium individuals in the United States occurs in the combined populations within central New York, in Onondaga and Madison counties. There are currently about 15 locations for P. scolopendrium in New York (Faust, 1960). Six locations, or substations, occur at Clark Reservation State Park in Jamesville, New York. The substations at Clark Reservation are particularly important because most of the P. scolopendrium in New York exist here; in 1966, approximately 96% of all mature P. scolopendrium in New York (1228 total) occurred here (Faust, 1969). The substations at Clark Reservation are also unique in that a census of the population at each substation was begun in 1916 by M. Hunter (1922). Populations at each substation were censused again in 1920 by Hunter. The next census was done in 1936 by M. Faust with assistance from the Syracuse Botanical Club and botany graduate students at Syracuse University. Since 1936, the population at each substation at Clark Reservation has been inventoried about every five years. The last census that was reported in the scientific literature was made in 1956 (Faust, 1960). The objective of this paper is to report results of inventories made about every five years since 1956, including the most recent census, undertaken by the first author in 1986. Seventy years of monitoring data are also examined in relation to potential habitat requirements and conservation measures.",

    "abstract": "During the course of the study of Pteridophyta for the Flora of the Province of San Juan, Argentina, directed by R. Kiesling, several taxonomic novelties have appeared, among them, a new species of Cheilanthes. In order to find the taxonomic position of this species, related species were examined. These species had not been grouped by Tryon and Tryon (1982, pp. 251-255) in their informal classification of species groups in Cheilanthes. Because their characters did not allow inclusion in any of these groups, a new group is proposed. The systematics of the cheilanthoid ferns is being studied by many authors using cytological and electrophoretical data, in order to find more coherent classifications of these complex taxa (Vida et al., 1983; Gastony & Windham, 1987; Wollenweber, 1985; Windham, 1986,1987; Benham et al., 1988). Recently, Argyrochosma and Astrolepis were separated from Notholaena (Windham, 1987; Benham et al., 1988). However, a modern taxonomic treatment is still necessary in Cheilanthes. In fact, this large genus has recently been extended by additions of species formerly placed in Adiantopsis, Doryopteris, and Notholaena (Tryon & Tryon 1982, pp. 267, 272, 296). MATERIALS AND METHODS Collections in BA, BAB, BAF, GH, HBR, ICN, LP, MBM, PACA, and SI and type specimens at K, P, SI, and W, were studied. Ecological and geographical information was obtained from herbarium labels and field data. The following characters were used to distinguish and group the species: rhizome type; rhizome and basal stipe scales; stipe and rhachis sections; axis color and direction; blade division; venation; stipe, rhachis, and blade indument; sorus position; and spore wall (sculpture and structure). Spores from herbarium material were studied with LM and SEM. For light microscopy, material was acetolized by Erdtman's technique, preceded by treatment with hot sodium carbonate (3%) for 2 minutes, with the aim of not destroying the perispore. Slides for study with LM were mounted in glycerine jelly. An Olympus BH2 microscope was used. For the SEM, material was treated with sodium carbonate, washed and suspended in 96% ethanol, then transferred to acetate plates and later coated with gold. A JEOL JSMT-100 SEM was used.",

    "abstract": "We conducted a systematic revision of the genus Loxsomopsis H. Christ (Loxomataceae) based on 99 herbarium sheets representing about 52 separate gatherings. Many morphological characters varied considerably, but as much of this variation was found within individual collections it was of little taxonomic relevance. Characters that varied between specimens but remained roughly constant within individual gatherings included the pubescence of lamina, petiole, and sorus, hair size and coloration, presence or absence of glaucous layers on the lamina surface, and spore surface structure. However, we found no correlation in the occurrence of two or more of these characters and were unable to morphologically define discrete species within the genus. Thus, we consider Loxsomopsis to include one variable species, L. pearcei (Baker) Maxon. The morphological variation is probably the result of the distribution of the species in small, isolated populations in ephemeral early successional habitats, leading to continuous population extinction and establishment of new population based on few propagules. Notes on ecology and distribution, full taxonomy, and specimen citations are provided.",

    "abstract": "The genus Azolla belongs to the Salviniaceae, a family of heterosporous, freefloating ferns occurring in fresh-water habitats, mainly in warm temperate to tropical regions. Stratigraphically, the genus ranges from the late Cretaceous to the present. Six living species usually are recognized. In recent years, considerable interest has been focused on fossil members (some 48 species have been recorded) which, together with the living species, are placed in six sections of the genus. The morphological and taxonomic diversity of Azolla, particularly of its reproductive structures, coupled with the short stratigraphic ranges of individual fossil species, renders it a potentially valuable stratigraphic indicator. In modern species of Azolla sporocarps are borne in pairs which arise from the ventral lobe of the first leaf of a branch. These paired sporocarps may be of the same sex or they may be male and female, termed microsporocarp and megasporocarp, respectively. The microsporocarp contains numerous microsporangia bearing massulae; within the megasporocarp is a single megasporangium containing a megaspore apparatus. The massula and megaspore apparatus are highly distinctive structures peculiar to Azolla. Probably no group of embryophytic plants has a more complex megaspore. The megaspore apparatus consists of the megaspore, above the proximal pole of which lies a superstructure of hair-like filaments called the columella. The columella, which is continuous with similar filaments on the megaspore wall, bears vacuolate, pseudocellular floats, which number three or nine in modern species. The columella and floats constitute the so-called swimming apparatus. The massula is a pseudocellular structure in which the microspores are embedded; in living species it may be eglochidiate or may have hair-like or anchorshaped processes called glochidia. Interpretation of the development of reproductive structures in Azolla commenced many years ago (Meyen, 1836; Griffith, 1844) and has concentrated on A. filiculoides Lam. (Strasburger, 1873, 1889; Campbell, 1893; Hannig, 1911; Duncan, 1940; and Bonnet, 1957). Azolla caroliniana Willd. was studied by Berggren (1880) and by Pfeiffer (1907), A. pinnata R. Br. by Rao (1935), and A. nilotica Dcne. by Demalsy (1954). Excepting Svenson (1944), little emphasis has been placed on the taxonomic use of anatomical and morphological features of the mature reproductive structures of modern Azolla species. Investigation of the reproductive structures of A. prisca Reid & Chandler, from the Lower Oligocene of the Isle of Wight, southern England, reveals a more",

    "abstract": "There is now a fairly extensive vascular crytogam flavonoid literature and there are a number of researchers actively engaged in this research field (Swain & Cooper-Driver, 1973). All vascular crytogam flavonoid work has been done on the sporophyte generation, with one exception: Laurent (1966) determined that Blechnum brasiliense gametophytes produced the flavonoid kaempferol, which is one of the flavonoids produced by the B. brasiliense sporophyte. Reasons for the paucity of information on fern gametophyte flavonoids include the easy accessibility of sporophytes and the now disreputed opinion that flavonoids, being associated with lignin synthesis, are exclusive to vascularized plant bodies. This exclusivity has been lost because flavonoids have been isolated and identified in various non-vascular plant groups: certain algal divisions, bryophytes (Swain, 1974), and fern gametophytes (Laurent, 1966). Initially our investigation was undertaken to determine if Dryopteris intermedia A. Gray and D. marginalis A. Gray gametophytes produce flavonoids and, if so, were these the same flavonoids produced by their sporophytic counterparts (Petersen, 1976). Because of the unusual results of this first portion of the research, the inquiry was amplified to include an analysis of flavonoid content along a developmental profile of the gametophytes. Half-strength White's minimum nutrient medium adjusted to pH 6.0 was used to culture the gametophytes. Liquid cultures were prepared by placing 0.25 g of spores in a 4 1 flask and adding 2 1 of nutrient solution. Separate cultures of D. intermedia and D. marginalis were grown at 22?C under 300 ft-c of illumination from cool-white fluorescent lights in a 12/12 hr diurnal cycle. Gametophytes were harvested and assayed for flavonoids at three developmental stages: (1) pre-antheridial initiation (0 antheridia/gametophyte), (2) antheridial initiation (0 or 1 antheridia/gametophyte), and (3) post-antheridial initiation (4-6 antheridia/gametophyte). Ten-gram samples of harvested gametophytes were immediately extracted in methanol and re-extracted repeatedly until a colorless supernatant was obtained. Concentrated extracts were spotted onto Whatman 3MM chromatography paper (42 x 55 cm). Chromatograms were developed in two dimensions employing the two standard solvent systems for the separation of flavonoids: t-butanol, acetic acid, water (3:1:1) for the first dimension and 15% acetic acid, water for the second dimension. Completed chromatograms were inspected under UV light, both in the presence and absence of NH3. Spot color changes under both conditions were noted and R tvalues determined. Spots were excised, eluted in spectral grade methanol, and UV spectral data obtained using standard procedures (Mabry",

    "abstract": "Of the six genera recognised by Copeland (1947, pp. 14-17) in the Marattiaceae, there are cytological records in the literature for Angiopteris, Marattia and Danaea. These numbers are: n = 40 (Manton & Sledge, 1954; Mehra & Singh, 1955) and n = 80 (Manton & Sledge, 1954; Ninan, 1956) forAngiopteris; n = 39 (Brownlie, 1961), n = 78 (Ninan, 1956), and n = 40 (Walker, in Manton, 1959; Walker, 1966) for Marattia; and n = 80 and triploid hybrids showing 40 bivalents and 40 univalents for Danaea (Walker, 1966). These chromosome counts show thatAngiopteris and Danaea have a base number of 40, whereas Marattia has two base numbers, 39 and 40, the lower number being derived by the loss of one chromosome (Walker, 1966). The cytological uniformity of the representatives which have been examined so far underlines the distinctive morphological, anatomical and embryological characteristics shared by the genera (Campbell, 1911; Bower, 1926). No cytological information is available for two of the remaining genera, Archangiopteris, Macroglossum, or, until now, for Christensenia. Christensenia is unique in the Marattiaceae in possessing palmately divided fronds with scattered, round synangia and reticulate venation. It is found in Assam, Malaysia, Sumatra, Java, Bali, Borneo, and the Philippines. Throughout its range several species have been described, but these are doubtfully distinct and, pending critical taxonomic investigation, all the variants are perhaps best regarded as forms of one species, C. aesculifolia (Blume) Maxon. The genus has not been reported previously from the Solomon Islands, but in the 1960's it was found by different collectors on three of the major islands. During the 1965 Royal Society Expedition to the British Solomon Islands, C. aesculifolia was found by the author on San Cristobal, the southeasternmost island, growing in the lowland forest approximately seven miles inland from Wainoni Bay near the confluence of the Warahito and Pagato Rivers. It was evidently very localized, since considerable searching in the area revealed only two small populations in deep shade on the steep banks of two small calcareous streams feeding the Pagato and Sumaro Rivers respectively (RSS 4215, 28 July 1965, K; RSS 4220, 29 July 1965, K). In addition, specimens are known from the Buin area, Bougainville (25 July 1964, Schodde 3674, CANB) and from Allardyce Harbour, Santa Ysabel (4 Feb 1967, BSIP 8271, HON, K). These records represent a notable extension of the range of the genus eastwards into Melanesia and place Christensenia in a small group of Malesian fern genera now known to reach their southern limit in the Solomon Islands. It is of some phytogeographical interest to note that, so far as the author is aware, the genus has not yet been found in New Guinea, although this may merely be a reflection of insufficient botanical exploration.",

The younger gametophytes have the carrot shape of a Type II gametophyte with a tapering base, a constricted neck, and a gametangial cap with antheridia. With additional growth, the gametophytes become as wide as long and finally wider than long. The wider than long gametophytes are the first to have both antheridia and archegonia on their gametangial caps. The largest gametophytes grown in culture are Type I with irregular disk shapes. The antheridia on all gametophytes are sunken and, for the Lycopodiaceae, the archegonia have medium sized necks with only 3–4 neck canal cells.

In Brazil, these fern fronds represent an income source for numerous households, working with a traditional management system with a maximum of three annual collections in the same area. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the demographic structure of managed R. adiantiformis populations in the south of Brazil and verify the sustainability of the harvesting activity in this region. The study was conducted in an area of Atlantic Rainforest in the State of Rio Grande do Sul. The demographic structure of the managed populations was evaluated in permanent plots, where fronds in the different development phases were counted quarterly for one year. Rainfall was identified as the main factor influencing bud emergence and development. A reduction in R. adiantiformis populations related to forest regeneration was also observed. Fast frond regeneration and the absence of differences between managed and non-managed populations concerning the proportions of buds and young fronds corroborate the ecological sustainability of the management system used by the local harvesters. The results obtained differ largely from those of populations studied in South Africa, where R. adiantiformis plants seem unable to maintain frond density and size when harvested. These contrasting results are probably related to climatic differences between these areas, especially annual rainfall, which is higher in Brazil allowing for the rapid regeneration and sustainable management of this resource in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest.",

Using inverse PCR and single oligonucleotide nested PCR genome-walking approaches, the full-length genomic sequences of NEO genes were determined for three fern species Coniogramme intermedia var. glabra, Plagiogyria distinctissima and Pronephrium lakhimpurnense. Sequence and structure analysis results indicate that they possess a conserved structure and organization. Introns are absent in three genes. They each contain an 4332, 4308 and 4317-bp ORF (Open reading frame), encoding a deduced protein with 1443, 1435 and 1438 amino acid residues. Their N-terminus consists of a putative functional phytochrome sensory module including PAS (Per / Arnt / Sim), GAF (cGMP specific phosphodiesterase / adenylate cyclases / formate hydrogen lyase transcription) and PHY (phytochrome) domains, whereas the C-terminus contains a nearly complete phototropin with two LOV (Light, Oxygen and Voltage-sensing) and one STKc (Serine/Threonine protein kinases, catalytic) domains. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that they are evolutionarily close to their homolog AcNEO found in Adiantum capillus-veneris. The 3D structures of the functional domains were computer-modeled, and the pivotal amino acid sites for each functional domain were also identified.

The relationship between different life-history traits of a species and abundance tend to be conditional and context dependent. We were interested in whether the local relative population density of three fern species in Estonia is related to post-emergence growth of their young sporophytes, i.e., that the locally abundant species, D. carthusiana, has the highest vegetative growth in its first growth periods and the two less abundant species, D. dilatata and D. expansa, have lower. We were also interested in differences between generative traits of young sporophytes of three species, specifically in the number of spores. We grew the species in a garden experiment for two vegetation periods, 2004–2005, until the first sporulation. The relative population density of the three Dryopteris species was related to the relative post-emergence growth of the species. The most abundant species D. carthusiana, exhibited the highest values of vegetative growth parameters in the first growth period. The less abundant D. dilatata and D. expansa both had shorter fronds, shorter intensive growth periods and lower leaf elongation rates. Dryopteris dilatata had a different vegetative growth strategy compared to the other two species; it differed in timing of intensive growth of frond length and increase of frond number and had the lowest values of generative parameters among the three species.",

    "abstract": "With the purpose of providing a basis for programs of sustainable management in the conservation of this endangered species, this paper presents morphological aspects on the gametophyte development of Dicksonia sellowiana (Dicksoniaceae) by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Dicksonia sellowiana spores were germinated in Morh's nutrient solution modified by Dyer (1979) under a 16-hour photoperiod at 23 ± 2°C. To determine the best substrate for gametophyte and sporophyte development, 30 days after spore sowing filamentous gametophytes were transferred to different substrates: soil rich in organic matter; coxim (coconut fiber); sterilized typic hapludult soil (distroferric red nitosoil); and sterilized typic hapludult soil (distroferric red nitosoil) with the addition of organic compost. The best system for D. sellowiana growth was the red soil with the addition of compost. Fifteen days after spore sowing in mineral solution, gametophytes were filamentous. Some had attained laminar morphology and had established an oblique cell division, giving rise to the obconic cell. Laminar gametophytes were observed 30 days after spore sowing and cordate gametophytes were observed after 45 days. Mature cordate gametophytes were observed after 80–90 days. After 245 days 84.67% of gametophytes had produced sporophytes in sterilized red soil with the addition of organic compost. In typic hapludult soil, without the additional termophilic compost, sporophyte formation was delayed (development after 180 days). When gametophytes were transplanted to soil rich in organic matter they did not develop and in the “coxim” substrate, which is a substitute for the “xaxim” substrate, only filamentous gametophytes were observed at the end of the study.",

    "abstract": "Alpine vegetation is one of the most restricted ecosystems in Mexico. Its greatest extent occurs on the high peaks of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB). In this study we document fern diversity of the alpine vegetation of central Mexico, generate a floristic list, provide a key for determination, and report the elevational limits of the species present. The latter information will serve as a baseline for future comparisons to determine potential upward migration of fern species, as is predicted with global warming. In comparison to the páramo vegetation of Central and South America, fern diversity in the alpine vegetation of central Mexico is surprisingly low, and only five families, 11 genera, and 12 species are documented. This represents 1.5% of the ferns species known from the country. Polypodiaceae is the most diverse family, with four genera and four species, followed by Pteridaceae (three genera and three species) and Dryopteridaceae (two genera and two species). Aspleniaceae and Woodsiaceae each have a single genus, the former with two species and the latter with one species. All of the alpine ferns growing in the TMVB are leptosporangiate, and there are no arborescent, epiphytic, aquatic, or heliophilous ferns. Asplenium castaneum, Cystopteris fragilis, and Polystichum speciosissimum are widespread in the alpine vegetation, whereas the remaining species are restricted to one or few sites. With regard to upper elevational limit, the highest occurring species were Asplenium castaneum (4,569 m), Polystichum speciosissimum (4,490 m), and Cystopteris fragilis (4,377 m).",

However, for most species of the genus, no study has ever shown the composition of these structures or proven their nature comprehensively. Based on scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses, we confirmed the presence of silica bodies in microphylls of Selaginella, described four distribution patterns of the structures, and carried out a terminology review. The presence of silica may be related to mechanical protection of the cell wall, activation of defense mechanisms, and providing support for microphylls. Further in-depth analyses based on studies on the evolution of this character remain necessary to elucidate its relevance for the ecological relationships and systematics of Selaginella.",

    "abstract": "A review of work on the origin and phylogenetic relationships of six systems of allopolyploid homosporous ferns and their progenitors serves as the basis for assessing the history and status of ideas relating to the biogeography of polyploid ferns. The likely dates of origin for the polyploids from recent analyses provide a historical context not previously available, making possible rigorous tests of hypotheses about the history of polyploids, especially the origin, distribution, and duration of polyploid ferns as lineages. Insularity figures prominently in developing an understanding of polyploid fern biogeography. The origin and persistence of polyploid ferns is enhanced by the empty niche space and high disturbance on Darwinian islands. In addition, the greater precinctiveness of polyploid ferns related to larger spore size is likely a selective advantage on islands, consistent with the number of high polyploids encountered among ferns on oceanic islands. Though recently originated polyploid ferns usually have identifiable progenitors with which they are partially sympatric, the rate of expansion of these ferns beyond the range of their progenitors varies. In two cases from Austral regions, long-term persistence and divergent speciation have been demonstrated in widespread polyploids and polyploid lineages with unknown diploid progenitors, though the general consensus is that polyploids do not persist in the long term.",

    "abstract": "Salvinia molesta in Mexico.-Thegenus Salvinia Ség.comprises ten species of mostly tropical ferns that are floating aquatics or less commonly stranded on receding shorelines.Among these, perhaps the best known is S. molesta D.S. Mitchell (Kariba weed, giant salvinia, giant water spangles), which is notorious as an extremely aggressive invasive exotic in both the New and Old Worlds.This species is extremely fast growing and has the capacity to cover the surface of even large bodies of standing and slow-moving water, forming so dense a continuous mat that oxygen exchange is inhibited and light passage is precluded, to the detriment of other aquatic organisms.Because it is a sterile pentaploid (n=45; Loyal and Grewal, Cytologia 31: 330-338.1966), S. molesta reproduces only vegetatively by fragmentation and regrowth; thus humans, waterfowl, and surface drainage are the main dispersal agents.The taxon first came to the world's attention in the 1930s, when plants inadvertently released into a lake in Sri Lanka quickly grew into a major infestation.Subsequently, it caused similar problems in portions of Australia, India, southeastern Asia, and Africa (Moran, Fiddlehead Forum 19[4+5]: 26-28.1992).It was not until 1972 that the taxon was correctly determined to represent an unnamed species and was described as new to science, based on plants infesting Lake Kariba, along the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe (Mitchell, Brit.Fern Gaz.10: 251-252.1972).In the United States, S. molesta and its relatives are considered noxious weeds under the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) and thus are prohibited by law from international import or interstate shipment.Salvinia molesta is a member of the S. auriculata Aubl.complex, which consists of four taxa, all native to South America and Trinidad (Forno, Aquatic Bot.17: 71-83.1983).All of these taxa (but in particular S. molesta) are considered potentially severe aquatic weeds outside of their native ranges.Forno and Harley (Aquatic Bot.6: 185-187.1979) were the first to discover native populations of S. molesta growing at relatively low elevations in temperate southeastern Brazil.Curiously, although the species has proliferated in the Old World tropics, it apparently has not spread significantly thus far in the neotropics (Moran, Fl.Mesoamer.1: 396-397.1995).The introduction of S. molesta into temperate North America is very recent.Nauman (Flora of North America 2: 336-337.1993) saw no wild-collected material, but mentioned that it was a candidate for future escape based on its cultivation in Florida.The species was first reported in the wild from a small pond in South Carolina (Johnson, Aquatics 17[4]: 22, 1985), soon thereafter from a reservoir in eastern Texas and adjacent Louisiana (Jacono, Sida 18: 927-928.1999), and subsequently from several other southeastern states (Jacono et al., Castanea 66: 214-226.2001).At about the same time, infestations were first noted in agricultural canals in southeastern California, and subsequently in the Colorado River.Salvinia molesta was first reported as present on the",

Ex situ germplasm storage and growth are important complementary tools for conserving this rare fern. This study was conducted to document the reproductive biology of this species. Mature sporophylls of A. cornucopia were collected in May, 2012 from Mt. Apo, the Philippines. Each sporangium bore 64 yellow, monolete spores. The average spore size was 49.3±3.7 µm. Fresh spores germinated 100% within one week of sowing (mean germination time (MGT) <1 week). Air-dried mature spores remained completely viable even after one year of storage at 3°C, although mean germination time was somewhat delayed (MGT = 1.4 weeks). Spore germination was of the Vittaria-type, whereas gametophyte development was of the Drynaria-type. Adult gametophytes were cordiform-annual and gametangia were of the leptosporangiate type. Unicellular papillate hairs appeared on marginal, dorsal, and ventral surfaces of the gametophytes. Gametophytes first produced antheridia and archegonia after seven weeks of culture. Gametophytes began to sexually produce sporophytes after 13 weeks of culture. The rate of sporophyte production reached 64% after 26 weeks culture. Results of this study suggest that cold temperature spore storage and in vitro culture offer reliable techniques for conserving this rare fern.",

Results suggest that lipids and carbohydrates increase in percent of total biomass (w/w) throughout development. In addition, lipid and carbohydrate content can change with varying culture conditions.

Relative to other spore traps, our proposed trap is simple to build, easy to mount in the field, easy to carry, maintenance free, and requires no energy source. In addition, our trap records rainfall volume, and the quantity of spores captured can be expressed in terms of area-density (particle m−2).

Because the epithet villosa is preoccupied in Myriopteris and there are no synonyms for this distinctive taxon, a new name is required. The species is herein renamed Myriopteris windhamii.",

Since this taxon is now known to be hexaploid, its ability to cross freely with tetraploid and diploid ones is somewhat surprising, yet evidence from morphologic characters indicates that it does so. The following have been reported: D. CLINTONIANA X CRISTATA. This was published2 as Aspidium cristatum X A. cristatum var. clintonianum. The frequently expressed view that D. clintoniana and D. cristata intergrade and are therefore only varietally distinct is manifestly based on the manner in which this hybrid combines their features. It should prove on cytologic study to be pentaploid. D. CLINTONIANA X GOLDIANA. In reporting the existence of this hybrid, Dowell3 considered it to represent D. goldiana ssp. celsa W. Palmer. Although this view has been widely accepted, cytologic study by Dr. S. Walker4 has shown it to be incorrect.",

    "abstract": "Some years ago I acquired a small wooded area next to my garden and to make it more interesting, I began planting ferns there. At the same time a friend, Mr. Thomas Carlson, who is a local pteridologist, introduced me to the American Fern Society, and I was all set for a new hobby. Later I became acquainted with the late Mr. M. D. Mann, Jr., then Treasurer of the American Fern Society. Many will remember his interest in the Society and its members, his beautiful fern garden and his give away department. Being a conservationist rather than a botanist, I began growing ferns from spores, doing some experimenting in order to find the most practical methods for the amateur fern grower. Of course, I did some reading, too. This review was originally intended only to cover the development of spores into prothallia, ending the process with the first leaf or leaves of the young sporophytes or fernlets, a process which, in the case of viable spores, requires only that the spores be surrounded by an atmosphere at or close to the point of saturation (of moisture), while resting on a moist surface and subject to favorable light and temperature conditions. However, the amateur who sows fern spores does so in order ultimately to produce ferns for his garden. So it appeared logical to pursue the subsequent development of the tiny sporophytes or fernlets through transplanting, and so forth. This article covers only the growing of ferns by the amateur not possessing a greenhouse. Commercial methods are not considered.",

    "abstract": "The coming decades are predicated to bring widespread shifts in local, regional, and global climatic patterns. Currently there is limited understanding of how ferns will respond to these changes and few studies have attempted to model shifts in fern distribution in response to climate change. In this paper, we present a series of these models using the country of New Zealand as our study system. Ferns are notably abundant in New Zealand and play important ecological roles in early succession, canopy biology, and understory dynamics. Here we describe how fern distributions have changed since the Last Glacial Maximum to the present and predict how they will change with anthropogenic climate change – assuming no measures are taken to reduce carbon emissions. To do this, we used MaxEnt species distribution modelling with publicly available data from gbif.org and worldclim.org to predict the past, present, and future distributions of 107 New Zealand fern species. The present study demonstrates that ferns in New Zealand have and will continue to expand their ranges and migrate southward and upslope. Despite the predicted general increased range size as a result of climate change, our models predict that the majority (52%) of many species' current suitable habitats may be climatically unsuitable in 50 years, including the ecologically important group: tree ferns. Additionally, fern communities are predicted to undergo drastic shifts in composition, which may be detrimental to overall ecosystem functioning in New Zealand.",

This suggestion was accepted by George E. Davenport,1 who formally described the plant as Aspidiumr cristatum x ,marginale, proposing Dryopteris cristata x marginalis as an alternative name. He discussed the matter at some length before a meeting of the American Fern Society at Boston in 1898, and his paper appeared in a Fern Society publication.2 Dodge's suggestion and Davenport's paper served as a stimulus to further study, to the reexamination of herbarium specimens that had been doubtfully identified, to increasing watchfulness in the field, to experimental work, and to published descriptions and discussions of the problems. Gradually, as additional data accumulated, and as the difficulties of any alternative explanation for an increasing number of plants and specimens were recognized, the validity of the theory of natural",

Most of these have been collected in Indiana. In this article I will give a simple explanation of forking: its cause, production and result. I am indebted to Mr. C. A. Weatherby and Mr. R. C. Benedict for their help in the preparation of this paper. Although the cause of forking is primarily a problem for the cytologist and geneticist, certain facts may be garnered from gross observation that throw some light on the problem. Sometimes a plant will bear forked fronds year after year with the type of forking essentially the same in successive years. An example of this is Pellaea atropurpurea var. cristata Trelease. This variety growing at Eureka, St. Louis county, Missouri, has produced the same kind of forked fronds for years. Another example is a plant of Polystichum acrostichoides (Michx.) Schott which I found in La Porte county, Indiana (Fig. 1). This is an extreme form with all of the pinnae forked and the tip of the frond forked many times. The fronds of 1936 show exactly the same kind of forking as those of 1935. Dr. E. G. Logue has germinated spores from a forked plant of Dryopteris Goldiana (Hooker) Gray and grown the young plants. He says that the young plants show [Volume 28, No. 2 of the JOURNAL, pages 41-80, plates 5-8, was issued June 18, 1938.]",

    "abstract": "Fences made of wood, or of wire supported between posts, are almost unknown in Ecuador. Fences of rails, pickets, or of boards fastened to upright posts would succumb rapidly to decay and to the ravages of termites. Wire fencing is prohibitively expensive, and even if it were not, the posts upon which the wire is strung would be just as susceptible to fungus and termite damage as those used in constructing an all-wood fence. Add to these deterring factors a scarcity of readily accessible timber in the inter-Andean valley in which many of the larger towns are located, and one quickly understands why earthen walls from one to four feet thick and about seven feet high take the place of fences, as we know them, throughout much of Ecuador. Small suckers or offshoots from mature plants of Agave sisalana and Fourcroya occidentalis, both fiber plants, are planted along the top of many of the tamped earth walls to reduce erosion during the rainy season. (In the towns and cities a capping of tile or of a hard plaster commonly serves the same purpose and does not eventually split the wall with enlarging roots.) The walls upon which the fiber-producing plants grow form excellent habitats for a number of xerophytic or semixerophytic ferns. Practically every earthen wall that has stood through three or more seasons supports from one to a dozen species of ferns. The fern flora on the earthen walls in the larger cities rarely approaches the richness of that on similar walls in the country, for the",

Their cumulative labors have accounted very satisfactorily for the species of the United Stated and a fair proportion of those of Mexico; and though these species are rather numerous and often very local, and rest on minute and somewhat repetitious characters, it does not appear that the group has been at all seriously over-segregated. For the United States, it can be regarded as now reasonably well understood. Nevertheless, except for Hieronymus's very condensed and now out-of-date synopsis in Die Natiirlichen Pflanzenfamilien and Underwood's amplification of it,1 no one has recently attempted to key out the species of more than a relatively limited area.

Associated plants were Ilex opaca, Myrica cerifera, and Quercus rabra (Spanish Oak), with an undergrowth of Vaccinium, Gaylussacia, and other plants.

Fendler was a man of unusual and attractive personality and led a varied life: before describing the book, it may be well to give some account of the man. Fendler was born at Gumbinen, Prussia, Jan. 10, 1813. His father died when the son was six months old; the step-father who in due time succeeded him, could afford to give the boy only an irregular and imperfect education. After some schooling, he was apprenticed to the town clerk; but he was born with a love of travel and the prospect of a life spent at a desk copying legal documents did not at all appeal to him. He presently secured an appointment as general assistant to a government physician who was studying the cholera situation on the Russian border and got his first experience of the world in the midst of an epidemic of that disease. Later, he learned the tanner's trade; later still, in the effort to improve his condition, he entered a government technical school at Berlin. His health nearly broke down under the severe standards of work enforced there (he states that very few students lasted out the full course); partly by way of restoring it, he tramped about Germany for a year, knapsack on back, as a travelling artisan. Finally, in 1836, he sailed from Bremen for the United States. He landed at Baltimore and worked for a while in a tannery there, but found the work too hard and soon changed both residence and occupation, going to work in a lamp factory in New York. But travel and the wilderness seem always to have been calling him; by 1838 we find him in St. Louis, then on the frontier, after a round-",

Based on allozyme patterns and chloroplast and nuclear sequence data, it is inferred to be a diploid and the maternal (i.e., chloroplast donor) parent of three allotetraploids, B. furculatum, B. minganense, and B. paradoxum, with which it shares similar morphological traits. Botrychium farrarii is closely related to B. campestre sensu lato, from which it differs primarily by having longer trophophore and sporophore stalks. A key to B. farrarii and morphologically-similar species is presented. At this time, B. farrarii is documented by few individuals from four small, montane forest openings and roadsides in close proximity within a single watershed. Its full geographic range and habitat preferences remain unknown, and we hope this paper will spur discovery of additional populations. Until the species is known to be more abundant, it would be prudent to manage each site to maintain population viability, including avoidance of actions that could adversely impact plant persistence or habitat suitability.",

It is intended to provide background to readers of this issue and to alleviate the need for repeating this information by subsequent authors. At present, 38 species of Botrychium have been described, with occurrences worldwide in a diverse range of habitats, most commonly in meadows dominated by herbaceous perennial flowering plants that are the alternative host of the mycorrhizal fungi that support belowground growth of Botrychium. The genus produces small aboveground leaves that produce sporangia. Leaves of individual plants may remain dormant belowground in some years. Individual plants may live for decades. Spores germinate belowground and, following colonization by a mycorrhizal fungus, produce belowground bisexual gametophytes that have a high probability of intragametophytic selfing, commonly resulting in populations with low allelic variability. Because of their small size and reduced morphological complexity, Botrychium species have often been referred to as cryptic species. Though difficult to identify, genetic analysis has shown species distinction to be equal to that of non-cryptic species, and has allowed recognition of morphological characteristic of each taxon.",

    "abstract": "The name Pyrrosia, although published by Mirbel in 1803, was overlooked by pteridologists until relatively recently. Instead, the synonyms Cyclophorus Desv., 1811, or Niphobolus Kaulf., 1824, were used. Giesenhagen (1901) published the only monograph, treating 50 species in Niphobolus and describing their venation, epidermis, and indument. Farwell (1931, pp. 241-246) recognized that Pyrrosia is the correct name of the genus. R. C. Ching (1935) studied the species of the Asian mainland, Japan, and Taiwan Province of China. He transferred 49 known species to Pyrrosia and described five new species. This has been the only extensive systematic paper on the genus. Nayar and others (1961, 1965, 1967) did detailed work on the morphology and anatomy of the Indian species of Pyrrosia in which they divided the 13 Indian species into six groups, some of which are apparently unnatural and inconvenient to use. For example, they placed P. lingua (Thunb.) Farw., which has stellate hairs with only lanceolate arms in the P. heteractis group, although each stellate hair of P. heteractis (Mett. ex Kuhn) Ching has 1-3 longer, acicular arms in addition to the lanceolate arms. Van Alderwerelt van Rosenburg (1908, pp. 678-696) divided 34 Malesian species into two sections under the generic name Cyclophorus. Section Niphobolus had venation similar to that of Campyloneurum (more or less regular, subquadrangular areolae with two or more simple or forked, included, extrorse veinlets). Section Niphopsis had venation similar to that of Pleopeltis (more or less irregularly netted with single, free, included, variously oriented veinlets). This arrangement has something to recommend it, but since the blade of Pyrrosia is very thick and in most species the veins cannot be seen without clearing, venation is difficult to use for identifications.",

    "abstract": "The identification of Hawaiian tree ferns is difficult for most laymen and taxonomists because of past nomenclatural confusion, misapplication of the specific names, and the absence of a complete key to all of the species. Although Sadleria, a Hawaiian endemic genus of the Blechnaceae, has some arborescent species which are referred to as tree ferns, these are not treated in this paper. The correct nomenclature of the six Cibotium species found in Hawaii is presented. A simple key is given for the species. This is supplemented with descriptions of their characteristics as seen in their native habitats. I have deposited in the herbarium of the University of Hawaii my reference collection of entire fronds for each of the Hawaiian species described. The range of Cibotium extends from Assam through China, Malaya, Indonesia, the Philippine Islands, and Hawaii to southern Mexico and Guatemala. There are three Asiatic species (Holttum, 1963, pp. 164-166).: C. barometz (L.) J. Smith, C. cumingii Kunze, and C. arachnoideum (C. Chr.) Holttum. The Central American species are: C. schiedei Schlecht. & Cham. (Mexico), C. regale Versch. & Lem. (Mexico to Honduras), and C. wendlandii Mett. ex Kuhn (Mexico and Guatemala), according to Smith (1981, pp. 75-76) and Stolze (1976, pp. 94-97). The six endemic Hawaiian Cibotium species are: C. glaucum (J.E. Smith) Hook. & Am., C. chamissoi Kaulf., C. splendens (Gaud.) Krajina ex Skottsb., C. nealiae Degener in Degener & Hatheway, C. hawaiense Nakai & Ogura in Ogura, and C. st.johnii Krajina. Cibotium glaucum and C. chamissoi are found in the rain forest areas of Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Maui, and Hawaii. Cibotium splendens is common on Oahu; forms of it may also be on Molokai and Maui, but this has not been confirmed. Cibotium nealiae and C. st.-johnii are apparently restricted to Kauai. Cibotium hawaiense is endemic to the island of Hawaii; it is locally abundant on that island. I have seen it close to Wright Road in the Olaa Forest, at Puu Makaala near the Stainback Highway, at the end of the Olaa Back Road, above Laupahoehoe, and in the Kohala Mountains. The most common species on the island of Hawaii is C. glaucum. Cibotium chamissoi is the next most abundant. The key to resolving the nomenclatural confusion associated with the Hawaiian tree ferns lies in understanding Hooker's treatment of the genus in the Species Filicum (1844). He separated C. chamissoi Kaulf. and C. glaucum (J.E. Smith) Hook. & Am. and described a new species, C. menziesii Hook. Krajina in Skottsberg (1942, pp. 30-41) showed the latter to be identical to C. chamissoi Kaulf. and the name C. chamissoi sensu Hooker to be C. splendens (Gaud.) Krajina ex Skottsb.",

This material, which is comprised of oxidative, cross-linked polymers of carotenoids and/or carotenoid esters (Brooks & Shaw, 1968; Gooday et al., 1974), is resistant to ultraviolet irradiation, desiccation, biological decay, and non-oxidative chemical attack (Shaw, 1971; Strohl et al., 1977). The extensive work of Zetsche and co-workers (1928-1937), and the later studies of Shaw and co-workers (1964-1974), summarized by Brooks and Shaw (1971) and Shaw (1971), have provided substantial information on the chemistry, biochemistry, and geochemistry of sporopollenin. Sporopollenin has a wide taxonomic distribution, occurring in myxobacteria, fungi, algae, pteridosperms, gymnosperms, and angiosperms (Brooks, 1971; Atkinson et al., 1972; Gooday et al., 1974; Strohl et al., 1977; Honegger & Brunner, 1981). Sporopollenin in sporocarps of Azolla-a heterosporous, free-floating fern that occurs worldwide in freshwater habitats (Moore, 1969)-was inferred histochemically (Lucas & Duckett, 1980), but not chemically defined. Therefore, we undertook this effort to verify the presence of sporopollenin in Azolla spores, and gain some insight into its contribution to the structure of spore apparatus. We have now identified this compound in Azolla spore apparatus by infrared spectroscopy (IR) following acetolysis. The percent (by weight) sporopollenin of the spore apparatus has been determined, and its contribution to spore apparatus architecture demonstrated with scanning electron microscopy prior to and following acetolysis.",

A subspecies, E. ramosissimum subsp. debile (Roxb.) Hauke, is found in India, southeastern Asia, and the south Pacific Islands to Fiji. This species is a member of subg. Hippochaete and, as the specific epithet indicates, is much branched, unlike most of the other members of the subgenus. It is also unlike them in often having double or triple lines of stomata between the ridges along the stems. In these characters it can readily be mistaken for E. giganteum, E. x schaffneri, or, when with only single lines of stomata, E. myriochaetum. As with other species of Equisetum, E. ramosissimum subsp. ramosissimum is variable (Milde recognized 34 varieties). In addition to the species mentioned above, it also can be mistaken for E. hyemale, E. laevigatum, E. x ferrissii, or E. x moorei (in Europe). But the combination of regular branching, long internodes, long sheaths, brownish sheath coloration with a black girdle, flattened sheath segments, persistent but shriveling sheath teeth, often multiple lines of stomata, prominent vallecular and carinal collenchyma, silica surface with numerous pilules, and green spores tends to distinguish this species from all the others, which may show one or more of the above characters, but not most or all of them. Under the distribution ofE. ramosissimum, Milde (1867, p. 461) listed British Columbia 49? n Br. (Dr. Lyall). Since there has been no further record of this species in North America, it has not been included in the flora of North America. In the last few years, however, a few collections from North America have come to my attention: NORTH CAROLINA: New Hanover Co.: Dense population of branching plants on sandy ditchbank through ballast dump on east side of Northeast River, south of the old US-17 bridge, Wilmington, 22 Aug 1970, S.

Burkhalter 2254 (FLAS). When Leonard sent me a specimen in August, 1970, he described it as evergreen, mostly branched, and at its reproductive peak, and he noted that the area was rich in European records. I wrote to him that it looked to me like E. xferrissii (known from North Carolina), but because of the time of coning and presence of green spores, it must be an odd form of E. hyemale var. affine.",

REYNOLDS* The phenomenon of apical dominance (generally defined as the inhibition of lateral buds or meristems by the apical bud or meristem) occurs generally throughout the plant kingdom and does not appear to be limited to higher vascular plants. Albaum (1938a) demonstrated that the central growth zone, located in the indentation of the roughly heart-shaped prothallus ofPteris longifolia, was analogous to an apical meristem. If this apical meristem was excised from the prothallus, numerous adventitious gametophytes, each with a central growth zone, would arise from the previously inhibited cells. The meristematic zone was considered responsible for the maintenance of apical dominance as long as there was a continuum of living cells between this meristem and the rest of the prothallus. As far as I am aware, the present report is the first to document meristem-induced apical dominance in isolated prothallial tissues where there was a total lack of cellular continuity between the meristem and the affected cells.",

From the latter city there is a road to the northeast that goes over the mountains to the village of Huautla de Jimenez. This road has been best known in recent years for its halucinogenic fungi, hippies, and police-in that order. The road rises steeply out of Teotitlan and snakes its way up to the top of a ridge, crossing it at Puerto Soledad. The upper parts of the slope are forested with pine and oak. The forest at the top is the wettest and consists largely of oaks and some Podocarpus. The wet winds from the Gulf of Mexico keep this region moist the year around. I have collected over 100 species of ferns within two miles of the pass, where the wet forest is nearly continuous. The road continues near the top of the ridge, dives to the bottom of another valley and climbs part of another ridge before reaching Huautla de Jimenez. Most of the road is heavily cultivated or at least cut over. After passing Puerto Soledad, which is 19 miles by road from Teotitlan, the forest is soon interrupted by agriculture, but there are small patches of forest and several waterfalls by the road. In 1970 Mr. Steven Leonard and I collected a remarkably filmy fern on the ground in the spray beside a small waterfall. At first it looked to us somewhat like Trichomanes radicans, for its leaf tissue was only one or two cells thick. But on closer examination I found that the plant had tiny dorsal sori with hood-like indusia typical of Cystopteris. A similar specimen was found at the United States National Herbarium from Veracruz, also from a waterfall. This suggests that the thin frond texture may be due to constant waterfall spray, but apparently this is not the case. A plant was grown for nearly a year in the greenhouse of the New York Botanical Garden, during which time the new leaves continued to be as filmy as those of the original plant. Consequently, I am describing the plant as a new species:",

Put if one examines the vascular anatomy, scales and spores, one finds the superficial similarity hides a great diversity. 'he three genera are Stenochlaena s.str., Lomaricpsis F6e, and Teratcphyllum Mett. I studied these plants in the forests of Malaya, and wrote a paper describing their differences (Holttum, 1932). Ihe differences are also summarized by Copeland (1947), and the species of the three genera in the Malay Peninsula are described in Holttum, 1954. The genera Stenochlaena and Teratcphyllum are confined to the Old V orld, but Lcmaricpsis is pantropic. I hus all tropical American species formerly included in Stenochlaena belong to Lomariopsis (see Holttum, 1939), but Vareschi (1968) still places them in Stenochlaena, and his generic description includes a statement about vascular anatomy which applies to Stenochlaena s.str. and is not true of the species he describes. In 1932 I expressed an opinion that Stenochlaena is related to Acrostichum (both genera have an exceedingly complex vascular anatomy) and thus to Pteris, and I still think this possible; but Copeland has included Stenochlaena in the Blechnaceae. Lomariopsis and Teratophyllum appear to me to be related to Tectaria and Ctenitis. Six species of Stenochlaena are here recognized, two in Africa, the others in Asia, Malesia, and the Pacific. One of the latter has not yet received a valid name; as pointed out by Morton (1970) my attempt to give it one ignored the terms of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. In my paper of 1969 I also reported that examination of a type specimen in Presl's herbarium necessitated a re-interpretation of his name S. juglandi119",

Two preparative techniques were employed: maceration and sectioning. Under SEM macerated tracheary elements from roots, rhizomes and leaf rachises showed large scalariform perforations lacking pit membranes, thus constituting apparent perforation plates. The perforations showed terminal as well as lateral positions. “Multiple end-wall” and “intermittent” perforation plates were also observed. In sectioned material tracheary cells exhibited mostly intact pit membranes conforming tracheids with scalariform and circular to oval wall pitting. In roots, true perforations seemed to be present in some tracheary cells. A different degree of pit membrane perforations were registered in both macerated and sectioned material, thus suggesting the existence of “incipient vessel elements”. According to our observations macerations produce alterations in the xylem tissue, which can lead to misinterpretations.",

    "abstract": "Four members of the alpha-tubulin gene family were examined in Ceratopteris richardii. Genetic linkage mapping based on a population of nearly 500 Doubled Haploid Lines was able to position three or four members of this gene family on linkage groups 17, 24, and 28, respectively (two of the four observed polymorphic restriction fragments containing alpha-tubulin genes are either identical or map too close to each other on linkage group 17 to be distinguishable in map distance). Non-mapable monomorphic bands observed on probed Southern blots suggest that the alpha-tubulin gene family in this species is large. Four alpha-tubulin genes from C. richardii were sequenced and found to be fairly similar to each other in terms of their amino acid sequences, with their greatest diversity at the carboxy-terminal ends. BLAST comparisons found each of these four amino acid sequences more similar to an alpha-tubulin from a dicot, gymnosperm, or alga species than it was to any other alpha-tubulin sequence presently known from Ceratopteris or from the fern Anemia phyllitidis or the moss Physcomitrella patens. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences placed three of the four Ceratopteris alpha-tubulin gene copies in a clade with copies from Pseudotsuga and Anemia, consistent with a history of two gene duplication events, one following and one preceding the divergence of ferns and seed plants. The fourth copy is robustly separated from the preceding three and placed in a clade of algal alpha-tubulin genes, suggesting its divergence from the ancestor of the other three before the divergence of algae and land plants. As characterized thus far, the alpha-tubulin gene family of C. richardii is relatively large as compared to the six copies known from fully sequenced Arabidopsis thaliana, a condition that may be correlated with the large genome size and diverse life history constraints of this homosporous fern species. These findings suggest several new opportunities for research into the evolution, function, and regulation of the alpha-tubulin gene family in Ceratopteris.",

    "abstract": "The various species of the aquatic fern genus Marsilea grow in India throughout the year, braving the vagaries of climate and thus indicating their wide tolerance to different factors of climate, of which temperature is one of the most important. Different species seem to have different temperature tolerance ranges. Marsilea quadrifolia grows in Kashmir (Gupta, 1962) where the winter temperature goes far below freezing, whereas M. aegyptiaca occurs even on bare rocks and survives summer temperatures exceeding 50?C in Jodhpur (Gopal, 1968). It is true that water plants are at an advantage inasmuch as the fluctuations in water temperature are not so wide, but this does not altogether apply to amphibious plants like Marsilea, which pass a part of their life under terrestrial conditions during the dry season. These considerations led to some experiments on five Indian species of Marsilea: M. aegyptiaca, M. maheshwzarii, 1M. minuta, M. quadrifolia, and M. rajasthanensis. Their responses to different temperature treatments are reported below. In all the experiments five-internode pieces of rhizome taken from clonal cultures were transplanted to earthen pots. After three days, when the plants had become well established, they were subjected to the various experimental treatments. In the first set of experiments, the potted plants were kept at three different temperatures: (i) at a constant 15?C in a phytotron chamber, (ii) in an open garden where the temperature fluctuated between 25?C at night and 40?C during the day, and (iii) in a phytotron chamber at 15?C during the night and in the open at 38-40?C during the day. In the first two treatments normal growth occurred, but the total dry matter accumulation was more than twice as much at the higher daytime temperature than at continuous 15?C. There was almost no growth in the third treatment where the diurnal temperature was about 25?C hotterthan 150",

    "abstract": "Xylary tissues of the pteridophytes have beeii studied in detail by several workers, but phloem tissue has received very little attention. The probable reason for this is the difficulties encountered in studying the anatomical structure of the phloem, for example in cutting perfect radial longitudinal and cross sections of sieve elements showing the details of sieve areas and in staining the tissues. Little is known about the phloem anatomy of Equisetum. I have studied phloem in the rhizomes and aerial shoots of E. hyemale, E. telmateia, E. arvense, and E. giganteum. This paper concerns only the latter two species. The purpose of this investigation was to gather data on Equisetum phloem that could be compared with presumably comparable tissue described in some American calamites (Agashe, 1964). Johnson (1933), in discussing the origin and development of certain tissues in E. scirpoides, mentioned the occurrence of sieve plates with small pores on the lateral walls of the sieve cells. Golub and Wetmore (1948) described the development of phloem in E. arvense. According to them, protophloem sieve cells may be 3 mm long or more. Their longitudinal walls have many, transversely elliptical, faintly staining sieve areas; such areas are also found on the oblique end walls, but they do not seem to form distinct sieve plates. Mletaphloem sieve cells are longer, larger in diameter, and have densely granular cytoplasm and very thick walls; sieve areas are more common on the end wall in metaphloem than in protophloem. There appears to be some confusion in the literature regarding the definitions of sieve cells and sieve tubes. The presently accepted definitions, according to Esau, Cheadle, and Gifford (1953), who quote Cheadle and Whitford, state that a sieve tube consists of sieve elements joined end-to-end to form a vertical tube-like structure in which sieve areas are more highly specialized on the 74",

In addition to known structural and physiological adaptations, we hypothesized that microscopy and shotgun metagenomic sequencing might reveal eukaryotic microorganisms such as fungi that may aid Equisetum survival. Here, we report evidence for several lineages of eukaryotic microbes associated with giant Equisetum xylochaetum, which dominates vegetation in saline streambeds of remote valleys in the hyper-arid Atacama Desert, Chile. Plant material was collected and field-preserved at two comparatively low-disturbance sites; DNA extracted in Chile using low-shear methods was later sequenced, 18S and 28S rDNA taxonomic marker sequences were selected for SILVAngs classification, allowing comparisons to eukaryotic microorganisms previously inferred for earlier-diverging plant lineages. SEM, fluorescence microscopy, and/or LM of toluidine blue-stained sections of roots indicated protists, epiphytic and endophytic fungi, and cortical nematodes. Eukaryotic genera inferred from 18S rDNA at >100X mean sequencing depth included the ciliate Engelmanniella, hyphal chytrid Monoblepharella, predatory ascomycete Cephaliophora, a salpingoecid choanoflagellate, and an annelid worm. 23S rDNA sequences indicated ascomycete Capnodiales fungi at one site and four types of Pezizomycotina fungi at the other. No evidence for vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi was found, but we hypothesized that Equisetum may benefit from other types of fungal associations, some possibly inherited from ancestral plant lineages.",

During the gametophyte phase and the early sporophyte phase, P. vittata demonstrated a wide adaptability to differing light intensities, but grew best under 40% shade.

The New York fern (Thelypteris noveboracensis), typically found within deciduous forests, occurs in locally extensive stands in North America extending from northeastern Canada to southeastern U.S.A. Soil samples were obtained in autumn (2007) and early summer (2008) within a plot of T. noveboracensis in the understory of deciduous trees in the forest reserve at Torrey Cliff, NY to document the rhizosphere (root-associated) density of commonly occurring heterotrophic eukaryotic microbes (protozoa), including microflagellates, naked amoebae and testate amoebae. The ranges in densities (number/g soil dry weight) are as follows: microflagellates (6.5 × 106–1.3 × 108), naked amoebae (1.8 × 103–4.0 × 106) and testate amoebae (ca. 400). Very few active ciliates were observed. This is the first report of microbial communities associated with the rhizosphere of ferns and provides a step toward a more complete documentation of protozoa associated with plant communities. Some comparative data of protozoa associated with mosses and seed plants are also presented.",

It is 1993 bp long, contains a 723 bp open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a deduced protein (named CtCVNH) with 150 amino acid residues. CtCVNH has a predicted isoelectric point (PI) of 4.47 and a calculated molecular mass 15.9556 kDa. It possesses the conserved anti-HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) CV-N domain, which is the same as the cyanovirin-N homology (CVNH) members that were isolated from filamentous ascomycetes and C. richardii. Modeling of the tertiary structure indicated that CtCVNH is an elongated, largely β-sheet protein that displays internal two-fold pseudosymmetry. Comparative structure analysis of the predicted CtCVNH with native CV-N revealed that the major evolutionary changes occurring during the evolution of plant CVNHs were: 1) a length increase at N- and C-terminal regions; and 2) a loop to helix transition at the helical-turn regions. Phylogenetic analysis showed that CtCVNH was grouped together with the two CVNHs from C. richardii.",

The present paper presents comments on this classification, and incidentally poses some questions which may be relevant to a consideration of the classification of the species of tropical America. In the area covered by Flora Malesiana there are almost 200 species of Cyathea. In the mainland of Asia and the adjacent non-Malaysian islands I can distinguish only 24 or 25; in the Pacific and Australasia are 50 to 60 species (no full comparative survey of these has yet been made). There is no species in mainland Asia or the Pacific region which has no close relative in Malaysia. Thus a discussion of the genus in Malaysia applies in essentials also to the species of these other regions. The traditional basis for a classification of this group of ferns long has been the character of the indusium, upon which Robert Brown (1810, p. 158) established the genera Hemitelia and Alsophila as distinct from the earlier Cyathea Smith (1793, p. 416). Although there were some minor differences as between different subsequent authors in the definition of these genera, the generic characters may be thus broadly summarized: in Cyathea the indusium is cup-shaped, in Hemitelia it is attached only on one side of the receptacle, and in Alsophila there is no indusium.

During November and Deceinber, 1962, two new types of Bolbitis were collected from the Castle Rock area in the Western Ghats of South India. They were transferred to the fernery of the National Botanic Gardens at Lucknow, along with specimens of Bolbitis presliana, B. senicordata, B. subcrenata, and B. virens. One of them matches B. semicordata (Moore) Ching, except that its rachis and stipe are narrowly winged and the margins of the pinnae are conspicuously lobed. It is described as a variety of B. semicordata. The other is a large fern forming extensive colonies on gravelly soil on the western slopes of the hills in deep shade.

Practically, the need for a better taxonomic understanding of the group is illustrated by the fact that the plants are hard, and sometimes impossible, to key out in the best manuals. A check of herbarium material will show that many specimens have been named and annotated several times with several different names, many plants have been obviously misnamed, and still others have no name at all. Those who are familiar with these plants under natural conditions recognize that field observations are also puzzling. This paper is a result of more than a year's study of all the material of the Lycopodium inundatum complex represented in the herbaria of the American Fern Society and University of Michigan, plus those living specimens kindly sent for my study by the botanists to be acknowledged below. It is my purpose here to present a hypothesis of relationships among these plants that has emerged from this investigation, and it is my hope to test this hypothesis in future years. I believe that presenting this hypothesis will be of value for other botanists who are dealing with these plants.",

    "abstract": "After a long history of taxonomic isolation, recent studies show that Hymenophyllopsis K.I.Goebel is nested within the tree fern genus Cyathea Sm. s.s.. We compare developmental stages of typical Cyathea with an anatomical survey of Hymenophyllopsis. Such comparisons should clarify how the distinctive features of Hymenophyllopsis are related to or derived from those of typical Cyathea. Hymenophyllopsis and Cyathea samples from field-preserved materials and herbarium specimens were examined using standard light microscopy techniques. Hymenophyllopsis species have simple stem anatomy: all have solenosteles or simple dictyosteles, and sclerenchyma and secretory strands are lacking. Only H. superba has as many as four vascular bundles in the petiole base. Leaf blades lack stomata, the epidermal cells contain chloroplasts and there are only one or two mesophyll layers. Typical adult Cyathea species have complex stelar anatomy with medullary bundles (some with cortical bundles) and complex stem histology. There are numerous vascular bundles in the petiole. Leaf epidermal cells other than guard cells lack chloroplasts and the mesophyll has multiple layers. In contrast to their differences from adult Cyathea plants, Hymenophyllopsis anatomy corresponds closely to early stages of young Cyathea sporophyte development. The origin of “Hymenophyllopsis” from typical Cyathea ancestors involved a drastic reduction in size and anatomical complexity, with the precocious production of spores. This is a clear example of paedomorphosis among pteridophytes, where Hymenophyllopsis adult plants represent precociously fertile, permanent “young sporophytes” of tree ferns.",

Nevertheless, his species was misinterpreted by succeeding authors since the first years of its publication. In 1827, Sprengel2 regarded Aspidium distans as a synonym of Woodsia ilvensis (L.) R.

Bertoloni3 studied a specimen sent to him from Viviani and treated A. distans as a good species; he described the fern more carefully and pointed out Sprengel's mistake too. Nevertheless, Aspidium distans continued to be referred to Woodsia ilvensis by Moore,4 Milde,5 Luerssen,6 and other authors. Viviani's species was considered again by Cesati, Passerini, and Gibelli,7 who regarded it as an independent species and proposed for it the new combination Nephrodium distans.s However, in a footnote, they observed that it remained to be seen if the species corresponded to Aspidium paleaceum Don.",

It was growing abundantly in a narrow ravine in hardwood forest on a steep slope north of the lake.

Mrs. Fay MacFadden has it growing in her fern garden in Los Angeles. The only other Diplazium from the United States that is at all similar is D. lonchophyllum Kunze, which is known from a single locality in Louisiana.' It is a Mexican species, doubtless introduced in Louisiana, although Dr. Maxon did not reject entirely the possibility that it might be native. In the case of D. japonicum, there is no doubt but that it is introduced, even though it is growing in Florida in a distinctly rural area, isolated from any present-day farmhouses and eight to ten miles from the nearest town. It is distant about 200 yards across a forested area from a country road. Its abundance and luxuriance suggest a natural propagation regardless of how it might have come to be here in the first place. In general appearance and cutting D. lonchophyllum is not dissimilar to D. japonicum, but it differs in numerous particulars. It can be distinguished immediately by its stalked rather than sessile lower pinnae, and by the smooth rather than scaly stipes and rhachises.

After an examination of the type specimens of Polypodium scandens Forst. f. and P. pustulatum Forst. f. in the British Museum of Natural History, London, I agree with Pichi-Sermolli that the common, sweet-scented species of polypody in the rain-forests of eastern Australia and New Zealand is identical with Polypodium scandens Forst. f. Unfortunately, Domin2 adopted the name P. pustulatum Forst. f. for Microsorium scandens and used Polypodiumn scandens Labill. for the closely allied species Microsorium diversifolium. Following him, Copeland published the new combination Microsorium pustulatzm (Forst. f.) Copel.",

But a promising spot indeed is this cinder heap for a fern hunter. One would expect a few rock ferns and some of the hardy and ubiquitous species that range throughout the country, but little else. But actually on this unique volcanic island the most remarkable feature of a remarkable vegetation is the unexpected richness and variety of its fern flora, and the greatest surprise of all is the great quantity of filmy ferns (species of Hymenophyllaceae) which one associates with the shady forests and deep valleys of the mainland.",

    "abstract": "Linnaeus recognized twelve genera of ferns in his Species Plantarum of 1753. The largest genus was with fifty-eight species of which over sixty percent are American. Ineluded in his genus Polypodium were species now known to be species of Polystichum, Dryopteris, Cystopteris, Cyathea, and other genera. Some eight authors were cited by Linnaeus in providing the bibliographies for the New World species. He cited his own works first, as elsewhere in his Species Plantarum, followed by references to the works of Plumier, Petiver, Gronovius, Plukenet, Morison, Hans Sloane, and John Ray. Though Linnaeus lists Fewillaei peruviana as one of his sources in the introduction to his classic, he does not refer to Feuillee in the pages devoted to Cryptogamia Filices, evidently overlooking the fern descriptions contained in his work when writing the account of the several American species. This is more unusual since Feuillee illustrated two species based on Chilean observations not previously pictured. Father Luis Feuillee (1660-1732), explorer, astronomer, and botanist, was the author of the first herbal for Peru and Chile in which these fern drawings appeared. Luis Econches Feuillee was born at Mane, near Forcalquier, in Provence, in the year 1660, of humble parents. In his twentieth year Luis joined the Order of the Minimi. At this time Europe was awakening to a lively interest in the sciences-the Royal Society was founded in London when Luis was two years old, and the Academic des Sciences was chartered by Louis XIV in 1666. Feuillee 's taste for the sciences attracted attention in official circles and in 1699 he was sent to the Levant as an aide to Jacques Cassini on a hydrographic mission to determine the character of ports, to map offshore currents, and so forth. His mission to the Antilles in 1703 was an extension of this assignment; on this expedition he went ashore at Martinique, Caracas, and elsewhere, and returned to Brest in 1706. On Decem26",

Richard) Hooker, e. g. in Hooker and Baker, Synopsis Filicum, by Diels in Engler and Prantl, and by Christensen in Index Filicum, a disposition based chiefly on the lack of an indusium, as in Alsophila. In 1926, F. O. Bowerl studied its morphology in detail, and came to the conclusion that this species differs from Alsophila in several important characters-in having a creeping rhizome rather than an erect caudex, in having hairs only rather than scales, and in having the sori of the simple rather than gradate type. He chose to erect a separate family for it and the related genus Lophosoria called the Protocyatheaceae. The characters are important and doubtless fundamental, but the erection of a separate family is scarcely necessary. Bower called this species Metaxya rostrata Presl, which is correct. However, the matter was confused by Copeland, who in his Genera Filicum called it Amphidesmium blechnoides (L. C. Richard ex Hooker) Klotzsch. It is the purpose of this note to point out that both the generic and specific names adopted by Copeland are incorrect. The name Amphidesmium dates from Schott,2 who",

Now the species is considered extinct in the wild as it exists only in greenhouses, tissue cultures, and as a few young reintroduced sporophytes. For the last 13 years, a collaborative team of researchers from the Government of Bermuda and the Lab for Rare & Endangered Plants at Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo in Nebraska, USA has been working to bring this species back from the brink of extinction. In this project, we developed propagation methods for D. laffanianum, and we studied molecular and morphological characters to determine the phylogenetic placement of D. laffanianum. We sequenced plastid DNA from D. laffanianum using high-throughput sequencing, downloaded six plastid markers (atpA, atpB, matK, rbcL, rps rps4-trnS, and trnL intron trnL-F) from GenBank for 21 Diplazium and outgroup taxa, and inferred a phylogeny. We examined 185 collections of five Diplazium species closely related to D. laffanianum, and we scored 15 morphological characters to test whether D. laffanianum is a distinct species. The phylogeny placed D. laffanianum in the D. cristatum group, suggesting a Neotropical ancestor, and two morphological characters distinguished D. laffanianum from close relatives. Our results provide evidence for the phylogenetic placement of D. laffanianum, and we are actively propagating and reintroducing individuals to the wild, aiding conservation of the species.",

We used non-metric multidimensional scaling to observe vegetation differences in nine sites with juvenile club moss populations. The vegetation change over a four-year period in a dry pine forest site with a juvenile club moss (Lycopodiaceae) population and nine additional sites used for gametophyte search were analyzed. Sites with emerging juvenile club moss populations in dry pine forests included the following characteristics: 1) vegetation composition stability; 2) no tree canopy shading; and 3) the presence of Deschampsia flexuosa (L.)

It is similar in many respects to the common Boston fern (N. exaltata var. bostoniensis). It differs in two respects: the more nearly erect position of the leaves and the fronds (PI. 6, fig. 1), and in the formation of tubers (Pl. 6, fig. 2) by means of which the plant may be reproduced. Propagules of this nature are formed in only a few other ferns, but are, no doubt, familiar to most readers of the Journal. The reproduction of the fern has been studied by the writer for several years and will be briefly described. As in all other ferns which belong to the Polypodiaceae, the fronds of N. cordifolia bear numerous spores from each of which upon germination is produced the sexual phase or the gametophyte generation, the small heartshaped prothallium familiar to every one interested in ferns. As is well known, the prothallium bears on its under surface the sex-organs (antheridia and archegonia) which produce the gametes, the sperms and the eggs. After fertilization, the asexual phase, or sporophyte generation is formed. About three years later, the plant, thus formed, reaches maturity, when it produces",

With a vast reservoir of species in South America and with ocean currents, trade winds, hurricanes, and birds provided, it might appear easy to account for the origin of the flora. But as soon as one looks into the matter he begins to find serious obstacles. A review of the problem, to which Dr. Maxon made so many contributions, is attempted in this article. Let it at once be admitted that the origin of the fern flora, depending on distribution by spores, cannot be settled apart from the general problem of introduction of higher plants. A very small proportion of the fern flora exists apart from forests, even though the pioneer flora of Krakatau may have consisted of blue-green algae and mycorrhizal ferns (van Leeuwen, 1936). The problem is thus enlarged by our having to consider modes of dispersal which are effective only over short distances. The ease with which hypothetical landbridges can be furnished has led many biologists to discard such proposals unless supported by strong geological evidence. Moreover, theories of dispersal of higher animals and plants by winds, ocean currents, floating logs, and the like are definitely rejected by some biologists.",

He said he thought such an article would be very useful, but he died before I had a chance to discuss the matter fully with him. Shortly after his death, I went through his rather extensive library and catalogued all common fern names, but business and other writing caused me to put it aside for two years. Last fall I went through all the pertinent books and journals at the Gray Herbarium. Doubtless I missed some but I trust not many. Not having Mr. Weatherby to consult I was fortunate in securing the generous aid and advice of one of his former students-Dr. Rolla M. Tryon, Jr., now one of the leading fern specialists. In going through some of Mr. Weatherby's files, I came upon a typed list of common names of ferns by Mr. W. L. Dix, which had been made for Mr. Weatherby for a similar project but which was never completed. I wrote Mr. Dix and asked if he would like to make this",

This plant, a common club-moss, is found throughout central and northern Europe, most of North and South America, continental Asia, the East Indies, and even in Africa, being in fact so widely distributed as to have led naturally to its therapeutic use in common life in many parts of the world. It was frequently used in domestic therapy as an application to fresh wounds, and earned a reputation as an absorbent styptic. Notwithstanding its rather wide use in pharmacy in the middle of the 17th century, English druggists seem not to have included the powder in their lists of drugs before 1692, and it was not official in any of the London pharmacopoeias. It was introduced in the U. S. Pharmacopoeia of 1860, and has been included in all succeeding editions.",

    "abstract": "Invasive species are one of the largest threats to vulnerable ecological communities and biodiversity today and are economic burdens across the globe. It is therefore crucial that we understand the origins and the driving forces that promote the establishment, persistence, and spread of these taxa. Polyploidy, or whole genome duplication, has been suggested as a possible factor facilitating the success of invasive taxa, yet is an understudied aspect in invasion biology. Although ferns are often neglected in invasive species inventories, several fern families are overrepresented as naturalized and invasive taxa including the vining ferns in the family Lygodiaceae. The Japanese climbing fern, Lygodium japonicum, is native to eastern Asia, and since its introduction in the early 1900s through the ornamental plant trade, it has rapidly spread throughout the southeastern United States, creating dense thickets that smother native plants and disrupt agricultural pine logging. While previous chromosome counts of L. japonicum suggest that both diploid and tetraploid cytotypes occur in its native range, there are no data for populations in the invaded range to date. Using chromosome counts, flow cytometry, and spore size measurements, we assessed the ploidy of invasive populations of L. japonicum in the state of Florida. We found that L. japonicum is represented by a tetraploid cytotype throughout Florida. Our study is the first to examine the ploidy of invasive L. japonicum populations, although additional work will be needed to determine if this species is tetraploid throughout its invaded range.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary causes of contrasting patterns of pathogen diversity in different host clades are poorly understood. This study tested the hypothesis that older host lineages have fewer pathogens than younger lineages by examining the incidence of fungal pathogens in fern families differing in their time of origin over a span of 300 million years. Fern-fungal records were obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture database, and study effort was estimated by the number of citations to each fern species in the Web of Science. Pathogen discovery rate (PDR) within a fern family was measured as the rate at which pathogens were recorded in relation to the number of citations to species within that family. PDR for fungi in the Basidiomycota and Ascomycota showed significant differences among fern families and significant phylogenetic signal in the Basidiomycota. PDR for Basidiomycota was significantly negatively correlated with clade age of the fern family. Generic and species diversity within families affected PDR positively, although the effects of clade age were still significant. Within the Basidiomycota the effects of clade age were largely accounted for by the rust fungi (Pucciniales) which formed the majority of recorded basidiomycete pathogens on ferns. The most parsimonious explanation was that the rust fungi host-shifted onto fern families in the early to mid-Cretaceous, but have rarely moved onto more distantly related and older families. However, several other hypotheses could not be excluded, including loss of specialized pathogens in older clades as a result of resistance evolution.",

    "abstract": "We started out November 26th, 1927, with car and trailer, an aggregate weight of three full tons. Rain overtook us the first night out, before a camp ground had been located in the darkness, and for a whole month it was a fight against rain, snow, sleet and cold. While in camp at Harper's Ferry four inches of snow and sleet fell. Imagine our surprise to find purple cliff brakes in all stages of growth on the face of a retaining wall along a side street, rubbing pedestrians' elbows as they passed! The cliffs above would no doubt have been interesting to examine but the sun had already come out, the snow and ice were melting, and masses were slipping down the face of the wall, absolutely barring investigation. No ferns were seen in any of the Virginia Caverns visited but it was interesting to note that often where 100or 200-watt or larger electric lamps with reflectors had been installed close to the clay-covered formations, the heat and light of the lamps, combined with the natural moisture present, had favored low forms of plant life, an inch or so high, over a space the size of a dinner plate, pale green. Three or four kinds may be seen but none were identified. As the lights are on but a few minutes while visitors are passing, the results are astonishing. Our next thrill was in finding venus-hair ferns on the outer walls of Fort Marion, St. Augustine, Florida, in great quantities, though not growing thriftily. Most unusual of all was to find that it grew much finer on the inner walls of rooms of this coquina-rock-built fortress. The fort consists of a large inner court, around which are chambers approximately thirty feet deep, all facing the court, each with one door and usually a window on 80",

Visitors as a rule do not approach the mountains from the west, so that the mesophytic forests and delightful mossy swamps of that section are little known. In forest and swamp, ravine and open field, ferns and clubmosses are abundant. The following pteridophytcs were all easily located on one farm of two hundred acres or less near the village of Andes, in Delaware County. The list is probably not complete even for this small area. No one is distinctly rare, but the great abundance in species and total numbers makes the place a delight to the fern lover. One may sit on a fallen tree trunk in the old swamp forest and count eight or ten species of ferns within sight, indeed, almost within touching distance, and from one old log up nearly at the top of a mountain at the margin of the beech-maple forest I counted six species and varieties of Lycopodium.

    "abstract": "During the course of botanical explorations in Texas in 1926 I found opportunity to pay two brief visits to the Davis Mountains, near the extreme western part of the state. The flora of this region proved to be extremely interesting and rich in plants characteristic of Northern Mexico, many of which are rare and little known in the United States, and including a number that apparently have not been found previously north of the Rio Grande. The Pteridophytes are well represented and abundant in many localities in the region and a rather complete collection of them was made. When the specimens were examined several surprising things were discovered, including one species (Pellaea cordata) not previously credited to the United States, and some others that are comparatively rare and limited within our national boundaries. A brief account of the species of this group collected in the Davis Mountains and in the piedmont area from Alpine to Ft. Davis may be of interest to readers of the FERN JOURNAL. The complete list of the Ferns of Texas is yet to be compiled. In 1903 Mr. B. F. Bush1 published a list of the species then known from the state, in which he",

The powdery cloak-fern is also an odd little plant. From above it appears like a very diminutive Pellaex. But the waxypowdery material on the underside of the leaves gives the plant a chalky appearance, making recognition easy. There are, therefore, four species to the credit of this peculiar sandstone formation, which is an exceedingly good showing for a region where one may walk for many miles, with never a sight of a fern, usually to be rewarded finally by but one or two species growing around sdme far-isolated spring or on some special overhanging, shaded ledge of a creek or deep ravine.

I feel quite in accord with the expressed opinions of Dr. Waters in respect to the careless distribution of any and all kinds of plants, for it takes the spice out of life to go botanizing in a region and to find that someone has introduced alien plants into it. Also it cuts off the need of scientific collecting. But with the hart's tongue it seems to me it is quite different. I do not think Dr. Waters need fear that its range will be extended. I dare say that, outside of New York State, where conditions seem to favor its propagation, in five years' time there will not be a single plant growing that has been set out in the wild. For ages in the past the hart's tongue has had the chance of extending its range throughout eastern America, and yet it clings to a strip of country running through central and western New York and eastern Ontario. It has, however, found a lodging place six hundred miles away in Tennessee, in two places. But what about all that intervening territory? Why has it not established itself in some of the limestone districts in Pennsylvania, or Kentucky? What is the matter with the limestone outcrops of Vermont, Massachusetts, and Ohio? It is true that at one time it was reported near Louisville, Kentucky, but Williamson and later botanists were not able to substantiate that claim.",

    "abstract": "habitat is a field of huge sandstone concretions weathered in situ out of the Dakota sandstone which is the rock formation of the region. These concretions are commonly known as Rock City and are situated three miles southwest of Minneapolis, Ottawa county, Kansas. The concretions are mostly from 6 to 12 feet in diameter and for the most part quite spherical in shape. They show the natural stratification and cross bedding of the sandstone and contain numerous small crevices and cracks. The accompanying illustrations (plate 6), from photographs taken by the writer in 1900, show the main part of the city and the size and character of the concretions. This fern habitat is presented as entitled to the claim of being the most remarkable one on the continent. Now for the ferns. The concretions both on the shaded and exposed sides contain a profusion of Pellaea. Since the region is on the line in which P. atropurpurea (L.) Link, Southern Purple Cliffbrake, and P. glabella Mett., Northern Purple Cliffbrake, overlap, both of these species are present. These identifications have kindly been verified by Professor Frederic K. Butters, of the University of Minnesota. The plants on the south side of the concretions are exposed to the intense heat, often too hot for the bare hand to endure, and the bright sunlight characteristic of the Kansas transition prairie and at times to very extreme drought for long periods.

    "abstract": "The fossil fern Schizaeaopsis was described by Berry (1911a) as a digitate frond with digitate fertile tips containing trilete, strongly striated spores, but with no information available concerning the structure of the fertile tips.The material was collected from the Lower Cretaceous Patuxent Formation of the Potomac Group, by Fontaine, who had described this fern under the genus Baieropsis, in the Ginkqoales (Fontaine, 1889).He included material in two species of Baieropsis, since he misinterpreted the sporangialbearing structures as fungoid growths on the leaves of a ginkgophyte.Berry (1911a) reassigned the material to the family Schizaeaceae in the Pteridophyta, after illustrating that the fertile tips contained fern spores which were similar to spores of Anemia and Lygodium.In 1944, O. Selling studied the spores of the Schizaeaceae and excluded Schizaeaopsis from any relationship with Schizaea because the fossil had trilete spores and those of Schizaea were monolete.Selling suggested that the overall fossil morphology indicated that forms similar to Schizaea existed in the early Cretaceous but that lack of details about the fertile parts did not allow unambiguous assignment to the Schizaeaceae.Recently J. van Konijnenburg-van Cittert (1991) accepted the placement of Schizaeaopsis within the Schizaeaceae noting that the macromorphology was like that of Schizaea/Actinostachys but the spore morphology was like Mohria/Anemia.Reexamination of the fossil fern has elucidated several additional details that influence its placement within the family and suggest possible relationships with modern genera.",

    "abstract": "Recent research in the genus Isoetes has included both a continued effort to locate and describe new and little understood taxa as well as a new effort to understand their population biology and mechanisms of speciation. Gel electrophoresis has only recently been used to aid in the latter research. Taylor et al. (1985) and Taylor and Luebke (1988) have compared North American taxa using several enzyme systems, and Hickey et al. (1989b) have used electrophoresis to examine species relationships and population biology in Isoetes. Although electrophoresis may be utilized to distinguish taxa of Isoetes, practical methods of species sorting and identification in the genus continue to utilize characters of spore morphology, habitat preference, and geographical location. The purpose of the present study was to utilize the techniques of gel electrophoresis to explore the relationship between I. engelmannii A. Br. var. engelmannii and var. caroliniana Eaton (1900a). Data gathered as part of this study were also used to better understand the population biology of both taxa and to investigate the usefulness of electrophoresis for examining relationships between presumably closely and more distantly related taxa. Braun (1846) originally described I. engelmannii (Engelmann's quillwort) from specimens collected by Engelmann in 1842 from a Missouri pond near St. Louis. Later Engelmann (1867, 1882) described several varieties of the species: var. valida from Pennsylvania and Delaware, var. gracilis for small plants from southern New England, and var. georgiana for extremely large and robust plants from Floyd County, Georgia. Eaton (1905) recognized var. fontana for plants with accessory bast bundles in the leaves, spotted sporangia, and larger spores with broken reticulations. Isoetes engelmannii var. caroliniana was described by Eaton (1900) from Mitchell County, North Carolina, based on a wide velum covering up to two-thirds of the sporangia and megaspores with jagged crests to a broken reticulate pattern.

Usually three fronds per tree were measured, but occasionally four or five or as few as two per tree were measured. The majority of the fronds were sterile, but the presence of fertile fronds should have no effect on the results, for fertile and sterile leaves are practically monomorphic in Nephelea (Gastony, 1973). RESULTS The length of the fronds of a tree is fairly constant. The standard deviation within a tree averaged 4.55% (s=2.96, n=45).

    "abstract": "The great diversity of mating systems exhibited by flowering plants has attracted the attention of botanists for nearly two centuries, and the causes and consequences of this diversity have been extensively discussed. Until quite recently, however, little attention has been paid to the mating systems of ferns and other homosporous plants. Klekowski & Baker (1966) were among the first to address the problem, proposing that most sexual reproduction in fern populations is a result of self-fertilization within a single gametophyte. Although a number of studies on the distribution of lethal alleles in fern populations appeared in the 1970's (e.g. Klekowski, 1973, 1979; Lloyd, 1974), it is only within the last five years that data on genotypic diversity in homosporous plants have begun to accumulate rapidly (e.g. Haufler & Soltis, 1984; Gastony & Gottlieb, 1985; McCauley et al., 1985; Soltis & Soltis, 1986, 1987). With these data it is now possible to describe the mating system of a variety of homosporous plants (Holsinger, 1987). The sperm and eggs produced by a single gametophyte are genetically identical, except in the unlikely event of a somatic mutation within the gametophyte. Thus, if a sperm fertilizes an egg produced by the same gametophyte, the resulting sporophyte will be homozygous at every locus. In contrast, self-fertilization in seed plants results in only a halving of heterozygosity in each generation. Thus, self-fertilization in homosporous plants is the most extreme form of inbreeding that can occur. In terms of the genetic consequences, the only systems that are directly comparable are certain forms of asexual reproduction in insects (Stalker, 1956; Carson et al., 1969; Ochman et al., 1980). Self-fertilization in homosporous plants, therefore, provides an excellent testing ground for theories of mating system evolution. Studies of the mating system in homosporous plants have commonly distinguished between three types of mating events (Lloyd, 1974; Klekowski, 1979): (1) outcrossing, the cross-fertilization of gametophytes derived from the spores of different sporophytes, (2) intergametophytic selfing, the crossfertilization of gametophytes derived from the spores of a single sporophyte, and (3) intragametophytic selfing, the self-fertilization of a single gametophyte. The natural distinction is, however, between matings involving a single gametophyte and matings involving different gametophytes. It is not the genealogical relationship of two gametophytes that determines the chances that a mating occurs between them, but their proximity to one another. If intergametophytic selfing occurs, it occurs as a result of correlated spore dispersal. The spores of Asplenium lepidum, for example, are dispersed as a unit in",

To professional botanists, the study of these small ferns has contributed to advances in cytology, chemical systematics, reticulate evolution, hybridization, and ecology. Knowledge of the Appalachian Spleenwort complex is still far from complete; indeed, new hybrid ferns and cytogenetic races have only recently been described. The purpose of this paper is to describe a new, naturally occurring spleenwort hybrid. In October, 1979, while botanizing in the Shawnee Hills of southern Illinois.

The hybrid was found on a north-facing crevice in a sandstone canyon where a large number of the parent species were present. The elongate-triangular shape of the blade at once suggested C. rhizophyllus; however, the base of the blade was cut into opposite, pinnate lobes that looked very much like enlarged basal pinnae of A. trichomanes. The stipe resembled that of A. trichomanes due to its narrow diameter and dark brown color that extended a short distance up the rachis (Figs. I and 3). Furthermore, the frond venation was both dichotomously free branched, as in A. trichomanes, and anastomosing, as in C. rhizophyllus (Fig. 3). The suspected hybrid was removed and brought to Southern Illinois University, where it was grown for further study. To gain further evidence of the plant's hybrid nature, alpha and beta esterase isoenzymes were studied using starch gel electrophoresis in the suspected hybrid and the putative parents. It was hypothesized that the suspected hybrid would show isoenzyme banding patterns present in both parents and perhaps intermediate bands as well.",

Several species have been problematical in their identification, notably N. biserrata (Swartz) Schott, N. exaltata (L.) Schott, and N. hirsutula (Forst.) Presl (Christensen, 1932, p. 74; Copeland, 1947, p. 91). Two of these species, N. exaltata and N. biserrata, occur in Florida and have been a source of difficulty, in part because of plants intermediate in a number of characteristics. The intermediates appear to represent hybrid populations between these two species. Distributional data show that intermediates occur only in the overlapping portions of the parent species' ranges and not where only one parent occurs. Intermediates are found whereverN. exaltata and N. biserrata occur together, usually in disturbed portions of the habitat. The intermediates are more abundant and luxuriant as would be expected of hybrids.",

    "abstract": "Pheromonal interactions between cordate gametophytes of the lady fern, A. filix-femina, were assayed using a protocol typically used for detecting water-soluble pheromones such as antheridiogen. Three week-old, cordate gametophytes were transferred from multispore cultures grown on nutrient agar to agar containing extracts from a previous generation of gametophytes (treatment) and to fresh nutrient agar (control). Three weeks after transfer, fifty gametophytes were examined from treatment and control plates. Each gametophyte was measured for size (area) and shape (circularity) and scored for number of antheridia and archegonia. Treatment gametophytes were significantly smaller, less circular, had fewer archegonia, and possessed antheridia more often than control gametophytes, a pattern consistent with known antheridiogen effects on gametophytes of transitional morphology and sensitivity. The experiment was repeated using gametophytes that were six weeks old at time of transfer to treatment and control plates. Treatment gametophytes in the second experiment did not differ significantly in size (area) or length from control gametophytes; however treatment gametophytes were more circular and possessed greater widths and length : width ratios, deeper notches, and fewer archegonia. We present a model in which one or more phytochemicals released by cordate gametophytes increase rates of anticlinal division in the apical meristem. The possibilities that the substances involved are phytohormones involved in the development of a notch meristem and cordate morphology in the source gametophyte, and that antheridiogen may be involved, are explored.",

    "abstract": "Life-cycles in leptosporangiate homosporous ferns which normally occur in nature have been reported to be either obligately sexual, with a haploid-diploid alternation of generations, or obligately apogamous. Apogamous reproduction is a process which requires two basic phenomena: production of viable spores either by meiosis (Dopp, 1932; Manton, 1950; Mehra & Singh, 1957) or by mitosis (Evans, 1964) and production of a diploid or haploid sporophyte from a diploid or haploid gametophyte without an intervening act of syngamy. In many sexual species apogamous outgrowths from the gametophyte can be induced by abnormally prolonged cultural conditions. This type of reproduction in sexual species has not been observed in nature, and sporophytes produced in this manner in cultivation have not produced viable spores (Manton, 1950, p. 201). Further elaborations of the fern life-cycle include vegetative reproduction, which is found in a large number of species, and apospory, which has been produced in the laboratory but has yet to be shown conclusively to occur in nature (see DeBenedictis, 1969, for a review of literature on apogamy and apospory in ferns). In addition to the obligate nature of the sexual or apogamous life-cycle, some species of homosporous ferns can be characterized as being high polyploids, a condition apparently evolved in response to the primarily homothallic nature of their gametophytic reproductive biology (Klekowski & Baker, 1966). As a result of this general dominant polyploid theme, base numbers of extant genera are themselves composed of several sets of duplicate chromosomes, with multivalent formation during meiosis restricted or eliminated by genetic or physiological control of bivalent pairing. Evidence is accumulating that the polyploid condition in ferns has selective advantage in that it provides storage of genetic information which is later released by homoeologous recombination (Klekowski, 1973). It is the object of this paper to provide evidence from the life-cycle of a single plant of Matteuccia orientalis (Hooker) Trev. which circumstantially indicates the presence of facultative apomixis (the production of sporophytes from gametophytes by both sexual and apogamous pathways) and the production of both haploid spores and diploid spores with their subsequent germination and growth into gametophytes of two ploidy levels. Matteuccia orientalis is an Asian species distributed from India throughout China to Siberia, Korea, and Japan. It consists of two cytotypes, a diploid (n = 40) found mostly on the Asian mainland and a tetraploid (n = 80) found in Japan. Lloyd (1971) shows that the tetraploid cytotype is of autoploid origin.",

    "abstract": "Of the sixty or more species in the Ophioglossaceae, only 0. pendulum L. and 0. palmatum L. are epiphytes. Although some authors (Chrysler, 1941; Eames, 1936, fig. 78) have regarded these species as relatively primitive in the genus and have envisioned a reduction series culminating in the more diminutive terrestrial species, others have suggested that they are advanced in most respects (Bower, 1911, 1926; Wagner, 1952). Because detailed information about the gametophytes, spore wall sculpturing, stem structure and development, and venation pattern -among other characters-is not available for most species in the genus, strong adherence to either hypothesis serves little purpose at the present time. Nevertheless, the derivative state of the epiphytic habit in Ophioglossum is supported by its extremely low frequency of occurrence in the genus and the family and the unique frond architectures displayed by both 0. pendulum and 0. palmatum. Numerous discussions of the peculiar features of these epiphytes, as well as speculations about their evolution, have dominated the literature dealing with them, but little has been reported about their natural history and ecology. For this reason, in this paper I would like to relate observations on the natural history of a population of 0. palmatum, the Hand Fern, in southern peninsular Florida. In addition, I shall attempt to place these observations into the context of the natural history of 0. palmatum as it occurs in other parts of its range, as well as that of O. pendulum in the Old World tropics. Ophioglossum pendulum is found throughout the Old World tropics, except for Africa, and is also found in Hawaii (Christensen, 1932; Clausen, 1938, p. 117). It has elongate, ribbon-like blades up to 4 m long and 9 cm wide which often fork in large specimens. Horner (1958), Graf (1970), and Carlquist (1970) each illustrate this species. Each leaf bears one fertile spike which may exceed 50 cm and which is inserted medianly on the sterile portion of the leaf blade. Mature leaf blades are perpendicular to the supporting surface (Wagner, 1952), and stomates are present on both leaf surfaces.",

In the past, some (but relatively not very many) authors of fern Floras included a paragraph on the distribution of the taxa (Posthumus, 1928; Christensen, 1932; Backer & Posthumus, 1939). In some other fern Floras some space is devoted to ecology, but very little to geography (Holttum, 1954). In still others, considerations of a general kind on ecology and geography are altogether lacking (Vareschi, 1969). Lyell (1870), in his rather little-known book on the distribution of ferns, tried to bring together all the data known at his time; his work is now, of course, almost exclusively of historical significance.",

The next day, Monday, was market day in Villa Alta. This enabled us to obtain extra boys to carry the additional presses brought in by plane from Oaxaca. Mr. Hallberg secured three boys without difficulty, and late in the afternoon we were off on the trail again. This time it was to get across the valley (down 1500 feet and up 2000 feet) on very steep trails to the next and last village of Yetzecovi for the night. This tiny village of 130 people has official jurisdiction over Mr. Hallberg's coffee ranch. By making this start on the trail to the ranch, we were able the next day to make a more leisurely hike to the ranch, collecting ferns along the way. The trail from Yetzecovi to the ranch rose steadily but not too steeply (compared to the other side) for three hours to the highest point of the ridge at 7200 feet. In abandoned fields near Yetzecovi we passed through a forest of Bracken fern, Pteridium, the fronds reaching 10 to 12 feet in height. Pine and oak were still the principal trees on this side of the mountain. The average rainfall was conspicuously heavier here than earlier on the trip, as indicated by the many epiphytes. For example, filmy ferns (Hymenophyllum myriocarpum) made their first appearance. Also species of Gleichenia became common in open areas on the upper parts of the slopes (G. palmata, G. pectinata, G. bancroftii, and G. underwoodiana). When we reached the peak, it was like stepping into another world. There was a nearly constant cover of clouds and the vegetation showed their effect. The epiphytic mosses and ferns were so dense as to cover completely all trunks and branches. Here the true rainforest began. (Weather instruments kept by Mr. Hall117",

The latest worker on this group, Dr. K. Iwatsuki, has treated Leptogramma as Stegnogramma Blume sect. Leptogramma,4 but he has not adduced any convincing reasons for recognizing Stegnogramma as distinct from Thelypteris. In a more recent paper,5 Iwatsuki has summarized the characters of Stegnogramma as follows: Short rhizome with well marked collenchymatous tissues, the pinnate or pinnatifid fronds having the indistinct apical pinnae, the exindusiate sori elongate along the",

American botanists1 have done relatively little in the area, but speed and convenience of modern travel grant new opportunities to see the unique vegetation of this continent. Our opportunity came with an invitation to attend the 50th Jubilee celebration of the National Botanic Gardens of South Africa, at Kirstenbosch, near Cape Town in South Africa. The program included a 3200 mile trip to the Cape Peninsula, the Podocarpus forest at Knysna, the Karroo deserts, and the eastern provinces of Natal and Transvaal. We combined with this a trip to Mount Kenya to observe the montane flora of east Africa. We made several trips out of Nairobi and camped on Mount Kenya with Dr. and Mrs. B. Verdcourt. His work is primarily on flowering plants but he has published also on mollusks and on some African species of Adiantum. We visited Cameroons Mountain, the highest land mass in west Africa, to sample the montane flora of west Africa.

The wintergreen fronds soften at their base in fall and survive the winter under snow, allowing vernal photosynthesis and providing an energetic benefit to the plant. This study addressed whether or not the softening of the stipe is critical to the evolutionary adaptiveness of the wintergreen leaf habit. I kept the fronds of 12 Dryopteris intermedia plants upright through the winter of 2015–2016 and left those of 12 other plants prostrate as controls. In the spring of 2016, a greater proportion of the frond surface area had frost damage on the upright fronds than on the control plants, and a greater proportion of the fronds were broken in the upright plants than in the control plants. The softening of the stipe was probably a critical step in the evolution of the wintergreen habit in D. intermedia.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the functional significance of heterospory in land plants, nor about how species ensure that mega- and microspores, which have strongly different wind dispersal, are dispersed over similar distances to ensure cross-fertilization. We studied active ejection distances and heights of megaspores of Selaginella denticulata, S. helvetica, and S. selaginoides. Under laboratory conditions, the maximum horizontal and vertical ejection distances of megaspores from the sporangia were 24 cm and 22 cm for S. denticulata, 65 cm and 45 cm for S. helvetica, and 120 cm and 76 cm for S. selaginoides. The function of this active spore ejection thus should not only be seen in the ability of horizontal dispersal but also as a means to bring the megaspores into the wind currents. Under laboratory conditions, microspores of all three species showed a maximum horizontal ejection distance of about 10 cm. However, experiments in the open showed that under natural conditions with wind, microspore dispersal occurs over much longer distances and that the megaspores are partly also wind assisted and reach similar distances. In addition, we observed synaptospory, in which microspores electrostatically adhered to megaspores and were dispersed with them. Our results suggest that the active ejection of the megaspores is a means of ensuring similar dispersal distances of micro- and megaspores and thus cross-fertilization. Very little is known about the breeding system in Selaginella, but we surmise that both self-fertilization and outcrossing occur.",

Wagner as one parent and another, as yet undescribed, diploid species (B. \"farrarii\") as the other parent. Genetically, B. furculatum is distinguished from B. pallidum by exhibiting fixed heterozygous loci in which expressed alleles of one of the genomic contributions matches those of B. pallidum, whereas many alleles of the other genomic contribution have not been detected in B. pallidum, but are displayed by B. \"farrarii.\" Morphologically, a suite of leaf characters differentiates B. furculatum from B. pallidum, particularly a more pronounced bowed or wishbone-like junction of sporophore and trophophore. Gradations in morphology and color between the two species have led to erroneous reports of B. pallidum in the Rocky Mountains. A key to differentiate B. furculatum from similar species is presented.",

Analyses of directional growth of gametophytes in response to gravitropic stimulation demonstrated that gametophytes showed negative gravitropism. Dark-grown gametophytes of dkg1 her1 mutants, which germinate in complete darkness, displayed a more distinct negative gravitropism. Unlike her1 spores, dkg1 her1 spores do not require light irradiation to induce spore germination. Therefore, light irradiation on her1 spores was possibly inhibiting the negative gravitropism of her1 gametophytes. In the present study, prolonged white-light irradiation on her1 spores inhibited negative gravitropism in the gametophytes. Light irradiation on spores therefore affects the later negative gravitropism of dark-grown gametophytes.",

Cytologically, the meiotic chromosome number of n = c. 38II 6I (2x) and the malformed spores of the three plants are characteristic of hybrid sterility. The electrophoretic polymorphisms of four isozymes (Pgi, Pgm-1, Pgm-2, and Skdh) were examined in the three plants and in 22 individuals of the putative parental species, P. fibrillosopaleaceum (11) and P. igaense (11). The heterozygous genetic patterns (Pgi-ab, Pgm-1ab, Pgm-2ab, and Skdh-ab) fixed in the putative hybrids indicate that they have a combination of the Pgi-b, Pgm-1b, Pgm-2a, and Skdh-a alleles of P. igaense and Pgi-a, Pgm-1a, Pgm-2b, and Skdh-b alleles of P. fibrillosopaleaceum. The morphological, electrophoretic features and chromosome numbers confirm the three plants to be diploid hybrids of P. fibrillosopaleaceum and P. igaense.

The pots were covered with glass jars. The above formula is a very good one for growing fern spores on agar, but more than ordinary care is required because an aseptic condition must be maintained. The results obtained are not worth the extra trouble and expense involved. The flower pot and rock method will not compare with peat, which in my judgment is not only the most practicable, but affords the maximum protection. WASHINGTON, D. C.",

Green Lake, east of Jamesville, was dowered by nature with a fern flora that made it a magnet for scientists and fern lovers the world over. Though the work of the Solvay Process Co., to which the fern-clad cliffs were only raw material for baking soda, this rare and beautiful station has been utterly destroyed. Rarest of all was the hart's tongue fern, Scolopendrium, and some four or five hundred specimens of this were removed, with belated assistance from the Solvay Co., from certain destruction to a location nearby that we hope will be safe. The hart's tongue is found only in four or five spots in Onondaga and Madison counties, in Tennessee, in Ontario, and apparently in Guatemala, and in no other locality on this continent. Its appearance is so unlike the ordinary aspect of a fern that the average person might overlook it. The chief danger of extinction, aside from the destruction of its habitats, comes from students of botany who exchange plants, and from nurserymen who dig it up to sell. The members of the Syracuse Botanical Club feel that they have at last done something practical by way of protection in getting the new amendment, protecting the hart's tongue, passed by the legislature. Miss L. W. Roberts, and other active members, but chiefly Mrs. John W. Church, Chairman of the Club Legislation Committee, have worked like beavers to build the protective dam. Assemblyman Horace M.

Butters, of the University of Minnesota, asking him if the University herbarium contained any specimens of Botrychium dissecturnm or Botrychium obliquum, and about how many had been found in the state. He replied that their herbarium contained no specimen of B. dissectumrn, and while it had several sheets labeled B. obliquum, he felt that they were not determined correctly, and that they were in reality B. ternatum var. intermedium. Prof. Butters offered to lend me the specimens for my study. I accepted the offer, and after carefully looking them over, I decided that Prof. Butters was correct in his decision. Shortly after I had returned the University specimens, Prof. Butters wrote me that Dr. Rosendahl had returned from the field with a plant of Botrychium dissecturn, which he had collected in Rice County, Minnesota, 5 miles east of Faribault. He stated that it was a large plant but not fruiting and entirely typical. One statement that interested me was that he saw no other Botrychiums in the vicinity. This is one more point in favor of my theory that B. dissectum is a valid species. I believe that the Minnesota plant grew from spores of B. dissectumn that had been carried there, perhaps in soil on the feet of birds. The Botrychium dissectum station here at'Bentonsport, Iowa, that I located in 1926, containing 31 plants, has continued to thrive and produce only B. dissectum plants. In the four years I have had it under observation no plants of B. obliquum have appeared at the station. Several small plants have come up at different times but all have developed into B. dissectum plants. 21",

In corresponding with Prof. F. K. Butters, of the University of Minnesota, he informed me that there were a number of sheets in their herbarium containing specimens labeled Botrychium obliquum, but to his mind they were incorrectly labeled, that they were for the most part really Botrychium ternatum var. intermedium. He stated that one sheet contained specimens that may be B. ternatum var. oneidense. At that time Botrychium dissectum had not been found in the state. I obtained a loan of herbarium material from Prof. Butters, and, after a careful study, I concluded he was correct in stating that B. obliquum was not represented in the state flora of Minnesota. Also that B. ternatum var. oneidense was found there. About this time I borrowed material from the Public Museum of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in order that I might study the Botrychiums of that state. I was not able to see the material from the University herbarium. The numerous records of Botrychium obliquum presented in No. 4, Vol. 18, of the FERN JOURNAL, by Steil and Fuller, were perhaps made from the labels without studying the specimens concerned. I found, as in the case of the Minnesota ferns, that nearly all the plants labeled B. obliquum were really B. ternatum var. intermedium. There was one exception. One plant labeled B. obliquum from the locality of Milwaukee was B. obliquum var. 125",

    "abstract": "When we study apomictic taxa two basic questions are of special relevance. The first is the question of their phylogenetic and/or geographic origin, the second is that of their genetic composition (variability or uniformity). There exists a variety of allozyme studies in apomictic angiosperms (Asker & Jerling, 1992; Battjes et al., 1992) which allows insights into the genetic patterns of apomicts and their evolution. In apomictic plants various genetic structures are observed. For example, the populations of apomictic species are sometimes multiclonal and the genetic differences between populations may often be relatively high (Ellstrand & Roose, 1987). According to Walker (1984) about 10% of all ferns are agamosporous. In the last decade a few investigations on apomictic (agamosporous) ferns using isozyme methods were published. In contrast to the earlier opinion, that agamosporous species are exclusively of hybrid origin (Walker, 1984), it was shown that in some examples, for instance Pellaea andromedifolia (Gastony & Gottieb, 1985), the Pellaea glabella complex (Gastony, 1988), and in Dryopteris sparsa (Darnaedi et al., 1990b), autopolyploidy may play an important role in the formation of apomicts. The apomictic species Pellaea atropurpurea (Gastony & Windham, 1989), Asplenium unilaterale (Watano & Iwatsuki, 1988), Pteris cretica (Suzuki & Iwatsuki, 1990), and Dryopteris yakusilvicola (Darnaedi et al., 1990a), on the other hand seem to have originated through hybridization events between different species. Agamospory in D. remota was first described by Fischer (1909). It was Dopp (1932) who worked out the detailed cytological background of the agamospory in this fern. Dopp's findings are valid for most of the agamosporous fern species (Walker, 1979). Dryopteris remota is triploid and appears to be strictly agamosporous (Fraser-Jenkins & Reichstein, 1984). This European species is distributed from the eastern Pyrenees to the Caucasus but is everywhere rare. Dryopteris remota usually grows as single individuals or forms small stands of a few to sometimes about 50 individuals. The populations are isolated from each other, sometimes by large distances. The largest population known so far was described by Benl & Eschelmiller (1973). About 130 individuals were found in one site (2000 x 300 m2) in Bavaria. In terms of morphological characteristics, D. remota seems to be quite uniform (except for characters most likely due to phenotypic plasticity) (Fraser-Jenkins & Reichstein, 1984). In our investigation the following questions were of interest: Are there different enzyme genotypes, either within populations or between populations from different parts of the distribution area? Do enzyme data point to a unique, or a multiple origin of the species? MATERIALS AND METHODS",

    "abstract": "Osmunda is intermediate between the eusporangiate and leptosporangiate ferns in many aspects and therefore has a special systematic position among extant pteridophytes. It is this position, together with the small number of extant Osmunda species and relatively extensive fossil record, that has generated great curiosity about this genus. Not only have considerable morphological comparisons been developed (Hewitson, 1962; Miller, 1967, 1971), but also aspects of palynology (Hanks & Fairbrothers, 1981), serology (Peterson & Fairbrothers, 1971), and DNA structure (Stein & Thompson, 1975; Stein et al., 1979; Stein et al., 1986) have been explored. Most of this work has focused on three extant Osmunda species: 0. regalis, 0. claytoniana and 0. cinnamomea, which are native to North America. Because of their distinctive morphological differences, these three species can be readily delimited, but their phylogenetic relationships are obscure. For about a century, pteridologists have been debating the evolutionary history of these three species and currently there are three competing hypotheses: (1) 0. claytoniana and 0. regalis are more closely related to each other than either of them is to 0. cinnamomea (Faull, 1901; Miller, 1967, 1971; Wagner et al., 1978), (2) 0. claytoniana has more in common with 0. cinnamomea than with 0. regalis (Hewitson, 1962; Peterson & Fairbrothers, 1971; Stein & Thompson, 1975; Hanks & Fairbrothers, 1981), and (3) all three species arose from a common ancestor at about the same time (Stein et al., 1979; Stein et al., 1986).",

    "abstract": "-Intraspecific variation in antheridiogen response has been reported in several fern species. Here, we characterized and compared dose-mediated antheridiogen response among six populations spanning the range of Onoclea sensibilis, a species widely used for antheridiogen assays. A crude aqueous filtrate (CAF) of antheridiogen APT was obtained from cultures of Pteridium aquilinum and introduced into mineral agar at six concentrations ranging from 0 (control) to 10-1. Response was initially characterized for one population using three criteria: percentage of male gametophytes, number of antheridia per gametophyte, and mean surface area of gametophytes. Percent male was consistently the best descriptor of the response profile and was used to compare responses among populations. In all populations, gametophytes exhibited little or no response at CAF concentrations 10-5 and lower; a saturated response, almost all gametophytes being male at 10-3 and higher; and an intermediate response, usually between 50% and 80% males, at 10-4. With few exceptions, response levels and profiles were very consistent among populations. Data and methodology provided herein indicate that use of the percent male criterion can provide a reliable quantitative assay using Onoclea that can facilitate future comparative research in antheridiogens. Gametophytes of numerous and diverse taxa within the Polypodiaceae sensu lato share response to antheridiogen A (sensu Voeller 1964; in this paper antheridiogen A refers to the general class of antheridiogens produced by and biologically active in taxa belonging to Polypodiaceae sensu lato, whereas antheridogen ApT, sensu Nif [1979], refers specifically to antheridiogen A produced by Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn). However, antheridiogen response is neither pervasive nor equivalent among polypodiaceous ferns. Species representing different genera may differ by orders of magnitude for the minimum APT dose required for response (Niif et al., 1975; Nif, 1979), and congeneric species may also differ in antheridiogen response, as shown in Bommeria (Haufler and Gastony, 1978), Cystopteris (Haufler and Ranker, 1985), and polystichoid ferns (Yatskievych, 1993). Variation in response may also occur within species, either among populations or even among individuals within populations. In Hemionitis palmata L., lower response was detected in populations with lower genetic load (Ranker, 1987), suggesting that reduced response to antheridiogen may facilitate a higher selfing rate, thereby eliminating recessive lethals within populations (Schneller et al., 1990). A genetic basis for variation in antheridiogen sensitivity was determined in Ceratopteris. Genotypes with lowered antheridiogen response were obtained experimentally in C. richardii Brongn. through application of mutagens, and a simple twogene basis of inheritance for antheridiogen sensitivity was determined (Scott and Hickock, 1987; Warne et al., 1988). These observations combine to indicate that antheridiogen response is subThis content downloaded from 157.55.39.35 on Wed, 31 Aug 2016 04:08:53 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms AMERICAN FERN JOURNAL: VOLUME 89 NUMBER 4 (1999) ject to evolutionary change. Because antheridiogen may be of importance in determining or facilitating the mode of sexual reproduction by gametophytes, evolutionary changes in antheridiogen response may represent variation in an important life history attribute. Of the species compared by Naf (1979), the greatest sensitivity to antheridiogen ApT was exhibited by Onoclea sensibilis L., which was therefore used as a reference for interspecific comparisons and has become the standard fern species for assaying antheridiogen A. This species is broadly distributed, occurring over most of eastern North America and disjunct in eastern Asia (Gastony and Ungerer, 1997). Although geographic sources of 0. sensibilis have varied among studies, the possibility of geographically based variation in antheridiogen response has not specifically been addressed. Most workers utilizing 0. sensibilis (e.g., Haufler and Ranker, 1985; Miller, 1968) have reported highly sensitive antheridiogen response and lack of spontaneous (i.e., without exposure to antheridiogen) antheridium formation, comparable to that indicated by Naf (1979). However, unusual responses have been reported from occasional frond collections (Nif, 1979), for example spontaneous antheridium formation (Klekowski and Lloyd, 1968; Miller and Miller, 1970; Rubin and Paolillo, 1983). Furthermore, the way in which response levels in relationship to antheridiogen doses have been quantified has varied among studies and sometimes has not been fully explicit. The objectives of this study were to determine consistent criteria for quantifying antheridiogen response of 0. sensibilis and to determine whether there are differences in response among populations from different regions. MATERIALS AND METHODS The antheridiogen exudate used in this study was obtained from gametophytes of Pteridium aquilinum, a standard source of antheridiogen A due to the high activity of its exudate. Spores from P aquilinum accession Sheffield 56 from England were sown under axenic conditions as follow. Spores were separated from sporangia by rinsing through a Nitex screen with 100 pm openings, using a wetting solution (2 drops of Tween-80 per 100 ml distilled water). Spores were collected in a cylindrical basket made from an inverted plastic 30 mm centrifuge tube. The conical bottom of the tube was cut off, and the cap was perforated with numerous holes using a hot dissecting needle. A finemeshed Nitex screen (5 ,um openings) was placed between the cap and the centrifuge tube opening to form a basket bottom that would retain spores but allow passage of liquids. Spore samples, wet with the Tween solution, were rinsed three times with distilled water and set in the dark overnight to allow germination of fungal spores. The following day, the baskets were placed in a sterilizing solution of 5% commercial hypochlorite for 90 sec, then placed in three rinses of sterile distilled water. Spores were then sown by pipetting onto mineral agar in densities ranging from 5-30 spores per cm2 in plastic petri dishes. Mineral agar contained Parker's macronutrients and Thompson's micronu222 This content downloaded from 157.55.39.35 on Wed, 31 Aug 2016 04:08:53 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms STEVENS & WERTH: ANTHERIDIOGEN RESPONSE IN ONOCLEA TABLE 1.

A second species, H. pinnatifida, was recently described from Ecuador. Hecistop- teris kaieteurensis, the third species for this genus, is described from Guyana. For 150 years, Hecistopteris was a monotypic genus consisting of the sole species H. pumila (Spreng.) J. Sm. known only from tropical America. The genus differs from others in the Vittariaceae by having small (up to ca. 6 cm long), simple, subsessile fronds that lack a pronounced midrib and are apically or laterally lobed or cleft. The plants usually reproduce vegetatively by root proliferations, as illustrated by Kramer (1990, p. 275), on mossy tree trunks. A second species in the genus, H. pinnatifida R.C. Moran & B. 0llgaard, was recently described from Ecuador (Moran and 0llgaard, 1995, p.180). We have found a third species, here named Hecistopteris kaieteurensis, while surveying the trees of Kaieteur National Park in Guyana. The main fea- ture of the park is a waterfall with a straight drop of 741 ft. The area at the top of the falls is forested with occasional open guiana type savannas that are characteristic of the Roraima formation. The forests are generally along the creeks and rivers and have a canopy ranging from 20-60 meters in height. A small patch of Hecistopteris kaieteurensis was found growing in moss on a trunk of a tree approximately 1.5 m above the base. Other trees were not ex- amined at the time to see the extent of the population. According to Jefferson",

Little, however, is known about what changes there may be in the sporing behaviour of a fern when it is transferred from its natural habitat to an artificial environment, such as a glasshouse. We recorded sporing behaviour in relation to vegetative growth in two genetically matched populations of Polypodium vulgare. One population was placed in a controlled-climate glasshouse, the other was left outside. The recruitment of new fronds was significantly higher in the indoor population than in the outdoor population. The indoor population also maintained a high proportion of actively sporing fronds throughout the winter. There was no net recruitment of new fronds in the outdoor population during the winter and early spring. Some elements of the glasshouse environment, probably the enhanced light and temperature, induced continuous sporing in this fern. Considering the ever-increasing interest in ferns as ornamental plants, and the growing body of evidence of toxic and allergenic effects caused by fern spores, this kind of sporing behaviour may have implications for human health.",

    "abstract": "Athyrium filix-femina (Lady Fern) comprises a complex of homoploid (n = 40) taxa, distributed over much of the northern hemisphere and extending into South America, whose evolutionary relationships are poorly understood and whose taxonomic treatment is problematic. The A. filix-femina complex of North America comprises as many as four taxa with overlapping ranges and provides an especially suitable context for exploring patterns and processes of divergent evolution and its taxonomic consequences in ferns. We addressed differentiation of two eastern North American taxa distinguished on the basis of growth form, frond shape, and spore color, and most recently treated as varieties A. angustum and A. asplenioides (Northern and Southern Lady Fern respectively). Although, these two taxa have been long perceived as closely related, they have been known to intergrade and recombine to form a hybrid zone in their relatively narrow region of overlap. This perception is supported by the data from the present study. Collections from 17 populations, 9 of A. angustum from Quebec to Pennsylvania and 8 of A. asplenioides from New Jersey to North Carolina, were examined for spores using LM, SEM, and TEM, and/or allozymes (16 loci coding 10 enzymes). The two taxa exhibited highly distinct perispore surfaces: all A. angustum individuals had papillose surfaces, whereas most A. asplenioides individuals were rugose with a reticulum of inflated folds. Spores from the northernmost A. asplenioides population sampled (Shirley, NJ) showed varying degrees of intermediacy suggestive of introgressive hybridization with A. angustum. Levels of allozyme polymorphism in populations (means: P=36.5%, A=1.97, HE=0.129) were near means for angiosperms and ferns. Genotype frequencies at most loci in all populations were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium indicating an outcrossing mating system. Most alleles were shared among all populations. However, at the four most polymorphic loci (Idh-1, Pgi-2, Pgm-2, and Tpi-2) allele frequencies were significantly divergent between populations of A. angustum and A. asplenioides, especially Idh-1 which approached fixation for alternate alleles. Values for FST ranged from 0.008 to 0.459 for individual loci (0.255 across loci) with especially high values for Idh-1, Pgi-2, Pgm-2, and Tpi-2. Hierarchical FST analysis indicated that differences between the two taxa (FXY=0.216) accounted for most allele frequency divergence among populations (FXY=0.238). UPGMA analysis of paired Rogers' Similarity (S) values resulted in two principal clusters each comprising populations of one taxon. Populations of A. angustum and A. asplenioides were joined within their clusters at S=0.938 and S=0.945 respectively, while the two taxon clusters were joined at S=0.848. The spore and isozyme data indicate substantial divergence between A. angustum and A. asplenioides, suggesting that they merit distinction at the rank of subspecies or species. Additional study of populations in their region of sympatry is required to determine the nature and extent of hybridization.",

    "abstract": "Equisetum xferrissii Clute is the naturally occurring sterile hybrid of E. laevigatum A. Br. and E. hyemale var. affine (Engelm.) A.A. Eaton (Hauke, 1958). Although it is morphologically distinct and relatively easy to identify, it does not consistently appear on floristic lists of Iowa's prairies, nor in broader discussions of Iowa or Midwest floras. Only recently has the commonness of E. xferrissii become recognized. Peck (1976) documented the presence of E. xferrissii in 74 of Iowa's 99 counties. He felt (pers. comm.) that a thorough search would turn up E. xferrissii in the remaining counties as well, making it as widespread in Iowa as its parent species. E. hyemale has been recorded in all counties, and E. laevigatum in 91 of 99 counties. The current study was designed to quantify the presence of E. xferrissii in one county considered representative of much of Iowa and to address ecological questions regarding the dispersal and maintenance of the sterile hybrid and its parental species. Ecological information on these three Equisetum taxa is sparse. Hartman (1958) recognized what are now known as E. xferrissii and E. laevigatum as plants of ditches and embankments, noting also that E. xferrissii grew in moister sites than E. laevigatum and that E. hyemale preferred a moister habitat than either E. Xferrissii or E. laevigatum. Because they are agricultural weeds and toxic to livestock, E. palustre and E. arvense have received considerable attention. Borg (1971) did an extensive study on E. palustre as a weed in Finland. He recorded rhizome growth of 30 cm to several meters per year, reaching depths of 180 cm below the soil surface. In regard to vegetative dispersal, he found that rhizome fragments of E. palustre were not good propagules and did not support the idea that E. palustre was spread by road building activity. As field weeds, E. palustre and E. arvense have been tested for herbicide responses. E. arvense topgrowth was found to be sensitive to most chemicals, and rhizome growth could be retarded to various degrees (Hoyt & Corder, 1962). Equisetum palustre, on the other hand, was found to be quite resistant to the chemicals tested. Topgrowth could be damaged, but rhizomes remained virtually unaffected (Holly, 1953). The ease of vegetative propagation in Equisetum has been noted several times (Hauke, 1963; Praeger, 1934; Schaffner, 1931; Wagner and Hammitt, 1970). The reports concentrate on the proliferation of aerial culm fragments floating on water or placed in or on saturated soil. Hauke (1963) suggested that E. xferrissii culms were transported outside the range of its parent species by human activity. He noted, however, that preventing desiccation during translocation was critical for success. Dosdall (1919) also found that culms rapidly lost viability upon drying and, in",

It has fleshy fronds for storing water, but it is not uncommon to observe shrivelling of its fronds during dry spells. Different CAM plants seem to respond to drought differently. Under water stress, CAM plants such as Tillandsia increase their CAM activities, but plants such as Opuntia reduce their CAM activity instead (Kluge & Ting, 1978). We have reported recently that tropical succulent orchids behave just like Opuntia when placed under water stress (Fu & Hew, 1982).",

    "abstract": "In an earlier report on chromosome numbers in the genus Anogramma (Gastony & Baroutsis, 1975), three new counts were established and all known previous counts were summarized. At that time, a count of n=26 for A. leptophylla from Europe (Kurita, 1971) was overlooked. We wish now to acknowledge this count, to report new counts made for populations of A. guatemalensis and A. leptophylla, and to suggest an explanation for some of the variant counts previously reported for A. leptophylla. The general techniques for chromosome preparations were those previously discussed (Gastony & Baroutsis, 1975). To maximize chromosome staining, however, a propionic-iron-haemotoxylin stain (Henderson and Lu, 1968; Rigby, 1973) was applied to fixed mitotic cells of Anogramma gametophytes. The stained chromosomes were visually enhanced by use of phase microscopy in analysis and photographic work. To promote spreading and separation of mitotic cells during squashing, material was treated with one of two preparations: Glusulase (Endo Laboratories Inc., Garden City, NY), a commercially available enzyme mixture from the intestinal juice of the snail Helix pomatia, was applied full strength to gametophyte tissue for four hours (Faberge, 1945); Driselase (Kyowa Hakka Kogyo Co., Tokyo, Japan), a fungal-produced enzyme mixture, was applied as a 10% (w/v) aqueous solution according to the Glusulase schedule. Both preparations were equally satisfactory for softening cell walls. The potential of this enzyme technique in working with gametophyte chromosomes has been more fully discussed by Gastony (1977). Chromosome counts forA. guatemalensis, published here for the first time, are based on three unequivocal counts. The counts reported for A. leptophylla, however, are based only on the material illustrated in Figs. 3, 4, 8, and 9. Sources of spores cultured to provide living material of the taxa herein reported are: A. guatemalensis, Gastony 1037, Depto. Chimaltenango, Guatemala; A. leptophylla, 7 Oct 1972, Mickel, Edo. Oaxaca, Mexico; A. leptophylla, 20 Oct 1972, Esterhuysen, Cape Province, South Africa. Voucher specimens of the plants raised from spores are deposited at IND.",

The most likely candidate is P. calirhiza, a species of Oregon, California, and Mexico that has not been documented from Arizona.

It lies adjacent to Panama and touches the Caribbean Sea on the north and the Pacific Ocean on the west (Fig. 1). The Choc6 is largely an area of tropical lowlands and swamps, but has a few low mountains along the Pacific coast and some slopes and isolated peaks of the Andes, principally in the southeastern part of the Department. The northern two-thirds, between the Serrania de Baud6 and the Andes, is drained by the Rio Atrato, the southern third largely by the Rio San Juan. The Choc6 is sparsely populated. About 50,000 people live in Quibd6, the capital and only large city. Another 160,000 live in small towns, villages, and settlements, mostly along the rivers and coasts. Despite the low population density (ca. 4.5 people per km2), primitive agricultural and lumbering practices, overgrazing, deforestation, and exploitative mining and timbering have destroyed vast areas of natural vegetation. We had a difficult time finding primary or even undisturbed secondary forest in most areas, even though we walked up to 15 km from rivers and roads in an attempt to find the least disturbed collecting areas. Of the botanists whom we know to have visited the Choc6, the first and most famous is Celestino Mutis (1732-1808), a Spaniard whose name is commemorated by Puerto Mutis, a settlement at the head of Bahia Solano. We have also seen specimens from the Choc6 collected by E. P. Killip and J. Cuatrecasas, by J. Araque Molina and F. A. Barkley, by J. Cuatrecasas, by M. A. Arcos, by H. P. Fuchs, and by W. A. Archer. W. Andrew Archer visited the Choc6 about 35 years ago; his published observations Exploration in the Choc6 Intendancy of Colombia (Sci. Monthly 44: 418-434. 1937) are still relevant today. The Choc6 has a bad reputation among field biologists, and it is largely deserved.2 Roads are few. The usual means of transportation are motor launch, dugout canoe, and, to some extent, airplane. Except in Quibd6 and three or four other towns, medical care is nonexistent. The annual rainfall, particularly in the Quibd6 area, nearly sets world records (8,262 mm per year); in the town of Llor6, 24 km southeast of Quibd6, it is said to be about 10,000 mm per year.

The pteridophyte flora of Costa Rica is extremely rich. The vascular flora of the country is estimated to contain approximately 10,000 species, of which perhaps 800 are ferns and fern allies. There are few places in the world with as great diversity in such a small area, which is less than that of West Virginia.

This species was introduced into Spring Lake, San Marcos, Texas, in 1963 by Mr. Leo Osborne, who was at that time manager of the Texas Aquatic Plants Company, San Marcos, Texas. During the summer of 1963, Dr. R. Thacher Gary, Southwest Texas State University, observed one small specimen in the San Marcos River below Spring Lake Dam. From September, 1963 through May, 1965, I undertook an extensive study of the macrophyte community in the first 650 meters of the headwaters reach of the River. During this time I did not find one specimen of Ceratopteris. The specimen reported by Mr. Morton was collected June 7, 1966; the species was reported as being common in the shady part of the River. September, 1967, was the first time I visited Spring Lake and the River after 1965. At that time the species was well established in Spring Lake, in the headwaters reach of the river, and for several river miles downstream. The species survived a flood in January 1968, during which time the river inundated its banks and the river bed was scoured. I wish to thank Dr. D. S. Correll, Texas Research Foundation, Renner, Texas, for the identification of this species. AQUATIC STATION, SOUTHWEST TEXAS STATE UNIVERSITY SAN MARCOS, TEXAS 78666. 122",

Most of the species of Ceratopteris are widely distributed. Ceratopteris thalictroides occurs in tropical Asia, Australia, and America (Benedict, 1909; Morton, 1967). Ceratopteris pteridoides is known from tropical America, subtropical South America, and continental tropical and subtropical eastern Asia (De Vol, 1957). Ceratopteris deltoidea is now known only from Florida, Central America, Jamaica, Porto Rico, Guyana, and Surinam. It has probably disappeared from Louisiana (Benedict, 1909; De Vol, 1956). Ceratopteris lockhartii is known from Trinidad, Guyana, and French Guiana (Benedict, 1909), C. cornuta from tropical and subtropical Africa, and C. gaudichaudii from Guam.",

    "abstract": "Miost taxonomic work on the ferns in the past has involved gross morphology, stelar anatomy, and the structure and position of the sori. Recently attention has been directed toward the diagnostic values of spore characteristics (Brown, 1960; Crane, 1953; McVaugh, 1935; and Marengo, 1956). I\\ly work has been carried out to assess the value of spores as a means of identification of the ferns indigenous to Indiana. As a result a diagnostic key was devised using spore characteristics. The spores examined were fresh, except for Dennstaedtia punctilobula (Michx.) M\\Ioore, Woodwardia virginica (L.) J. E. Smith, Pellaea atropurpurea (L.) Link, and Cheilanthes lanosa (Michx.) D. C. Eaton, which were obtained from herbarium specimens. These four ferns have been collected in Indiana, but are rare (Deam, 1940). Untreated spores were observed for color and size. Fifty spores of each species were measured using an ocular micrometer. Spores of each species were taken from several specimens chosen randomly. For detailed study, spores were treated according to the acetolysis procedure of Erdtman (1943). A set of reference slides was prepared by mounting spores in Hoyer's Medium. This clears the spores and acts as a preservative. Slides may be kept for several years. M[ost species can be distinguished by differences in shape and in the structure and markings of the perispore and exospore layers. However, the species of Botrychium and Osmunda are very similar, with the main difference being size. The spores of Athyrium pycnocarpon (Spreng.) Tidestr. closely resemble those of Asplenium. Further, the spores of Athyrium asplenioides (Michx.) Desv. have ridges much like A. pycnocarpon, whereas Athyrium angustum (Willd.) Presl. does not have distinct wings and ridges, but is tuberculate.",

    "abstract": "A typical greenhouse, although it may function as a tropical house or humid house, usually fails to meet the requirements for growing certain types of tropical plants, notably such rain forest epiphytes as filmy ferns, grammitid ferns, and lycopods. Humidity appears to be the most critical factor for these plants. Temperature and light must also be correct, but they are easier to control. The great success of workers at Kew Gardens and elsewhere in Great Britain in growing these difficult plants has been attributed largely to a climate which enhances efforts to maintain conditions of high humidity, moderate temperature, and indirect light. My research at the University of Michigan involves the study of fern gametophytes which propagate themselves vegetatively by means of gemmae. Self-propagating gametophytes are found in three primarily tropical fern families: Hymenophyllaceae, Vittariaceae, and Grammitidaceae (Farrar, 1967). The culture of these gametophytes apart from their sporophytes has not been difficult. Most of the variety of techniques commonly used for gametophyte culture are suitable (cf. Stokey, 1930; Steeves et al., 1955; Kleinschmidt, 1957; Miller and Miller, 1961), provided that spores or clean, healthy gametophytes are available as innoculating material. For my own work I prefer the method described by Basile (1964) for the culture of bryophytes. A problem arises, however, when",

    "abstract": "Oogenesis of Lygodium japonicum (Thunb.) Sw. is studied using TEM and cytochemical techniques. The early development of the archegonia of L. japonicum is similar to those of the core-leptosporangiate ferns. A mature archegonium always contains an egg, a ventral canal cell (VCC) and a binuclear neck canal cell (NCC). With the development of the egg, a separation cavity forms between the egg and the VCC. However, a pore region, with a diameter of about 3.5 μm, constantly connects the egg and the VCC. The canal cells degenerate gradually accompanied by the accumulation of mucilaginous secretions around the canal cells. PAS reaction reveals that these secretions are polysaccharide in nature. Later development of the archegonia of L. japonicum differs greatly from the core-leptosporangiate ferns. The egg nucleus becomes highly irregular and two types of nuclear evaginations are formed during oogenesis. When the egg matures, no egg envelope or fertilization pore are formed. Only a layer of amorphous material is deposited on the outer surface of the egg. This is the first observation of a fern species that has a pore region but does not result in the formation of a fertilization pore. The pore region appears to determine the formation of the fertilization pore. These observations are consistent with the hypothesized phylogenetic position of L. japonicum relative to the core leptosporangiate ferns.",

In the present study, we compared the microphyll micromorphology and ultrastructure of two resurrection species (S. pulvinata and S. sanguinolenta), and two non-resurrection species (S. kraussiana and S. chrysocaulos). Compared with the two non-resurrection species, the two resurrection species had most of their stomata distributed on the adaxial surface of microphylls that were tightly attached to stems, and possessed smaller and thicker microphylls, smaller stomatal size, higher stomatal density, thicker epidermal cell walls, more chloroplasts, and denser cytoplasm. These micromorphological and ultrastructural features of the two resurrection species were beneficial in reducing the transpiration and dehydration damage and could be considered as ecological adaptations to xeric environments.",

Many studies have focused on the reaction of trees to fertilization, but little is known about herbaceous plants. Ferns are a particularly common group in tropical forests, spanning all vegetation types and zones. Here, we assess how seven years of moderate addition of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and N+P along an elevational gradient (1000–3000 m) have impacted richness and composition of fern and lycophyte assemblages in tropical montane rain forests growing on naturally nutrient deficient soils in the Ecuadorian Andes. We found that fertilization does not affect overall species richness, but that there were strong differences in species abundances (∼60% of species), both negative and positive, that were apparently related to the systematic affiliations and ecological properties of the affected species. These diverse responses of ferns to fertilization provide insight into the sensitivity and complexity of the relationships of nutrient availability and community composition in tropical forests.",

    "abstract": "Marsileaceae is a unique family of semi-aquatic ferns mainly growing in seasonal wetlands worldwide. These habitats present several challenges, since plants go from being wholly submerged to being exposed to aerial conditions, increasing drought stress. Although heterophylly has been studied as an adaptation to these environmental changes, there are still many unanswered questions concerning the mechanisms underlying the ecology of Marsileaceae. We studied the presence of circadian regulation in stomatal conductance, carbon assimilation rate, intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE), and leaf movement of four species from all three genera of Marsileaceae, and related our findings to possible water stress adaptations. No circadian regulation was detected in Pilularia globulifera, whereas Regnellidium diphyllum and two Marsilea species had an apparent rhythm in their stomatal conductance and iWUE, with species-specific patterns. Moreover, light-independent leaf movement was only found in Marsilea species. Taken together, the rhythm in iWUE and leaf movement, along with other anatomical traits for conserving water, infers different strategies to either increase carbon gain or reduce water use in Marsileaceae. Our study represents the first steps towards understanding the underlying drivers and adaptive value of circadian regulation in this family.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is expected to increase temperature and temporal precipitation variability leading to higher evapotranspiration and more frequent and severe droughts. While advancements are being made in our understanding of how plants will respond to these changes, gaps remain in our knowledge of species-specific drought response. This is especially true among herbaceous plant communities, including ferns and other seed-free vascular plants. Previous hydraulic work on ferns has almost exclusively concentrated on the leaves, with very little information on the rhizome, which is surprising given that the rhizome is the long-lived perennial organ (making it more costly and important in species survival). Only recently have rhizome hydraulics been explored in the context of drought stress. Similar to observations in many woody trees, fern leaves tend to desiccate and hydraulically disconnect before the perennial stem experiences significant levels of drought-induced embolism, suggesting strong vulnerability segmentation. These findings have significant implications for fern survival during drought. In this review we expand on these observations, integrating information from previous work on plant hydraulics and ecophysiology, to understand the implications of vulnerability segmentation on the response of ferns to future climate change.",

    "abstract": "Two long-term studies were conducted in a rainforest in Puerto Rico that included measurements of leaf and plant functional traits of the common fern species Steiropteris deltoidea. A Fern Demography study (1993-2009) compared annual variation and effects of a category 3 hurricane (Georges, 1998) on fertile and sterile leaf traits. A second long-term study (2003-2019), the Canopy Trimming Experiment, evaluated annual variation in growth and reproduction of S. deltoidea in response to two experimentally simulated and one category 4 hurricane (Maria, 2017). In the Fern Demography study, differences between fertile and sterile leaf production rates and plant leaf count of S. deltoidea were significant while leaf lengths and lifespans did not differ between leaf types. Fertile (but not sterile) leaf production increased three-fold after Hurricane Georges but declined 10-fold by the end of the study. Leaf lifespans of cohorts emerging before and in the three years after Hurricane Georges were significantly shortened by tree and debris fall. Elevated production of fertile leaves and increased plant leaf counts followed the two simulated hurricanes of the Canopy Trimming experiment and two natural hurricanes. Steiropteris deltoidea exhibits a level of interannual flexibility in some growth and reproductive traits in response to a changed understory environment that suggests it may be a good indicator species for evaluating microhabitat hurricane effects. Although S. deltoidea exhibited resilience, predicted increases in frequency and magnitude of hurricanes in response to climate change may test the limits of life history strategies of rainforest understory ferns.",

In this study, we describe the community- and species-level phenological patterns of leaf phenophases (young, non-fertile, fertile, senescent) of terrestrial ferns and their relationship with environmental variables in a Tropical Dry Forest over 15 months. At the community level, each phenophase was related to a different variable. The young phenophase was positively associated with precipitation, while non-fertile was positively associated with humidity, fertile was negatively associated with canopy cover, and senescent phenophase was not associated with any variable. At the species level, all fern species showed the peak leaf production of each phenophase in the rainy season. However, each phenophase was present during different periods of the rainy season; at the beginning, it was the young phenophase, in the middle, the non-fertile and fertile phenophase, and at the end, the senescent. Such phenological studies will help us understand how fern species change over time and modify their strategies, especially at the community level, in the face of imminent global climate change.",

    "abstract": "In growing ferns from spores, it is desirable, and in experimental work essential, to be able to obtain pure cultures of one species. For example, much time might be wasted in carefully growing plants which later turn out to be contaminants. For controlled experiments, contaminating spores of other species may give uncertain results and threaten the validity of the work. Not only are mixtures of spores of other fern species an inconvenience, but spores of mosses, algae, and fungi are likewise troublesome. Often cultures become overgrown with the filamentous protonemata of mosses that shade out the desired fern prothallia. Algae, especially the green and blue-green types, may often take over, enveloping the fern material, killing both prothallia and young sporophytes. Mold fungi also are serious pests that handicap culture work. To allay such contamination, many who grow fern spores are careful to sterilize their culture medium, whether it be soil, nutrient agar, or liquid solution, as ethod of Preparing Spores for Fern Cultures 95",

They have long been universally known under the generic name Cyrtomium, although doubtless some dealers list them as species of Polystichum, a not altogether unreasonable disposition. Convincing generic distinctions from Polystichum are hard to find; still, if all slightly tenuous genera of ferns were to be reduced to synonymy the result would be having only a few very large genera, not perhaps the most convenient treatment in practice. The purpose of this note is, however, not to discuss the relationship of Cyrtomium to Polystichum but to Phanerophlebia, which is even more closely allied. Copeland, in his Genera Filicum (1947), discussed these two, concluded that they were synonymous, and adopted the name Phanerophlebia for the combined genus, reducing Cyrtomium to synonymy. Copeland is not original in deciding that these groups are not generically separable; the same conclusions and on the same grounds were reached by Thomas Moore1 and John Smith.2 The only original thing is the conclusion that the proper generic name is Phanerophlebia, an erroneous conclusion, as it turns out.",

If there had been a larger colony here, were there others somewhere along the Niagara formation in Michigan? That region became the most interesting in Michigan so far as I was concerned, and many hours during the winter season of 1953-54 were devoted to a study of the geological literature dealing with it. Between Trout Lake and Drummond Island, where the Niagara formation enters Michigan, I found that the Niagaran rocks were exposed in a range of rather conspicuous hills on which northern hardwoods were, or had been, the principal forest type. Polystichum Lonchitis and other species known to occur in the Bruce Peninsula of Ontario, where the American Hart 's-Tongue reaches its greatest abundance, were already known to occur in this part of the state. Additional interest was focused on this section by a letter from a local resident who thought that she and her husband had seen Hart'sTongue while deer hunting, although they could not remember the location.",

Many others have done the same thing and probably the only reason I have been asked to write of my experiments is to show that it is an easy possibility open to anyone with a window-sill or a few square feet of space. If your interest isn't keen at planting time, I assure you it will be aroused by those first tiny pricks of green, will mount when these green points turn into lovely ruffled prothallia, and will reach fever-pitch when these give rise to the tiny sporophytes (usually like very small clover or violet leaves at first) which are the beginnings of the true fern. At every stage, such a lively green! There have been some failures and disappointments, but surprisingly so many more successes. In a few particulars, I have had to do things a bit differently from methods described in the American Fern Journal, and these will be mentioned, but the main fact of interest to those who have seen my ferns is the large number I have been able to grow in a very small space. The little porch shown in the accompanying picture is smaller even than it looks, scarcely 6 x 8 feet in all, and what is there now was not really planned. Like Topsy,",

Deam, research forester of Indiana, I was privileged to examine all the Botrychiums which he had collected for several years past, as he sent me his whole collection asking that I determine them for him. It appears that Mr. Deam is a very keen observer, and in his work as research forester he has collected extensively throughout his state, and has brought together a fine collection of the Indiana Botrychiums. In the collection there were 34 sheets from 23 counties. There were 17 of Botrychium obliquum, 10 of Botrychium dissectum, 4 of Botrychium ternatum var. intermedium, and 2 sheets that contained specimens of a new variety or possibly a new species. Of these last specimens I will speak later. To those that hold to the theory that B. dissectum is always found in company width B. obliquum, I will say, that from the study of Mr. Deam's collection conclusions do not point that way. Of the ten stations where Mr. Deam had collected B. dissectum, only three were with B. obliquum. This conclusion was formed from studying the labels, and I also wrote Mr. Deam asking if I should understand that B. obliquum was not present with B. dissectum when not mentioned on the label, and he replied that that was correct. He also added that in the north part of the state where B. dissectum was more often found, B. obliquum was quite rare. But in the south part of the state where B. obliquum was common, B. dissectum was rare. There were seven stations where B. dissectum grew alone. These seven stations were, one each in Porter, Allen and Delaware Counties, and two in Wells County 48",

    "abstract": "The identity of neotropical specimens of Trichomanes is often puzzling because the species vary in frond size and dissection according to the humidity and light intensity under which they grow and because many of the species are wide ranging and have accumulated different names in different countries. Although there has never been a modern monograph of the genus as a whole, Wessels-Boer (1962) treated the species of subg. Didymoglossum (Desv.) C. Chr. and more recently Windisch (1993) published on the T. crispum group, which are among the most vexing species of subg. Achomanes K. Presl. Trichomanes polypodioides L. is a rather common, widespread, lowland and midelevation epiphyte. It is often found on tree fern trunks and has short, strongly alate stipes and narrowly lanceolate, merely pinnatifid laminae with entire to sinuous or crenate lobes, a frond form that is rather unusual in Trichomanes. This species and its allies form section Acarpacrium (Prantl) C. Chr. of subg. Achomanes and are characterized by having stellate (or sometimes bifid) hairs, rather than simple hairs, on the lamina margins and usually on the veins. Morton (1968, pp. 198-199) included ten names in this section, five of which appear to be valid species. The disposition of the other names is as follows: Trichomanes adscendens Kunze is probably a synonym of T. holopterum Kunze, T. attenuatum Hook. and T. ptilodes Bosch are synonyms of T. alatum Swartz, T. curranii Weath. is a synonym of T. superbum Bosch, and T fimbriatum Backh. is a synonym of T. trigonum Desv. In studying these species for the Flora of the Guianas, I found some specimens that had been misnamed and were actually a new species: Trichomanes caliginum Lellinger, sp. nov.

The hybrid was initially identified from herbarium material; however, the authors agreed at the time that confirmation by chromosome counts was necessary. This paper confirms the identity of the hybrid by chromosome counts, provides details of the morphology and ecology, and designates a binomial. lacustris L. (I. macrospora Dur.) was discovered in Lake Wawayanda, Sussex County, New Jersey, by J. L. Edwards in 1937 (Chrysler & Edwards, 1947). This species is near its southern limit of geographical distribution in northern New Jersey, and was listed as endangered in the state by Fairbrothers & Hough (1973). The population has been observed by Montgomery since 1965. engelmannii A. Braun is common in lakes and ponds in northern New Jersey. It was first collected in Lake Wawayanda by J. L. Edwards and E. T. Wherry in 1938 (Taylor in Montgomery & Fairbrothers, 1992). Taylor recognized the hybrid by its irregular, polymorphic megaspores (Wagner et al., 1986) during examination of specimens for the New Jersey Ferns and Fern Allies. The parents were deduced from the spore surface ornamentation and the presence of the possible parents in the same lake. engelmannii x lacustris was first collected by J. L. Edwards and J. Dezer in 1937, and again by J. L. Edwards in 1938. Montgomery collected the hybrid with I. lacustris in 1965. All collections were labeled as Isoetes macrospora, the recognized name for North American L. lacustris, until Taylor's identification. METHODS",

Wagner, 1979), and several sterile interspecific hybrids have been reported (see P. Soltis et al., 1987, for review).As part of a comprehensive molecular analysis of polyploidy, its causes, and genetic consequences, we have studied two additional interspecific hybrids.In this paper we provide electrophoretic documentation of hybridization between P. andersonii and P. munitum and between P. lemmonii and P. munitum.Both hybrids were previously reported based on morphological and cytological evidence (W.Wagner, 1973).Polystichum andersonii occupies lowland coastal forests in British Columbia and southeastern Alaska, montane forests in western Washington and Oregon, and also occurs disjunctly in southeastern British Columbia, northern Idaho, and northwestern Montana.This species is tetraploid (2n= 164; W. Wagner, 1973; D. Wagner, 1979), but its ancestry is uncertain.Warren Wagner (1973) suggested that this species is of autopolyploid origin based on its distinctive leaf morphology and the presence of a vegetative bud on the rachis of the frond.",

    "abstract": "The spores of Christensenia are echinate, and superficially similar. How- ever, detailed SEM study reveals differences in spore shape, size, and exospore characters, such as spine distance, length, curvature, banding, apex morphology, and fusion. These differences are taxonomically significant and correlate completely with characters of gross morphology in the three taxa in the genus. In a recent revision, Rolleri (1993) segregated the genus Christensenia Max- on into the following taxa: C. aesculifolia Blume subsp. aesculifolia, C. aes- culifolia Blume subsp. korthalsii (de Vriese) Rolleri, and C. lobbiana (de Vriese) Rolleri. In that paper, spore morphology was considered to be unim- portant taxonomically, and spores were only described as monolete, elliptic in polar view, with a conical/spinulose ornamentation of close, short, sharp but soft spine-like processes (Rolleri, 1993, p. 14). Later observations of Christensenia spores, however, suggested that they var- ied more than previously thought. Therefore, we decided to study spores with a scanning electron microscope (SEM), especially to search for possible cor- relations with the morphological data presented by Rolleri (1993). This is the first analysis of specific and infraspecific variation within a genus of Marat- tiales, although spores of extant genera and species of the order have been studied and described for well over a century. Previous studies involving Christensenia considered it to be monotypic, and descriptions and illustrations of its spores were always attributed to C. aes- culifolia (Edrtmann and Sorsa, 1971; Morucchio, 1973; Devi, 1977; Hill and Camus, 1986; Tryon and Lugardon, 1990). Erdtman and Sorsa (1971) described apparently monolete perispores having an outer wall densely ornamented with spines. Morucchio (1973) described trilete, echinate spores and the possible presence of a perispore. Devi (1977, p. 99) described the spores as monolete and devoid of perine, with inconspicuous laesura. Hill and Camus (1986) stated that the spores may be trilete, or alete within a single syn- angium. They also described ornamentation as being prominently spinulose, with large spines, a feature of the sporoderm that they considered derived in",

Because Bierhorst (1955) obtained about 30% germination in soil culture, efforts were made to improve the germination of these spores in axenic culture. In a recent study, modifications to the nutrient medium showed that 90% germination can be obtained in axenic culture (Whittier, 1990). The key change was the elimination of nitrate nitrogen from the nutrient medium. The development of a nutrient medium on which high percentages of Psilotum spores can germinate presents an opportunity to study the influence of nonnutritional factors on germination. Whether spore source, age, or storage have any influence on germination can now be examined. This study was conducted to demonstrate how these factors affect the viability of Psilotum spores.",

Rouffa (1966) observed that Psilotum, which was illuminated with cool white fluorescent light at 200-400 ft.-c. for extended periods of time, would produce unusual fertile appendages. Warren H. Wagner, Jr. (pers. comm., 1986) observed unusual plants of Psilotum collected in Hawaii by Francis G. Howarth on the floor of a lava tube in complete absence of light. These plants had the appearance of short aerial rhizomes. The modifications of these plants were apparently caused by their growth in the dark, so Wagner suggested that such modified development might be produced experimentally by giving greenhouse-grown plants a dark treatment. The aim of this investigation was to determine whether Psilotum plants could grow at all for an extended period in the dark and whether their morphology would be altered by such growth.",

This report concerns the ecology of W. scopulina gametophytes and sporophytes. An understanding of the life history of any fern is incomplete as long as the functioning of its gametophytes remains obscure. Yet, the study of gametophyte ecology is in its infancy. Adaptations of gametophytes to cold and dessication have been explored by Pickett (1914). Hill (1971) compared the habitat requirements for spore germination and gametophyte development for three ferns in Michigan. Gametophyte population divergence and general ecology have been studied by Cousens (1979). Wagner and Sharp (1963) found that free-living Vittaria prothalli occurred in areas far north of their sporophytes. Since this discovery, several other genera of tropical ferns have been found to possess gametophytes with geographic ranges much more extensive than the sporophyte (Wagner & Evers, 1963; Farrar, 1967; McAlpin & Farrar, 1978). Page (1979) sums up much of the research on fern gametophyte ecology.",

Spores of the fungus Botryodiplodia theobromae germinated completely on water or water agar under light or in darkness but failed to germinate on soils under the same conditions.

At the base of the stem is a protostele surrounded either partially or completely by phloem. Above this point pith develops, and the stele is an ectophloic siphonostele. The remainder of the stem contains a dictyostele of anastomosing collateral bundles with endarch xylem and no secondary vascular tissues. Root bundles are attached at the meristele edges. It is not known whether roots are associated consistently with leaf bases. Rostowzew found one root attached near each leaf base in 0. vulgatum, and Vasisht found the same condition in 0. aitchisonii. It seems possible that the roots of some species bear no discernible relation to the leaf bases; figure 2 of Gewirtz and Fahn may be interpreted as indicating this.",

    "abstract": "Since the publication of Ferns of New by Chrysler and Edwards (1947), a great deal has been learned about the relationships of the eastern American Wood Ferns, Dryopteris. The work begun by Manton (1950) has been followed up by Walker (1959, 1961, 1962), and especially by Wagner and his coworkers (1971 and other references). Although some problems still remain to be resolved, the relationships are reasonably well understood (Wagner, 1971). Except for D. celsa, the distributions of the species are generally known, but those of the hybrids (especially those involving D. celsa and D. clintoniana) are known in local areas only, e.g., Michigan (Wagner & Hagenah, 1962; Wagner, Wagner & Hagenah, 1969), Virginia (Wagner, 1963; Wagner & Wagner, 1966), New York (Wagner & Wagner, 1965), and Ontario (Britton & Soper, 1966). Dryopteris celsa is primarily a southern lowland plant of the piedmont and coastal plain, although its distribution inland may not be fully known. Isolated populations are known in northern New York and Michigan (Wagner, 1971). Dryopteris clintoniana, on the other hand, is a northern and upland plant, and rarely is found south of the Wisconsin glacial boundary (Wagner, Wagner & Hagetah, 1969). Dryopteris species and hybrids are abundant in the northern part of New Jersey. This area should be one of overlap for D. celsa and D. clintoniana, since the glacial boundary and the upland-lowland boundary both occur here. Only D. clintoniana has been previously reported, except for a publication on material used for chromosome studies by Wagner (1971), in which hybrids involving D. celsa were detected. No recent field work involving Dryopteris populations has been reported, and no other chromosome counts have been made, hence the presence of D. celsa in New Jersey is undocumented. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to investigate the distribution of Dryopteris celsa and D. clintoniana in New Jersey.",

    "abstract": "Asplenium is one of the largest, most diverse, and widespread genera of modern ferns. Many of its nearly 800 species reproduce vegetatively by buds. In different species or species groups, buds have been reported on the roots (A. auritum, A. cuspidatum), in the axils of basal pinnae (A. monanthes var.), in the axils of several pinnae (A. commutatum), on the rachis near the apex (A. sessilifolium, A. polyphyllum), on an attenuated rachis tip (A. radicans, A. rutaceum, A. rhizophyllum), and plantlets have been observed on the upper surface of the pinnae (A. bulbiferum, A. viviparum), and on stolonoid fronds (A. mannii, A. bipinnatifidum complex). See Faden (1973) for a more detailed treatment of buds and plantlets in Asplenium. The various means of vegetative reproduction in A. exiguum are reported here and its horticultural possibilities are discussed. Asplenium exiguum is a small spleenwort (fronds 3-20 cm tall) with an interesting disjunct geographic distribution. It is found in the Himalaya Mountains, the Philippine Islands, Mexico, and the southwestern United States. In 1971 the author discovered it in the Mexican state of Oaxaca near the village of Ixtlan de Juatrez, growing on dry, exposed rocky cliffs and shaded ravines. Plants growing on the more exposed sites occasionally rooted at the tip of an extended rachis. This mode of reproduction has been noted by Bir and Shukla (1968), Copeland (1960, p. 442) and Knobloch and Correll (1962, p. 151). Living plants transplanted to the New York Botanical Garden greenhouses have survived well. One plant was placed in our cloud forest chamber (the type described by Farrar, 1968), where it had nearly 100% humidity. After a few months, three methods of vegetative reproduction expressed themselves. A few fronds had prolonged apices with rooting tips (Fig. le); occasionally a frond forked at the tip (Fig. Ic), resulting in two proliferous apices. Some fronds developed buds at the base of pinnae near the tip of the rachis (Fig. le); this type has not been noted for this species previously. The most unusual development, however, was that a plantlet developed at the apex of many pinnae, forming a necklace of young plants around the entire frond (Figs. Ib, d). This is most pronounced on the older fronds as they lie close to the ground. Careful examination shows that all pinnae, whether they are on living plants in the cloud forest chamber or the greenhouse or are on herbarium specimens, bear a bud in the notch at the apex (Fig. la). Apparently wild plants only rarely get sufficient humidity to allow the buds to produce plantlets, for only rarely on herbarium specimens was it possible to detect with magnification the slightest germination of these buds, and plantlets",

A cold requirement for completion of the annual cycle of growth and development in flowering plants native to the temperate zones is well known (Salisbury & Ross, 1969). However, little or no information is available on the role of low winter temperatures in the life cycle of temperate zone ferns. Preliminary experiments suggested that six local fern species differed widely in their dependence on a cold treatment for renewed growth. Three species (Osmunda claytoniana L., Athyrium filix-femina (L.) Roth, and Matteuccia struthiopteris (L.) Todaro) required at least 30 days of outdoors cold treatment, during November-February, to produce appreciable bud-break indoors. The other species (Cystopteris fragilis (L.)

    "abstract": "The taxonomy of the fern genus Arachniodes Blume in China is rather complicated with the creation of many new names since the 1960's. The purpose of this article is to make a clarification of the genus as a whole from China and provide an enumeration of what is known at present. Through herbarium studies and field observations, the distribution, morphological criteria and subdivision of the genus Arachniodes from China are discussed. The total number of species has been reduced from ca 130 names to 58 names, some of which are still in need of studies to prove their acceptance. A subdivision of four sections is adopted and further completed, i.e. sect. Cavaleria, sect. Globisorae, sect. Amoenae , and sect. Arachniodes; and for the 50 species names included in the section Arachniodes, 10 species groups were proposed for the purpose of further comparison. Names of taxa that belong to Arachniodes known from China are enumerated in alphabetical order with information about their synonyms, their distribution and the sections and groups in which they are categorized.",

Analysis of the plant suggests that apparently it is a hybrid (which will be described in detail elsewhere) of P. bridgesii and P. mucronata. The various features of the plant are mostly intermediate between those of the morphologically dissimilar parental species. As is to be expected in such a wide cross, the sporophyte is essentially sterile. At times, however, occasional individuals can be found to yield a few viable spores among the far more numerous nonfunctional products of abortive sporogenesis. Among the many individuals examined, two plants from a locality near Yosemite (Pray 1958, 1961) had sufficient functional sporangia to give a few spores to be sown on agar. In these sporangia, spore size was variable, with a few obviously larger than the rest. It was apparently the larger spores that were capable of germination. Accurate spore number per sporangium was not determined. It was, however, less than the normal 64.",

    "abstract": "Few plant species have demonstrated the ability to hyperaccumulate heavy metals from contaminated soil. Recently, Pteris vittata L. has been identified as a hyperaccumulator of arsenic. Because gametophytic development is an essential stage in the fern life cycle, impacts of heavy metal hyperaccumulation on gametophytic and sporophytic tissue must be investigated if successional bioremediation efforts are to be implemented successfully. Our research showed that sporophytes as well as gametophytes of P. vittata are capable of As uptake and accumulation. Increased As (≤2500 ppm) did not inhibit spore germination, and deleterious effects on gametophyte morphology were observed only after extended time periods on media with extremely high As concentrations (≥600 ppm). Six other Pteris species varied in ability to germinate on As-containing media. Sporophytes of P. vittata showed no adverse effects when exposed to the highest soil As levels (1650 ppm); in fact, root proliferation was observed in areas of increased As concentration (250 ppm). Foliar application of an arsenical herbicide (calcium acid methanearsonate) to sporophytes resulted in decreased chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations. Phosphate additions inhibited As uptake by sporophytes, indicating As uptake involves the phosphate transport system.",

    "abstract": "The cup ferns cultivated in southern California are finely divided ferns of large to medium size, and sometimes are used as background foliage. Little known to the gardening public, they may be recognized by the characteristic cup-like marginal structures on the under side of the fronds. The sporangia are borne within these cups. With the exception of Dennstaedtia punctilobula, a temperate North American species, all are trop. ical species. Once these plants are established in gardens they require little care except watering. Today they are most frequently found in older gardens where they were planted before the era of philo. dendrons and other foliage plants of present popularity. The Huntington Estate in San Marino, California, has a well estab. lished bed of D. davallioides in its Japanese tea garden. Dennstaedtias rarely are found in the nursery trade and plants are primarily acquired through the generosity of fern gardeners. New plants are started easily from division of a mature plant. Some gardeners object to the wide-creeping habit of D. cicutaria and D. davallioides. However, I have found them easy to control by occasionally pulling them out of trespassed areas. During the winter months these plants undergo a period of rest. They are at their best in the spring and summer months. Although capable of withstanding more abuse than many other ferns, their requirements are basically the same; shade, a moist friable soil, some protection from wind, and fairly good drainage. It is doubtful if these ferns would survive in areas with long cool winters. Dennstaedtias in general are large to medium sized ferns with creeping, branched, hairy rhizomes. The fronds usually are broadest at the base and may be once to four times pinnate. The veins are free, forked, and on fertile fronds bear sori at their tips. The indusium and leaf-margin form a cup-like structure",

    "abstract": "Plants have different strategies for adapting to environmental conditions, such as characteristics that allow them to be more efficient in shady or sunny environments. Those that grow in dimly lit environments often have a photosynthetic epidermis. However, Adiantum raddianum, known as the maidenhair fern, is a species found in sunny environments that has this characteristic. Within the abaxial and adaxial epidermal cells of the leaf pinnules of this species, there are arm-like projections where chloroplasts agglomerate. The goal of this study was to describe the development of the epidermal cells of A. raddianum, describe the morphological characteristics of the chloroplasts in these cells, and interpret any cytological characteristics that this species might have as a result of an adaptive survival strategy. The study found that the arm-like projections within the epidermis develop when the leaves are young and still exhibit circinate vernation. Cytological observations revealed a plastidial dimorphism, where there was variation in the arrangement of the thylakoid system, and the presence of stromules, which may help establish a connection among chloroplasts and between these organelles and mitochondria and peroxisomes. Descriptions of the stromules and plastidial dimorphism, made in this study, can be included with other known epidermal adaptive strategies (e.g., plastidial movement and mucilage secretion), which help this plant to survive under different environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "The family Ophioglossaceae is one of the oldest fern lineages, characterized by a specific sporophyte structure where each leaf is divided into a fertile (sporophore) and a sterile (trophophore) segment. The aims of this study were to analyze: (1) the growth rate and duration for each developmental stage of the sporophyte of the protected fern Botrychium lunaria (L.) Sw., (2) the correlation between sporophore and trophophore size, and (3) the effects of soil conditions and density of other herbaceous plants on the development and number of individuals of B. lunaria to suggest some possible methods for its protection. Field research was conducted in a threatened population of this species in alluvial ash forest (Astrantio-Fraxinetum Oberd. 1953) at the base of Dziewicza Góra, a wooded hill in western Poland. During leaf emergence, the first and longest stage of development, the leaf developed intensively. Subsequently, its subdivision into the sporophore and trophophore became apparent. Throughout the four subsequent stages of sporophyte development (initial maturation, final maturation, spore release and senescence), the sizes of the trophophore and sporophore were significantly correlated. Additionally, sporophore size was affected by abiotic factors, including the total N and organic C contents of the soil. In patches with a higher cover of the herb layer we observed a smaller number of individuals of B. lunaria, so active protection by control of competing plant species seems necessary to ensure the survival of this population. Our results may help to design an effective conservation strategy for this rare and threatened fern in Poland and elsewhere.",

Resumption of growth when the cultures are supplied with glucose reveals that they are still alive. The stalled gametophytes of S. dissectum and O. crotalophoroides on media without sugar contain lipid droplets from the spores and a few starch grains that form during germination. The starch and lipid do not support the further growth of the stalled gametophytes because the size of the gametophytes does not change over time. These storage products slowly disappear from the stalled gametophytes. It appears that the storage materials are used to keep the stalled gametophytes alive. About 9% of the stalled gametophytes of O. crotalophoroides remain alive for ten months and about 5% of those of S. dissectum remain alive for 34 months. Delayed gametophyte growth is also exhibited by young gametophytes of Botrypus virginianus, Lycopodium obscurum, and Psilotum nudum. Delayed growth of mycoheterotrophic gametophytes under natural conditions would increase the time available for colonization by appropriate mycorrhizal fungi.",

The topography is essentially mountainous; the highest peaks on Luzon and Mindanao are about 10,000 feet high. The land area is not great, being about that of the New England States and New York combined, but nearly one-third of it is covered with primary forests. The conditions are most favorable for the growth of ferns, and that the fern flora was an exceedingly rich one was apparent about a century ago when the collection assembled by Hugh Cuming in 1836-40 became available to European botanists. In 1841 John Smith' in his preliminary study of the material, listed 297 species of true ferns from this one collection, of which 100 were presumed to be new; a few of these were actually from the Malay Peninsula, however. It is rather difficult to estimate closely the total number of species of ferns and fern allies that actually occur in the Philippines, because of the very complicated synonymy, but not far from 1,000 species have been recorded; this number is probably too high, however. A conservative estimate would be about 925 valid species of ferns and fern allies for the entire Archipelago.",

    "abstract": "Military Highway was laid for more than 900 miles during the summer of 1942 and winter of 1942-43. The or Alcan Highway, as it is popularly called, traverses some of the most rugged territory on the Continent. Great expanses of the Road are in country which, except for a few Indians and trappers, is virtually uninhabited and, to a large extent, is unexplored and incompletely charted. The overcoming of formidable mountain regions, including the Rockies, broad turbulent rivers, deep ,extensive muskegs, inclement weather, insect pests, and other natural barriers makes this project one of the most difficult human and engineering accomplishments of the century. The Road, south of Whitehorse, does not go above timberline, although the higher mountains through which the Road travels have their summits well above the tree zone. Most of the country is heavily forested, but the tree species are very few. The forests consist primarily of various combinations of white spruce (Picea glauca), black spruce (P. mariana), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia), and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides), with alpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), balsam poplar (Populus tacamahaca), paper birch (Betula papyrifera vars.) and northern larch (Larix laricina) occurring less frequently.

    "abstract": "During the summer and fall of 1932 a study was undertaken of the ferns of the Mammoth Cave National Park region with the purpose of throwing some light on the question of the importance of certain factors which enter into the habitats of ferns, especially soil reaction, moisture, and temperature. The topography and geology of the region make it especially suited to the growth of a number of species, since it has a variety of calcareous and siliceous soils, plateaus, wooded slopes, valleys, cliffs, ravines, ponds, streams, sinks and caves. Occasional observations have been made of the ferns of this region for at least sixty years. In 1878 the book by John Williamson on Ferns of was published. This book, which has the distinction of being one of the first important works on ferns published in the United States, includes descriptions, original drawings, and some recorded habitats for all of the species found in the state previous to that date. About thirty-eight or forty species are discussed in it which were considered indigenous to the state. Among those who supplied Williamson with information concerning the localities where certain species were to be found was Professor John Hussey, of Purdue University, who was appointed botanical assistant in 1874 of a party sent by the Kentucky Geological Survey into the district of Edmonson, Butler, and Grayson Counties. Hussey was interested primarily in the timber but was continually on the watch for a new or rare species of fern. Several of his vivid descriptions of the habitats of rare species which he observed in the Mammoth Cave region or in other parts of Edmonson and adjacent counties are quoted in Williamson's book. 113",

From the former it inherits an oblong outline, from the latter sharply incised margins and glandular epidermalindusial surfaces. Further indication of its hybrid origin is furnished by its rather marked variation from one clump to another, especially in the position of sori and degree of glandularity. The taxon first named Aspidium cristatum var. clintonianum by Eaton in 1867, now widely known as Dryopteris clintoniana (Eaton) Dowell, is still more variable, combining in various ways the characters of two rather well-marked members of the genus-D. cristata and D. goldiana; its duration varies from evergreen to deciduous, the rhizome scales from pale brown to shining black, the frond-outline from narrowly to broadly oblong, the tip from gradually to abruptly acuminate, the basal pinnae from deltoid to undulately oblong, and the sorus-position from supra-medial to subeostular.

    "abstract": "Until this summer, only one station for Scott's Spleenwort (x Asplenium ebenoides R. R. Scott) was known in Tennessee. This single station at Beersheba Springs was discovered by E. W. Graves on an automobile trip in 1929 through Tennessee to Sand Mountain, Alabama, and reported in the AMERICAN FERN JOURNAL, volume 20 (No. 1), pp. 22-25. Anderson (1930-1931) failed to find this fern in Tennessee as did also the earlier botanist, Gattinger (1901). This unusual rarity has seemed hard to understand in view of the abundance of Camptosorus rhizophyllus (L.) Link and Asplenium platyneuron (L.) Oakes, especially in Middle Tennessee, where both are frequently found growing together. In the spring of 1933, the author resolved to pay especial attention to all masses of Camptosorus rhizophyllus found on his Sunday field trips. However it was not until October 8, 1933, that the first station for the hybrid was discovered. This station is about thirteen miles south of Nashville, near U. S. Highway 70 and directly west from the Mt. View School (Davidson County) in a mixed hardwood forest close to the edge of a cedar forest in an old field. This is an open forest with almost no undergrowth but with many cedar (Juniperus virginiana L.) stumps, the cedars having been removed for timber (Plate 2). Apparently this station is located on soil overlying Lebanon limestone and characterized by numerous sink-holes. As a matter of fact, this A. ebenoides station was located on a slightly sloping hillside (eastern exposure) about halfway between two sink-holes which were about one hundred yards apart. Only two A. ebenoides plants could be found in spite of careful search. A few fronds were collected and sent to Dr. Wil39",

    "abstract": "possibility of seeing Condors and Harpy Eagles in their native haunts, and being able to collect alpine seeds in a 'little-worked' locality was one naturalist's filip for his ascent of the highest peak of Venezuela, Pico Bolivar. Dr. E. M. Chenery, the naturalist just quoted, who ascended Pico Bolivar a decade ago, has written briefly of his trip. His expedition, he writes, was but the second party of extranjeros to ascend the peak which lies just to the south of the four-century-old city of Merida on the Pan American Highway. Pico Bolivar is the highest summit of the Sierra Nevada de Merida, rising to an imposing 16,400 feet, and, together with the nearby Humboldt Peak and lesser peaks of the Columna massif, creates the backdrop of the beautifully situated city. It will be evident from a glance at the map of the vegetation of Venezuela published by Pittier and Williams (1945, 103) that the Andes of Merida represent the northernmost extension of the paramos of the northern Andes. This map may be advantageously matched with that of Vergara of 1906, the paramo detail of which has been reproduced by Pennell (1938, 428). The Vergara map shows the relationship of this northern extremity of the Andes to the paramos of Colombia; indeed, the Venezuelan area, designated on the Vergara map as the Sierra Nevada de Merida, suggests one of the several islands of paramo stretching archipelago-like in a northeast-southwest trend.",

On the south side of the larger summit these ledges form rough terraces; on the other side they drop more steeply and irregularly to the meadows along the river. From the highest points there are agreeable views of the Taconic hills to the west and north along the valley.

    "abstract": "In the original edition of 'Linnaeus' Species Plantarum (1753) two binomials appear on page 1090, Polypodium F[ilix] mas and P. F[ilix] femina. The first is the basis of Dryopteris Filix mas Schott, with the following synonyms: Polystichum Filix mas Roth, Aspidium Filix mas Sw., Nephrodium Filix mas Rich., Tectaria Filix mas Cav., Lastrea Filix mas Presl, and Lophodium Filix mas Newm. The second is the basis of Athyrium Filix femina Roth, with the following synonyms: Aspidium Filix femina Sw., Tectaria Filix femina Cav., Nephrodium Filix femina Michx., Asplenium Filix femina Bernh., Cyathea Filix femina Bertol., Cystopteris Filix femina Coss. & Germ., and Lastrea Filix femina Colomb. On page 1091 the binomial Polypodium F[ilix] fragile occurs, the specific name apparently being taken from the pre-Linnaean reference to Plukenet, Filix saxatilis, cauliculo tenui fragili. While the specific names Filix mas and Filix femina have consistently been accepted by all post-Linnaean botanists, Filix fragile has with almost equal consistency been ignored. This is probably because in his Flora Svecica ed. 2 (1755), and the second edition of the Species Plantarum (1763), Linnaeus used the binomial Polypodium fragile instead of P. F. [ilix] fragile. In all his works he consistently used P. Filix mas and P. Filix femina; but these were widely used pre-Linnaean phrase names and Filix fragile was not a name so used. It seems highly probable that P. F[ilix] fragile was printed by oversight in 1753, P. fragile being intended; it is, however, actually published and perhaps should be accepted. Summarizing Linnean usage it is to be noted that in 1753, in his",

Ballard established a society for the study of nature in connection with classes which he was then teaching in Lenox, Massachusetts. This was so well received locally that he decided to extend an invitation to the young folks in other communities to join the new movement, and a note to this effect was published in St. Nicholas, at the time the leading nature magazine for young people. A large number of replies were received, and as a result the Agassiz Association for the study of nature by correspondence was formed in 1880 and named for the distinguished naturalist, Louis Agassiz. In a day when movies, autos, radios, bicycles, telephones, and interurbans were rare or absent, people had more time for a study of their surroundings and the chance of being helped over the hard places in a new study was not to be neglected. Not only did the idea appeal to the children for whom it was originally intended, but many grown-ups, interested in a study of the out-door world, were attracted. Local groups, known as Chapters, were formed in many places, and three years later there were more than 650 Chapters in existence, with a total of some 15,000 members. Soon other Chapters, known as Corresponding Chapters, were formed for",

    "abstract": "In the summer of 1916, while on a field trip near Windham, Portage County, this state, I found a crested form of the Lady Fern. The form was new to me and sufficiently beautiful to make a rather striking appearance. I lifted the plant and brought it home. It was first given a place with several other ferns in a small bit of native woods on the college campus. Although assurance had been given that the ferns were in no danger and would not be disturbed during the construction of a new dormitory nearby, the workmen buried the entire bed under logs, scrap lumber, and rubbish to the depth of some six or eight feet before their plight was discovered. After half a day of very strenuous labor on my part, which was a source of considerable amusement to those who had been guilty of the carelessness, the roots of perhaps half of the ferns, all of which were the very rarest species known to the state, were recovered and transferred to a hastily prepared fern-bed by the side of the house in which I am now living. The crested Lady Fern was one of those which was rescued. It took kindly to its new home and has become more cristate each year until it is now a plant of real beauty, Dr. Butters' has shown that there are two species of Lady Ferns instead of one in the eastern half of the United States, neither of which is identical with Athyrium filtx-foemina (L.) Roth, of Europe. He concludes further that Athyrium asplenioides (Michx.) Desv. is prevailingly southern in its distribution, while Athyrium angustum (Willd.) Presl is prevailingly northern in its distribution.",

Among the more rare ferns one finds Asplenium Bradleyi, A. montanum, A. pinnatifidum, A. Trichomanes and occasionally Pellaea atropurpurea growing along the sandstone cliffs, and lower down, where the creek bed has been cut into the limestone shales, Camptosorus rhizophyllus and Dryopteris spinulosa intermedia occur.

In. connection with a study of the fern tribe Vittarieae, of which only a single species, V. lineata (L.) J. E.

Antrophyum Kaulfuss is one of the three Vittarioid genera found in the Philippines, and in the Old World generally. It comprises twenty to twentyfive species (as I have found in the course of nearly five years' intermittent study).

After caf6 at the fonda we set out, following up the Rio Maricao, scrambling over the rocks and in and out of the water most of the way. Maricao is 1500 feet high and we ascended some five hundred feet only in the five or six miles we made up river. The beauty of that rocky stream of clear rushing water, its banks hung with strange trees and shrubs and gorgeous flowers, with ferns everywhere they could find a foothold, on rocks, on the trunks and branches of trees, was intoxicating. I met my first tree ferns here. One, some 25 feet high, a species of Alsophila, was collected in fruit. It has fronds six or eight feet long, the stout woody stipes beset with spines like a blackberry cane. On its trunk were growing Polypodium asplenifolium L., its long narrow fronds drooping over on their slender fuzzy stipes, and Trichomanes",

A friend, seeing them, exclaimed, They all look alike to me! It hardly seems possible that a person having eyes should see so little of beauty around him. There is no more fascinating study for the amateur botanist than ferns, especially if he lives in a locality where they are abundant. Everyone admires their graceful beauty. After having been familiar with their forms all of one's life, it is most interesting to learn to call these neighbors by their names. The widespread popularity of nature study has opened our eyes to many things hitherto unnoticed. If one has a hobby, that hobby is a source of pleasure wherever one goes, and keeps one young. Rue the day when you cease to be absorbingly interested in some specialty. The first visit to the woods after one has begun to learn more about the growing things will be different from any other trip. I well remember such an occasion. It was on a late September afternoon when the summer's growth was finished. Overhead arched magnificent trees, while the rays of the setting sun cast a golden glow over all. Ferns on every side! Rocks and mounds entirely concealed by the walking fern and big bunches of the cinnamon, spinulose, and other large ferns, often named brakes by the uninitiated, while from the crevices of the rock formation at our feet peeped out rosettes of the dainty maidenhair spleenwort.

For two of its sixty years, there was war with that one. For fifty-eight no enemies have appeared to disturb its peace. They have been around it. For two years it was in a hot country, where insect life was abundant. A crocodile, nine feet long, was killed one morning on the verandah of the house where the herbarium was lodged, and the other insects were legions. (Buffon's only proof, that the crocodile was not an insect was, He is too large. Plainly not a scientific argument.) This rare peaceful history seems more peculiar from the fact that I have for only twenty years poisoned plants for my own herbarium. In those early days we never heard of insects injuring an herbarium. Perhaps it was because then Ignorance was bliss.

    "abstract": "In the early numbers of the Fern Bulletin several local fern floras were published in friendly competition for the title of Richest Fern Locality. The ferns of Scolopendrium Lake in Jamesville, N. Y., were listed in the October, 1897, number by L. M. Underwood. This was followed in the next number by Mrs. Terry's account of her collections in Dorset, Vt., and a little later by an article on the ferns of Pittsford, Vt., by Miss Slosson. In 1905 Mrs. Terry published a supplement to her Dorset list adding two new species and several forms and hybrids. Two of these regions are unique in rock formation and soil character, the other two are largely typical of much of the limy hill country of New York and New England. A brief comparison of the lists from these four localities may not be wholly without interest. As a basis for such a comparison it is necessary to adopt some ruling as to what shall be counted as distinct species. Dryopteris Clintoniana and D. intermedia, both of which were counted as varieties in the early lists, are now generally rated as species. That member of the genus that was once called var. dilatata and more recently var. americana seems to me to deserve specific rank, and it is so counted in this article, though as far as I know it has never been given a specific name. It is clearly impossible, with the information at hand, to tell how the early lists would be affected by Prof. Butters's segregation of Athyrium Filix-femina, so for the present purpose I have adhered to the old name. I have omitted all hybrids, including Dryopteris Boottii. The Ophioglossaceae are left for separate comparison at the end of the article.",

What I wanted was not merely a place where ferns would grow. For several years I had been studying the ferns in the woods, having in mind the eventual construction of this garden, and had learned to appreciate how effectively their beauty is brought out by appropriate surroundings. Therefore I had visions of green trees, and enticing paths bordered by clumps of mountain laurel and pungent sweet-pepper bushes, a place of restful leafy shade shut off as much as possible from all surrounding sights of civilization by a screen of shrubbery. And then, having prepared the setting, I would fill it in with the real gems-the ferns-and perhaps with a few of the choicest wild flowers. SELECTING THE LOCATION.-The place selected for the garden was the southerly half of a rectangular piece of lawn, the whole area being 120 by 90 feet. This was bordered on three sides by good-sized trees-spruce, sugar maple, red maple, several concolor firs, a picturesque clump of canoe birches, a white pine, and an old cherry tree-these trees not only making a very attractive frame for the garden, but also furnishing considerable shade and a first-class wind break. Along the easterly and southerly boundaries of this lawn ran a solid board fence nearly six feet high, which while admittedly not particularly ornamental was of real value in shutting out drying and destructive winds. The whole area sloped gently toward the north, thus insuring good drainage, and the soil was a good sandy loam. 53",

As was learned later, this pond is a temporary affair, and is filled or emptied according to the exigencies of cranberry culture. The important landmark, according to the directions, was a railroad embankment. This was visible the other end of the pond, and was reached finally after a considerable detour. For the benefit of those who may wish to hunt for Schizaea, let me describe in some detail the actual surroundings under which it grew at that particular locality. The pond lay in a hollow only a little lower than the adjoining tract. Along two sides, the ground was at that time very dry and covered with blueberries and scrub oak.

No generic description is given, but the intent of the author is quite clear (italics mine). Evidently the writer of these words failed to observe that Ehrhart carefully explains his intent. Ehrhart prepared and distributed a set of exsiccatae under the title Phytophylacium, and inserted in his Beitrage (4: 145-150. 1789) a list of the species (ten decades, or one hundred in all). Each species in the list is assigned a single name, followed by its current binary one. At the end of the list is the following explanation; the translation here given is rather free, but believe closely approximates the sense of the original: I must here omit, for lack of space, the locality where each plant was collected. have reprinted, however, my 'nomina usualia'. Not that it seems to me to be of very much consequence, since they are nothing but an attempt to assign to each plant a name, that may be used for it alone, without an accompanying generic one, as suggested by Oeder in his 'Einleitung zur Krauterkenntniss,' ?141; but that a certain man by the name of Dahl, who is a particular friend of the idea, might derive some amusement from it, and that might accomodate him.

    "abstract": "Mobile county lies principally in the coast plain. However, there is a line of sand hills extending down through the northwest corner of the county, running about half way across and coming within seven miles of the city of Mobile. The east side is very low and marshy. Along the Alabama river and Mobile bay, which bound the east side of the county, is a continuation of swamps which also cover a large part of the south end of the county. The flora of this low country is very rich, for here we find Sarracenia flava, S. rubra, S. psittacina, S. drummondii, the yellow, red, and purple pitcher-plants. Also we find Pogonia ophioglossoides, P. divaricata, Limodorum tuberosum, L. parviflorum, L. pallidum, and L. multiflorum, and a large representation of Habenaria and others of the orchid family. Here too are found eight species of the Rhexia or Meadow Beauty family. Among the ferns there are found the Woodwardias, Osmundas, Dryopteris patens, and other of the marsh loving kinds.",

B. Norton of the Bureau of Plant Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture. The specimen (No. 437 of Mr. Norton's series) grew with others at the edge of a stream in deciduous woods, in high hammock land. Brooksville is situated in western middle Florida, 40 miles almost due north of Tampa. The region is one in which Blechnum occidentale might reasonably be expected to occur naturally, and there is no reason to suppose that it is not native where discovered, notwithstanding that a Plant Introduction Garden of the Bureau of Plant Industry is located not many miles distant. At the writer's request Mr. Norton has kindly submitted the following notes relating to the discovery of this species: When at Brooksville, Florida, in February, 1916, as I was being driven out to the Plant Introduction Garden",

Possibly few botanical laboratories are provided with the requisite incinerating apparatus, but in the case of those connected with colleges there is usually a chemical laboratory near by. If the services of a competent chemist could be enlisted the ash of many such plants might be analyzed, with results not only interesting from an ecological standpoint, but perhaps also of diagnostic value in distinguishing related species. For accurate results certain precautions should be observed, such as collecting all the material from the same tree or same kind of tree, washing off any possible dirt and dust, testing it at different seasons of the year or taking old and young foliage separately, etc. It would be a simple matter also to determine at the same time the ash content (with analysis if possible) of the bark on which the plants grow.

    "abstract": "In late August, 1907, a few days were spent at Breezy Point, Warren, N.H., and there, as elsewhere, the flora claimed much attention. No unfamiliar ferns were found, but one day, in walking up the rough mountain road leading from Merrill's Mountain Home to the Summit House on Mt. Moosilauke, a small Lycopodium was seen that has been pronounced typical L. inundatum. This road is built on the steep mountain side, in many places cut in on the upper side and built up on the lower, with a depression at the bottom of the cut to carry off water. In two hollows of this roadside gutter the little lycopodiums were found,-small weak plants, none over five inches long, clinging closely to the soil, some creeping up the rain-washed bank, most bearing each a sporophyte from an inch to an inch and a half in height. The plants were entirely separate, not more than two dozen in all. The neighborhood produced abundantly black spruce and balsam, Spirea tomentosa, Pteris aquilina, Anaphalis margaritacea and a dry-ground Solidago. A few rods away, lower down the mountain, was a carpet of Lycopodium annotinum, L. obscurum, and L. clavatum in intimate mixture, but, so far as observed, nothing justified the presence of an inundatum plant in that locality. It will be interesting to make further search for the plant in that neighborhood. 15",

As a matter of fact, editor is partial name Dryopteris, but managing editor and elected officers would probably all favor Aspidium, and undoubtedly votes would still be cast for Nephrodium if matter were submitted vote of Society. Mr. Druery favors Nephrodium because this name bears directly on kidney shaped indusia characteristic of most of species of this genus, but he notes Lastraea as accepted name in England. Is not this itself an illustration of practice which he makes objection, use of superfluous names to puzzlement of fernists? The use of scientific names which have direct application genus in question, however ideal it might seem, is unfortunately a counsel of perfection. If it were be followed its logical conclusion in realm of nomenclature, it would mean so wholesale a revision of existing names that changes incident adoption of modern rules based on priority would fade in insignificance.

On July 6th of the past summer, I joined a party of fourteen members of the Vermont Botanical Club, on an excursion to North Bridgewater, Vt., to visit the station for Dryopteris filix-mas. The party was guided by Miss Nelson, the discoverer of the station. Considering the close relation of the two ferns, I anticipated a hunt for the hybrid, and it was hardly a surprise, though it was a great satisfaction, when I found, almost immediately after alighting from the carriage, first D. marginalis and then the hybrid. Several other plants of the hybrid were discovered by members of the party, and though the temptation was considerable, I think none of them was entirely stripped. Of the five fronds secured by me, I have presented one to the American Fern Society Herbarium, one to the herbarium of the New England Botanical Club, one to the herbarium of the New York Botanical Garden,",

In spite of the hairy coatings that make it easier for them to live in relatively arid locations, they have in the main become adapted to drier conditions by the ability of their cells to lose much of their water for short periods without fatal results. This is much the same line of physiological evolution that has been followed by the desert species of Cheilanthes and Notholaena. These plants have retained all of the morphological features and most of the anatomical ones to be found in their congeners of moister climates. By means of an adaptation which is physiological rather than anatomical, these desert ferns are able to live under nearly the same conditions as the cacti, with their elaborate structural features for meeting conditions of drought. In spite of the great diversity exhibited by the ferns of the world, we must regard them as having been conservative from an evolutionary standpoint, when we contrast them with flowering plants.

Now, however, Cuba may be added to its range by reason of a recent collection made by Dr. J. A. Shafer, in February of this year, between La Perla and Santa Ana, in the province of Oriente. (Shafer no. 8626, Feb. 11, 1911.) The plants collected were just in a mature fruiting condition, some of the sporangia having opened, the others still closed but full-sized. In Jamaica the fruiting period appears to range from late December to April, just about six months earlier than the fruiting season of B. Underwoodianum Maxon, the related Jamaican form. These two species form one of the several interesting pairs of Botrychium species, which occur in widely separated regions, and include in each locality two forms more or less alike in form and cutting but differing in the time of fruiting. In Jamaica the pair comprises, as just noted, Botrychium Jenmani and B. Underwoodianum. In the southern",

    "abstract": "American fern students seem to differ in regard to their conception of Polypodium vulgare L. var. auritum Willd.; the characteristic ear-like appendages borne on fronds of that fern, being described as occupying various positions. My attention has been recently called to this matter, by an article in the American Fern Journal (Vol. 1, pages 7-9)  Polypodium vulgare in Maine, by Henry W. Merrill, where the statement appears that the true var. auritum is not eared on the upper side of the segments. On page 8, Mr. Merrill says ,Still another form has been found that, unlike auritum, which has ears on the lower side of the pinnme, has ears on the upper edge of the pinnae only. Mr. W. N. -Clute says that this form is new, and the finder is hunting for a name, but so far he has been unsuccessful. Mr. Merrill, unfortunately, does not attempt to substantiate his assumption that the true var. auritum is not eared on the upper side of the segments and I am unable to conceive what ground he has for this belief. Polypodium vulgare L. var. auritum Willd. is a form found occasionally in New England, easily distinguished from other varieties by the presence of ears or auricles on the lowest segments next to the midrib. These ears or auricles may be borne on the upper border, on the lower border, or on both upper and lower borders of the lowest segments. Considering the fact that American botanists have only recently evinced active interest in fern variation, it is not surprising that' meagre descriptions of these most interesting forms are found in American textbooks, or perhaps no mention of them whatever, and that they are not well understood. For instance, our most pretentious (25)",

Underw., a member of the family Gleicheniaceae, in the extreme southwestern part of Alabama, as a native inhabitant of that region. A specimen which is perfectly typical of this species was sent to me for identification by Mr. L. H. McNeill, Mobile, Alabama, who wrote that it was found growing in the 'pine flats', in the south part of Mobile County, in a shallow cut through yellow clay, on the Mobile & Bay Shore R. R. (Alabama Port Extension), about one and one-half miles east of Delchamps Station and across Fowl River. He added, This plant, the only one I found, was growing in a niche in the perpendicular side of a shallow railroad cut * * and formed a tuft large enough to fill a bushel basket. It grew on the north (the sunny) side of the cut. * * * The road has been built but a few years and, with the exception of rails, no foreign material was used in its construction and practically no foreign material has been carried into that neighborhood. Mr. McNeill, who has devoted much time to a study of the ferns of southern Alabama, was at pains to include these unusually complete data on acount of his inability to associate the plant with the description of any species known from the southern states and also, apparently, because of the fact that it might conceivably be regarded as an introduction. The chances of its having been introduced by man are, however, very remote. Species of Gleicheniaceae are not in general cultivation, being rather rare even in the conservatories of large botanical institutions; and they are not, as a rule, sufficiently",

On account of its small fronds and its habit of growing so thickly in beds together, it requires a closer and much sharper inspection to detect variant forms, than does its more favored and thriftier growing relative, the hart's tongue. I certainly enjoyed discovering accidentally my first walking ferns, more than I did my finding the hart's tongue where I knew others had done so before me. And the first ones grew within sight of my place of business and barely outside the corporation limits, in a little glade locally known as Ewer's Gulf, scarcely an eight of a mile long, yet a rarely failing source of pleasure for a ramble any day. Walking ferns are so widely distributed and common that nearly every one has an opportunity to observe the variant forms, and as the fronds are not affected by much of anything except a severe drought, they may be found at all seasons of the year. i the plant with the up er side of the 8",

As he, Edwin Jellett, and myself took botanical trips together, we were very anxious to find some of this species in our rambles. As we had canvassed most of the locality within twenty miles without results, we began to despair of ever finding it, though Prof. Meehan claimed the specimen figured had been collected in the Wissahickon. One Sunday, after a most delightful trip along Edge Hill to the Pennypack, Joseph remarked: Wouldn't it be a grand ending to a perfect day to find some Goldieanum?, and, while drinking from a spring which ran down along a gentle slope, I noticed a number of extra large ferns growing in the water among stones and proceeded to investigate. On picking a frond and looking for the spore-cases, I found them to be very close to the mid-vein and on my showing it to Joseph, he let out a Hurrah! and said: We have found it 52",

The leaf is somewhat abnormal in that the apices of the blade and pinnae are all more or less blunted and irregular so that the general outlines of the blade and pinnae cannot properly be compared to those of Mr. Winslow's plant. The pinnae, however, appear to be considerably broader than in his specimen. The sori are very small and the indusia are strongly convex, the margins being closely appressed to the leaf tissue. When examined under a microscope, only small, colorless aborted sporangia were found, although the leaf was collected in September, two or three months after the normal fruiting period of either of the species named.",

The fern in question was collected August 19, 1914, on a steep diabase cliff on the south shore of north Ombabika peninsula, Lake Nipigon, Ontario. Dryopteris fragrans (L.) Schott. (7084). This is a very remarkable plant in that it has about 120 (counted as accurately as possible without destroying the planta few did drop off) dead fronds and 10 mature live fruiting fronds-130 in all at the time of its collection. The five other specimens of this species collected on the present expedition show 5, 7, 9, 4, and 6 green fronds respectively, an average of about seven green leaves to the plant including the first plant. Using this figure as the basis of the average annual leaf production, some of these dead fronds are at least 17 years old and the whole plant 18 years old. If it produced 10 fronds annually, they are 12 years old and the whole plant 13 years old. From these figures it seems perfectly reasonable to conclude that the oldest set of dead fronds is at least 15 years old. But this is not all. The rootstock is about 12 centi-",

    "abstract": "The students who have been working for many years to unravel the history of the vegetable kingdom, have given us a very clear and convincing body of proof that our terrestrial plants have developed from aquatic ancestors. It is doubtful if any single event in plant evolution is of greater importance than the emergence from ponds, rivers and lakes, and the development of characteristics which make life possible on dry land. We are familiar with the necessity of water for fertilization in mosses and in the prothallia of ferns, and the fact is very impressive when we realize that none of the ancestors of these plants were ever free of dependence upon water or films of water for this critical act in their life histories. The emergence of plants from the water to the land may have occurred more than once and in more than one group. However this may be, we have numerous cases in which members of purely terrestrial groups have returned to the water. All of our aquatic flowering plants show their terrestrial origin both in their relationships and in the fact that they expose their flowers above water, where fertilization is able to take place by the complex process of pollination which, more than any other performance or structure, was the thing that made terrestrial existence possible. Although ferns still depend upon water as the medium for the transfer of sperm to egg, this act may be per-",

So rare is it that there are in the Gray Herbarium only four sheets from north of the Mexican border and those were collected by Wright and Bigelow between 1849 and 1851. In Mexico, Pringle and Palmer have found it at a few places in Chihuahua and Coahuila. Late collections reported by Wooton and Standley' from New Mexico and by E. J. Palmer2 from Texas add new stations, but do not materially extend the local and restricted range of this plant. Wright seems to have made the first collection in 1849. When his specimens reached Europe and began to be studied there, Hooker referred this plant to the Mexican Pellaea pulchella and cited it under that name in the Species Filicum. Mettenius was of a different opinion and described it as a new species. Baker, somewhat impressed by Mettenius' view, treated it as a variety of P. pulchella3, and Christensen follows this reference in the Index Filicum. Eaton commented on the matter as follows:",

The suggestion of another field of activity will be sufficient to attract the attention and the efforts of many students who are favorably situated for carrying on the work. I have in mind especially the time of fruiting of each species. Records should be definite, giving at least the actual date when the spores first ripen, also as nearly as practicable the time when the spores have been all discharged. In connection with this study, the student may be in a position to make various other observations and records: such as the time of appearance of the plant at the beginning of the growing season and the time of its withering at the end of the season, behavior under varying ecological conditions, distribution of species, etc. Such records from different observers in various sections of the country constitute valuable material for publication, especially if the records extend over observation periods of more than one season for the same species.* PORT RICHMOND, N.

The whole gorge is beautiful and hundreds of tourists, attracted by its charm, visit the spot each year. A Symposium of Eastern Botanists was held here during the Fourth of July week, 1905. This symposium included representatives of the Torrey Botanical Club, the Botanical Society of Washington, the Philadelphia Botanical Club, and the Botanical Society of Western Pennsylvania. The region contains many plants of interest to the general botanist as well as the fern student, and since so far as is known no list of the flora was ever published, it may not be out of place to include a few other plants with the ferns.",

At about ten o'clock, members and guests of the Torrey Club, numbering fifty-two, left the New Jersey Central station in a special car, for the Pine Barrens of Toms River. The Fern Society was represented by Prof. R. A. Harper, Dr. John H. Barnhart, Mr. 0. A. Farwell, Miss Laura M. Bragg, of the Charleston Museum, Mrs. L. Keeler, and Miss I. H. Stebbins, of Rochester, who had been at the Hart's-Tongue hunt. To my regret, I did not meet our President, Mr. Bissell, who, I have since heard, had joined our party in the afternoon. Mr. Long also joined us at the station, which we reached at half past twelve. After our lunch at the Ocean House, we started on our sandy walk. There are many ponds, pools, and sphagnum bogs in this section. Before reaching the first bog, we saw Eupatorium hyssopifolium and E. verbenaefolium, Cassia nictitans, Arenaria squarrosa, Chrysopsis Mariana, and the rarer C. falcata. The exquisite wands of Blazing Star, Liatris graminifolia, var. dubia, made the places glow with color. It was said that Eupatorium resinosum was found. I did not see it, but have read that nowhere in the world, except in the pine barrens of New Jersey, is this plant found. Tufts of Hudsonia tomentosa and ericoides and the dainty Polygonella articulata grow here and there. The first bog, having been reached by this time, gave such treasures as late specimens of the branching white flowered Sabbatia, red root, Lachnanthes tinctoria, Cranberries, Pitcher plants, the three Sundews, the round leaved, spatulate and thread leaved, a tiny Xyris-but no Schizaea.

Schott and its cultivars could serve as a model system for continuing morphogenetic studies of ferns with cell suspension cultures. Cell suspension cultures have been prepared from numerous plant species since the beginning studies of Muir et al. (1958), Steward et al. (1958), and Halperin (1969). Such studies have not been done with ferns. A study of the induction, proliferation, and differentiation of single cells of Boston fern and its cultivars could serve to answer basic questions in the morphogenesis of ferns, and contribute to the development of newer methods for the rapid propagation of sporophyte plants for the nursery trade. The purpose of this investigation, therefore, was to describe the conditions necessary to produce single cell suspension cultures from stolon tip callus, and to induce whole plantlets from the callus in three cultivars of Boston ferns.

    "abstract": "Platycerium is a genus of large, attractive epiphytic ferns that mainly grow on trees. In Singapore, two species have been known - P. coronarium (Koenig) Desv. and P. ridleyi Christ. The former commonly grows on forest and undisturbed wayside trees (Wee, 1978) while the latter is rare. P. ridleyi was once collected from tall trees in the primary jungle of Bukit Timah, but it is now thought to be extinct there (Holttum, 1966; Wee, 1984). During the 1970s and 1980s epiphytes were systematically removed from wayside trees in Singapore because it was thought that they contributed to the rotting of host tree branches. It was further thought that P. coronarium encouraged the breeding of mosquitoes (Wee, 1990). However, in 1990 there was a change in government policy. Epiphytes, including P. coronarium, were looked upon with favour, and their presence on wayside trees was encouraged. Efforts were thus made to reintroduce P. coronarium as well as a few other selected epiphytes onto wayside trees to enhance the attractiveness of the Garden City. However, two decades of systematic removal of the fern had resulted in their disappearance from most trees in Singapore (Wee, 1985; Wee & Corlett, 1986). The only source of planting materials was Peninsular Malaysia, where they commonly grow on rubber trees. Unfortunately, the sudden demand outstripped the supply. As for P. ridleyi, the species is extremely rare. Also, it does not produce young plants vegetatively while P. coronarium does so only infrequently. Thus the only source of large numbers of planting materials was propagation by spores or by tissue culture. This paper reports the production of P. coronarium and P. ridleyi sporophytes from stem and frond explants.",

Ching (1936) differentiated between Thelypteris and Dryopteris on the basis of petiolar characters. Bower (1914) used these characters along with others in establishing the relationships between Blechnum and allied genera. Sen (1964), Keating (1968), and Lucansky (1974a, 1974b) also used petiolar characters in working with dennstaedtioid, cyatheoid, dicksonioid, and pteroid ferns as did Bir (1962) and Kato (1972, 1975) in differentiating members of Athyriaceae. Recently, Lin and DeVol (1977, 1978) have given a key, based entirely on petiolar characters, to 170 species of Taiwan ferns and tried to establish relationships between various families of extant ferns. The above literature and many other references show that petiolar characters, particularly vascular pattern, are relatively constant within a species. In order to test constancy in Indian ferns, we have tried to study materials of the same taxon collected from diverse localities (see Khare, 1984; Khare & Shanker, 1984, 1986). In the process we noted that Hypodematium crenatum (Forssk.) Kuhn (Aspidiaceae of Copeland, 1947) showed considerable variation among the petioles of plants collected from different sites. A detailed study of their petioles was then begun.",

    "abstract": "When establishing the genus Ceradenia (Bishop, 1988), I noted that many taxa were yet to be described. Since the number of novelties will be a surprise to some workers, a few words of explanation seem appropriate. First of all, until recently no group of Neotropical Grammitidaceae has been studied thoroughly using all the nomenclaturally important material. Furthermore, it is now apparent that different species may be superficially quite similar even though they belong to distantly related groups. As a result, the application of some nineteenth century names has been somewhat hazy, for most of the work in this century on these ferns has been done in the New World whereas the types for the older names are in Europe. And of course the descriptions published for these older names have been of little help to modern students. Therefore, specimens of undescribed species have lain in herbaria unrecognized because of the difficulty in ascertaining the precise application of published names. Lastly, these ferns appear to be inadequately collected and many are known only from their types. Parris' careful study of the genus Grammitis in New Guinea (1983) provides an illustrative case; of 64 species accepted 21 were new. Subgenus Ceradenia has been the easier of the two in which to elucidate the included taxa. Subgenus Filicipecten includes the large C. kalbreyerimeridensis group, which in complexity and similarity of species seems analogous to the Polypodium vulgare complex of the Northern Hemisphere. The novelties of this subgenus will be treated later. The eight new species in subgenus Ceradenia here described fall into three species alliances. Five are related to C. capillaris, a widespread species that erenow had but one closely allied described species. A single species falls with the small group of species near C. pilipes. The two remaining species, which are the first terrestrial, erect ones in the subgenus, are closely related to C. herrerae, which in turn seems allied to C. albidula. I have standardized and simplified certain morphological terms in their application to grammitid ferns. I use rachis and pinna whether the lamina is pinnatifid or pinnate. The difference between these two states of laminar dissection is often small or even obscure in many Grammitidaceae. The costa is the midrib of the pinna, the vein is the primary branch from the costa, and the veinlet (venula) is the branch of a forked vein. Of the trichomes, a hair (pilus) consists of one or more thin-walled cells and may be branched or simple, a seta is a pluricellular, unbranched, acicular trichome with thickened cell walls (the multicellular nature is not normally discernible except under higher magnification), and a gland or glandular hair is any trichome that includes one or more cells that are clearly internally or externally secretry.",

    "abstract": "Recent field work and collections from the Atlantic lowlands of Costa Rica have revealed a hybrid between two exindusiate species of Cyathea. This hybrid is noteworthy because it combines the characters of two species that are rather dissimilar and morphologically distinctive. Both of the parents are acaulescent tree ferns of reduced laminar architecture; both are also rather rare and spottily distributed, known from relatively few collections, and one was described only four years ago (Stolze, 1984). The hybrid in question is a cross between Cyathea stolzei A. R. Smith ex Lellinger [originally described as Trichipteris pinnata Stolze], from Costa Rica and Panama, and C. ursina (Maxon) Lellinger [Trichipteris ursina (Maxon) R. Tryon], occuring from Belize to Panama. Both parents and the hybrid were found growing together at the same locality: Costa Rica, Pcia. Heredia, Cerros Sardinal, ca. 2 km N of Chilamate de Sarapiquf (Finca La Martita), 10? 28' N, 84? 04' W, ca. 80-160 m, Smith et a]. 1780 (CR, MO, UC). Cyathea stolzei [Smith et al. 1794 (CR, MICH, MO, NY, UC)] was a relatively common fern in the forest understory, while C. ursina [Smith et al. 1814 (AAU, CR, MICH, MO, NY, UC)] was common in the forest and along trails, especially in somewhat swampy sites. A single plant of the hybrid was discovered growing along a trail at the edge of the forest. The area was one rather rich in ferns, with about 70 species collected, but the only other tree fern species that were found in the area were Cyathea trichiata (Maxon) Domin [Trichipteris trichiata (Maxon) R. Tryon], a species characterized by its bipinnate-pinnatifid fronds, abundantly hairy axes, and trunks several meters tall, and C. multiflora J.E. Smith, also with bipinnate-pinnatifid fronds, a small hemitelioid indusium, and trunks 1-2 m tall. One additional collection of the hybrid has been seen from an adjacent property: Costa Rica, Pcia. Heredia, Finca El Bejuco, at southern end of Cerros Sardinal (N of Rio Sarapiqui), Chilamate de Sarapiquf, ca. 100 m, 10? 27' N, 84? 04' W, Grayum et al. 4613 (MO). With it also grew the putative parents, C. stolzei (Grayum et al. 4608, CR, MO, UC) and C. ursina (Grayum et al. 4621 CR, MO). One additional tree fern was found at this site: Cyathea microdonta (Desv.) Domin; it is easily distinguished by its bipinnate-pinnatifid fronds and spiny rachis and costae. At El Bejuco, C. stolzei grows only on the ridgetops and upper slopes; C. ursina occurs only in the swampy stream bottom at the base of the ridge. The hybrid is in the intermediate zone-the lower slopes of the ridge. Of the two parental species, only C. ursina has been found from the fern-rich (173",

    "abstract": "The genus Botrychium has only recently received detailed attention. Since Clausen's monograph in 1938, most publications on this genus have been connected with floristic studies. Only Sahashi's study (1982) endeavored to take a broad, monographic approach. As is well known, the genus is difficult taxonomically because of subtle characters, variability, rarity, and few and often poor specimens of many of the taxa. Ideally the species should be studied in the wild as natural populations. Japan, western Europe, and North America are the areas best understood. China, on the other hand, has evidently been rather poorly collected, and a number of the taxa that were described by the great botanist R. C. Ching have been brought into question. For this reason, and in the hope of encouraging further investigations of Chinese Botrychium, we have prepared this preliminary review. We have maintained the genus intact, having recognized no segregate genera, and we have also used a conservative approach to species delimitation. Through the kindness of Kunghsia Shing and the authorities of the Institute of Botany (PE), and the Institute of Forestry and Pedology (SFP), Academia Sinica, we were supplied with their Botrychium specimens for study. Dr. Shing kindly translated the labels. We also used specimens from the New York Botanical Garden (NY). University of Michigan (MICH), United States National Herbarium (US), Harvard University (A/GH), and University of California Berkeley (UC). Where Clausen had only 13 Chinese specimens to study, we had 191. DeVol (1945) listed only three species from east central China. A number of the taxa that had been proposed by R. C. Ching were synonymized in keeping with our present knowledge of variability in the genus. We extrapolated our knowledge of the variations of related New World species to arrive at our conclusions. Most of the taxa that have been reduced to synonymy were segregates of two species, B. lanuginosum and B. robustum. The twelve species that we recognize in China display a diverse array of geographical ranges (Fig. 1) correlated with topography, climate, and agricultural activities. We did not map the records from the literature because of the chances of misidentification. The natural distribution of the species is limited to the southeastern half of the moist territory roughly separated by the line (Fig. 2) from the Da Hinggan Mountains to the Taihang Mountains to the Qingling Mountains, to the eastern and southern edges of the Qing-Zang Plateau (Inst. Bot., 1974; Chen et al., 1986; Ching, 1959; and Wu, 1983). An exception is B. lunaria, in Xinjiang Province, northwest China (not shown in Fig. 1), where the precipitation is higher on the north-facing slopes of the mountains (Wu et al., 1980). Within the major distribution area of Botrychium, annual precipitation is",

    "abstract": "Although the morphology and branching pattern of fern rhizomes has received considerable attention in morphological, phylogenetic and occasionally in ecological studies (Troll, 1937; Bower, 1923; Troop & Mickel, 1968; Hirsch & Kaplan, 1974; Bierhorst, 1977; Hagemann, 1976; Gruber, 1981), the systematic value of morphology at the levels of genus and family is rarely explored. If morphology is used as a character in taxonomic studies, it is usually only in statements like rhizome long-creeping, short-creeping or erect (e.g., Price, 1983). As a result, detailed knowledge of morphology and its variability is scarce or lacking for most genera. Within the Polypodiaceae sensu stricto, knowledge of morphology is restricted to a small number of scattered genera or species. At present, a fairly comprehensive survey of morphology is available only for the Davalliaceae (Sen, Sen & Holttum, 1972; Croxdale, 1976; Kato, 1974, Kato & Mitsuta, 1980). Little is known about the morphology in the Grammitid ferns and the genus Loxogramme. Relationships between the Polypodiaceae and other families of ferns are not firmly established. The Grammitidaceae and Loxogramme are often considered close relatives of the Polypodiaceae and the same has been postulated for the Davalliaceae (Holttum, 1973). This study was initiated to assess the variation in morphology present in the Polypodiaceae and related groups, and to determine the possible systematic significance of any variation found in morphology.",

While the paleotropical representatives of these families have received considerable anatomical study in the past (Ogura, 1927, 1972; Godwin, 1932; Mehra & Singh, 1955), it is only recently that similar attention has been directed towards tree ferns of the New World tropics (Lucansky, 1974; Lucansky & White, 1974). The vascular anatomy of the tree fern rhizome is characteristically a dictyostele with the individual meristeles surrounded by a thick layer of sclerenchyma. In addition, the squamate genera of the Cyatheaceae (those bearing scales rather than trichomes as stem and petiolar indument) all possess numerous additional vascular bundles in the medullary and, in some genera, cortical regions. Each of these auxiliary strands is, in turn, partially surrounded by a sclerenchyma sheath (Lucansky, 1974). While much work has been and is being done on the main meristele and on comparative aspects of the stem in general, little attention has been given to the three-dimensional architecture of the auxiliary system and its functional significance. This is primarily due to the limitations imposed by the methods previously employed. Sectioning techniques sufficient for the study of the main meristele are, as a rule, not adequate for studying the anastomosing medullary network over long distances. This study examines in three dimensions the medullary auxiliary network of Cyathea fulva (Mart. & Gal.) Fee, using the technique of surface cine photography (Tomlinson, 1970; Zimmermann & Tomlinson, 1974). In addition, the possible functions of these bundles are discussed. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cyathea fulva ranges from southern Mexico to Panama, Colombia, and Venezuela, and grows at 800-4200 (primarily 1500-2500) m elevation. It is found associated with forests of Liquidambar, Podocarpus, and Quercus (Tryon, 1976). The specimen used in this report was collected in a Liquidambar forest at 1250 m elevation near Misantla in the State of Vera Cruz, Mexico. The trunk was ca. 3 m long, of which about two-thirds (including the basal, apical, and mid-trunk portions) was brought back for study. Voucher specimens are on file at the Gray Herbarium, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts.",

    "abstract": "Cheilanthes kuhnii Milde var. brandtii (Fr. & Sav.) Tagawa is a fern endemic to central Honshu in Japan. This fern is morphologically characterized as follows. The fragile stipes are 8-20 cm long, castaneous, and bear broadly lanceolate, pale brown scales on the lower parts. The laminae are narrowly ovate, tripinnatifid, 15-30 cm long, and 6-13 cm wide. They are summer-green, thinly herbaceous, and more or less farinose beneath. The indusia are continuous in fully soriferous leaves, but sometimes are interrupted in less soriferous ones. According to Ching (1941), this fern belongs toAleuritopteris sect. Dalhousiae, characterized by not or thinly farinose laminae and relatively thin texture. He regarded it as being identical with C. kuhnii Milde var. kuhnii of Korea, Amur, Manchuria, and North China. But typical C. kuhnii of the mainland of Asia has lanceolate and rather deeply dissected laminae. The Japanese plants seem to be more appropriately treated as a variety of C. kuhnii. Cheilanthes kuhnii var. brandtii is usually not rare in the habitats where it grows, but its geographical range is limited to the limestone areas of central Honshu. It is usually found in rather open, dry, and more or less disturbed places, such as on roadside rocks or stone walls near villages, but rarely is found on moist and shaded rocks deep in the mountains. The density of the white farina on the lower surface of the lamina is strongly influenced by the habitat. The plants in open and dry places bear a considerable amount of farina, whereas those in moist and shaded places are hardly farinose. Makino (1917) described var. efarinosa having non-farinose laminae, but it seems to be only an extreme form not worthy of varietal distinction.",

    "abstract": "Well defined apical cells in the meristems of pteridophytes other than Isoetes typically have a simple geometric shape, a relatively large size and nucleus, and a high degree of vacuolation. In radially symmetrical apices, the apical cell is located at the center of the apex. But the most important requirement of an apical cell is that it be the source from which all cell lineages in the apex are derived. The recent history of segmentation of an apical cell may be deduced from the geometrical relationships and relative thickness among the walls of the surrounding cells (Bierhorst, 1977). The most recently formed cell walls are the thinnest; older walls are thicker due to the deposition of additional primary wall material as cells become subdivided into groups or packets of cells. The shoot apex of Isoetes was originally described by Hofmeister (1862) as having a single apical cell which was the ultimate origin of all other cells in the shoot. Using various species including the one which Hofmeister studied (I. lacustris), later workers have either denied the existence of a single apical cell (Bruchmann, 1874, Hegelmaier, 1874; West & Takeda, 1915; Bhambie, 1957) or have allowed that at least in some cases such a cell may be present (Scott & Hill, 1900; Lang, 1915; Paolillo, 1963). Scott and Hill suggested that Hofmeister may have been influenced in his interpretation by the fact that the apical cell was the only type of apical organization known at that time, but they were careful to point out that occasionally an apical cell may be present. Scott and Hill found several examples of what they thought might be apical cells, but they could not determine if the large size and central position of these cells were stable or if these properties would have been lost in the course of further activity of the meristem. The present report confirms the existence of an apical cell at least in some specimens of I. tuckermanii A. Br.",

Although nearly 2,000 specimens have been available to me for examination, a startling number of these have been partially or totally inadequate for purposes of classification. A small number are of questionable value even for identification. On looking back at the frustrations experienced due to lack of sufficient data (which just as easily could have been provided), it occurred to me that other collectors might benefit by the hindsight I have gained from these problems. I present the following observations, not only for the consideration of inexperienced taxonomists, but for veteran collectors as well, in hopes that they may prompt more effective collecting of large ferns. Scientists in the field spend large sums of money and exude copious amounts of perspiration collecting in new and exciting areas. Where practicable, a competent field man will always collect sections (at least) of fern rhizomes, in addition to the leaves, knowing that both will yield characters of taxonomic value. Anyone faintly acquainted with the problems of Thelypteris would never break off the upper part of the lamina and leave the important basal section behind. And most of us include on our labels information concerning the habit and the habitat of specimens taken. I have seen phanerogam specialists, not especially familiar with problems of fern taxonomy, turn over dozens of leaves in a colony of ferns, attempting to add fertile, as well as sterile, ones to their collecting bags.

It proved to be the first species of Trichomanes sect. Selenodesmium that has leaf blades more than one cell thick. The relatively exposed habitat (altitude ca. 300 m along the trail from the Dumbea Dam to Montagne des Sources) which, however, seemed to be supplied with subsurface water, correlates with the nearly sclerophyllous fronds of the new species. Substratum samples unfortunately yielded no hymenophyllaceous gametophytes, only thallose ones identified as Blechnum sp. and filamentous ones clearly belonging to Schizaea fistulosa. Bierhorst NC460 included two mature specimens, and Bierhorst NC465 included one sterile, halfgrown plant with associated substratum. The material was preserved in a chromic acid-acetic acid-formaldehyde solution in the field and was later transferred to glycerine alcohol. Type material will be dried and deposited in the Gray Herbarium, Harvard University. Freehand sections of all parts of the plant were prepared and stained with 1% Methyl Green for 5 min followed by two rinses in water. The sections illustrated in Figs. 11 and 13-18 were prepared in this manner. The cleared leaf shown in Figs. 4 and 20-22 was bleached in Clorox until white (ca. 15 min; monostromaticous species generally take 1-3 min), rinsed with three changes of water, dehydrated in 70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol (5 min each). It was then stained with Fast Green (1% in 100% ethanol) for 3-5 min, rinsed in two changes of 100% ethanol (total ca. 5 min), then one change of 1:1 xylene-absolute ethanol, then cleared in xylene (two changes of 5 min each), and finally mounted in synthetic resin HSR.

In addition, the sporophylls and trophophylls are conspicuously dimorphic for Phlegmariurus changii, but essentially monomorphic in Phlegmariurus carinatus. The ecology, conservation status, and morphology of P. changii is compared to that of species in three other sections (Sect. Phlegmariurus, L. B. Zhang, Sect. Huperzioides H. S. Kung et L. B.

One hill, named Mount Hamilton, is the site of the Arboretum's magnificent collection of azaleas. In the midst of the fields was a valley, undoubtedly called a gulch or a gully, of no use except as a dump for farm trash. It was a nuisance, a useless piece of land, so fortunately for its later use, the trees were not cut nor the gully filled. For this we are eternally grateful. This is Fern Valley.

Dryopteris X Tavelii Rothmaler is abundant in this region, although the little work on the ferns of the environs of Mont Blanc by Venance Payot1 mentions only typical D. Filixmas. In 1959, the senior author in outlining the distribution in France of D. X Tavelii2 had not at that time seen a single specimen from Haute-Savoie. Probably Christian Bange, of Lyon, was the first to observe this fern in this region. He wrote to us September 10, 1960, that he had found it in 1958 in the gorges of Diosaz, and later in several localities in Savoie and Haute-Savoie, among others in the environs of Chamonix. He believes that he has discovered D. Borreri Newm. also, on the left lateral moraine of the Glacier of Argentieres. In collaboration with M. Berthet, M. Bange communicated his first discoveries to the Societe Linneenne de Lyon in June, 1960, and an account has now been published.3 The specimens of D.

It is probable that each population is distinctive genetically and morphologically. Unlike so many of the familiar leptosporangiate ferns its life-cycle appears to be entirely sexual. It therefore lacks the general uniformity that characterizes such obligate-apogamous ferns as Pellaea atropurpurea and Pteris cretica. A small, isolated population of Diellia will probably tend to acquire unique features by a combination of random fixation and selection by the factors of a particular environment. Of the few populations which really do seem to merit specific recognition, that at Pohakea Pass, Oahu, discovered by D. L. Topping some twenty years ago, seems to represent one of the most distinctive species in the genus. Its ensemble of distinctive features makes it necessary that it be described as a new species. For help in studying this population I am indebted to Harold St. John, H. L. Lyon, E. B. Copeland, and Lincoln Constance.",

This so aroused our interest in ferns that we decided that we must have a fern garden. Since we had only a level, treeless, sunny meadow available for such a garden, this seemed like a bold decision. On examining the ferns upon our return home the prospect seemed even less propitious, as the week at the Grand Central Palace and the journey back to Sharon had played havoc with them. Then, too, we had no space in which to store our ferns pending the completion of a proper setting, except a small workroom in which light, temperature, and humidity were so unfavorable that the condition of the plants became worse every day. It was obvious, therefore, that some place must be speedily prepared, even if it did not entirely coincide with plans for the permanent setting. We had for some years made use of slatted covers for our cold frames as a protection from the strong summer sun, and we believed that an adaptation of these could be made to provide the shade necessary for the ferns.",

At that station Ferris wrote, in the account of the discovery of the fern prepared for the Fern Bulletin (19: 36-38. 1911), that Ceterach was growing in locations similar to those selected by Aspidium juglandifolium [Phanerophlebia auriculata] and Polystichlum aculeatum lobaturm [P. scopulintum].

The 7-year cycle of heavy rains had passed in 1939, with a fall of about 40 inches on the southwest coast, and the next heavy fall was not expected therefore until 1946. It was equally as surprising to the inhabitants of the area as it was to me to receive torrents of rain in late January of 1941.

    "abstract": "One of the most unusual habitats in which to find ferns is the formation of limestone of Silurian Age upon which cedar barrens develop in Kentucky. Recently the author had occasion to study and collect the plants and ferns found on two of these outcroppings-one in Bullitt County, near Cedar Grove-the other, in Nelson County, near Bardstown, along Cedar Creek. The flora on these barrens is distinctive and alike on both. The actual barren is made up of a grayish clay which is very slippery when wet, yet hard and brittle when dry, cracking to a depth of about a centimeter. This area is open and barren, having only occasional patches of Rhamnus lanceolata and Rhus aromatica, with an infrequent Celtis bush and cedar tree. Peeking out from under this shrubbery are delicate Shooting Stars (Dodecatheon meadia), pale blue Sisyrinchium angustifolium, white Nothoscordum bivalve, little Scutellaria parvula, and bright yellow-orange Lithospermum canescens. So it is in May. Later in the season, in August, the flora is quite different, the predominating species being Agave virginica, Sabatia angularis and its white form, several Rudbeckias, Echinacea pallida, Ratibida pinnata, Petalostemon candidum, Thalictrum revolutum, Asclepias verticillata, A. tuberosa and Acerates viridiflora. Just back of this barren is a sort of transition zone of mesophytic woods containing chestnut-oaks, hackberry, and sassafras, canopying a humus-containing soil in which Frasera caroliniana grows, along with Botrychium virginianum and Asplenium platyneuron. Back in this wooded area is an outcropping of Silurian limestone, 53",

When it becomes necessary to raise young ferns in very large quantities, however, as for student classroom study in universities, a dependable standard procedure is needed. Certain important requirements must be met: the prothallia and young sporophytes should be relatively uniform in size and age, free from molds and algae, and available at a set time and in considerable numbers-enough for study by perhaps four or five hundred students. Also, it is desirable that the materials and equipment be relatively simple, standard, and easily available; complicated media and equipment such as those used in physiological research are impractical. The following method, which I have developed and used at the University of Michigan, serves the above requirements most efficiently. It is simple, and if the technique is carefully followed, the results are gratifying. This method should be of value not only where materials are needed for classroom study, but in any situation where large numbers of plants are desired; and it may be suggested also to those who wish to raise",

The Bulletin said nothing about boiling a syrup. No matter how thinly spores are scattered, nor how irregularly they germinate, the tiny green scales will overcrowd some spots. To thin these I began transplanting with a pin, and later with a ball-pointed pen, but could not see the hairlike rootlets without a strong lens, which was in the way while transplanting.

Since that time over a dozen trips have been made to various parts of the area, ranging from the Bill Williams Fork of the Colorado River in Arizona to Cajeme (or Ciudad de Obreg6n), Cedros, and Quiriego in southern Sonora, and from the northern edge of the Colorado Desert in southern California to San Jose del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas at the southern tip of Baja California, Mexico. Most of the traveling was done in automobiles, with occasional side trips by saddle and pack animals. Many miles were covered on foot, for often it was necessary to scramble over rocky hillsides or up boulder-strewn canyons to reach plants growing only where the cliffs and rocks protected them from grazing cattle. Different trips took me, together with various assistants and companions, into the field during every month in the year except November and December, so the seasonal fluctuations in the vegetation were well covered. On all occasions the objective of the field trips was the accumulation of information about the general vegetation of the area; the collection of ferns was, at the beginning, purely incidental.

The steep often precipitous north slope is drained by Crystal Creek and Golden Curry Creek which flows into Champion 'Creek. The west slope drops down into the Sharps Creek watershed, and the south slope is cut by City Creek Canyon. The streams on the east slope empty into Champion Creek which flows northeast and in the largest stream in the region. According to Smith (1938: 32-40) the lower part of the Calapooya formation is dominantly sedimentary, while the upper part is mostly igneous. The lower or sedimentary phase of the Calapooya is made up for the most part of pyroclastics or coarse breccias and agglomerates, all of these being different facies of volcanic materials of more or less explosive origin. Mud flows are also present. The upper igneous phase consists largely of different types of andesitic, dacitic and basaltic flows. The mountains in this area are made up predominantly of tertiary sediments and related intrusive igneous rocks, basalts and andesites, which are the result of folding and faulting, peneplanation and later dissection by rejuvenated streams. They do not seem to present any regular pattern. The topography is in that stage usually designated as mature.",

    "abstract": "It was pointed out in 19181 that Equisetum sylvaticum as it occurs in Europe has scabrous branches, while the American representative of this species usually has smooth branches. On both continents the degree of branching is variable, and the first varietal designation of the smooth American plant was a slightly branching phase which was named var. pauciramosum Milde. The commoner plant in the eastern United States, with branches smooth but compound, was named E. sylvaticum var. pauciramosum f. multiramosum Fernald. Professor Fernald, although treating the two phases of the smooth-branched American plants as forms of one variety, stated that the freely branching phase was commoner in the southern part of the range, while the phase with subsimple branches, of only occasional occurrence southward to New England and Ohio, was the characteristic plant of Greenland and Labrador. Dr. Wherry, emphasizing this difference in range, proposed varietal rank for the more freely branching plant, calling it E. sylvaticum var. multiramosum (Fernald) Wherry.2 The characters of these phases of the species may be most clearly shown in a key:",

This had reference especially to such modern reports as those of I. A. Perfilev2 from Kolguev Island, and of V. N. Andreev3 from two localities in the northeastern portion of the Kanin Peninsula, which left very little room for doubt that this plant indeed inhabited those low-arctic parts of eastern Europe. Andreev's reports were accepted by Prof. Eric Hulten, who also reported the species to go far north (possibly into the Arctic) in parts of Asia.4 However, in view of the frequent misidentification of other species (in particular some phases of the notoriously variable E. arvense) as E. pratense, it was felt wisest to withhold judgment on the propriety of admitting the latter, mainly southern species, into the arctic flora.",

    "abstract": "Hardin County, one of the largest counties of the State, is situated in north-central Kentucky. Its fern flora is no doubt more or less typical of many other counties. The original county, formed in 1792, exceeded in size the State of Delaware, and from it have been carved in whole or in part thirteen present counties. It is easily accessible, being traversed by the main lines of the Louisville & Nashville and the Illinois Central Railroads and bordering the Ohio River on the north. The Dixie Highway, spanning the country from north to south, and the Central Highway, from east to west, cross each other in the countyseat, Elizabethtown, some twenty-five miles northeast of which is My Old Kentucky Home, where Stephen Collins Foster wrote the famous song of that name; while half as far to the southeast is the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln, now a national shrine, and twice as far to the south is the Mammoth Cave, one of the natural wonders of the world. Topographically, Hardin County may be divided into three characteristic sections: Muldraugh's Hill in the northern part, a continuation of the chain of scenic hills known in Indiana as The Knobs; the barrens in the central part, and undulating plains in the southern part. On the high points of Muldraugh's Hill is a thin formation of Warsaw rock and lower down the eroded sides sandstones, shales and limestones, with frequent wetweather springs and waterfalls. Passing to the south from Elizabethtown one encounters a cherty limestone of the St. Louis group, which disintegrates easily, forming a somewhat reddish but productive soil that enters largely into the once noted wheat-lands. A large portion of the surface rock of the county is sub-carboniferous and fre91",

    "abstract": "The best known and historically most interesting fern of the Appalachian region is the Scott's Spleenwort, xAsplenosorus ebenoides (Scott) Wherry (Alston, 1940; Weatherby, 1949), a bigeneric hybrid between Asplenium platyneuron and Camptosorus rhizophyllus. The Ebony Spleenwort, A. platyneuron (L.) Oakes, has tall, pinnately compound leaves with shiny, blackish midribs; its veins are simple and bear parallel sori. The Walking Fern, Camptosorus rhizophyllus (L.) Link, has attenuate, simple leaves with green midribs; its veins are reticulate and bear arching sori. Proliferous leaves of the Walking Fern bear a plantlet at their long and thread-like tip. The hybrid fern combines the parental characteristics in a spectacular and often highly asymmetric manner. The hybrid was first found near Philadelphia along the Schuylkill River around 1862 by a horticultural writer, Robert Robinson Scott, and has been known as Scott's Spleenwort ever since (Weatherby, 1949). Scott published a short description in Thomas Meehan's Gardener's Monthly in 1865 and called it Asplenium ebenoides (i.e., like ebeneum, the then-current synonym of platyneuron). However, Meehan in an editorial note suggested that it might be a hybrid, and the following year the British naturalist Rev. M. J. Berkeley proposed its parents correctly (Weatherby, 1949). A number of problems center around Scott's Spleenwort. There has been a question about the correctness of the epithet ebenoides. A fern considerd by some to be identical to it had been named Asplenium hendersonii by Houlston a decade and a half earlier than A. ebenoides. It was assumed that Scott's Spleenwort was a sterile hybrid because in the original locality it occurred singly with the parents. However, around 1874, Julia L. Tutwiler, a teacher, discovered a large population of Scott's Spleenwort in Rock Hollow, near in Hale Co., Alabama, a ravine later known to botanists as Havana Glen. This apparently fertile population grew on a conglomerate rock of",

The thickened, reddish, glandular hairs scattered over the underside of the lamina, the pubescence of two ranges of length, the broad fronds with the lowest pinnae only slightly or not reduced, and the short-creeping rhizome would seem to place T. guamensis between T. dentata and T. parasitica.

However, he found no stages that could be used for comparison with Damell-Smith's report of the later stages of germination and the origin of the apical cell. Whittier reported some early stages of germination and gametophyte development that did not agree with Darnell-Smith's description of apical cell origin. Consequently, more stages of germination and early gametophyte development from axenic culture have been studied to determine how the apical cell of Psilotum gametophytes is formed.",

    "abstract": "Interest in new state and national records, range extensions, and the status of rare or endangered species of ferns is probably nowhere more keen than in Florida. Critical field and herbarium work to upgrade our knowledge of the distribution and habitat requirements of ferns, especially in the subtropical southern region of the state, assumes political as well as scientific significance at a time when state and federal socio-economic decisions are influenced by the ecological status of species as humble as a lousewort or a snail darter. Efforts to increase the accuracy of our floristic records for Florida ferns have been quite evident in recent years, for example in the work of Messler (1974), Evans (1975), Ward and Hall (1976), Nauman and Austin (1978), Nauman (1978), Austin et al. (1979), Adams and Tomlinson (1979), and Nauman (1979a, 1979b). Such efforts, however, must include the deletion of erroneous records as well as the addition of new records. The deletion of one such erroneous record, the natural occurrence of Vittaria graminifolia Kaulf. in Collier County, Florida, is the subject of this report. The belief that V. graminifolia occurs in Collier County, Florida, its only reported occurrence in the United States, is based on a statement appended to the discussion of V. lineata (L.) J. E. Smith in Wherry's (1964) Southern FernGuide. Wherry stated that V. filifolia Fee was found in 1960 in Collier County, and he distinguished it from V. lineata by the weak iridescence and width of its scales. In another context, Tryon (1964a) showed that V. filifolia is an incorrect name for this species and that its correct name is V. graminifolia. In an effort to bring cytological evidence to bear on the identity of the Appalachian gametophyte by counting its chromosomes and those of V. lineata and V. graminifolia (Gastony, 1977), I undertook a search for V. graminifolia in Collier County. Dr. Wherry responded to my request for more information relating to his 1964 report by noting (in litt., 15 Aug 1976) that at the age of ninety and a half he was no longer able to recall more specific locality data or whether an herbarium voucher documented his report. He did recall, however, that he had visited the living fern collection assembled by John Beckner in St. Petersburg, Florida and that Beckner had there two Vittarias, one less winter hardy than the other. The less hardy one from Collier County was what Dr. Wherry took to be V. graminifolia (as V. filifolia). Wherry's information enabled me to contact John Beckner, who agreed to take me to the site from which he had collected the Vittaria in question. In the company of Dr. Michael Madison of the Selby Botanical Garden and several others, we explored the swampy locality west of Copeland and Deep Lake where Beckner clearly remembered having made the original collection, and we eventually found several specimens of what Beckner said was V. graminifolia if anything in that",

    "abstract": "Several unexpected observations were made recently while collecting plants of Stylites E. Amstutz for anatomical study. The plants were collected near the end of the growing season (18-19 April 1979) so as to obtain young plants which had just completed various numbers of growing seasons. In the type locality, Stylites is described as forming pure colonies which stand just above the water level in the lacustrine bog in which they are found (Rauh & Falk, 1959); but the plants we collected at 4100 m altitude (Karrfalt & Hunter 22, NY) near Lago Junin, 14 km north of Junin, Peru, were invariably growing in association with various flowering plants (Figs. 1 and 2) and were frequently submerged. The colonies at the Junin locality were generally in the form of radially symmetrical, dome-shaped hummocks (Fig. 1), but various other rounded shapes occurred as well. The hummocks ranged in diameter from 20 to about 200 cm. The larger hummocks generally were found to contain a larger proportion of other plants in addition to Stylites than did the smaller ones. The plants in the hummocks were extremely densely packed and usually stood above the water level, but some hummocks were partially or completely submerged. The submerged portions of these hummocks were populated nearly exclusively by Stylites, but the emergent portions included other plants as well (Fig. 5). These plants usually were rather small (with stems a few millimeters in length), but some were quite good-sized (stems 2-4 cm long) and bore about 40 leaves up to 7 cm long, as well as numerous gemmae. Their leaves did not have the typical flattened form with deflexed tips, but rather were subtriangular to terete in cross section and ascending. All intermediate forms between these atypical leaves and those described by Rauh and Falk (1959) were also seen; the variation in leaf morphology will be described in detail in a subsequent report. The plants with the atypical leaf form always were submerged and not densely crowded. On the other hand, plants bearing typical leaves occurred both above and below the water level in the bog, but these plants always were densely crowded. Leaf form correlates with population density rather than with emergence or submergence. The nature of this correlation is not certain, but experiments in progress suggest that it is largely or entirely environmental. In contrast to its very limited geographical range, Stylites is extremely vigorous and abundant where appropriate conditions for its growth exist. The Junin locality is a bog which has been used as a pasture for many years. It is heavily grazed by sheep and llamas, as indicated by the cropped herbage (Figs. 1 and 4) and abundant llama dung. The Stylites plants, however, very rarely show any evidence of even accidental damage by the animals. The Junin locality occupies at least several acres; we were unable to determine its full extent due to our anoxemia and consequent lack of energy. The leaves of Stylites are coated with considerable quantities of mucilage, as are the basal parts of the leaves of all Isoetes species of which we have seen living",

    "abstract": "Cocos Island, in the Pacific Ocean at 5032'57 N Lat. and 86o59'17 W Long., is the only extra-continental possession of Costa Rica. It is uninhabited and lies some 500 km south-southwest of Costa Rica and about 830 km north-northeast of the Galapagos Islands. The island is known from early times. In 1541, N. Desliens included it in one of his maps under the name of Yle des Cocques, a name probably based on the abundance of coconut palms found there. It was for a long time a favorite anchorage of pirates and buccaneers, as it was far from Spanish garrisons on the continental shores. In more recent times it has been a stop for whalers in search of fresh water and game. Cocos Island is better known for the many stories telling of hidden treasure than for its fauna and flora. The paucity of floristic studies is well summarized by Hertlein (1963). The island is of volcanic origin, as evidenced by the abrupt topography and the nature of its rocks. The soils are poor, mostly clayish, and not very deep. Nevertheless, they support a luxuriant vegetation which thrives in the almost constant rainfall that averages about 7000 mm per year. The ferns and fern-allies have been reported in rather fragmentary fashion by a few botanists who stopped at one of the two large bays (Chatham and Wafer) for a few hours on their way to or from the Galapagos Islands or during more general oceanographic researches of the western coasts of tropical America. Some records are those of Hemsley (1882-1886), Robinson (1902), Stewart (1912), Svenson (1935), and Fosberg and Klawe (1966). I have been on the island for two expeditions which totalled fifteen weeks. As of now, the Pteridophyta of Cocos Island is known to include 60 species, of which six are endemic:",

    "abstract": "The population genetics of ferns, which results from initiation of individuals in a new location (often via long-distance dispersal) plus a wide range of mating systems, merit continued study. In the case of species in the subfamily Botrychioideae (specifically the genera Botrychium and Botrypus), previous work using allozyme and isozyme techniques revealed low genetic diversity and weak population genetic structure. This lack of genetic differentiation between populations is in spite of underground fertilization in the genus resulting in high levels of inbreeding and primarily fixed heterozygosity in tetraploids. In the present study, Amplified Fragment-Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs) were used to examine population genetics and structure of three species in the genus Botrychium and one species in the genus Botrypus. Measures of population genetic diversity were generally low, with the highest measures in the relatively common Botrypus virginianus. Across all species, measures of population differentiation were low and most genetic variation was contained within populations. Bayesian analysis of population structure using the program STRUCTURE corroborated these findings, with inferred genetic clusters that generally did not correspond to geographic collecting locations. These results agree with previous studies, with low genetic diversity within and among populations likely due to self-fertilization that limits outcrossing and long-distance spore dispersal that results in genetically similar populations.",

In addition to a few distinctive morphological traits, the species differ in terms of habitat and geographical distribution. The influence of the seasonality and habitat characteristics on quillwort morphology is poorly understood. To assess this influence, specimens from one population of I. cangae, and four populations of I. serracarajensis, were sampled in dry and rainy seasons to investigate variation among vegetative and reproductive characters. The megasporangium color, megaspore ornamentation, alae length, velum length and coverage (%), morphometry of sporangial wall cells, and polar/equatorial diameter ratio of megaspores provide consistent characters for species delimitation. The presence of stomata in I. serracarajensis is a new discovery and is related to its amphibious habit. Some characters that have been used in Isoëtes species descriptions, such as the number of leaves, leaf length, sporangium size, number of megaspores, and megaspore diameter were found to be variable. The current findings provide further information on the biology of the species and show the influence of seasonality and habitat characteristics on the morphological diversity of these lycophytes.",

    "abstract": "Plants are characterized by their marked plasticity and ability to alter their functional biology to partition ecological niches. However, there are limits to functional trait exploration especially in complex and stressful habitats. Highly specialized traits may control a species ability to explore within and across habitats. Such may be especially true of epiphytes, whose array of unique traits may constrain their ability to cross establish in epiphytic and terrestrial habitats. In the case of ferns, there are few reported examples of species that can grow across these habitats with regularity. However, this study reports and explores species that exhibit great ecological flexibility growing across a wide range of habitats and growth forms. Specifically, we examine species that grow as 1) terrestrially rooted and epiphytic individuals, 2) nest and non-nest-forming epiphytes; and nest-forming terrestrially rooted individuals, and 3) species that grow as terrestrial, epiphytic, and epipetric individuals. We use natural abundance foliar stable isotope ratios (SIR) of N15 and C13, and %N, to explore intraspecific variation in mineral nutrition and water relations across and within niches. Our results reveal the 1) unreported ability of some species to grow across the epiphytic/terrestrial divide, 2) surprising ability of some species to explore these habitats with little to no shift in functional traits; 3) a potentially new function for the nest in nest-forming epiphytes. Finally, our work highlights the need to consider intraspecific trait variation more carefully when studying ferns that occur across a wide range of habitats.",

Christensen's Index Filicum, Supplementum III (1934) and the best information available at the time, the correet name for the naturalized fern in Florida called Dryopteris setigera was Dryopteris uliginosa (Kunze) C. Chr. It now appears that this name is no longer tenable on two counts: It is a later homonym (dating from 1934) of Dryopteris uliginosa (A. Braun ex Doell) Druce (1908)2 and secondly an earlier specific epithet has been found in Polystichum Torresianum Gaud. (1828), the epithet uliginosa Kunze dating only from 1847. There is a further point, that regarding the correct generic name. In 1941 I was following Christensen in recognizing an inclusive genus Dryopteris, but information has accumulated since that time that indicates that all of these plants are not closely allied; some authors have even proposed that the thelypteroid group be separated into a different family from Dryopteris sens. strict. I agree at least to the extent of separating Dryopteris sens. strict. (as typified by the male fern, D. Filix-mas) from Thelypteris sens. lat. W. H. Wagner, Jr., was the first to identify Polystichum Torresianum with Dryopteris uliginosa (Kunze) C. Chr.3 He did not see the type of Torresianum and apparently no one else has examined it, but the original description agrees except for the statement that the hairs are sometimes branched; as Wagner points out, this was probably an error of observation, because branched hairs would hardly be found in any species of the type",

    "abstract": "About ten years ago, the U. S. National Museum lent a large number of unnamed specimens of tropical American Lycopodiums to Dr. W. Herter, the noted authority on the Lycopodiaceae. Dr. Herter found a number of new species among these collections, which he published in two papers, under the generic name Urostachys Herter. The generic name Urostachys, dating from 1922, is antedated by two or three older names for the same concept.' However, it does not seem to me either necessary or desirable to split up the genus Lycopodium, which certainly seems to be natural, although with plants as old as these and which offer so few characters it is hard to be sure. But I agree with Boivin,2 that if one begins to split up Lycopodium it will be necessary to recognize not just two genera but five or more, which is surely extreme, considering the inadequate present state of our knowledge of the gametophytes, life history, and anatomy of the species. Apparently, this group of Lycopodiumti is rich in species, for most of those described by Herter seem to be well founded. Many of the specific epithets chosen by Herter are fanciful, derived from the names of mythical personages (cassandrae, dianae, poseidonis) or stars (arcturi, capellae, stcllae-polaris, crucisaustralis) or both (castoris), but why not? There are too many humdrum hirsutums and acuminatums. In order to refer in identification lists and otherwise to the",

The estimates of outcrossing rates (tm = 1.200) indicate that diploid I. yunguiensis is a predominantly outcrossing species. Six selected AFLP primer pairs used in the study amplified 195 reproducible bands, 160 of which were polymorphic (PPB = 82.05%), indicating significant genetic diversity at the species level. AMOVA revealed that 40.12% of the genetic variation was attributable to differences between populations and the rest (59.88%) to variability within populations. High outcrossing rates and the historical accumulation of genetic variation may be responsible for the high levels of genetic diversity observed in the I. yunguiensis population. To maintain the current level of genetic diversity for this species, we recommend increasing in situ conservation sites.",

My collections from two subsequent Archbold expeditions-in the Territory of Papua in 1936-1937 and Dutch New Guinea in 1938-1939-have yielded 118 new species and the new genus Lepidocaulon described by Professor E. B. Copeland in various papers, and in addition a number of new records for the island of species previously known from other parts of Malaysia. Substantial contributions to the total of known species have been made by others in recent years, but by far the greater part of New Guinea remains quite untouched by botanical collectors. As early as 1934, according to Lam,2 970 species of Pteridophyta, including 597 endemic species, were known from the mainland and adjacent islands. New Guinea should be thought of as a great, diversified country rather than a mere island. Measuring 1500 miles in length and 450 in maximum width, its area of about 312,000 square miles is not much less than that of California, Oregon, and Washington combined and the high mountains of these states fall short by 2000 feet of the altitude of 16,500-foot Mount Carstensz in Dutch New Guinea.

The collections reported here were made in the rolling western portion of the county. McVaugh and Pyron, in their recently published Ferns of Georgia (1951), list nine species of pteridophytes from Lowndes County. This apparent paucity is due to lack of botanical exploration, not to scarcity of ferns, a situation that McVaugh and Pyron suggest may be true of many counties in the state. Unless otherwise stated, references to previous records are based upon Ferns of Georgia. The following list adds nine species and one form to the previously published records for Lowndes County.

Among these taxa, some of the most problematical are those which possess sori, i.e., unprotected sporangia following the veins (Bower, 1928). Some groups of gymnogrammoid species possess distinctive vegetative characteristics that separate them from other groups and seem to identity them as monophyletic assemblages, e.g., Jamesonia Hook. & Grev. with indeterminate, linear leaves. The generic placement of some species has been more difficult, however, and many species have been treated in as many as five genera throughout their taxonomic histories (e.g., see Ranker, 1989). One such challenging group has been the species variously associated with the genus Hemionitis L. Several workers have examined the relationships of Hemionitis species to those of Bommeria Fourn. Maxon (1913), Copeland (1947), and Haufler & Gastony (1978) all suggested that the two genera could be merged into one (although none did so nomenclaturally). Subsequent investigations (Giannasi, 1974, 1980; Giannasi & Mickel, 1979; Haufler & Giannasi, 1982) demonstrated the existence of two groups, based on leaf flavonoid composition, that crossed recognized generic boundaries (reviewed in Ranker, 1989). As a result of a systematic investigation of the intraand intergeneric relationships of Hemionitis (Ranker, 1987, 1989), a variety of morphological attributes were discovered which serve to distinguish two distinctive groups of species (Table 1). The character states listed for Hemionitis are shared by H. levyi",

    "abstract": "Recent studies of North American Lycopodiaceae are relatively few, but they have led to some major changes from the taxonomic treatments of the first half of this century (e.g., Eaton, 1890; Fernald, 1950). At the generic level, pteridologists generally agree that the classical genus Lycopodium comprises several distinct genera (0llgaard, 1987), but they do not generally agree as to how many segregate genera to recognize. At the specific level, pteridologists now generally agree that closely related taxa treated by previous workers as varieties of single species are better ranked as distinct species. In North America, examples of this change in rank can be found in the Huperzia selago group (Beitel, unpubl.), the Lycopodiella inundata group (Bruce, 1976), and the Lycopodium complanatum group (Wilce, 1965). This paper deals with the question of rank for a taxon in the L. obscurum group, commonly referred to as the ground pines or tree clubmosses. Over the years, pteridologists have disagreed as to what rank members of this group should receive. In 1803, a half century after Linnaeus described L. obscurum, Michaux distinguished a close relative, L. dendroideum. The former was colloquially referred to as the flat-branched tree clubmoss, the latter as the tree clubmoss due to their different phyllotaxies, orientation, and relative development of the leaves of different ranks. In 1890, D. C. Eaton placed L. dendroideum as a variety of L. obscurum without comment. This placement was followed by nearly all flora writers and writers of popular fern books during the first half of the 1900s. The situation changed when, from 1974 to 1978, Dr. R. James Hickey worked on the taxonomy of the L. obscurum group in North America and eastern Asia (Hickey, 1977, 1978). After detailed studies of geography, ecology, habit, and leaves of the central and lateral axes, he concluded that three species should be recognized: L. obscurum of eastern North America, L. dendroideum of northern North America and eastern Asia, and L. juniperoideum Sw. of eastern Asia. In addition, he concluded that a new variety of L. obscurum should also be recognized: var. isophyllum. The new variety resembled L. dendroideum by its equally spreading and equal-sized leaves which impart a cylindrical aspect to the branchlets. But the new variety more closely resembled L. obscurum by its phyllotaxy and its appressed leaves on the main erect stem below the first lateral branches. In essence, the new taxon was a round-branched variety of the flatbranched tree clubmoss. Hickey (1978) used the varietal category for his new",

    "abstract": "Micromorphological data are increasingly used in taxonomic and developmental studies of pteridophytes (e.g. Zimmer, 1989). Although gametophytic data are considerably scarcer in the literature than sporophytic data, it is clear that gametophytes have much to offer, and scanning electron micrographs of gametophytic features are becoming increasingly common. The majority of published micrographs show fixed, dehydrated material illustrating structural or developmental points (e.g. Elmore & Adams, 1976; von Aderkas & Cutter, 1983; Whittier & Peterson, 1984ab Nester, 1985). A smaller number have included similarly processed material to illustrate taxonomic features (e.g. Tigerschiold, 1985, 1989). A few studies have employed low-temperature (or cryo-) scanning electron microscopy (LTSEM) (e.g. Sheffield & Cutter, 1985; Sheffield & Farrar, 1988; Douglas & Sheffield, 1990) and one study included quantitative and qualitative comparisons of gametophytic material processed by conventional and low temperature methods (Attree & Sheffield, 1984). While it is clear that LTSEM offers superior preservation of delicate specimens, there are disadvantages with all existing SEM techniques. Low temperature work requires specialized, expensive equipment, and although free from the shrinkage and distortion seen in conventionally-prepared gametophytes, LTSEM specimens are not artefact-free (e.g. Jeffree et al., 1987; Moss, Howard & Sheffield, 1989). All the methods employed for gametophyte material to date are also destructive; the tissue cannot be used for any other purpose subsequent to micrograph production. An investigation is in progress in this laboratory involving the cultivation of soil samples containing natural fern spore banks. A desire to obtain micromorphological and electrophoretic information from single gametophytes in such cultures prompted the present investigation. Our aim was to find a non-destructive method of obtaining good quality scanning electron micrographs, based on modifications by Jernstedt et al. (1991) of the method of Williams, Vesk & Mullins (1987) and Williams & Green (1988).",

    "abstract": "Plants can reduce competition for limited resources by chemically inhibiting the growth and development of other species (allelopathy). In moist environments, the inhibitory chemicals are leached from growing or senescent leaves by rainfall, are exuded from the roots, or result from decomposition of the plant (Rice, 1984). Most studies of allelopathy in pteridophytes have focused on the effect of fern species on angiosperms. For example, Gliessman & Muller (1978) found in southern California meadows that toxins from Pteridium aquilinum severely affected some species of herbs and annual grasses while not affecting or only slightly affecting others. Of the few investigations of allelopathy among fern species, even fewer have focused on species which are found in the same general habitat. Two studies involving species found in the same general habitat investigated chemical interactions at the gametophyte stage of the life cycle. Bell (1958) found that various extracts of prothalli from Dryopteris filix-mas inhibited germination or reduced growth in D. borreri gametophytes; Petersen & Fairbrothers (1980) found that gametophytes of Osmunda cinnamomea reduced growth in Dryopteris intermedia gametophytes and that D. intermedia gametophytes reduced growth in 0. cinnamomea gametophytes. Other studies of species found in the same general habitat looked at the effect of the sporophyte on the gametophyte stage of the life cycle. Bell & Klickoff (1979) discovered that sporophytes of Polystichum acrosticoides, Polypodium vulgare, and Onoclea sensibilis reduced gametophyte growth for all species but P. vulgare. Munther & Fairbrothers (1980) found autotoxic as well as allelopathic inhibition of spore germination from sporophytes of Osmunda cinnamomea, 0. claytonia (no allelopathic effects), and Dennstaedtia punctilobula. All of the species used in these studies, although found in the same general habitat, do not generally occur in close proximity. This paper reports on an experiment performed to determine the allelopathic effect of sporophytes of Osmunda cinnamomea on the number and growth rate of gametophytes of Dryopteris carthusiana, D. cristata, and D. goldiana. 0. cinnamomea grows in close proximity with D. carthusiana and D. cristata but not with D. goldiana. 0. cinnamomea is, however, found in the same general habitat as D. goldiana. Both of the experiments with 0. cinnamomea mentioned above showed allelopathic effects on Dryopteris and other species (Munther & Fairbrothers, 1980; Petersen & Fairbrothers, 1980). Cinnamic acid and benzoic acid derivatives, which have been implicated as allelopathic agents in a number of studies (Rice, 1984), have been found in 0. cinnamomea (Bohm & Tryon, 1967).",

    "abstract": "Breeding systems have a significant influence on the genetic structure of populations (Allard et al., 1968; Baker, 1953; Jain, 1976; Wright, 1969). Many species of flowering plants exhibit mechanisms that prevent self-fertilization or increase the probability of cross-fertilization. These mechanisms usually function in the sporophyte generation and include heterostyly, dichogamy, and dioecy. In pteridophytes, the mating system is a function of the gametophyte generation. Unlike flowering plants, homosporous pteridophytes are faced with a potentially major evolutionary constraint due to the loss of genetic variation in progeny after a single generation of intragametophytic selfing. Klekowski (1972, 1973) hypothesized that homosporous taxa evolved a polyploid genetic system coupled with homoeologous chromosome pairing to compensate for the loss of variability due to selfing. The evidence that has accumulated to date suggests that this type of genetic system is not operative in most species (Buckley et al., 1985; Haufler, 1985). Analysis of genetic variation of sporophytes in natural populations by expression of recessive lethal genes and isozyme marker loci indicates that intragametophytic selfing and the resulting homozygosity are rare. Mating systems in ferns are controlled both intragametophytically and intergametophytically. Intragametophytic factors include the temporal and spacial arrangement of gametangia and the presence of recessive lethal genes that prevent zygote development. Variations of gametangial development and occurrence include male to hermaphroditic, female to hermaphroditic, initially hermaphroditic, and sequentially unisexual. Intergametophytic factors are populational phenomena that relate to sex expression (e.g., dioecy, antheridiogens) and the density and availability of sperms. Of the intragametophytic factors, protandry (male to hermaphroditic gametangial sequence) has been hypothesized to have the greatest probability of intragametophytic selfing (Lloyd, 1974a). The recent discovery of a recessive mutant allele for chloroplast packing in Acrostichum danaeifolium Langsd. & Fischer has provided an opportunity to test the probability of selfing in gametophytes with a male to hermaphroditic gametangial sequence.",

Rosenstock (1906, p. 60) treated this species as a variety of G. bifida and made the combination based on Sturm's name. Rosenstock did not study any of Sturm's type material, but his brief description agrees with the usual circum- scription of the name. Our studies have shown that this taxon is an independent species and one lacking a correct name in Sticherus. Therefore, we propose:",

    "abstract": "We observed mapped individuals of three species of Botrychium Sw. at a single site in Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta for six years. Our study showed that the interspecific sterile hybrid, B. xwatertonense W.H. Wagner and its putative parents, B. hesperium Maxon & R.T. Clauson and B. paradoxum W.H. Wagner, are stable, unique genotypic entities. For B. hes- perium and B. Xwatertonense, the degree of sporophore pinnation and the number of trophophore pinnae are plastic characters with much of the observed variation explained by the size of the plants. Although B. Xwatertonense is reported to be sterile, most sporophytes appeared more than 4 cm from other conspecifics, indicating that they are probably not produced vegetatively. Mean height of B. Xwatertonense was greater than that of either of its parents, indicating hybrid vigor. Many members of the Botrychium subg. Botrychium are considered rare (Lellinger, 1985). Nine species in the continental United States are can- didates for listing as threatened or endangered species under the Federal En- dangered Species Act of 1973 (USDI-Fish and Wildlife Service, 1993), and nine species are listed as rare in Canada (Argus and Pryer, 1990). Often rare species occur together with more common species in genus (Wagner and Wagner, 1983). However, these communities are natural common garden experiments and can be a tool to evaluate the discreteness of conge- neric species growing together. Species that maintain their morphological dif- ferences in communities are evidence that these differences are genet- ically fixed. The sterility of interspecific hybrids is additional evidence of ge- netic differentiation between the parent species (Wagner and Wagner, 1983). Members of Botrychium are often difficult to differentiate because the plants are simple and offer few characters for recognizing species (Cody and Britton, 1989). Furthermore, intraspecific variation in leaf shape within and among populations and among years is not well understood (Graham and Wagner, 1991). Keys to the taxa of Botrychium subg. Botrychium include sporophore and trophophore characters (Wagner and Wagner, 1986), but the range of vari- ation among species for these characters is often not known. The number of hybrids found in communities is usually very small (Wagner, 1991). One reason for the paucity of hybrids may be the low fre- quency of intergametophytic fertilizations (Soltis and Soltis, 1986). However, at the B. Xwatertonense type locality studied by Wagner et al. (1984), almost 25% of the plants were sterile hybrids. The reason for this high frequency of",

This is a fairly modest number of novelties; the percentage will be much greater in Mexico, southern Central America, and the Andes from Venezuela to Bolivia. Because of the large number of species in the genus (over 500), the complexities of their taxonomy, the very few regional treatments, and the lack of a usable monograph, the taxonomy of the genus is in chaos and a modern treatment is sorely needed. Efforts to correct this situation are currently underway. Elaphoglossum apodum var. latum Mickel, var. nov. A var. apodo lamina late nec anguste oblanceolata differt.

Tod. by Marengo (1973). It is of interest to establish the ultrastructure of the cells formed at the termination of the second meiotic division. Marengo (1949) reported that cytoplasmic inclusions resolvable by light microscopy apparently disappeared during spore enlargement and that proplastids and plastids made their appearance as the large vacuole was replaced by more cytoplasm. To establish the identity of cytoplasmic inclusions received from the meiocyte and to elucidate the fine structure of the young spore, an electron microscope study was made of a sporangium shown by thick sections to contain young spores just separating from the tapetum (Fig. 1, T). Individual sporangia dissected from young fertile fronds were fixed in glutaraldehyde followed by osmium tetroxide and embedded in Epon (Spurr, 1969). 0.5 /um sections were cut from individual sporangia and examined by phase contrast microscopy without staining. From a sporangium identified as having spores at the desired stage, thin sections were cut with a diamond knife, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined with an Hitachi HU-11A EM. Identifiable inclusions present in the young spore shown in Figs. I and 2 include lipid droplets (L), amyloplasts (A), and mitochrondria (M). Small vacuoles (V) are present, as well as a loosely organized endoplasmic reticulum. At this stage, the spore nucleus appears to have not yet reached full interphase, since a nucleolus is not present and the nuclear membrane (Fig. 2, NM) is poorly defined. The mature spore of this species has a nucleolus occupying fully onethird of the nuclear cross-section (Marengo, 1956). It is hoped that the optical disappearance and re-appearance of inclusions in the enlarging spore can be followed with ultrastructural techniques. Properly buffered fixative may allow preservation of stages plasmolyzed by the fixatives of light microscopy. Older sporangia are to be dealt with in the next phase of this study.",

    "abstract": "Based on the morphological characters of the sporophyte and gametophyte, palynological evidence, and spore germination patterns seen in whole mount preparations, the genera Anogramma, Bommeria, Gymnopteris, Hemionitis, and Pityrogramma have been assigned to different families by fern taxonomists. Bower (1928) included these genera in the group designated as gymnogrammoid ferns, whereas Christensen (1938) placed all except Gymnopteris in the polypodiaceous group. Copeland (1947), however, regarded these genera as part of the complex group of pteroid ferns. Holttum (1949) followed Bower in his conception of gymnogrammoid ferns and combined the gymnogrammoid and vittarioid ferns of Bower into the family Adiantaceae. Nayar (1970) placed Anogramma in the Adiantaceae, Bommeria, Hemionitis, and Gymnopteris in the Cheilanthaceae and Pityrogramma in the Pteridaceae, whereas Crabbe et al. (1975) treated all five genera as members of the Adiantaceae. According to Haufler and Gastony (1978), gametophytes of Bommeria and Hemionitis responded differently from those of Anogramma and Pityrogramma to antheridiogen A, the male sex hormone isolated from the gametophytes of Pteridium aquilinum, to merit their further subgrouping. Previous light microscopic studies (Endress, 1974; Raghavan & Huckaby, 1980; Huckaby & Raghavan, 1981a; Rutter & Raghavan, 1978) on the orientation of the initial cell divisions during germination of spores of certain ferns using techniques generally employed in electron microscopy (fixation in an aldehyde fixative and embedding in glycol methacrylate plastic) have contradicted earlier work on spores of the same ferns based on whole mount preparations. Comparative studies of spore germination in Anemia, Lygodium, and Mohria (Schizaeaceae) (Raghavan & Huckaby, 1980) and in Cyathea and Dicksonia (Huckaby & Raghavan, 198 la) have also demonstrated the value of the early division sequence during spore germination as a stable taxonomic criterion in defining affinities of problematic genera. In view of the disagreement among pteridologists on the relationships of Anogramma, Bommeria, Gymnopteris, Hemionitis, and Pityrogramma, the present work is aimed at evaluating the importance of spore germination patterns in these genera as studied by moder histological techniques and in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) as a new source of taxonomic evidence.",

Since a light microscopic study of this species by the author (1949) showed an apparent decrease in size of cytoplasmic inclusions from the sporangium initial to the spore mother cell, it is of interest to elucidate these changes on the ultrastructural level. Individual sporangia dissected from young fertile fronds were routinely fixed in glutaraldehyde followed by osmium tetroxide and embedded in Epon (Spurr, 1969). Sections 0.5um thick were cut from individual sporangia and were examined by phase contrast microscopy without staining. From sporangia identified as containing pre-meiotic stages in sporogenesis, thin sections were cut with a diamond knife, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined with an Hitachi HU11A electron microscope. The sporangial initials (Fig. 1) appear to contain large, osmiophilic bodies (Fig. 1, t) which resemble closely the tannin accumulations described by Ledbetter and Porter (1970). The appearance of vacuoles (v) within these bodies is followed by their disappearance in the later stages of sporogenesis, including newly formed spores. Mitochondria (m) appear hardly larger than those in later stages and in newly formed spores. Their internal structure, however, differs from that of mitochondria in newly formed spores. Cristae appear not to be shelf-like, but rather mitochondrial material separated by internal cavities. This peculiar and distinctive internal structure persists through at least the early prophase of meiosis (Fig. 6,m), following which their cristae extend as plates, continuous across the mitochondrion (Marengo, 1977). The osmiophilic bodies are still present in early sporogenous cells (Fig. 2,t), with an occasional vacuole apparently replacing the tannin mass (Fig. 2, v). By the time the sporogenous cells approach the rounded-up meiocyte stage, the osmiophilic bodies have disappeared and lipid droplets appear in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3,L). In the dividing sporogenous cell in anaphase (Fig. 4), the mitochondria appear concentrated in the polar regions of the spindle. The distribution of mitochondria at mitotic anaphase appears to contrast markedly with that of the meiotic anaphase I, where the mitochondria are concentrated at the edge of the spindle preparatory to invading it, and form the mitochondrial plate characteristic of interphase following the first division as well as all phases of the second meiotic division (Marengo, 1949, 1977). In the early prophase of the first meiotic division (Fig. 5), spore mother cell polarity is reflected in a concentration of mitochondria at the base of a barely",

    "abstract": "As the gametophyte morphology of various fern groups has become better known during the past several decades, it has become increasingly apparent that gametophytes provide dependable morphological criteria for taxonomic and phyletic studies. Bower (1923-28) and Holttum (1949) pointed out that the comparative morphology of fern gametophytes can be of significance in understanding different phyletic groups. Stokey (1951, 1960), Atkinson and Stokey (1964), and Nayar and Kaur (1968, 1969, 1971) discussed the role of fer gametophytes in taxonomic and phyletic studies. According to Nayar and Kaur (1968, 1969), the patterns of spore germination and gametophyte development characterize various taxonomic groups, and so provide dependable data for comparative morphology. Nayar (1954, 1961, 1965), Nayar and Kachroo (1953), and Bajpai (1964) studied gametophyte morphology of some drynarioid ferns. Until now, no detailed studies of the gametophytes of the monotypic genus Drynariopsis have been made, although Nayar (1965) reported that Drynariopsis gametophytes show Drynariatype development. This study of Drynariopsis heraclea gametophyte development was made to compare the gametophytes of this primitive genus with those of other drynarioid ferns. Spores were collected from the fernery of the Natural Science Research Center, University of the Philippines. Gametophytes were raised on sterilized Knop's nutrient agar medium in petri dishes (Nayar, 1962). The cultures were maintained at 24+ 2? C under 600 ft-c of light from four fluorescent lamps placed horizontally above the culture dishes. All observations on morphology and development of the gametophytes are based on these laboratory cultures. To study cellular structure, the gametophytes were mounted in an acetocarmine solution, which induced partial plasmolysis of the cells and so rendered the cell outlines clear. Drawings were made using a camera lucida.",

    "abstract": "Equisetum variegatum Schleich., the Variegated Scouring-rush, occurs northward from the northern tier of states of the United States into Canada, on damp sand or shores, often on calcareous substrate (Fernald, 1950; Wherry, 1961). This paper reports the first verified record of E. variegatum from New Jersey and discusses a dubious record from that state. The hybrid E. x trachyodon A. Br. is also reported for New Jersey. Equisetum variegatum was listed for New Jersey by Taylor (1915) and Fernald (1950), but not by Chrysler and Edwards (1947), Wherry (1961), or Hauke (1963). The record for New Jersey was apparently based on an undated specimen collected by C. F. Austin, labeled Bergen Chrysler and Edwards (1947) disallowed this record, indicating that E. variegatum and E. pratense were motnted on one sheet and concluding that E. variegatum was mounted by mistake with E. pratense. Further investigation by the author showed that there are specimens of many pteridophytes from New Jersey collected by C. F. Austin, usually labeled only Bergen and without dates or specific locality. A total of 36 species of the more common northeastern ferns and fern allies are represented at CHRB or NY by such collections. It is interesting that specimens of plants known to be difficult to grow or transplant (e.g., Lycopodium spp., Botrychium spp. other than B. dissectun?) are lacking. I suggest, therefore, that at least some of these C. F. Austin collections represent garden plants which were originally collected at various places in western New Jersey and probably elsewhere. This conclusion is supported by the fact that, in addition to the mixed collection of E. variegatum and E. pratense, there is a sheet of E. fluviatile at NY with labels from both Bergen and St. Lawrence Co., NY, and another undated sheet of E. pratense labeled and Sparta. I agree with Chrysler and Edwards that the record for E. variegatum from Closter, Bergen Co. is highly suspect. Other Closter records by this collector without specific location or date are likewise dubious. A hybrid involving E. variegatum has been known from New Jersey since at least 1950: E. x trachyodon is the hybrid between E. variegatum and E. hyemale L. As far as is known from herbarium records, this hybrid was first collected by J. L. Edwards along the Delaware River, near Flatbrookville, Sussex Co., 28 October 1950 (CHRB, NY). On 19 August 1977, Vincent Abraitys collected plants of E. variegatum near Marksboro, Warren Co. I came across this material in connection with a project to revise the Chrysler and Edwards book. Material was sent to Dr. Richard Hauke, who verified the identification.",

    "abstract": "Isoetes butleri Engelm. occurs in Georgia (Boynton, 1902), Tennessee, Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Oklahoma (Pfeiffer, 1922; Fernald, 1950), Alabama (Reed, 1965; Kral, 1973), and Kentucky (Baskin & Baskin, 1978). Throughout its range it is restricted to shallow soils over limestone. In Tennessee, I. butleri is restricted to cedar (limestone) glades of the Central Basin and occurs in very shallow soils that range from 5 to 10 cm deep down to bedrock. In the Isoetes habitat, these shallow soils are waterlogged much of the time from late autumn to mid-spring, but frequently are below the wilting coefficient during the remainder of the year (Freeman, 1933). Common associates of . butleri in the Tennessee cedar glades include Leavenworthia spp., Nothoscordum bivalve (L.) Britt., Ophioglossum engelmannii Prantl, Sporobolus vaginiflorus (Torr.) Wood, and Scutellaria parvula Michx. In the middle Tennessee cedar glades, leaves of . butleri come above the soil surface in early to mid-March, and microand megasporangia develop on the adaxial surfaces of the leaf bases in early to mid-April. Senescence of the leaves begins in mid-May, and by mid-June the leaves as well as the roots are dead. By this time, the spores are mature. The corms remain in an inactive (quiescent) state in the soil until autumn, when growth of new roots and leaves is initiated. Growth of new roots begins in early October and is soon followed by leaf growth. By mid October, roots are 0.5-3 cm long and leaves are 0.5-1.5 cm long. Roots continue to grow until mid November, but there is little additional leaf growth until the following spring, when the leaves emerge above the soil surface. Thus, the timing of the vegetative life cycle in 1. butleri is one of the physiological adaptations that allows this drought-intolerant species to persist in its summer-dry, winter-wet habitat. In this study we investigated the role of temperature in regulating the timing of root and leaf growth in the vegetative life cycle of/. butleri.",

    "abstract": "In an earlier paper by Bloom (1962), dealing with rhizoid formation in unfertilized megagametophytes of Marsilea, it was suggested that rhizoid formation is a geotropic response involving an endogenous auxin. It was suggested that the auxin becomes concentrated in the ventral region of the gametophyte plant as a result of gravitational force. As a result of a series of experiments conducted in our laboratories, further evidence has been gathered to confirm the roles of auxins and gravitational forces in determining rhizoid formation. Maravolo and Voth (1966) have reported that gemmalings of Marchantia normally form ventral rhizoids on new tissue, but that when exogenous auxins are applied and reach a threshold concentration on the dorsal surface, rhizoids form there as well. The number of rhizoids formed was reported to be proportional to the concentration of the exogenous auxin. Miller and Miller (1964) reported effects of auxins on cell enlargement in fern gametophytes of Onoclea sensibilis, but did not report any observations of unusual effects on rhizoid formation. Kelley and Postlethwait (1962) studied the effects of the plant growth substance 2-chloroethyltrimethyl-ammonium chloride on gametophytes of Pteridium aquilinum and noted an effect on the time sequence of rhizoid production, but did not report any unusual effect on the position of the rhizoids formed. If auxins are indeed involved in rhizoid formation in the megagametophytes of Marsilea and if a higher concentration of auxin at the ventral sites is a response to gravitational force, certain predictions can be made concerning the effect of the application of exogenous auxins to the megagametophytes. In diverse processes auxins are generally stimulatory at certain concentrations and inhibitory at higher concentrations (Leopold, 1964). It could be predicted that rhizoid formation would be inhibited at high concentrations of exogenous auxins and stimulated at low concentrations. An additive effect could be expected if exogenous auxins are applied at very low concentrations. To test the above hypotheses the following experiments were conducted. Mineral nutrient solutions were prepared using Hoagland's No. 2 solution as given by Hoagland and Arnon (1938), with appropriate micronutrients added. Separate solutions were prepared by adding indole-3-acetic acid, napthalene acetic acid, or gibberellic acid in amounts to provide concentrations by weight of one part in 10,000 (10-4), 100,000 (10-5), 1,000,000 (10-6), and 10,000,000 (10-7). Plain agar was added at a concentration of 1.5% to each solution and the solutions were autoclaved and poured into sterile 100 X 15 mm plastic Petri dishes. Sporocarps of Marsilea mucronata were hydrated in deionized water. As soon as the megaspores were free they were transferred to the surface of the agar plates. Organic materials other than agar were not included in the media since the mega-",

    "abstract": "The Oak Ferns, represented in the United States by Gymnocarpium dryopteris, G. robertianum, and their putative hybrid, have been placed in many different genera. Some authors have placed them in the genus Dryopteris, primarily on the basis of similarities in rachis characters and rhizome scaliness. Others have included them with the Beech Ferns (Phegopteris). The Beech Ferns and the Oak Ferns have in common an elongate creeping rhizome and exindusiate sori (Morton, 1950). Slosson placed them both in the cosmopolitan genus Thelypteris, along with the Marsh Ferns (Wherry, 1961, p. 64). Ching (1933) proposed that the Oak Ferns be regarded as a genus distinct from Phegopteris, and he redefined Gymnocarpium. Currently most workers appear to favor this interpretation; however, other combinations are frequently used, particularly in local and regional floras. Cytological studies have shown a similarity in chromosome size between the Oak Ferns and the Beech Ferns; however, the number differs. The base number of 40 is found in the Oak Ferns (Wagner, 1966). The Broad Beech Fern and the Long Beech Fern have numbers of 30 and 90, respectively (Britton, 1965; Manton, 1950, p. 184). True Dryopteris has a base number of 41 chromosomes (Walker, 1961; 1962). These chromosomes tend to be somewhat larger than those of either the Beech or the Oak Ferns. Chromosome numbers vary within the genus Thelypteris; however, none reported correspond with that of the Oak Ferns. In recent years paper chromatography has gained acceptance as a taxonomic method. Most of the studies have involved taxa at or below the species level. The works of Smith and Levin (1963), Alston and Turner (1963), and others have indicated chromatography to be of particular value in the confirmation of interspecific hybridization. Works with higher taxa have concerned primarily the distribution and occurrence of specific compounds (Kupchan et al. 1961; Mabry et al. 1963). Cellulose acetate electrophoresis has been used in animal taxonomy (Leviton et al. 1964). No reports were located of comparable comparative studies in plants, though immunoelectrophoresis studies have been done with various plant taxa (Gell et al. 1956). This study was undertaken to add further information concerning the status of the Oak Ferns by the consideration of biochemical characteristics, and to explore the value of paper chromatography and cellulose acetate electrophoresis in generic problems. Chromatographs and electrophoretographs of extracts from the Oak Ferns were compared with those of representatives of the Beech Ferns, the Marsh Ferns (Thelypteris), and the Wood Ferns (Dryopteris).",

    "abstract": "The subject of fern leaf venation is a very old topic and it has been dealt with by many authors during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Most of the discussions of fern leaf venation concentrate on its qualitative aspects resulting in descriptions of various types of leaf venation. Considerably less attention has been devoted to the quantitative aspects of fern leaf vascularization. This report will give a brief summary of some of the measurable aspects of the vascular system within the leaves of certain rather common ferns. The collections of the ferns used in this study came from two sources. Those collected out-of-doors came from Giant City State Park or from Jackson Hollow, six miles northeast of Simpson, Illinois. Material was taken with the permission and under the supervision of Dr. Robert H. Mohlenbrock of Southern Illinois University. Other ferns were obtained from the Department of Botany greenhouse at the University of Nebraska. The fern leaves were studied from slides made of cross sections of the material which had been stained with Delafield's hematoxylin and safranin. Whole mounts of cleared leaves or leaflets or parts of these were also studied to obtain vein patterns and angle of branching. All measurements recorded in this study were made by means of an ocular micrometer. All those listed in Table I are averages of many separate measurements. Leaf thickness was measured at veins rather than between veins. Intervascular interval was measured from the vascular tissue of one bundle to the vascular tissue of the next adjacent bundle; thus it includes any specialized parenchyma or bundle sheath cells. Vein width includes only the width of the conductive tissues of a vascular bundle. Angle of branching refers to the branching of vascular bundles from the midvein of the leaf or segment and not to the ultimate branchings in the lamina. It was measured in linear units and the angle 87",

Holloway (1916) found that the vascular cylinders of New Zealand lycopods exhibited specific stelar patterns. He thought that the cortical sclerenchyma affected stelar arrangement and that the presence of this tissue could be responsible for imparting rigidity and lateral pressures to the stele. This rigidity and lateral pressure support the stele in such a way that the xylem elements become more definitely arranged in groups or bands. Later, Holloway (1919) concluded that there were two basic patterns in which the xylem elements were arranged; these patterns also appeared to be associated with the leaf trace system: (i) the mixed type in which the leaf trace system extends beyond the cauline vascular cylinder and (ii) the banded or parallel type in which the vascular cylinder becomes strongly developed and the leaf traces affx themselves to it. He interpreted the banded type as a specialization of a radial pattern that was caused by a restriction on the stem in monopodial branching. Holloway also associated stelar patterns with prothallus type: short-lived prothalli were characteristic of the mixed type of vascular cylinder and long-lived prothalli of the banded pattern. He noted that these differences were exhibited in all the species of Lycopodium",

    "abstract": "Hawaii is home to four species in the fern genus Diplazium: Diplazium arnottii, D. esculentum, D. molokaiense, and D. sandwichianum. Three are endemic to the Hawaiian Islands, and one is introduced and naturalized (D. esculentum). They vary in frequency, from very abundant (D. sandwichianum) to rare and critically endangered (D. molokaiense). Prior to this work, the phylogenetic relationships of only D. esculentum had been estimated due to lack of information available about these species. In this study, we inferred phylogenetic relationships of the Hawaiian Diplazium based on six chloroplast regions – atpA, atpB, matK, rbcL, rps4+rps4–trnS IGS, and trnL intron+trnL–trnF IGS. We downloaded these plastid markers from GenBank for an additional 83 Diplazium species and two Athyrium species, and used the latter as outgroups. The resulting phylogeny inferred from combined data indicated that D. arnottii and D. sandwichianum are sister taxa, likely with origins in the Paleotropics. Morphologically, the two species can be distinguished by leaf dissection and lengths of sori. Diplazium molokaiense is sister to the Asian D. heterocarpum (among our sampled taxa). Diplazium molokaiense is distinguished from other species in the clade by its large sori and longer fronds. Our results reveal the phylogenetic placements of three Diplazium species and corroborate the placement of a fourth species.",

Stelar architecture has attracted much attention, in part, due to its diversity in the fern lineage as well as its use as a stable taxonomic character for circumscribing species, genera, families, or larger informal clades. One aspect of stelar morphology that has garnered specific attention is polystely: the development of multiple concentric cylinders of vasculature. This feature has evolved in lineages throughout the fern phylogeny, including in the genus Pteris L. (Pteridaceae). Here, I describe a polycyclic solenostele as a new synapomorphy for Pteris sect. Litobrochia. The identification of this character as a synapomorphy furthers our understanding of the morphological evolution and circumscription of Pteris as well as aides in species identification within this speciose genus.",

We leverage coding and non-coding DNA sequences from the chloroplast and nucleus to elucidate the allopolyploid origins of the three species. Consistent with, and building upon earlier works, we find evidence that the páramo tetraploid most recently named as Polystichum orbiculatum is derived from two distinct Andean progenitors, P. lilianiae is derived from two Mayan progenitors, and P. talamancanum is derived from one Andean and one Mayan progenitor. The Costa Rican polyploids incorporate the legacy of the Andean and Mayan regions into their genomes, forming new lineages with novel genotypes.",

An unusual site in the Piedmont of northeast Georgia was found to harbor two species of nonnative ferns that have clearly become naturalized. A third species at the site represents the appearance in a natural setting of another nonnative fern species whose cultivars and hybrids are being more widely planted as ornamentals. Examination of herbarium specimens from Georgia and the Southeastern United States clarified the status of some earlier records and some overlooked records, based on misidentifications or questionable status as naturalized. The species involved (Arachniodes simplicior, Polystichum polyblepharum, and Anisocampium niponicum (=Athyrium niponicum)) are all introductions from temperate regions in East Asia and probably represent escapes from cultivation via spores. The appearance of these species in natural communities raises questions about their potential to spread farther and to become pests by crowding out native flora. The invasive potential of these three species and five other species discussed in a previous paper is evaluated based on field observations as well as information about their status as an epiphyte or ground dweller, reproductive plasticity, ecological requirements, and popularity as horticultural ornamentals.",

Wagner, Jr.,2 that the well-known Asplenium pinnatifidum is a fertile tetraploid (allopolyploid) derived by the crossing of Asplenium montanum and Camptosorus rhizophyllus. This being so, it is quite likely that this crossing is taking place de novo occasionally, and that some plants of A. pinnatifidum found in the wild may be sterile diploid hybrids, the result of recent hybridization and not the descendants of preexisting plants of A. pinnatifidum. A condition similar to this has been shown by Dr. Wagner to exist in A. ebenoides, for the Alabama population of this is a fullfledged species, being a fertile tetraploid, whereas plants occurring elsewhere are newly formed, sterile diploid hybrids. Dr. Wagner has indicated that other Aspleniums also, such as A. Trudellii, A. Gravesii, and A. kentuckiense, have some Camptosorus blood in them, being crosses of pinnatifidum. As I pointed out in my review of Wagner's paper,3 these facts point up a serious nomenclatural difficulty.

The distribution in the southern 16 counties of Illinois is given for the rarer species. Probably the first person to collect pteridophytes to any extent in southern Illinois, particularly Jackson County, was George Hazen French, during the period between 1870-1885, although Frederick Brendel in 1860 and George Vasey in 1862 had made some collections in Johnson, Union, and Jackson Counties. A. B. Seymour, in 1880 and 1881, collected in Jackson and Union Counties. It was he who discovered the only known station in southern Illinois for the New York Fern (Dryopteris noveboracensis). During the same period, F. S. Earle was making collections around Cobden (Union County). In 1919, E. J. Palmer botanized extensively in Gallatin, Pope, Alexander, and Hardin Counties, finding, for the first time in Illinois, Ophioglossum engelmannii Prantl. Following Palmer came southern Illinois' most ardent student of ferns, Miss Mary Steagall. Associated with Southern Illinois Normal University (now Southern Illinois University), Miss Steagall collected many specimens of ferns throughout the area, concentrating particularly on parts of Jackson and Pope Counties. It was in the latter county that she discovered the rare Filmy Fern (Trichomanes boschianum). During 1940 and 1941, John McCree collected a large number of specimens in southern Illinois, although the bulk of his collections was angiosperms. Between 1947 and 1951, a study of the vegetation of southern Illinois was undertaken by William M. Bailey and Julius R. 143",

Here, we examine the backbone of this large and heterogeneous lineage using both phylotranscriptomic methods and a more focused, curated approach. We find that Pteridoideae and Parkerioideae are together sister to the rest of Pteridaceae and that Cryptogrammoideae is sister to Vittarioideae plus Cheilanthoideae. We find independent support from our phylotranscriptomic analyses, published cytological data, and genomic distributions of substitutions per site for several whole-genome duplication (WGD) events within Pteridaceae, mainly in Vittarioideae and Cheilanthoideae. However, the various inference methods gave differing approximations for the placement of WGD events within each clade. This study demonstrates that phylotranscriptomic analyses, which employ large datasets at the cost of requiring simpler models and potentially a greater risk of systematic error, can be used in concert with more curated approaches to resolve deep phylogenetic relationships. It also provides an example of the difficulty of confidently inferring ancient WGD event placement, even when using multiple methods.",

The goal of this work was to document a set of morphological observations from the gametophytes of six different species collected in situ. We discovered identifiable gametophyte populations of Elaphoglossum latifolium, Hymenophyllum myriocarpoum, Lomariopsis maxonii, Polypodium dulce, Polytaenium cajenense, and Sticherus bifidus during the 2022 OTS Tropical Ferns and Lycophytes course in Costa Rica.

Congeneric species that occupy similar niches in distinct geographic ranges but whose native ranges narrowly overlap present an eco-evolutionary conundrum: How can species evolved to occupy similar niches in distinct ranges coexist? Research suggests that for a stable coexistence the species should differ at least subtly in their ecological niches, otherwise their coexistence would be unstable. We investigated whether these bracken species share a habitat and co-occur locally, and whether their coexistence is predicted to be stable. We surveyed bracken populations from seven sites at Archbold Biological Station (Venus, Florida, USA) and characterized their biotic and abiotic microhabitat. Both bracken species co-occur at three sites. The two species showed significantly different trends in canopy cover and in response to fire frequency, and they grew at different densities and biomass. These results suggest these two bracken species coexist stably by occupying distinct ecological niches.",

Here we focus on potential threats of invasive earthworms introduced from Europe and Asia on the threatened American hart's-tongue fern (Asplenium scolopendrium var. americanum). Earthworms are ecosystem engineers that alter physical and chemical soil properties and can trigger cascading effects on plant and soil communities. Using a paired field sampling and mesocosm study approach, we sought to assess the potential impact of earthworms to A. scolopendrium. We sampled earthworms at eight A. scolopendrium populations in New York State and documented widespread occurrence of a diversity of invasive earthworms in seven fern populations. Fern populations exist mid-slope and earthworm biomass was higher upslope than within or downslope of fern populations. In a two-year mesocosm experiment we evaluated impacts of two epi-endogeic earthworms (Lumbricus rubellus and Metaphire hilgendorfi) on A. scolopendrium gametophytes and young sporophytes by adding earthworm treatments to potted plants and following growth and survival of fern transplants. While L. rubellus reduced gametophyte survival and number of leaves produced by transplanted ferns, we found no effect of M. hilgendorfi on survival, number of leaves or leaf size. Our findings indicate negative, but limited, impacts of one invasive earthworm species on fern early life stages. Our results suggest that impacts on existing fern populations could be low, as few earthworms were detected within fern populations. Continued assessment of earthworm invasions and other associated stressors is necessary to inform future management and conservation efforts to facilitate A. scolopendrium recovery.",

Just a look at the stems would have prevented this mistake, for even the manuals mention the obscure joint near the base of the stipe of the latter species. Things did not always run smoothly, and there were critical moments when some of us hardly knew where to get off. The detailed account of these moments should remain in the unwritten history of the Society, because peace was made after each period of hostilities, and probably the majority of the did not know there had been any altercations. Indeed, there are but few left from the early days. The list of May, 1920, shows just eight who joined in 1895 or before, and only 36 more who came in between that year and the end of 1902. This total of 44 is not a large proportion of the flourishing society of one hundred or more members which Mr. Winslow discovered in that year. It is a much smaller proportion of the 264 in the latest list.",

Unfortunately my work was greatly interrupted by the war, and in the final revision of the manuscript I totally forgot this species. Mr. William R. Maxon had, however, come to the same conclusion as to its relationship and he on his own initiative, sent me very recently a portion of the type of P. cryptum together with parts of other specimens collected by Shafer in 1910. An examination of these plants shows at once that the species must be referred to the subgenus Goniopteris. It may therefore be called: Dryopteris crypta (Underw. & Maxon) C. Chr. & Maxon, comb. nov.

Not until the fall of 1919 was this privilege given me. Two years before I had tried for a passport, but as the war was on, and as all ablebodied men were needed at home, it was refused me. But in October, 1919, I succeeded in getting Lansing's signature to the necessary papers. Early on the morning of the 26th I left Mobile on the L. &. N. for Jacksonville, Florida. All day long we traveled over the sandy stretches of the Gulf slope, now and then running through scattered pine forests. Often near streams we would see groves of live oaks festooned with Florida moss hanging from the limbs. Reaching Jacksonville about ten o'clock in the evening, and having only ten minutes to spare, I soon boarded the East Coast Line passenger which was to carry me to Key West. All night we sped on and when morning came we were well down the Florida coast nearing West Palm Beach. At West Palm Beach along the railroad tracks I saw several ferns which apparently were Pteridium caudatum, Pteris longifolia, Blechnum occidentale, and Tectaria trifoliata. As we traveled farther south where the pines gave way to palms, the trees were often covered with epiphytic ferns. The scenery was now beautiful, orange orchards heavily laden with fruit, bordered with groves of palms. Occasionally we would get glimpses of the Atlantic on the east, but often we would travel over sandy wastes or the swampy land of the everglades. From the mainland to Key West, a distance of 120 miles, is one of the most remarkable railroads in the 46",

It not readily included in any recognized genus. Tryon & Tryon (1982, p. 280) said that may be related to Syngramma or a paleotropical element of Doryopteris. Tryon & Lugardon (1991, p. 173) said that it is an apogamous tetraploid that excluded (from Hemionitis) on the basis of its distinctive morphology as well as its flavonoid composition. According to D. B. Lellinger (in litt.), the lamina indument of H. arifolia unlike that of Syngramma and Doryopteris; it appears to be more like that of and its relatives. The stipe base and rhizome indument of H. arifolia also unlike that of Syngramma and Doryopteris; it appears to resemble that of Cheilanthes and its relatives. The venation of H. arifolia unlike that of Cheilanthes and Syngramma; it resembles, but does not exactly match, that of Doryopteris in forming polygonal areolae without included veinlets.",

    "abstract": "A biosystematic study of the star-scaled cloak ferns (Benham, 1989), led to the description of the new genus Astrolepis Benham & Windham (Benham & Windham, 1992) and elucidated several new taxa. Because of the preparation of several new floristic treatments, it is necessary to describe these new taxa within Astrolepis. Based upon isozyme patterns from starch gel electrophoresis and chromosome pairing relationships (Benham, 1989), one new species was discovered and is described below. Additional results from the study also reveal that two races of A. sinuata exist at diploid and triploid levels, and three races of A. cochisensis exist at diploid, triploid and tetraploid levels. These races can be easily distinguished from one another on the basis of spore number per sporangium and spore size. These races will be recognized at the subspecific level in the following taxonomic revision. 1. Astrolepis sinuata (Lagasca ex Sw.) Benham & Windham la. Astrolepis sinuata subsp. sinuata This subspecies represents the apogamous 32-spored, triploid race (n = 87). Spore diameters for this subspecies range from 50-65 gim. It is widely distributed from South America through Mexico into the southwestern United States, Georgia, and the West Indies.",

    "abstract": "In publishing the new generic name Goniophlebium, K. Presl (1836, pp. 185-186) provided a description based on five New World species, which he transferred to his genus. He also included the apparent synonym spuriorum sectio 1, Goniophlebium. Blume, which was based on three Old World species. (On examining Blume's work (1830, p. 132), one finds this section to be a rankless name, but one valid under Art. 35.2 and so available for transfer.) He also transferred each of Blume's species with a query. Presl's concept clearly applied to American material, for he saw no Asiatic material and he included Blume's name and species only ex auctoritate clar. Blume . It is very likely that Presl intended to establish a name independent of Blume's, as the preponderance of evidence indicates: American species described and transferred without doubt, Asiatic species not described, transferred with doubt, and only on the authority of Blume. J. Smith (1841, p. 56; 1875, p. 92) recognized the difference between New World and the Old World species. He mentioned their articulate pinnae and proposed that they be placed in Goniophlebium sect. Schellolepis or in Schellolepis. Pichi Sermolli (1973, pp. 465-468) agreed with that disposition, chose one of Presl's American species as lectotype, and cited the genus as Goniophlebium K. Presl. Had Presl excluded Blume's name (by not citing it) or Blume's species (by placing them in another genus), there would be no problem in considering Presl's name to be independent of Blume's. However, according to the present Code (Arts. 48.1, 63.2), by including Blume's name and his species even with doubt it is mandatory to base Presl's name on Blume's, to choose a lectotype from among Blume's species, and to cite the genus as Goniophlebium (Blume) K. Presl, as Rodl-Linder et al. (1990, p. 105) recently did. Only an act of conservation can override this disposition. In my opinion, the American species are different from the Asiatic ones, most notably in lacking articulate pinnae and in having sori in several series, as well as in a single series. These species seem best retained in a subgenus of Polypodium (Lellinger, 1981, p. 93). Hennipman, Veldhoen and Kramer (1990, pp. 205-206, 224-225) held the same viewpoint; they pointed out several hybrids that occur between the subgenera of American Polypodium. In addition, they illustrated dissected lamina scales and paraphyses of Polypodium (Goniophlebium) verrucosum (Hook.) J. Smith, neither of which I have observed in New World species, whose laminae are rarely pilosulous and perhaps never paleaceous or paraphysate. Because the names Goniophlebium (Blume) K. Presl and Polypodium subg. Goniophlebium (Blume) C. Chr. must be applied to Old World material that is not clearly allied to material from the New World, the New World subgenus traditionally called Polypodium subg. Goniophlebium requires a new name: Polypodium subg. Polygoniophlebium Lellinger, subg. nov. Rhizoma late repens, frondibus distantibus; laminae pinnatae pinnatisectae vel pinnati37",

Bernh.and C. protrusa (Weath.)Blasdell.Shaver (1950) pointed out that C. tennesseensis is morphologically intermediate between C. bulbifera and C. protrusa and concluded that these were the two parental species.Morphological and cytological work by Blasdell (1963) supports this interpretation.Plants of C. tennesseensis are usually misidentified as either C. bulbifera or C. protrusa.As a result, the range and abundance of this fern are not precisely known.This paper presents the distribution of C. tennesseensis in Illinois and shows that it is much more common and widespread than generally realized.Specimens of all Illinois Cystopteris from the following herbaria were examined: EIU, ILL, ILLS, ISM, MO, and SIU.Those specimens found to be C. tennesseensis were annotated as such and recorded.Locality data of individual collections are available from the author.In addition, numerous areas of suitable rock habitats were visited in the field, especially in southern Illinois and along the lower Mississippi and Illinois rivers.Previously, this fern was reported from only three Illinois counties: Champaign, Jackson, and Will (McGregor, 1950;Mohlenbrock & Ladd, 1978): however, I was unable to locate specimens from Champaign County.Cystopteris tennesseensis occurs most frequently along major watercourses of the state, such as the Illinois, Mississippi, and Wabash rivers (Fig. 1).Along these major rivers, habitat for this fern is provided by the rocky escarpments and ravines that run along or into the river floodplains.The writer's field experience in these areas indicate that C. tennesseensis is commonly present in suitable habitats and is often abundant where found.Cystopteris tennesseensis is also present, although to a more limited extent, in the Driftless Area of northwestern Illinois and in the Shawnee Hills of southern Illinois.",

Explants (6-8 mm long) were cultured on 1% agar-gelled sterile nutrient medium of Knudson as modified by Steeves et al. (1955) and supplemented with 2% sucrose in order to provide control diploid sporophytes growing in axenic culture. Roots, leaves, and rhizomes of the resulting plants were excised and induced to differentiate into aposporous diploid gametophytes. Stock cultures of diploid gametophytes were multiplied and further grown on liquid media supplemented with 0.6% agar to effect fertilization and raise tetraploid sporophytes. Tetraploid gametophytes were isolated from this tissue culture-induced tetraploid material by repeating the procedure followed at the diploid level. In this way, both diploid and tetraploid sporophytes and gametophytes were made available for this study. Phenolic compounds were isolated by two-dimensional paper chromatography of an 80% methanol extract of green material in t-BuOH-HOAc-H20, 3:1:1 (TBA) and 15% aqueous acetic acid (HOAc), followed by one-dimensional paper chromatography in water. C-glycosylxanthones appeared as orange compounds in ultraviolet light and turned yellow when fumed with ammonia. Both purified compounds were co-chromatographed with mangiferin and isomangiferin isolated from Asplenium montanum Willd. (Bozeman & Radford 11552, NY). Rf values in TBA, BAW, HOAc, and H20 were: mangiferin, 0.31, 0.43, 0.43, 0.12; isomangiferin, 0.19, 0.29, 0.23, 0.04; Asplenium mangiferin, 0.34, 0.42, 0.42, 0.11; Asplenium isomangiferin, 0.21, 0.32, 0.23, 0.03; and rutin standard, 0.43, 0.45, 0.56, 0.25. The BAW and HOAc values are very similar to those of Smith and Harborne (1971), but the TBA and HOAc values differ from those of Markham and Wallace (1980). Absorption spectra (MeOH, nm) were: mangiferin, 232, 260, 270sh, 310, 364; isomangiferin, 240, 258, 270sh, 312, 365. The compounds were unaffected by acid hydrolysis (1 hr, 2N HC1, 100?C).",

    "abstract": "Tryon (1970) revised the classification of the family Cyatheaceae and recognized six genera and three principal evolutionary lines among the squamate genera. Sphaeropteris with its undifferentiated (conform) scales represents an evolutionary line and occurs at the base of the squamate genera, while Cnemidaria with its marginate scales is found at the top of another evolutionary line. Sphaeropteris supposably contains elements allied to the other two major evolutionary groups in the family (Tryon & Tryon, 1982). On the basis of scale characters, Sphaeropteris subgenus Sphaeropteris is related to Alsophila and subgenus Sclephropteris is allied with Trichipteris, Cyathea and Cnemidaria. Holttum and Edwards (1983) believe that this latter alliance (together with certain species of Tryon's Sphaeropteris) forms a natural group which needs a new subdivision. Holttum (1963, 1964, 1965) also has intensively studied the Cyatheaceae, but recognized only a single genus Cyathea for the same taxa in the family. He subdivided the genus on the basis of characters of the stipe scales and associated characters of indusia, hairs and venation, and felt that the only sharp subdivision within the genus is between the subgenus Sphaeropteris and the subgenus Cyathea (Holttum, 1982; Holttum & Edwards, 1983). His subgenus Sphaeropteris is characterized by peculiar marginal setae on the stipe scales and certain indusial and venation characters, while Tryon (1970) regarded the uniformity of cells of the stipe scales as the most important character for delimiting the genus Sphaeropteris. Although Tryon (1970) promoted subgenus Sphaeropteris to generic rank, Holttum & Edwards (1983) feel that it is not a natural group and contains species that do not belong in the group. Sphaeropteris sensu Tryon is a genus of approximately 120 species found in both the New and Old World. Its distinctive feature is the presence of conform stipe scales with undifferentiated or poorly differentiated cellular construction",

    "abstract": "A number of studies have shown that cyanogenic phenotypes of plants are less palatable to, and less damaged by, many herbivores than are acyanogenic phenotypes of the same species (Jones, 1962; Angseesing & Angseesing, 1973; Cooper-Driver & Swain, 1976; Dritschilo et al., 1979; Schreiner et al., 1984). Yet many plant species are polymorphic for cyanogenesis, and the acyanogenic morphs are common (Fikenscher & Hegenauer, 1977). Studies on this polymorphism in Trifolium repens and Lotus corniculatus have shown that a variety of environmental stresses are more deleterious to cyanogenic plants than they are to acyanogenic ones. In Trifolium, low winter temperatures are correlated with low frequencies of plants containing cyanogenic glucoside (Daday, 1954; De Araujo, 1976). However, the correlation between low winter temperatures and a high incidence of acyanogenic plants is poorer for L. corniculatus (Jones, 1977). Cyanogenic Lotus and Trifolium plants were less tolerant of drought (Abbott, 1977; Foulds & Grimes, 1972). In some situations, salt spray may also select more strongly against cyanogenic Lotus plants (Keymer & Ellis, 1978). Cooper-Driver (1976) found that Bracken, Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn, was polymorphic for cyanogenesis and that cyanogenic Bracken fronds growing in the shade had higher cyanide levels than those growing in open, sunny habitats (Cooper-Driver et al., 1977). The incidence of cyanogenic and acyanogenic fronds in the two habitats was not measured. In an attempt to follow up on this work, the current study examined the incidence of cyanogenic and acyanogenic fronds in open and shady habitats. A survey was also made to determine if there was any correlation between winter severity and the incidence of cyanogenesis in Bracken stands.",

    "abstract": "Data concerning the taxonomy and geographic distribution of Adiantum trapeziforme L. and A. pentadactylon Langsd. & Fisch. are presented. Both species have been confused in the past and the distinctness between them is discussed. During the preparation of a taxonomic revision of Adiantum (Pteridaceae) in Brazil, the senior author noticed some problems involving the delimitation and distribution of A. trapeziforme and A. pentadactylon. The former species was described by Linnaeus (1753) and lectotypified by Lellinger (1977) based on an illustration by Sloane (1707: t. 59). Sloane's illustration does not clearly show the diagnostic characters for this species and it might be confused with A. pentadactylon, a related taxon. Adiantum pentadactylon was described by Langsdorff and Fischer (1810) and its type material (probably an isotype) is at G (photos BM, SP). This material resembles A. trapeziforme but represents a different species. Over the years, several authors have treated these species in different ways, sometimes erroneously. Hooker (1851) mentioned that both species belonged to the A. trapeziforme group, which is characterized by: Fronds tripinnate or decompound; sori almost invariably short, equal or nearly so, rarely continu- ous or elongated, as in A. speciosum and fumarioides. He did not, however, clarify the differences between these species. Fee (1869) cited Glaziou 2318 (B, P) as A. trapeziforme f. B A. pentadactylon. Glaziou's material was collected in Rio de Janeiro and is a typical example of A. pentadactylon. According to Baker (1870) in Flora Brasiliensis, A. pentadactylon is a syn- onym of A. trapeziforme. Nevertheless, the material cited by Baker, located at BM (Glaziou 438) and BR and P (Glaziou 1754), are clearly A. pentadactylon, and were collected in Rio de Janeiro. Christ (1900) described A. trapeziforme var. incisum Christ based on spec- imens (Ule 51, 195) from the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The variety was said to differ in its less glaucous pinnules, thinner tissue, segments lobed more than half way to the base, and numerous lobes (6-7 on each side of the seg- ment) usually bifurcate and obtuse. The syntype at P (Ule 195), however, is A. pentadactylon.",

    "abstract": "Fosberg's (1968) report of the European Polypodium vulgare L. on the coastal plain of the northeastern United States is of significance to the phytogeographical study of the P. vulgare complex in North America and Europe. Fernald (1922) enumerated the main morphological differences between P. virginianum L. and P. vulgare L. These include an acrid tasting rhizome, scales with sagittate attachment, and submarginal sori in P. virginianum, as opposed to a sweet rhizome, peltately attached rhizome scales, and medial sori in P. vulgare. The most characteristic feature of P. virginianum was found to be the glandular paraphyses described by Martens (1943, 1950) and by Martens and Pirard (1943). The only other possible report of true P. vulgare in eastern North America is a herbarium specimen dealt with by Martens (1943). The plant in question (from the Antwerp Botanical Garden) was mounted on the same herbarium sheet as a plant with paraphyses collected in Philadelphia in 1824. Martens concluded that the non-paraphysate P. vulgare specimen had been added to the sheet at a later date from a European locality. No occurrence of P. vulgare in eastern North America is mentioned in the works of Manton (1950) or Shivas (19 6 la, b) on the cytogenetics of the P. vulgare complex in Europe, nor by Manton (1950, 1951, 1957), Manton and Shivas (1953), or Evans (1971) in their studies of North American P. virginianum. All the aforementioned works stress the separate distributions of P. vulgare and P. virginianum. Fosberg, in recording P. vulgare from Long Island, Suffolk County, New York, based his identification on the fact that the sori bore no paraphyses, and the habitat-a sandy slope of glacial origin-was one that was more typical of the European species. Fernald (1922) had previously noted that P. virginianum is ordinarily a plant of rock habitats, only rarely occurring as an epiphyte; no mention of sandy banks was made. This viewpoint has been repeated by various authors, e.g., Cobb (1956) and House (1924). The question of whether the Long Island P. vulgare was indigenous or had been introduced with European trees planted in the area was raised by Fosberg. In my work on pteridophytes of Suffolk County, I reinvestigated the site of Fosberg's discovery on December 27, 1974, accompanied by G. Paul Kemp. This was made possible by Mrs. Grosvenor Atterbury, the owner, who kindly showed us the location, as she had Dr. Fosberg in 1968. The colony is on the northeast slope of a small glacial hill in the Shinnecock Hills of eastern Long Island at an elevation of ca. 65 ft (not 65 m, as reported earlier). The dominant trees at this",

    "abstract": "In contrast to Botrychium and Helminthostachys, which reproduce solely by sexual means, the genus Ophioglossum is characterized by the formation of clones. Individual plants may give rise to several others by the process of root budding. Sexual reproduction, on the other hand, is considered a relatively rare event. In this paper I wish to discuss a species of Ophioglossum which apparently lacks the ability to reproduce asexually and must rely entirely on the formation of gametophytes to produce new individuals. The Bulbous Adder's-tongue, Ophioglossum crotalophoroides Walt., is a plant of disturbed, sandy habitats with a geographical range extending from South Carolina to the Falkland Islands (Clausen, 1938, 1948). The structure and development of the sporophyte of this species easily qualify it as one of the most remarkable, yet little-known, pteridophytes in the world. Its most distinctive feature involves growth of the tuberous rhizomes in an overall downward direction (Fig. 1), in contrast to the more usual condition of upward or horizontal growth characteristic of the stems of ferns and other vascular plants. This peculiar phenomenon can readily be observed in the field by examining the under-surfaces of the stems. Light, tan-colored streaks (Figs. 2, 3) indicate areas of tissue eruption and emergence. Young tissues, formed by the activity of an apical region that is sunken deep within the stem, push outward and downward as growth proceeds (Fig. 1). In contrast to the apparently active stem bases, the upper, older regions are dark in color and partially necrotic. New roots are initiated near the bases of the stems. This type of upside down growth strongly contrasts with that of most other species of Ophioglossum. Petry (1913) provided the only existing account of the growth and development of the stems of this interesting species.2 In March, 1972, I visited several localities in north central Louisiana with R. Dale Thomas and W. H. Wagner, Jr., in search of 0. crotalophoroides. My primary objective was to collect a series of rhizomes of different ages for use in developmental studies. I was also anxious to discover the previously undescribed gametophytes of this species. It seemed likely that gametophyte characters would compliment those from the sporophyte in elucidating the evolutionary relationships of the species. Furthermore, there is a general need for more information about the gametophytic generation of Ophioglossum. Gametophytes are known from a mere seven of the approximately 30 to 40 species in the genus (Boullard, 1963; Mesler, 1972).",

It is built of hundreds of petiole scales of Nephelea mexicana, but its upper, concave end is covered with long hairs from the stipe bases or rhizomes of Lophosoria quadripinnata (Gmel.) C. Chr., which form a soft bed for the newly hatched birds. Besides the petiole scales and hairs that form the body of the nests, there are also lichens of different species in the outer wall. The conical nest shows several specimens of Cladonia sylvatica (L.) Hoffm. and two small fragments of Physcia sp. or Parmelia sp. The cylindrical nest has several specimens of Physcia setosa (Ach.)

I have observed numerous living plants of Asplenium montanum in Ulster County, New York, in seven counties in North Carolina, and I have seen herbarium specimens at the New York Botanical Garden (NY). All specimens were found to be uniform in morphology, and more than 99 per cent of the fronds bore sori. There are no described forms or varieties of this species. The new form (Fig. 1) differs from the typical form in the following characters: (1) blades light yellow-green instead of dark blue-green, (2) tip of frond not tapered to a lobed apex (Fig. 2A versus 3A), (3) pinnae and ultimate divisions more dissected (Fig. 2B versus 3B), (4) frond length averages 2.3 cm shorter than typical New York specimens, and (5) the absence of sori.

At no place is there a clear or forceful statement made to this effect, although Errera's' (1886) statement that the time of its formation, a cell membrane tends to assume the same form that a weightless fluid layer would assume under the same conditions, is referred to as Errera's Law by D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson (1952). Conclusions reached by Lewis (1925, 1944) ascribe polyhedral cell shape to both surface tension and the necessities of spherical geometry. Matzke and Duffy (1955) conclude, after a study of interphase cells within the apical meritsem of Anacharis densa, that  . . the variation in number, kinds, combinations and arrangements of faces in these cells is the result of the interplay of numerous factors and that the frequent occurrence of pentagonal faces is correlated with angular stability under liquid and semiliquid conditions at the time that the cell plate is formed in the cells within the apical meristem. Matzke (1940) described the three-dimensional shape of bubbles in soap foam and stated that they closely approached in three-dimensional shape the cells previously described by Lewis (1944) and Marvin (1939), and concluded that this evidence strongly supports the view that surface tension, along with such",

    "abstract": "In the course of a collecting trip to central Mexico during the summer of 1964, a Notholaena was found that has proved to be distinct from previously described species. The new species belongs to the group characterized by cereous indument of the leaf. It seems to be most closely allied to N. candida. The superficial appearance of the plant, particularly its narrower lamina and smaller, more remote segments (Fig. 1), however, suggests N. greggii. Apparently it bears no close relationship to the latter. NOTHOLAENA jacalensis Pray, sp. nov. Plate 10 Rhizoma breve, horizontale, ramosum; squamae lanceolatae, 3-4 mm longae, brunneae, marginibus angustis pallidioribus, taenia sclerotica lata, marginibus integris. Folia plerumque 1025 cm alta; stipes crassus nitide niger, teres, glaber praeter aliquot squamas ad basim, has dilute brunneoas, concolores, aut centrum angustum obscurius habentes, paululo brevior quam lamina, uno fasciculo vasculari praeditus. Lamina lanceolata, bipinnata praeter pinnas infimas, acuta, coriacea, superficie superiore glabra aut indumento cereo levissimo praedita, superficie inferiore dense cerea dilute flava; rhachis valde sulcata, glabra. Frons 4-7, pinnata, pinnis lanceolatis, 6-14 paria segmentorum lanceolatorum discretorum integrorum, sessilium sed non adnatorum habentibus, marginibus revolutis, non mutatis; pinnae basales unicam pinnulam interiorem inferiorem longissimam pinnatamque, cum 4-8 segmentis praebentes. Venae 1vel 2-furcatae; sporangia (64 sporas ferentia) in cacuminibus subflabellatis venarum disposita. TYPE: Jacala, Hidalgo, Mexico, roadside 1 km south of village, along highway #85, July 2, 1964, Pray 3095 (US). This species is very distinct from known Notholaenas, among which the only close relationship seems to be with N. candida. The prominent development of the basal pinnules of the lowest pair of pinnae is reminiscent of var. copelandii in particular. However, N. jacalensis is readily distinguished in a number of",

Approximately 24 hours following the incidence of smog, tan lesions, commonly near the smaller veins, appear on the leaflets. At this time, damage to the cells directly above the stomata can be seen with a microscope. Within 48 hours, part or all of a damaged frond may become completely dehydrated, turn brown and brittle, and crumble on pressure. Old, middle-aged, and young leaves appear to be equally sensitive. The growing tip of the plant, with its spirally uncoiling developing leaves, usually is not damaged.",

Metaxylem tracheids have wide borders on pits. Truly “reticulate” metaxylem tracheids are few. Protoxylem tracheids have helices with borders in Huperzia and Lycopodium, but in Phylloglossum protoxylem annuli and helices are non-bordered.

    "abstract": "Although several species of Lycopodium occur in abundance in certain areas of the eastern United States, these plants have been reported infrequently in Georgia. This is particularly true for Lycopodium complanatum var. flabelliforme, which, according to Dr. Wilbur II. Duncan, Curator of the University of Georgia Herbarium, has been reported from only ten of Georgia's 159 counties. In July, 1958, while on a botanizing expedition with Mr. Tom Jackson, of Rinehart College, I came across a small stand of L. complanatum var. flabelliforme in a wooded area at the baseof Georgia's famous monadnock, Stone Mountain, in Dekalb County. According to Dr. Duncan this is the first report of this species from Dekalb County, so this raises the total to 11 counties. More recently, on January 24 of this year, my father, Mr. Jim Hutto, accompanied me on a search for the grapefern Botrychium dissectum var. obliquzcm in a wooded area in Hall County about six miles south of Gainesville, Georgia. I had previously located an extensive growth of B. dissecturm in this locality in 1958 and I was interested in reexamining it. Several feet from the bank of a small stream running through the area I came across a patch of L. complanatum var. flabelliforme. A search of the area revealed that this small patch was all that was present. Dr. Duncan informs me that this is a new station, although he has previously reported this Lycopodium from Hall County from a station about six miles further south. It is my opinion that this and other species are probably more abundant in Georgia than we realize, particularly in the northern part of the state. With increased botanizing on the part of Georgia fern enthusiasts I believe the picture of the distribution will become more complete.",

Specifically, we have observed what we interpret as amitotic division and nuclear fragmentation in Pteris vittata L., the ladder-brake fern, Matteuccia Struthiopteris (L.) Todaro, the ostrich fern, and Dryopteris sp. Amitosis is usually defined as th'e simple constriction of the nucleus without the formation of condensed chromosomes or spindles; the term nuclear fragmentation is often used when more than two nuclei are so formed (5). Since amitosis or direct division has been a subject of recurring interest since nuclear division was first described, and, since the controversy over the significance of this process is still not satisfactorily settled, we feel it worthwhile to record these observations and suggestions for the use of the fern prothallia in the exploration of this problem. After describing our observations, we shall refer briefly to possible environmental conditions that might have stimulated the abnormal divisons.",

Gilbert described a new species of which he called P. viride, which has remained a nominally valid species since that time, primarily because no one has investigated it. Recently, Mr. G. Brownlie, of Canterbury University College, Christchurch, New Zealand, has asked me about it and prompted me to look into the matter. Mr. Gilbert wrote that his material had been collected for him by Dr. C. H. F. Peters, the astronomer-in-chief of the Transit-of-Venus Expedition of 1874. Most of Dr. Peters' collections were obtained near Queenstown, near Waikatipu Lake, New Zealand. The new species P. viride was described as intermediate between pellucidum and P. vulgare, differing from both in being smaller, in having the veins only once forked, and in the fine black wavy costae, the slender green stipes and rachis, and the metallic green color of the fronds. The Gilbert Herbarium was for some time thought to be lost, but it has been preserved. It was bequeathed to Hamilton College, which is located at Clinton, New York, and has been preserved in good condition in the herbarium of the Department of Biology of that institution. Through the courtesy of Prof. Walter N. Hess I have been privileged to borrow the type of P. viride, a photograph of which is reproduced in the accompanying plate. The label of the type reads Polypodium viride sp. n. Gilbert; Leg. Dr. C. H. F. Peters-1874; New Zealand, Middle Island. The plant is the common polypody of the eastern United States, vulgare var. virginianum (L.) Eaton, which should perhaps be treated as a distinct species P. virginianum L. The cytological",

The effects of some growth regulating compounds on the vegetative growth of Azolla have also been reported (Nickell, 1961). The aim of the present work was to subject a readily available number of different species and strains of laboratory-cultured Azolla to a range of temperature regimes, and to culture solutions modified by the addition of growth regulating substances, in an attempt to induce sporulation.",

Studies of the population biology of seed plants have revealed that basic genetic characteristics such as seed size, germination time, and growth rate can influence interactions among neighbors (Silvertown, 1987). Despite the well known effects of neighbors on gametophyte development (Naf et al., 1975) there are few studies of the effects of basic genetic characteristics such as spore size, germination time, and growth rate on gametophyte development. Schedlbauer (1976) has studied the effects of spore size, germination time, and growth rate on gametophyte development in Ceratopteris thalictroides (L.) Brongn. We used methods similar to those of Schedlbauer to investigate the influence of spore size and germination time on gametophyte development in Ceratopteris richardii Brongn. Previous investigation has revealed that two distinct developmental states occur among gametophytes developing from multispore cultures of C. richardii: small ameristic males and large meristic hermaphrodites (Sayers, unpublished data). Although a small number of vegetative and female gametophytes did occur, they were too rare to be included in any statistical analysis. This investigation thus focussed on large hermaphroditic and small male gametophytes.",

Gametophytes developed from these spores were treated to produce arrays of genetically identical clones. Sporophyte formation was determined when such clones from the same or different gametophytes, derived from the same frond, were combined in pairs in all possible ways to produce a diallel mating scheme. A recurring pattern of presence or absence of sporophyte formation indicated the occurrence of two genetic classes defined by no or very few sporophytes in pairs within either class but high frequency production in pair combinations of clones from different classes. The usual failure of sister clone pairs to produce a sporophyte contrasts with the frequently high incidence of sporophyte formation on the part of single, isolated non-cloned gametophytes. This conflict of evidence is discussed in relation to genetic incompatibility or, alternatively, the control of antheridia formation. The genetic differences revealed in cloned gametophytes provide an empirical way of determining whether a given stand of bracken is made up of more than one individual.",

    "abstract": "Any area with a poorly documented flora inevitably accumulates in its list of presumed species an assortment of one-time horticultural escapes, ballast waifs, railroad travelers, agricultural relics, and other chance introductions that are incapable of persistence and hence are not properly full-fledged components of area's flora. Such plants, once reported, tend to persist in listings long after they have disappeared in field. Little acclaim is accorded writer who omits a species that he feels is not adequately documented as a present member of his flora, while a degree of pride and even a measure of competitiveness accompanies report of a species in an area where it has not previously been known. Thus it is satisfying to provide first record of Marsilea as a current member of Florida flora since it was reported for state in 1890's. In 1891 L. M. Underwood traveled by rail through Florida, stopping at every opportunity to collect ferns and other vascular plants. In January and in March he paused at a depot known as Orange Bend, in Lake County, central peninsular Florida. Near depot he found in abundance what he identified as the mucronata form of Marsilea vestita. Underwood (1892) published a report of his discovery, noting that his specimens (now at PH, US, YU, and perhaps elsewhere) were first for this species from east of Mississippi River. Guided by Underwood's account, G. V. Nash visited same location on May 16, 1894. He remarked (1895, p. 161): plant occurs along track on both sides of depot for about one-quarter of a mile. It is confined to that limited area so far as I could find out. Its occurrence at such a distance from its ordinary range and its limitation to this small section point very strongly to its being introduced. Nash's specimens (PH, US) bear location Eustis, but are surely from Orange Bend station. A much earlier indication of Marsilea in Florida was published by D. C. Eaton (1872), a quarter century before Underwood's report, but has been wholly overlooked by later authors. Eaton possessed a plant from Florida labeled Marsilea quadrifolia L. (a European species sparingly introduced into northeastern North America), which he thought more likely to be one of western species, M. uncinata Braun, for instance. Two sheets in Eaton herbarium (YU) provide basis for this brief report. Both are Marsilea vestita (and are so annotated by D. S. Correll), and bear printed label: Plantae Floridanae: prope Apalachicola [Franklin County], coll. A. W. Chapman, M.D., 1860. Chapman (1897, p. 640), however, acknowledged Marsilea in southeastern United States only near Vicksburg, Mississippi. The labels on Eaton collections were prepared for his herbarium, and it is possible that an error occurred in documentation of",

    "abstract": "The genus Equisetum has caused problems to field botanists and herbarium workers because the species are often difficult to identify. The general morphology is so plastic and responsive to environmental influence that the same species can look quite different under different circumstances, and two different species can under certain conditions closely resemble one another. One source of characters which has recently come to the foreground is the micromorphology of surface silica. Equisetum has long been noted for its ability to take up silicon dioxide and deposit it on the surface of the plant as a hard, outer coat. For this reason, certain species have been used to scour pots and pans (scouring rush), or to polish wood (joiner's rush). The silica deposits have been suspected of varying among species, and in studying subgenus Hippochaete, I used the silica profile of the branch ridges as a character in distinguishing E. giganteum, E. myriochaetum, and their hybrid, E. x schaffneri (Hauke, 1963). I also illustrated the silica rosettes in the valleys of E. ramosissimum subsp. debile. Milde (1867) had illustrated these, as well as some vague differences of surface pattern among species of subg. Equisetum, particularly on the stomata. With development of the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), surface features of biological entities have become more amenable to study. Various people have used this technique to look at Equisetum (Laroche, 1968, 1969a, 1969b; Laroche et al, 1970; Kaufman et al., 1971; Page, 1972, 1974; Tanowitz, 1975; Dayanandan, 1977; Lawry, unpublished). Page (1972) revised the taxonomy of Equisetum subg. Equisetum largely utilizing silica micromorphology. Since the SEM technique is somewhat laborious and requires special equipment, it does not lend itself to convenient and rapid evaluation of surface micromorphology of a number of specimens from different localities, of plants of different ages, or of different parts of the same plant. Apparently Page looked at only one specimen for each species, and did not appreciate the possibility of silica pattern variation within a plant or between plants of the same species. The silica micromorphology does show some consistent characters by which species of Equisetum subg. Equisetum can be recognized (Hauke, 1978), and it is useful in helping to identify aberrant specimens. However, it is impractical for the working taxonomist, who must sort stacks of specimens, to stop and prepare for the SEM material from a problematic specimen, assuming he even has ready access to a scanning electron microscope. I sought a practical alternative to the SEM for rapidly evaluating surface silica micromorphology of herbarium specimens of Equisetum. The technique I adopted is the microreplica method, as published in the Turtox News some years ago. I have used this successfully on dried, pressed herbarium specimens. It works best",

It has been reported from two localities in Tennessee (Shaver, 1954). The first plants were found at a cave mouth in Roan County in 1849, but they had disappeared by 1900. The second site, discovered in 1878 a few miles north of Bridgeport, Alabama, in a lime sink in Marion County, Tennessee, contained plants which are surviving but are underdeveloped. The Hart's-tongue has not been found elsewhere in the southeastern United States until now. In early October 1978, E. Batchelder, a co-worker of the author and an avid spelunker, told of a caving expedition to Jackson County, Alabama, the previous weekend. While entering a cave through a deep sink, he saw an unusual-looking fern and photographed it. Two weeks later the photograph had been developed, and the fern proved to be P. scolopendrium. The site was visited on October 21 by a group consisting of the author, Mr. Batchelder, C. Batchelder, J. Shearon, M. Shearon, and D. Gazaway. The sink is about a mile from the village of Paint Rock on the western flank of Nat Mountain at about 1200 feet elevation. The sink is about 40 feet deep and its walls are vertical or overhanging, except for a narrow cleft through which passes a path so steep that a rope is necessary to enter the sink. There are also two cave mouths at the bottom.",

    "abstract": "The Dismal Swamp contains a large number of plants of sexual Dryopteris species plus some hybrid plants (Nickrent et. al., 1978). The hybrids are of particular interest because some of them, like D. celsa x cristata are able to reproduce and so form large stands. In the hybrids, the production of giant spores, considered to be a form of apomixis, is well known (De Benedictis, 1969). In addition to giant spores, other abnormal spore types (diads, triads, and fused tetrads) are produced in a manner apparently similar to that described by Hickok and Klekowski (1973). The objectives of this study were to examine the dispersion of spores within the fern's immediate habitat, to assess spore drift above the canopy, and to determine the dispersability of hybrid spores.

Br.).In addition, this new occurrence occupies a different plant community type from the plants at Loxahatchee, where the authors recently observed it growing in tree islands on root balls of Osmunda cinnamomea L. and on rotting logs.Historically, Schizaea pennula was known from Miami-Dade County, Florida, where it was first discovered in 1904 by A.A. Eaton (996, GH, USF) near the headwaters of the historic Miami River.John K. Small reports an occurrence of it ''over a decade later'' at Royal Palm Hammock, in what is now Everglades National Park (Small, J.K. 1938: Ferns of the Southeastern States, The Science Press, Lancaster).One other report was made for Pinellas County, Florida, (approximately 140 km north of the Prairie Pines Preserve population) where John Beckner discovered plants in pine flatwoods (J.Beckner, Amer.Fern J 43:125, 1953).Due to habitat destruction along the Miami River, and failed surveys by the authors at Royal Palm Hammock in 2004, and others at the Pinellas County population (Darling, Thomas Jr. Amer.Fern J 51 (1):1-15, 1961), it seems unlikely that plants are present at these locations.Outside of the United States, Schizaea pennula is also found in the West Indies, Central America and South America (Wunderlin & Hansen 2000).Although it is diminutive in size and easily overlooked, in the future more populations of this rare tropical fern are likely to be found.",

The young gametophyte develops into a solid, green, spherical primary tubercle. Mature gametophyte development occurs at the top of the primary tubercle by the formation of a crown with photosynthetic lobes. An intermediate shaft reported for other Lycopodiella gametophytes fails to form. Comparisons were made between intermediate shafts of Lycopodiella gametophytes growing in nature and in culture. In well illuminated conditions the intermediate shaft does not form as it does on poorly illuminated gametophytes. If the gametophyte development starts partially covered by soil, long intermediate shafts can be produced. The intermediate shaft raises the top of the young gametophyte to the top of the soil where a sexually-mature gametophyte develops and sexual reproduction can take place. The intermediate shaft provides the possibility for a young gametophyte in unsuitable illumination to grow into more suitable illumination for gametophyte maturation.",

    "abstract": "Natural groups of species are defined by a combination of characters. However, some of these diagnostic characters are sometimes overestimated, so as to result in unnatural groups, for there is no single feature that can circumscribe the higher taxonomic groups. ASPIDIUM BOYDIAE,1 an interesting but little known Hawaiian species described by D. C. Eaton, has long been considered as a representative of the genus Cyrtomium because of the presence of a peltate indusia, though its affinity has also been thought to be with Aspidium (Cyclosorus) cyatheoides. In A. Boydiae, the indusia are round and peltate; the fronds are impari-pinnate, with narrowly triangular-lanceolate, papyraceous pinnae with reticulate venation. On account of these features, this species was placed in Cyrtonium. A peltate indusium is a convenient key character to define the polystichoid ferns within the dryopteroid group of genera. Still, the similarity of such a character may be relatively unimportant, and in this case the most intimate alliance of A. Boydiae is found in A. cyatheoides, a species undoubtedly thelypteroid. Because of its interesting characteristics, A. Boydiae has been investigated from the phylogenetic point of view, comparisons having been made especially with Cyrtomium, a genus of the polystichoid series, and with the thelypteroid series of ferns. The rhizome of A. Boydiae is ascending and radially constructed, as in both the series. In A. Boydiae, the stipes are terete, stramineous, and subpubescent. The scales are very sparse near the base of stipe only, as is usual in almost all of the thelypteroid ferns. In Cyrtomium, the stipes are often densely",

    "abstract": "In the western end of Chippewa County, Michigan, adjacent to Highway M-28, about 1.5 miles west of Hulbert, occurs a plant community with an unusual variety of plants. This part of the county is a swampland with intermittent, low, broad, sandy ridges, which are probably old glacial lakeshore deposits. The swampland is dominated almost exclusively by black spruce (Picea mariana), tamarack (Larix laricina), and white cedar (Thuja occidentalis), while the ridges support scattered pine trees, an abundance of bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), and blueberries (Vaccinium spp.). Information from the Michigan State Highway Department indicates that this segment of Highway M-28 was built in 1935. At that time, sand from some of the ridges was excavated for road construction, leaving a sandy, flat surface at the level of the surrounding swampland. This area remains moist most of the year, thus providing a suitable environment for a number of otherwise uncommon species of plants. In the summer of 1954, I discovered this habitat and noted that, among other plants, certain species of club-moss were established there. These were mostly Lycopodium clavatum, L. inundatum, and L. tristachyum, together with another species which I did not recognize. I was unable to collect specimens, however, until the summer of 1956. In September of that year I revisited the area to collect a sample of the unknown clubmoss2. The plant was relocated along the margin of the moist sand-flat, where the latter meets a bank of dry sand, a remnant of a partly removed ridge. After a close examination, the plant was tentatively identified",

    "abstract": "mental. The back end of the lath house is a stucco wall, now covered with ivy, where originally there was a beautiful old pepper tree. In recent years, with the construction of storm drains, the water table has gone down and after several drought years all the old and beautiful pepper trees in the neighborhood died, including ours. In the completed lath house we laid out brick walks and constructed a little ravine where some rock ferns could be grown. I also planted an English yew tree, to satisfy my desire for the woods. In the center of the area I planted a Woodwardia radicans at the time the house was enlarged. It is tremendous now. The arching fronds produce buds which root and form new plants in the winter and late spring. These I cut away and hope I can find someone who wants them. The central area has several tree ferns also. The design for a lath house planting, or any other kind of garden for that matter, is a personal matter, like painting a picture: Two can't do it. Really, if you want a fern garden, it is because you love ferns. It is the gardener who hasn't much money to spend but has lots of love to give his plants who has the best luck with ferns, for every fern must be studied and loved for itself alone. In future articles I shall write about the kinds of ferns suitable for a lath house in the Los Angeles area and about some of the problems to be solved in growing them. 5450 CARLIN ST., Los ANGELES 16, CALIFORNIA.",

This orchid was not found, and there is a possibility that an abnormal plant of H. clavellata or H. lacera was mistaken for it; but the discovery of other interesting plants made the trips worth while. In the swamp along the Chickahominy River 0.7 kilometer south-southwest of the railroad station a small colony of a peculiar Grapefernl was noted. It differs from typical Botrychium obliquum, which also grows there, in its sterile segment having only 9 to 12 divisions, with more or less cuneate bases, and in the fertile segment being once-pinnate, or at most twice-pinnate at the base, and very slender-stemmed. Another distinction consists in the length of the common stalk of the two segments, which in B. obliquum is rarely more than 2 centimeters long, but here is 4 to 5 cm., or about one fourth the total",

    "abstract": "Botrychium frond was discovered. Most of the B. dissectum fronds were deeply divided and open, as illustrated in Britton & Brown, 2nd Ed.; the remainder were less divided with closer segments as illustrated in Gray's Manual. It seems probable that the variety obliquum may be the genetic type of the species while B. dissectum may be a form with jagged or incised margins, a condition that is frequent in many and various species of ferns; but since, as stated above, the dissected form was the first described and named it becomes the taxonomic type of the species. Of the three colonies which I have seen, two were of B. dissectum alone, the first containing around a score of plants, and the plants in both colonies bore the deeply divided open fronds of the type. Mr. Gladewitz informs me that heretofore he has observed B. dissectum about 10 times and in everyinstance associated with its var. obliquum about in the proportion of 2 of the latter to one of the former. Some might propound the suggestion that there are two species B. dissectum and B. obliquum representing extremes of marginal serration while the intermediates mentioned by Mr. Hopkins of Kent, Ohio, found where both grow together are the result of cross fertilization.",

Kaulfussii, and a more common one with thinner leaves and extending from the coast inland, var. intermedium. In 1922 Fernald transferred these to varietal rank under P. vulgare. While the work herein reported was under way, it seemed as if some such final disposition would be desirable, but it still seems worth while to put on record more detailed figures and measurements for Californian material than have heretofore been available. The work was carried on under the direction of'Dr. Philip A. Munz of Pomona College, to whom I express deep gratitude for his helpful supervision and encouragement. Material was collected in many inland localities centering about the Pomona Valley of Southern California and in the coastal region at San Diego and Laguna Beach. In all, 174 specimens were collected, 50 of these being of the Kaulfussii type. Additional material was available in the Baker Herbarium of Pomona College and from the Herbarium of the University of California.",

So, upon meeting Mr. Philip Brierley, a botanist of the Federal Horticultural Board, at Freeland, I at once mentioned the possibility of finding the Climbing Fern in that region. The next day, Sept. 19, 1922, Mr. Brierley guided me to the place where he had already located it. This station is in the bottom of a deep and wide wooded valley between two mountain ridges. The limits of the colony were not reached. For all I know there may be, up and down the valley, miles of territory included. At any rate, during my two visits (the second on Oct. 1st) the fern was seen to form the dominant green of the undergrowth on many acres of ground. So far as noticed, only the bottom of the valley is occupied-the sloping banks and flat terraces within fifty feet of the creek-level. No deep and permanently shady forest of large trees is there, but the presence everywhere of second-growth or thicket makes a changing mosaic of sun-light and shadow which seems to fill the requirements of Lygodium. The soil may be described as a sandy loam-the combination of accumulated humus and material from the weathering cliffs of the flanking . 40",

METHODSWe compared two sites in the vicinity of the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve (Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica).The Campbell's Woods site is classified as Premontane/Lower Montane Forest Transition (Holdridge, 1967) and is lower (1460 -1500 m) and dryer than the Nuboso Trail Woods (1520 -1560m), which are classified as",

    "abstract": "The gametophyte of most ferns is a small, thalloid, heart-shaped, short-lived structure. In some species of Trichomanes (Hymenophyllaceae), the gametophytes are filamentous and consist of a weft of inter-twining branched filaments. Such gametophytes are perennial and can reproduce asexually by means of gemmae. Independent colonies of gametophytes have been reported from North America (Farrar, 1967, 1992), Britain (Rumsey et al., 1990) and Central Europe (Vogel et al., 1993, Jerome and Rasbach, 1994). These colonies of filamentous gametophytes can exist as very small patches (<10mm2) or can cover huge areas (20m2). Such a colony, whether large or small, may have arisen from a single spore, from several spores or, asexually, by establishment from one or more gemmae. A colony of filaments may represent either a single individual, or consist of many individuals interwoven. This presents a problem for the study of genetic variation of individuals in these independent colonies when using conventional methods, eg. allozyme analysis (Hamrick, 1990). Since the maximum length of a continuous individual filament that can be isolated from a colony is only about 60-100 cells, conventional allozyme analysis and DNA extraction methods are inapplicable. To extract DNA from a single gametophyte filament, ultrasonication was used directly to provide a crude DNA extract for DNA amplification. To establish the extraction and amplification techniques, gametophytes of four taxa of Trichomanes were compared using a large single-copy region of chloroplast DNA. Taberlet et al. (1991) have shown that the use of their universal primers for DNA amplification of the chloroplast intergenic spacers between the trnT and trnF genes is informative for a wide range of plant species.

They were determined by the authors as belonging to that species on the basis of descriptions and illustrations given by Shende (1945) since the type specimen was not available for comparison. Microspores were acetolysed with acetic anhydride and concentrated sulphuric acid according to the method of Erdtman (1952). Megaspores were studied after treating them with 30% HF for 24 hours to dissolve the perispore and untreated. LM microphotographs were taken in transmitted and refracted light using a Nikon HFX-IIA Optiphot and SEM microphotographs with a JEOL SEM 35C model after coating the dry spores with a thin conductive film of gold palladium about 200 A in thickness, in an ion sputter coater (JFC 1100). SEM studies of microspores and megaspores were conducted at the National Botanical Research Institute, Lucknow. The details of the SEM wall ultrastructure of the spores of I. dixitei are described in the text. The descriptive terms used in the present paper have been taken from the glossaries given by Jackson (1928), Kremp (1965) and Hickey (1966). The mircospores (Fig. 2, A-F) are bilateral-monolete or tetrahedral-trilete, 16-45(33) pm in diameter and their monolete and trilete proximal ridges are thin and high. The spore wall is three layered (described here as perispore, exospore and mesospore). The perispore is echinate. It appears granular under LM, but when scanned under SEM, its surface shows well defined sharply pointed and uniformly distributed spines whose broad bases may sometimes coalesce with one another to form intersecting muri. The exospore may be granular or it may show very fine and short muri. The mesospore forms a smooth walled round or oval sac which is firmly attached to the exospore. The megaspores (Fig. 1 A-R; Fig. 3 A-F, Fig. 4 A-H) are dimorphic i.e., of two different sizes: the larger megaspores are pyramidal globose, 440-610(515) pm in diameter. The smaller ones are flattened in the proximal distal plane and are 255-440(360) pm in diameter. As a rule the megaspores show tri-radiate ridges on the proximal side, but in rare specimens the ridges are tetra-radiate (Fig. 4, D). The proximal ridges are straight or sinuous and up to 70 pm high. The equatorial ridge is of variable height: at the junctions with the proximal ridges",

    "abstract": "Woodsia R. Br. is a genus of about 25 species distributed worldwide except for Australia and Antarctica (Brown, 1964). Rosendahl (1915) was the first to describe a hybrid Woodsia (alpina x ilvensis) from specimens collected near Stockholm, Sweden. Butters (1941) reported W. cathcartiana (= W. oregana var. cathcartiana) x ilvensis and Tryon (1948) reported both W. glabella x ilvensis and W. cathcartiana x scopulina, all from southern Minnesota or southwestern Ontario. Thus, compared to genera such as Asplenium or the promiscuous Dryopteris, hybridization would appear to be an unusual event among woodsias. In June 1976, while collecting along a sandstone outcrop in an upland prairie in the Smoky Hills of central Kansas, I discovered a mixed colony of W. obtusa (Spreng.) Torr. and W. oregana D.C. Eat. var. oregana. A thorough search of the outcrop revealed an abundance of W. oregana in the drier, exposed sites, a fair number of W. obtusa in more protected, mesic sites, and a few individuals which appeared to be morphological intermediates of the two species. A limited sample of specimens was removed from the colony for further study. Examinations of the hybrid and parental plants revealed morphological intermediacy occurring in several characters on the hybrid plants. This is demonstrated by polygonal graphs of mean values for six characters (Fig. 4), including frond length, blade width and texture, stipe base color, stipe vestiture, and the shape of indusium segments. The indusia, which are traditionally used as a primary diagnostic character in Woodsia, were viewed with the aid of a Phillips 501 scanning electron microscope (Figs. 5-10). The indusia of W. obtusa consist of 4-6 wide, plate-like segments while those of W. oregana consist of 5-9 filamentous segments. Hybrid individuals have indusia with 5-10 segments that were each several cells wide and 2-3-furcate or otherwise irregularly lobed apically. Spore characteristics were also examined with the SEM. Brown (1964) stated that Woodsia spores were of no diagnostic value. While this may be true for light microscope studies, it would appear not to be so for SEM work. Surface ornamentation for W. obtusa and W. oregana in Kansas, as well as several other sites in the Great Plains, are consistent with those illustrated herein (Figs. 11-16). Of particular interest are the walls forming the reticulate surface in each species. Those of W. obtusa are 3-41Lm high and form complete areoles. In W. oregana the walls are 1-2,um high and frequently dead end, i.e. they do not always connect to form complete areoles. In addition, there is an obvious difference in the surface texture in each species. Spores from the hybrids were typically abnormal and abortive, although a very few nearly normal spores were observed (Figs. 13-14). The latter spores display some degree of intermediacy, having the disconnected walls of W. oregana and surface texture of W. obtusa.",

The present writer prefers the latter approach. The first of Smith's subgenera is Amauropelta. This is the largest and most difficult group of Thelypteris species occurring in Jamaica, with a total of 24 species, nine of them believed to be endemic. Amauropelta was classified by Smith (1974) in nine sections, all but one of which are represented in Jamaica. The position of the Jamaican species in these sections may be summarized as follows: 1. Adenophyllum: decrescens. 2. Phacelothrix: thomsonii. 3. Uncinella: negligens, oligocarpa, germaniana, linkiana, gracilis, heteroclita. 4.

    "abstract": "The Slender Lip Fern, Cheilanthes feei Moore, is a widely distributed species of the western United States which occurs eastward to Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, and Illinois (Fernald, 1950; Steyermark, 1963; Cranfill, 1980; Mohlenbrock, 1967). The easternmost station for this fern was along Cedar Creek in Bullitt County, Kentucky, in a region known as The Knobs. This small population, discovered originally by Clyde Reed (Reed, 1952), is thought to be disjunct from the next nearest stations along the Ohio River in southern Illinois (Cranfill, 1980). Cheilanthes feei was discovered in 1979 by Bentley during a routine survey of the plants of Claytor Lake State Park, Pulaski County, Virginia. The actual identity of the plant went unknown until the station was visited by the authors on May 8, 1981, when the first voucher collections were made. This discovery is a remarkable disjunction of approximately 450 km eastward from the Bullitt County, Kentucky station and nearly 650 km from the more contiguous portion of its range from Illinois westward. The preferred habitats of this fern are dry, exposed crevices in limestone or dolomite cliffs (Wherry, 1961; Mohlenbrock, 1967). Extensive exposures of this kind may be found along the New River in Virginia. Claytor Lake is a large impoundment of some 4500 acres formed in 1939 when the Appalachian Power Company built its Claytor Dam on the New River just upstream of Radford, Montgomery County, Virginia. In the southeastern sector of Pulaski County, the New River is deeply entrenched where it has cut through thick beds of limestone of the Rome formation and Elbrook dolomite, both of Cambrian origin. The more resistant dolomite forms nearly vertical cliffs, frequently several hundred feet high. The station for C. feei is a rather small but precipitous cliff, perhaps fifty feet high, which forms a nose-like projection along a westward facing portion of the shoreline. Because of the configuration of the rock, the exposures range from northwestern to southern. During a second visit to the outcrop on May 14, 1981, an estimate of 1200 plants was made. Most of these are extremely small and occupy nearly every minute fracture in the rock. Several hundred larger, mature plants crowd the deeper cracks and more protected, overhanging sites. Several smaller, shaded outcrops in oak woods adjacent to the main cliff support a considerable number of additional plants. Adjacent areas of the lake shore, where similar outcrops and exposures occur, were searched for additional populations of C. feei, but only six other plants were found on a very small ledge at the water level several hundred feet to the north. Since the normal pool elevation is approximately eighty-feet above the former river level, this same outcrop was undoubtedly much more extensive prior to flooding. A much larger population may have existed and, of course, other nearby populations may have been inundated by the lake waters.",

Baker, who described numerous new species based on them, but Sodiro himself also described many new species, first in his \"Recensio Cryptogamarum Vascularium Quitensium\" (1883), and many more in the larger work mentioned above.This is dated 1893 and is always so cited.Two years ago I chanced to use the copy in the library at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and I found that its copy was not the usual bound published copy, but a copy consisting of parts as published in the \"Anales de la Universidad de Quito.\"The Kew copy is incomplete, but it clearly shows that this work was actually published in parts, which were subsequently repaged and brought together in book form.A check with a full series of these \"Anales\" in the Library of Congress shows that the \"Cryptogamae Vasculares Quitenses\" was really published in parts, some prior to 1893 and some later.The beginning was in series IV, no.31, dated October 15, 1890, pp.284-291.This part contains the key to the families and the treatment of the Hymenophylleae down through the account of Trichomanes radicans.This first part is different from the later published book, being written all in Latin.It can be presumed that the University authorities, or Sodiro's friends, convinced him that his work would be more accessible if it were written in Spanish, for this first part was republished two years later in ser.V1, no.44, PPp-58-74.March, 1892, with",

Consequently, we proposed to refer the species to Bolbitis, where the acrostichoid condition is the rule.

    "abstract": "The species of the Thelypteris normalis complex in the southeastern United States and the West Indies have long been acknowledged as taxonomically troublesome. The first person to monograph the group was Christensen (1913), who treated it under Dryopteris, subg. Cyclosorus. More recent workers have also recognized the integrity of the group, but generally have treated it as a subgroup of Thelypteris (Small, 1938; Wherry, 1943, 1964). The chief problems encountered by Christensen and others have been the extreme variability in the species and the large number of forms which are seemingly intermediate between species. Robert and Edward St. John, avid collectors of Florida ferns in the 1930's, added to the proliferation of names when they described numerous Florida endemics. The assiduousness of previous workers, however, has laid the groundwork for more detailed studies utilizing cytology and field-to-greenhouse transplants, an approach which I believe has clarified the systematics of the group. A revision of Thelypteris sect. Cyclosorus in the New World is currently being prepared for future publication. However, in order that the important conclusions of this study might be more immediately available to those with an interest in ferns of the southeastern United States and to those involved in the preparation of floras, it seems appropriate to publish a portion of the study dealing with the species of this area. Following a key to the species and varieties is a synopsis of the southeastern United States taxa, excluding T. totta (= T. gongylodes), which is only rather distantly related to species in the T. normalis complex.

Several taxa can be reinstated and newly described thanks to extensive field studies in Colombia and bordering countries. Easily overlooked characters like minute hairs, laminar squamules, and size of indusia correlate with distinct physiognomies in the field. Cyathea multiflora in the strict sense is almost restricted to Mesoamerica, just reaching into the Colombian Darién region. We observe a geographic overlap of several species especially in the Darién-Chocó region (Cyathea hildegardis sp. nov., C. pinnula, C. pinnuloides sp. nov., C. retanae) and two wider-ranging species extending from Mesoamerica into the Andes (C. acutidens, C. pinnula). The reinstated C. columbiana and newly recognized C. uregoana sp. nov. and C. prosopioides sp. nov. are restricted to the Chocó, including the Ecuadorean Esmeraldas region. Frequently found in the northern Colombian Cordillera central is C. paisa sp. nov., which is intermediate between C. pinnuloides of the Darién-Chocó region and C. lindigii, a relatively large species widespread in the Cordillera Oriental and the eastern Andean slopes south to Bolivia. We retain C. acutidens and C. leucolepismata as distinct species that can also be readily distinguished in the field by their appearance and the shape of the entire leaves but can be difficult to differentiate as fragmentary specimens. Cyathea mariposana sp. nov., a trunkless species presumably more closely related to C. squamulosa, is described from Panama. Cyathea retanae is reported from Colombia. A lectotype is chosen for C. columbiana. All relevant species are illustrated and incorporated in a diagnostic key.",

Marcy, the Cloud Cleaver, Tahawus, as the Indians called it, lifts its head above the rest of the high mountains which stretch in every direction from this, the highest peak in the whole district. It has been my fortune to spend several summers in Keene Valley; and, with my son, to climb these mountains and in woods and ravines and along the cliffs to hunt for the ferns of the district. We have had good hunting and the story of our finds ought to be shared with the rest of the American Fern Society. One reaches this district of the Adirondacks from the east by the high road through Elizabethtown, whence north-bound roads carry us to the Poko-Moonshine territory in Essex Co-unty near Willsboro. road to Keene, after reaching the ridge drops down to the Au Sable valley by way of Spruce Hill. Here one finds a swamp which yielded fine specimens and some interesting Thelypteris (Dryopteris) hybrids. At the foot of the hill the dirt road takes one up into Keene Valley and at last to the Au Sable Lakes. Towering over them to the north is The Range, a series of high peaks which lead by stiff trails to Haystack and Marcy. North from Marcy one finds McIntyre, one of the great mountains of this whole district, with steep cliffs and stiff ascents, separated from its neighbors by the Avalanche Pass on the one side and by Indian Pass on the other. Out beyond lies Heart Lake, and still further Lake Placid. From Placid, back by way of North Elba, we come along the Cascade Lakes by the State Road to Keene, and after a bit find ourselves at the foot of Spruce Hill again. 10",

This may have been due to the fact that the region is somewhat difficult to explore, and that a permanent camp is inconvenient to maintain; and then also even botanists are often in a hurry, and in the few days of a summer's vacation they naturally discover only the more obvious species. The check list of the ferns of Crater Lake National Park which is herewith submitted is based upon three seasons of continuous field work is this region. That it is complete is scarcely to be hoped, but it will serve to change the popular impression that only pines and sedges grow there. The synonymy given is not intended to be even remotely complete, the object being only to include those citations than the amateur botanist would be likely to meet in studying the ferns of the territory covered by this list. Perhaps when the botanical millennium dawns it will not be necessary for students to wade through the present maze of technical terms.",

The ground is most uneven, straight from the hand of Nature; it has never been cultivated, or trodden flat by the feet of animals; it is covered with tree roots and so encumbered with fallen trunks and branches, that it would require all one's activity if visible to the eye; but it is ten times more difficult when these pitfalls are hidden under a vigorous growth of bushes, ferns, weeds, and grass sometimes six feet high, the blades wide and stiff with serrated edges as sharp as a razor. At every yard one must force one's way through dead fern stalks (tree ferns), branches, entanglements of a tough cane called supple Jack, the climbing fern, mange-mange (Lygodium articulatum), that catch you round the neck, the arms, waist, legs, and ankles, and cannot be broken",

    "abstract": "Eight years ago last August, while hiking on Staten Island near Tottenville, along the Arthur Kill Road, which was an ordinary dirt road and very much neglected, I came to a piece of oak woods, and a place where a wood or log-road turned off through the woods: this I followed for some distance, when to my surprise and delight right near this wood-trail I saw a stand of several hundred plants of Woodwardia areolata growing in a wet sandy piece of ground. I took up several roots, packed them in damp moss, and a few days later brought them to our garden in Pittsford, about four miles from Rochester, N. Y., where they were planted in the fern beds along with many other species of ferns and shadeloving native plants. We were told that the Woodwardia areolata would not live in our part of the country, nevertheless I decided to give them a try-out. Knowing that the soil in the Staten Island wood must be strongly acid, due to the great quantities of oak leaves decaying, our plants have therefore been given a tannic acid solution about once every four weeks during the summer months. With this treatment they have thrived beautifully. Two years ago last August, while in Perth Amboy, N. J., I decided to visit my fern bed on Staten Island, so took the ferry to Tottenville. What was my surprise on reaching the Arthur Kill Road at the outer edge of Tottenville to find that a wonderful change had been wrought: here, instead of a neglected dirt road, was a concrete highway, with subdivisions, and building going on. I hurried along, wondering if someone had built a house on my fern bed. On reaching the entrance to the wood trail there was a big sign reading Lots For 88",

FERN JOUR. 13: 7-13) entitled Proliferous Ebony Spleenwort, in which she describes finding a form of Asplenium platyneuron with young plants growing attached to the rachis of the sterile fronds from axils of the lower pinnae. She concludes by saying- Who can tell the cause of this curious variation from the type? In the vernacular there is an expression, familiar perhaps to some, to the effect that one is willing to try anything once. In this spirit, I  take my pen in hand to drop you a few lines,  bearing in mind however, the adage that fools rush in where angels fear to tread. With a firm determination and no evasion of mind whatever, I shall endeavor to steer a middle course, realizing the futility of claiming kin with the heavenly host, and not relishing the alternative. Miss Marshall's question postulates the theorems that, (1) Asplenium platyneuron without proliferation is the type, and (2) Asplenium platyneuron with proliferous axillary plants is a variation from the type or a variety. Are we justified in this assumption? Let us marshal the facts. D. C. Eaton describes (Bull. Torrey Bot.",

Dr. Maxon, however, was at the time inclined to consider it a new species; and later collections of it in the same general region by Purpus and Fisher (kindly communicated to me by Dr. Maxon) apparently show that he was right and that the plant, though presumably a local off-shoot of P. astrolepis and separated from it by rather slight characters, holds these characters well and should be regarded as an established species.

Here the three specimens of Hart's-tongue so kindly sent me by Mr. Ransier have found a home and, I hope, an abiding place forever. Just above them on some rock is the walking fern (Camptosorus rhizophyllus), while around are ebony spleenworts (Asplenium platyneuron), violets, hepaticas, orchids, and lady slippers to keep them company. Here, too, the common polypody (Polypodium vulgare) is making a brave effort to become naturalized both among and on some rocks, while nearby the beech ferns (Phegopteris polypodiodes), obtuse Woodsia (Woodsia obtusa), and several of the Botrychiums seem at home. Farther on, the persimmon trees, the horse chestnut, tulip-tree, wild -cherry, maple and white birch, big old trees, make a shaded north side yard. Here among these trees we have planted native shrubs of dogwood, redbud, shadbush, wahoo, sassafras and spice bush. These make a fitting setting for our fern and wild flower sanctuary which is a never-failing source of joy throughout the season. In earliest spring we find the first delicate, uncoiling fronds of the fragile bladder fern (Cystopteris fragilis), snow trillium and hepatica, to be followed later by the bold fiddle heads of cinnamon fern (Osmunda cinna102",

The Chilean ferns that have been mentioned are nearly all delicate plants that very poorly bear the influence of man. They do not have the slightest tendency to become weeds, except Equisetum bogotense and E. pyramidale, which occasionally invade abandoned cultivated fields. It is also customarily seen along the roads just as is the Adiantum, but generally in small quantities. Various Chilean ferns may be cultivated very well, especiallly Dennstaedtia lambertiana, and also Dryopteris argentina, Blechnum chilense and B. auriculatum. They are seen occasionally in the gardens and parks of Chile, but they have not yet achieved the propagation that their beauty merits due to the fact that as yet no one has bothered about propagating them in a methodical manner.",

In E. praealtum the typical condition is to have a completely sporogenous calyx sheath and only rarely is it entirely without sporangia, while at the other end of the evolutionary series the reverse condition is the rule. In E. arvense the calyx is normally completely sterile and only occasionally does it bear one or more sporangia. In this species, out of 51 cones gathered at random, 48 had no sporangia on the calyx, while three had one or more sporangia each. The physiological gradient, on which differentiation or character expression depends, may not develop at an equal rate on opposite sides of the determinate reproductive bud; and thus one side of a whorl may be ahead of the other in expression on the transition zone. Such cases are fairly common in E. arvense, where they may be easily studied. A shoot of this nature is shown in figure 3. The last sheath below the calyx proper is half 119",

Some of them have paid us visits which have been mutually agreeable, and we trust the custom may develop into a habit. Our common language makes communication of ideas between fern-lovers across the Atlantic more easy than is practicable in the case of many nearer neighbors who are hampered by differences of speech. Whereas in America the study of ferns is mainly one of the determination and distribution of species, in our own smaller country we have for many years taken up the study of variation within the limits of the several species and this has furnished us with abundant occupation, and an ever increasing series of problems in biolQgy, morphology and cultivation. Although have been known among British ferns for more than two hundred years, it was not until the middle of the last century that the collection and study of them was seriously taken up. For a time their accumulation became a rage (i.e., during the 60s and 70s of the 19th century), so much so that the most trivial variations, not excepting actual deformities, were eagerly collected and named. This excess naturally produced a reaction, and, for a time, botanists regarded the so-called varieties with some contempt. Nevertheless, a certain number of people persisted in collecting and cultivating varieties, but gradually became more critical and less easily satisfied as to the value of certain variations. Forms exhibiting mere depauperations and eccentricities were dropped and disregarded, and attention was concentrated on those showing increased development of certain parts and especially on those tending to greater division of the segments.

    "abstract": "Among the guests at the hotel was an English lady who, with her husband, frequently went driving with an intelligent old darky for driver (there are still more carriages and horses than automobiles in Jamaica), and often she brought me some treasure. Once it was a huge frond of Dennstaedtia rubiginosa, the ternate pinnae having a spread of 54 inches. The whole frond before the stem was cut must have stood four or five feet high. Another time it was a frond of Alsophila almost as large, also ternate, the thick texture of the upward rounding pinnae suggesting more a palm than a fern. Others also brought wayside specimens from more distant counties-the Star of Bethlehem, Hemionitis palmata, the underside of the fertile leaves protected by delicate red-brown hairs; the two silver ferns, Pityrogramma tartarea and P. caltonelanos; the gold ferns, Pityrogramma sulphurea and P. chrysophylla. In the lovely tropical garden of an American friend I found Pteris serrulata, Nephrolepis pectinata, Dennstaedtia rubiginosa and Cheilanthes microphylla, and in another garden a long belt of Fern, Dryopteris normalis, which at one time had been mingled with silver fern, but all of that had been crowded out by the Pepper Fern. I was also able through the kindness of a friend to purchase a collection of small ferns brought from the higher mountains to be used commercially for decorating candle-shades, handkerchief boxes, and the like. When covered with the thin inner bark of the lace tree, which resembles a fine net, these frail-looking objects are said to last a long time. In this collection were some of the filmies-Hymenophyllum fucoides, H. splendens, Trichomanes accedens, and T. rigidum-Asplenium fragrans, and several others. 86",

    "abstract": "-A new species in the Lycopodiaceae, a firmoss, Phlegmariurus stemmermannii A.C. Madeiros & W.H.Wagner, is described and illustrated from East Maui and the island of Hawaii. A contrasting description is also given for the most closely related Hawaiian species, P. mannii (Hillebr.) W.H.Wagner. The non-strobilate Lycopodiaceae in Hawaii comprise four species and one hybrid of epiphytic, non-gemmiferous firmosses (Phlegmariurus) and five species and five hybrids of terrestrial or epipetric, gemmiferous firmosses (Huperzia). Of the former, only one of the taxa (Phlegmariurus filiformis (Sw.) W.H. Wagner) lacks pendent tassles of sporophylls, and the remainder possess the tassles. The rarest of the tassled firmosses is Mann's firmoss (P mannii). Very few collections have been made of it, all from the mountains of West and East Maui, and Hawaii. It has been studied intensively in the field by Medeiros and Hobdy over the past decade, and there seems to be no question regarding its species status. During studies of the collections at the Bishop Museum in 1993, however, W. H. Wagner recognized an unusual single specimen from Hawaii that appeared to be a new species. Subsequently, plants with the same characteristics were discovered by Medeiros in Haleakala, in East Maui. With these additional specimens it was possible to confirm the distinctive features of the new lycopod, and the results of these studies are reported here. The two species dealt with in this paper belong to 11gaard's Myrsinites subgroup, Slender to delicate plants, often with red stems, usually decussate or subdecussate leaves throughout. Leaves of the basal divisions irregular in size or shape, usually not overlapping continuously (0llgaard 1987), with approximately a dozen species, all in tropical America, except for those in Hawaii. The Hawaiian species may be recognized by the fact that the sterile portions of the shoots are relatively short, usually considerably less than 15 cm, and the fertile or partially fertile tassles are usually long, up to 25 cm, Author for correspondence.

    "abstract": "Hybrids in artificial cultures have contributed to the understanding of the systematic morphology of ferns. Since the classic work of Margaret Slosson (1902), which first proved the origin of the natural hybrid x Asplenosorus ebenoides (R. R. Scott) Wherry (=Asplenium platyneuron (L.) B.S.P. x Camptosorus rhizophyllus (L.) Link), the techniques of growing fern gametophytes and producing crosses have improved, and many new developments have ensued. In 1957, Wagner and Whitmire provided the first demonstration of the conversion of a sterile allodiploid fern to a fertile allotetraploid. In 1968, Lovis reconstructed a fertile hybrid species of fern (Asplenium ( x )adulterinum Milde). In this article, all taxa, fertile and sterile, of interspecific origin will be referred to as nothospecies, and indicated by the use of the times sign if sterile and with parentheses around the sign if fertile-i.e., (x), a convention proposed by C. Werth (pers. comm.); divergent species will be referred to as orthospecies and will lack the multiplication sign. Many important experiments on Aspleniaceae were accomplished in European laboratories especially, as discussed and summarized by Reichstein (1981). In almost all cases, such experimental hybridizations were carried out to test some hypothesis of the origin of a given nothospecies. By comparison, many fewer hybridizations have been undertaken simply to find out what a cross between taxon A and taxon B might look like, and what combining, for example, a creeping rhizome with an upright caudex, or hairs with scales, or discrete sori with acrostichoid sori, might yield morphologically. Yet such questions may bear upon our understanding of the determinants of structure and form; we may be able to gain insights that would otherwise be unavailable. The plants involved in this report are all members of the spleenwort family, Aspleniaceae, always popular objects for culture work and hybridization experiments because of their conveniently small size, ease of culture, rapid growth, and often very distinct forms. As a matter of fact, the bizarre hybrid that we briefly describe below was formed by accident. A terrarium containing numerous gametophytes of the lobed spleenwort, (x )Asplenosorus pinnatifidus (Muhl.)

    "abstract": "I recently discovered, in Herbarium at Kew, specimens of a hybrid Cyathea plant cultivated at Birmingham, England Botanical Gardens in 1890 and of two plants stated to have been parents of hybrid. The specimens were sent to Kew by W. B. Latham, who was Curator of Birmingham Gardens from 1868 to 1903. The only published reference to hybrid known to me is in an account of his career by Latham (1901), in which he stated that he raised hybrid about 1870 and that parent species were the Mexican Cyathea insignis and Norfolk Island Alsophila excelsa; he did not give a distinctive name to hybrid. He also referred to a Dicksonia hybrid which he raised in 1862 and which was named D. lathamii by Thomas Moore (1885). Thus Latham was a pioneer in fern hybridizing, although he is not mentioned in book by E. J. Lowe on subject. Lowe (1895, p. 11) recorded that when he began experiments in 1851, Thomas Moore and others told him that hybridization of ferns was impossible; for comments on Lowe's work as recorded in his book, see Lovis (1967). Although Latham accepted nomenclature which placed in different genera parent plants of his Cyathea hybrid, he evidently recognized their close relationship. They both belong to Cyathea subg. Sphaeropteris in my arrangement of Cyatheaceae of Old World (Holttum, 1963, 1964), where about 100 species of subgenus are recognized. In 1970, R. M. Tryon recognized Sphaeropteris as a distinct genus, including in it not only American species mentioned by me (1963, p. 124), but also several others which in my judgement are quite unrelated. The six American species which I regard as true Sphaeropteris were described by Tryon (1971) as the group of Sphaeropteris horrida. In this group, two species are closely allied; they are named by Tryon S. insignis (D. C. Eaton) Tryon (from Greater Antilles) and S. horrida (Liebm.) Tryon (from southern Mexico). Baker (1874, p. 17) united two as Cyathea insignis D. C. Eaton, but in cultivation Mexican species became known as C. princeps E. Mayer, and Latham so named specimen of Mexican parent of his hybrid; see Tryon (1971) for a full synonymy. Latham's specimen is sterile, but its scales indicate that it belongs either to S. insignis or to S. horrida, as named by Tryon. Latham said that it came from Mexico, and by comparison with specimens in Kew herbarium I judge that he was right. The specimen certainly does not belong to any Old World indusiate species of subg. Sphaeropteris.",

    "abstract": "The genus Equisetum is unique in its mode of branching. The branches are borne at the nodes, but they develop exogenously from the top of the nodal ring, alternating with the sheath segments or leaves. The branch buds develop between leaves rather than being axillary to the leaf, which is the arrangement found in seed plants, or with no relation to the leaves, as in ferns. It is obvious that the branches are associated with the node below them, rather than the nQde above, because if the number of leaves at a node changes, the number of branches is the same as the number of leaves below it. Although exogenous in origin, the branch bud is enclosed by the leaf sheath and must grow out through its base. Where it emerges, a fringe of sheath tissue is left around the branch base as a collar. The base of the branch is surrounded by a sheath-like structure, which differs from the regular nodal sheaths in being usually scarious, brownish in color, and unvascularized, and in lacking stomata and a subjacent internode. This structure was described at length by Duval-Jouve (1864, as gaine basilaire) who followed Vaucher (1821) in considering it a protective structure for the branch bud, analogous to the bud scales of phanerogams. Milde (1867, p. 155) thoroughly discussed the Asthiille (Ochreola). He pointed out that it is always different in color from the branch sheaths, with short, blunt teeth. According to Milde, the ochreole does not grow from the branch but rather develops from the inner cylinder of the stem. He claimed it lacked commissures so was not of fused leaves, but of a single, toothed leaf. The outer (abaxial) angle is different from the others in being thick, with a vascular bundle, chlorophyllous cells, and scattered stomata. Thus the ochreola represents a bract with a midrib, in the axil of which the branch develops. Milde emphasized that the ochreole does not terminate an internode, as do the branch and stem sheaths. It belongs not to an internode, but rather to the whole branch. He also called attention to the similarity between this and the sheath subtending the juvenile plant as it develops from the embryo. On a later page in the same publication Milde (1867, p. 379) corrected and expanded his earlier description. The Asthiille, unlike a bract, belongs to the branch rather than the main axis, and is the first leaf whorl on the branch. He compared it to the first leaf (the prophyll) on most monocot branches. Janczewski (1876) described the initiating bud as forming a vegetative cone and a basal portion. As the vegetative cone develops, the upper part of the basal portion is elevated to form a rim around the vegetative cone, and this rim represents the first sheath of the branch. Janczewski found Milde's interpretation of this as a bract subtending the branch very odd (bien singuliere). DeBlock (1923) described the ochreole as membranous and becoming brown, with no trace of stomata, chlorophyll, or vascular tissue. Johnson (1937) in describing hydathodes in Equisetum leaves, commented on their absence on the ochreole, which is thin and usually devoid of vascular tissue. Even when vasculated, the ochreole",

    "abstract": "New records for seven fern species from the Wallowa Mountains of northeastern Or- egon are detailed. Two of these, Botrychium campestre and B. paradoxum, are additions to the flora of Oregon, and Cryptogramma stelleri is finally confirmed as a member of the Oregon flora, following an unverified 1932 report. Forty-seven pteridophyte species are now known to grow in the Wallowa Mountains, more than half of the fern diversity of Oregon. Situated in the northeastern corner of Oregon, in a physiographic province that includes the Ochoco Mountains and Blue Mountains, the Wallowa Moun- tains support a flora that combines both Cascade Range and Rocky Mountain influences. The combination of geographic location, a deep elevation range, and a mix of limestone, granitic, and volcanic bedrock types combine to sup- port a relatively diverse pteridophyte flora. Mason (1980) reported 35 species of ferns and fern allies from the Wallowas. Since 1980, W. H. and F. S. Wagner have recorded four additional species of Botrychium from the Wallowas, B. crenulatum, B. ascendens, B. lineare, and B. pedunculosum. The last three species were described by Wagner and Wagner (1986, 1994), with type local- ities from the Wallowas. A recently described species of Cryptogramma, C. cascadensis E.R. Alverson (Alverson, 1989), is also well documented from her- barium collections as occurring in the Wallowas. Thus, to date, 40 species of pteridophytes have been reported from the Wallowas. The purpose of this note is to report the existence of populations of seven fern species not previously reported, or reported but not confirmed, from the Wallowa Mountains. These additions bring the total number of pteridophytes known from the Wallowa Mountains to 47 species, or 53% of the approxi- mately 88 pteridophyte species known to occur in Oregon. Of these, Botry- chium campestre and B. paradoxum are additions to the flora of Oregon (Flora of North America Editorial Committee, 1993). Cryptogramma stelleri is finally confirmed as a member of the Oregon flora, as no voucher was ever found to verify the earlier report from the Wallowa Mountains (Frye, 1932). All of our sites are in the Eagle Cap Ranger District of the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest, in Wallowa County, Oregon. Botrychium campestre W.H. Wagner & Farrar (prairie moonwort) is an east- ern grassland species noted for its peculiar, spherical root gemmae. It is re- markably disjunct in the Wallowa Mountains. The nearest recorded population is 900 km to the northeast, in Alberta. A small population of this plant was found in July 1993 by the authors with Herb and Florence Wagner at the type locality for Botrychium ascendens, in the canyon of Hurricane Creek at 1570 m. The site is a mesic meadow on calcareous colluvium, with scattered Picea",

Baker (1891) was the first to note that this taxon was anomalous in Phanerophlebia and he transferred it to Aspidium subg. Polystichum, now universally given generic status as Polystichum. It is obvious from herbarium annotations that the Brazilian botanist Brade also concluded that the species was misplaced in Phanerophlebia, but he never published the necessary combination in Polystichum. While there are no doubts that this taxon is best placed in Polystichum, its affinities within the genus are obscure and it does not appear to be closely related to other Brazilian species.",

    "abstract": "Apogamy-the formation of a sporophyte from the vegetative cells of a gametophyte-can be divided into two types, obligate and induced. Obligate apogamy is the normal means of reproduction in certain fern species; in other, normally sexually reproducing species apogamy can be induced in response to specific cultural conditions. One condition necessary for the induction of apogamy is the prevention of fertilization. This can be achieved by witholding free water from the gametophytes (Lang, 1898; Manton, 1950; Steil, 1951). Whittier and Steeves (1960) found that sugar in the growth medium promoted the induction of apogamy in certain species of ferns; in a later study (1962) they noted that the optimum sugar concentration varied from one species to another. Other conditions which also affect the induction of apogamy are the presence of various growth substances (Whittier, 1966) and of ethylene (Elmore & Whittier, 1973) in the cultures, and the intensity and quality of the light to which the gametophytes are exposed (Whittier, 1964; Whittier & Pratt, 1971). Apogamy provides a system for studying the development of sporophytic from gametophytic tissue with no change in chromosome number. In addition, when sporophytes resulting from induced apogamy can be raised to maturity, the pairing patterns of their chromosomes at meiosis may indicate the amount of homology among the chromosomes, and thus may provide some evidence as to the evolution of the species (Manton, 1950; Manton & Walker, 1954; Bouharmont, 1972; Vida, 1972). Obligate apogamy occurs in several species of Pellaea (Tryon, 1957), but apogamy has not been experimentally induced in this genus. The object of the present study was to induce apogamy in a sexual variety of Pellaea in order to determine the conditions suitable for induction of apogamy in this taxon and also to obtain apogamous sporophytes to raise to maturity for chromosomal analysis.",

    "abstract": "Throughout its range the Polypodium vulgare complex has been treated in various ways due to misapplied names and inadequately understood taxa. In South Dakota two members of the complex are present, P. hesperium Maxon and P. virginianum L., and both reach what may be their respective eastern and western distributional limits in central North America. The populations in western South Dakota have been referred to as a single species by some authors and as two species by others. I have determined that the western plants belong to a single species, P. hesperium, and that the eastern plants are P. virginianum. This represents the first documented report for this species in South Dakota. Over (1932) reported that specimens from western South Dakota belonged to a single species, P. virginianum L. Winter, Winter, and Van Bruggen (1959) segregated the plants of that area into two species, P. hesperium Maxon and P. vulgare L. (=P. virginianum), but did not discuss reasons for the separation. This treatment of the western plants was altered when Van Bruggen (1967), Brooks (1969), and Petrik (1969) referred the plants to P. vulgare L. Van Bruggen (1972) properly recognized the western South Dakota plants as P. hesperium. On specimens I examined from western South Dakota, paraphyses were not present among the sporangia, which according to Lang (1972) place the plants with P. hesperium. At present, P. hesperium has been collected in Custer (Stephens 35431 & Brooks), Pennington (Brooks 146 & Stephens), and Shannon Counties (Visher s. n., SDU), South Dakota. A specimen of P. virginianum from eastern South Dakota was found in the University of Kansas herbarium. The label on the sheet read: PLANTS OF SOUTH DAKOTA, Polypodium vulgare L., Minnihaha County: 3 miles south Garretson, Palisade Recreation Area, in crevices of Sioux quartzite outcrop, 10 July 1965, L. Harms 2688. Petrik (1969) first reported this specimen but did not distinguish it from the western South Dakota plants, referring them all to P. vulgare. I examined the Minnihaha County collection as well as several later collections made from the same site (Stephens 21317, Stephens 36487, and Brooks 1450) and determined that the plants are P. virginianum L. Frequent paraphyses were observed among the sporangia on all of the specimens examined, distinguishing the plants from P. hesperium in western South Dakota. This was substantiated by Dr. Rolla Tryon (pers. comm.), who kindly examined a specimen (Brooks 1450) from Minnihaha County, South Dakota. The Black Hills and Shannon County, South Dakota, are the only areas in the Great Plains where P. hesperium is known to occur. In these areas the plants normally grow in shaded crevices of granite rocks. Polypodium hesperium is especially frequent in areas of higher elevation in the Black Hills. The population",

    "abstract": "The genus Lindsaea has already been dealt with in detail for the Pacific Islands and the Malesian region in two papers by Kramer (1970, 1971). The present paper records additional information in the form of new records and site conditions for the Fiji group. Field observation has shown that many species of Lindsaea, both terrestrial and epiphytic, can be used as indicators of drainage patterns in the lowland rain forest in Fiji. The terrestrial species change over a very short area, but each apparently always occupies identical, restricted parts of any slope. In the epiphytic species this is reflected in the distance above ground where each grows. An example of the simplest case is shown in lowland rain-forest of southeastern Viti Levu, where the crests normally carry L. pulchra; a short distance down each side this is replaced by L. pacifica or L. harveyi; and in the wettest ground near streams L. lapeyrousii occurs. The most widespread epiphytic species, L. vitiensis, L. repens, and L. pickeringii, occur on fallen, decaying logs on the crests and increasingly higher up tree trunks as one descends the slope. If the canopy above the crest is broken for a lengthy period, L. pulchra is replaced by L. ensifolia as drying out progresses. Where extensive areas of nearly level ground are found under the same conditions, the genus appears to be completely absent. Specimens listed are in addition to those given by Kramer (1971). SUVA represents specimens held in the Herbarium of the Fiji Department of Agriculture; these are listed with accession numbers only. Collections made by the author are at present in his personal herbarium. Distribution for the two large islands is listed under the different provincial districts. For details on these and for the various regional climatic zones mentioned, reference can be made to Derrick (1955). Synonyms and references listed under the individual species are limited as far as possible to those publications dealing entirely or largely with Fiji. Full details are given in Kramer (1970, 1971).",

    "abstract": "Ophioglossum engelmannii Prantl (Ophioglossaceae) is a North American fern whose reported geographical range extends from Florida to Arizona and southcentral Mexico north to northwestern Virginia, southern Ohio, southern Indiana, Missouri, Kansas, and Oklahoma.Plants of this species have been found growing in prairies, in open, grassy woodlands, on bluffs, in clay barrens, and in cedar (limestone) barrens and glades (Clausen, 1938;Fernald, 1950).Throughout its range, O. engelmannii is restricted to limestone soils, and thus Palmer (1932) considered it a strict calciphile.In a study of its soil reaction preferences, Wherry (1926) found that O. engelmannii is restricted to soils with a neutral to slightly alkaline pH.Information on macro-geographical distribution and general habitats of the species, as well as taxonomic data, can be found in several taxonomic works (Clausen, 1938;Fernald, 1950;Shaver, 1954;Gleason, 1952).The anatomy of the vegetative organs, as well as some aspects of sexual reproduction, also have been studied (Bold, 1967).Although this unusual fern is of much interest to botanists, little information is available on its autecology.Thus, the purpose of this paper is to report (1) observations made on the ecology of O. engelmannii in cedar glades of Kentucky and Tennessee, with special reference to its vegetative life cycle and (2) results of laboratory studies on the temperature relations of bud growth and dormancy.",

Newly generated rbcL data representing the North American taxon Parathelypteris simulata places it in the Coryphopteris clade, as well. In consideration of ecological and phylogenetic evidence, the new combination Coryphopteris simulata is proposed.",

    "abstract": "The American tree fern Dicksonia sellowiana reaches its northern distribution limit in Mexico. This species grows only in the highly fragmented remnants of the montane cloud forest (MCF). Given the lack of data on ecological aspects of this endangered tree fern species, considered under special protection by Mexican legislation, the objectives of the present research were to investigate the structure of D. sellowiana populations and to characterize its habitats. The study was carried out in seven populations located at different elevations and latitudes in the MCF of the Sierra Madre Oriental in Mexico. In each locality, three sampling plots were established to characterize the habitat and to record density, height, stem diameter, number of leaves, and individual fertility. The resulting values were analyzed with univariate and multivariate statistics. In four of the D. sellowiana populations, individuals of low height predominated; these were classified as dynamic populations. However, the density of individuals by unit area was low compared with some South American populations, probably because of the high degree of fragmentation of the MCF. The variation in population density was mainly explained by the vegetation cover. Environmental factors such as elevation and slope orientation, however, explained better the variation of the basal area of tree fern populations. These results constitute the first reference on the current state of Mexican D. sellowiana populations, which is important for the management and conservation of this endangered species, and for monitoring changes in the environmental conditions of its natural habitat, the MCF of Mexico.",

When my food gives out, or the amount of my collections become burdensome, I come back to civilization long enough to care for the plants, feed up, and set out again. This past year I was late in getting started, but on July 22 I alighted at the Mt. Baker Lodge, altitude 4200 feet, and began one of the shortest but most successful seasons I have ever had. I gathered both flowering plants and ferns, but here I shall mention only the ferns I found, except to say that I have found about seven new species and varieties of the former. I should like to tell of the many thrills I experienced with bears, eagles, weather, etc., but that belongs elsewhere. Between the date above and August 20, I made two visits to Mt. Baker, one to Mt. Rainier, one to Mt. Angeles in the Olympics, and one to Mt. Stuart in the heart of the Wenatchee Mountains.

Populations in Colorado were monitored for 20 years and for five years in Minnesota following translocation. Botrychium is mycoheterotrophic, so moving the soil containing mycorrhizae surrounding and attached to the plants is key to successful relocation. Two different methods of translocation were used to move plants and soil. Colorado populations declined 99% over 20 years. Minnesota populations declined 64% over five years. The success of these translocations appears to be poor as evidenced by the declining return of aboveground plants. It is possible that populations could return through the spore bank assuming that site conditions remain consistent. Results suggest that translocation is not a viable conservation tool within the typical management planning horizons of natural resource agencies.",

Although occurring in an ephemeral, vernal, seaside rock pool habitat thought to be indicative of I. nuttallii, field observations and morphological investigations determined these plants to be a distinctive taxon possessing small and boldly ornamented megaspores, relatively large microspores, and a regionally unique short velum coverage of the sporangia. It is reminiscent, particularly in spore ornamentation, of the aquatic, mid-season I. maritima and is known from one site (possibly two) where no living plants are presently evident. A unique combination of uncommon morphological features, restricted geographic range, rare habitat, and early growth season distinguishes these plants as distinct from all known Isoetes taxa. Isoetes salishensis, sp. nov. is proposed as an addition to the growing list of flora and fauna endemic to or centered on the Salish Sea area of southwestern British Columbia and northwestern Washington State.",

Both fertile plants and their hybrid are morphologically close, and can be identified by differences in frond morphology (Fig. 1) and perispore pattern (Sleep, 1971, 1975; Salvo et al., 1986). Plants of P. setiferum, P. aculeatum and P. Xbicknellii were found growing together in the Spanish Central Pyrenees, thus giving a good opportunity to study the influence of both parents on the hybrid's spore morphology (structure and external morphology of the perispore).

Spores of the three specimens were suspended in water and cut by means of a freezing microtome following the method of Muller (1973). Sections were transferred to slides and mounted in gum chloral for light microscopy observations, and air dried, mounted on an aluminum stub and gold coated for SEM studies.

    "abstract": "The pteridophytes of Hawaii have received relatively little attention from botanists during the past half-century. However, intensive recent studies in the islands have revealed a number of previously undescribed species, including the quillwort named here. Quillworts have been found in Hawaii several times since early this century. Between 25 September and 17 October 1917, Charles N. Forbes discovered Isoetes from pools atop Mt. Eke on the island of Maui (Forbes 682. M. BISH). Forbes did not recognize his collection to be Isoetes. It was not until 17 October 1977, when F. R. Warshauer collected Isoetes from the east slope of Mauna Kea on the island of Hawaii (Warshauer & McEldowney 1500 BISH), that Hawaiian botanists realized there was a native quillwort in the flora. Robert W. Hobdy again discovered Isoetes in pools on the summit of Mt. Eke on 23 October 1980 (Hobdy 931 BISH), and he collected it once more from the same site on 21 October 1982 (Hobdy 1705-1710 BISH). Study of these specimens and three later collections from Mt. Eke (Taylor 5332, 5658 MIL and Palmer 672 BISH) indicates that these Hawaiian quillwort acquisitions represent a previously undescribed species of Isoetes.",

    "abstract": "The genus Christella (Thelypteridaceae) is comprised of approximately 50 species distributed predominantly in the Old World tropics but also in the Americas (Holttum 1977). Two native Christella species, C. cyatheoides (Kaulf.) Holttum and C. boydiae (Eaton) Holttum occur in Hawai'i (Wagner, 1981). Christella cyatheoides is a common and characteristic component of matted fern understory of Hawaiian rain forest. Christella boydiae is a much rarer diminutive species of rocky stream courses. Christella boydiae has been collected only from the Ko'olau range of O'ahu, Kipahulu and Waiho'i Valleys on East Maui, and along low elevation watercourses near Hilo on Hawai'i. Currently it is only known from one of these historic populations at Kipahulu Valley. There are 20 specimens of C. boydiae in the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum Herbarium Pacificum (BISH) that represent 18 or fewer collections. Most of these specimens are in poor condition and as typical of collections made prior to 1910, have little or no collection information. The species has been most often collected on O'ahu. Of these, six specimens (one third of the total at BISH) were made between 1900 and 1908 by either of the noted Hawaiian botanists, C.N. Forbes or J.F. Rock, mostly from the Punalu'u region of the Ko'olau range. The last collection of Christella boydiae on O'ahu was made prior to 1908. However, Warren H. Wagner found that this species was still present in the Punalu'u area of the Ko'olau range on O'ahu as late as 1965 (Kaluanui Stream, rock shelves, Castle trail, Hau'ula Forest Reserve, Ko'olau range, W H. Wagner and S. Carlquist 65270 MICH). Since that time, many exotic weeds, noteably Clidemia hirta (Melastomataceae), have invaded the area and this species has apparently disappeared. On Hawai'i island, the species, to our knowledge, has been collected only once. Until recently, Christella boydiae had been collected only three times on Maui, first in 1881 in Kipahulu Valley (EL. Clarke s.n., BISH) without further location information. Then after 86 years, C. boydiae was again collected in Kipahulu Valley in 1967 (R. DeWreede 30) along Palikea stream at 915m (Lamoureux, 1968). A third Maui collection was made in 1973 in adjacent Waiho'i Valley as part of the NSF-sponsored Waiho'i Valley Research Project (B. Harrison 10) at 915-1040 m along Waiohonu stream where it was a rare fern from a shady location under a ledge associated with hymenophyllaceous ferns and various mosses along the stream bank (B. Harrison-Gagne, pers. comm.). Neither of these collections is present in the cabinets at the Herbarium Pacificum (BISH): although the latter is in the University of Hawai'i collection. Fourteen specimens at the Herbarium Pacificum (BISH) include the year of collection. Of these, eight were collect86",

Smith in the labyrinth of ravines of the Tunica Hills region 2 miles northwest of Weyanoke, in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana (Israel in 1979, LSU). A second population of approximately 80 plants was discovered on September 10, about three miles from the first location in deep ravines on Ouida Irondale Road 4 miles east from La-66 (Landry 78574, LSU, MICH). During the exploration of ravines on September 17 in Wilkinson County, Mississippi, which is due north of West Feliciana Parish, a single plant of C. fortunei was observed growing at a waterfall on Clark Creek, north of the settlement of Pond (Landry 78593, LSU). Following these discoveries, we found that C. fortunei had been collected by Dr. R. Dale Thomas, 3 miles North of Tunica, Louisiana in October, 1974 (Thomas 42096, NLU, LSU). The collection was identified by Dr. A. Murray Evans. The discovery of this fern represents a new addition to the presently known floras of Louisiana (Thieret, 1972) and Mississippi (Evans, 1978). Cyrtomium fortunei is characterized by a short, erect rhizome covered with dark, lanceolate to ovate, acuminate scales. The fronds are pinnate with 23 or more pairs of lanceolate, dull green pinnae having a prominent, darkened midvein. Cyrtomium fortunei is easily recognized by its papyraceous fronds and minutely serrate pinnae, as opposed to the commonly cultivated C. falcatum Presl, which has coriaceous fronds with entire, glossy pinnae. Nearly all stages of reproduction were observed in the populations of C. fortunei. The largest plants were 75-90 cm high and had all fertile fronds. But plants 30 cm or less high also had some fertile fronds. Profuse reproduction was evident from the large number of sporelings having two or three fronds. The largest plants were predominantly on the upper sides of the ravines, whereas the smallest were confined to the ravine bottoms. The Tunica Hills region is characterized by hills with loess deposits ranging from 1 to 60 m thick. Elevations in the area vary from 60 to more than 90 m above sea level. The hills are highly eroded by streams, and form narrow ridge tops with correspondingly steep to vertical slopes ending in ravines. The vegetation is classified as a mixed mesophytic forest association modified by Magnolia and other subtropical broadleaf species. In all locations, the associated species were Magnolia grandiflora, Fagus grandifolia, Ilex opaca, Cornusflorida, and Arundinaria gigantea. Other pteridophytes observed include Adiantum pedatum, Cystopteris fragilis, Athyrium pycnocarpon, A. thelypteroides, Polystichum acrostichoides, and Equisetum hyemale.",

    "abstract": "This article updates the treatment of the genus Botrychium Swartz (Grape Ferns and Moonworts) in Arizona and provides a key and illustrations as an aid to their identification. The most recently published key including all the species of Botrychium found in Arizona is that in the monographic treatment of the Ophioglossaceae by Clausen (1938). Four species of Botrychium have been reported previously from Arizona: B. lanceolatum, B. lunaria (San Francisco Peaks), B. multifidum (White Mountains), and B. virginianum (Santa Rita Mountains) (Maxon, 1942; Phillips, 1946-1947; Morton, 1951). The examination of extensive field collections of botrychiums in Arizona and of specimens in five Arizona herbaria (ARIZ, ASC, ASU, ASUF, and MNA) has revealed additional records for the State. All specimens examined by me are cited in the following checklist. Three additional specimens cited by previous authors but not examined by me are also included. Botrychium boreale, B. dissectum f. obliquum, and B. dusenii are reported here as new to Arizona. Second localities within the State for B. lanceolatum, B. lunaria, and B. multifidum are based upon collections from the White Mountains. These reports for the three taxa new to Arizona represent considerable range extensions for each species. Botrychium boreale was previously known only as far south as northern Nevada (Cronquist et al., 1972), northern Utah (Flowers, 1944), and northern Colorado (Weber, 1966), over 600 km north of the Arizona localities. This report of B. dissectum f. obliquum represents a westward range extension of 1370 km from known stations in eastern Kansas (Petrik-Ott, 1975). I have examined a collection of B. dusenii from Charleston Peak, Clark County, Nevada (Clokey & Ely in 1937, ASU), which is about 300 km west of the San Francisco Peaks locality. The richest areas in Arizona for botrychiums are the two highest mountains, the San Francisco Peaks and Mount Baldy (Fig. 8). On the San Francisco Peaks, botrychiums are quite common from 2900 to 3550 m elevation. They are most plentiful in the meadows of the Inner Basin (2900-3100 m), where B. boreale, B. dusenii, B. lunaria, and B. lanceolatum occur together. The meadows are surrounded by a spruce-aspen forest. Large logs (presumably the result of a forest fire many years ago) are scattered over the undulating, rocky terrain. Juniperus communis, Lonicera involucrata, and Ribes sp. are common shrubs. Herbaceous angiosperms include Anemone globosa, Arenaria fendleri, Carex spp., Castilleja linariifolia, Fragaria ovalis, Lathyrus arizonicus, Poafendleriana, Potentilla pulcherrima, Pseudocymopteris montanus, Solidago decumbens, Solidago multiradiata, Swertia radiata, and Zigadenus elegans. Cystopteris is the only other",

Despite Christensen's (1913, 1920) efforts to untangle the problems during his work on the comprehensive genus Dryopteris, the taxonomy remains quite confused. Collections are for the most part inadequate, as the difficulties encountered in the transportation and preparation of large ferns have prompted many botanists either to pass them by or to make only fragmentary specimens. Nevertheless, a new species has come to light, and I have also found it necessary to describe a new variety of C. equestris. In addition, two new combinations are needed for taxa occurring in Guatemala.",

Baker, which is characterized by having dorsiventrally flattened shoots comprising two lateral rows of larger leaves plus two medial rows of smaller leaves. According to Baker's (1883-1885) scheme of classification, S. eatonii is closely related to the other heterophyllous Selaginellae of eastern North America, namely S. apoda (L.) Spring, S. eclipes Buck, and S. ludoviciana A. Braun. When J. K. Small (1918, p. 67) originally described S. eatonii, he credited Hieronymus with being the author. No specimens of it were cited, although Small reported the plant as growing on limestone in the Everglade Keys; he also stated that the plant was first collected in 1903.

    "abstract": "macrospora Dur. is a northern species widely distributed throughout eastern Canada and the northeastern United States west to Minnesota (Pfeiffer, 1922; Wherry, 1961). Recently, populations of this species were found in the Little Tennessee and Hiwassee Rivers of southeastern Tennessee. The only other report of this species from the southeastern United States is that of Svenson and Griscom (1935), who cite it from northern Virginia. This report was accepted by Massey (1944, 1960) and by Harvill, Stevens, and Ware (1977) for the Virginia Flora, but was not mentioned by either Fernald (1950) or by Gleason and Cronquist (1963). There had been some confusion concerning the county of this Virginia collection. The voucher located in the Brooklyn Botanical Garden Herbarium is labeled Isoetes macrospora Dur., Shallow Water. Passage Creek. Macrospores Average 650 /. Frederic Co., VA. L. Griscom and H. K. Svenson 5561, July 2, 1933. Massey (1944) cited the collection as being from Passage Creek in Shenandoah County. This is verified by C. E. Stevens (pers. comm), who corresponded with Svenson, and indicated that Svenson still recalls the locations along Passage Creek as being in Shenandoah County. Recently, this location was examined by A. M. Evans, and plants of . macrospora were found to occur frequently in the shallow, cobble-bottomed pools of the Elizabeth Furnace area. Both the 1935 and 1978 collections from Passage Creek and the recent collections from the Little Tennessee and Hiwassee Rivers represent significant disjunctions from the glaciated, northern, contiguous range of I. macrospora to the unglaciated Ridge and Valley province of Virginia and Tennessee. The Passage Creek population is ca. 300 miles from the northern range, and the Tennessee populations are ca. 450 miles from the Virginia population. In the Little Tennessee and Hiwassee Rivers, the known populations of I. macrospora are limited to sections of river between upstream dams and impounded waters of mainstream reservoirs of the Tennessee River. The habitat is essentially riverine and consists of an alternating series of pool and riffle areas. Water depth is generally shallow (<2 m), but varies depending on releases from upstream dams. These releases also help to maintain a cool water temperature throughout the year (15 to 19? C in July, 1978). Individual plants ofI. macrospora were found rooted in sand-filled crevices of the rocky, cobble substrate in the moderateto fast-flowing water of pool areas that are 0.1 to 1.5 m deep. Plants growing in areas of weak currents have slightly erect to recurved leaves which spread from the corm in a symmetrical ring. In areas of strong current, the leaves are prominently recurved and fixed by the downstream current, giving the plants a striking, swept-back aspect.",

    "abstract": "After much loo long a wait, Boughton Cobb's guide to ferns is once again available.Elizabeth Farnsworth and Cheryl Lowe are to be congratulated for rewriting, with the assistance of a host of area specialists from across North America, this new version of a familiar favorite.Species coverage in the new addition is expanded and updated, taking advantage of now discoveries and new understandings within the field of pteridology.Each taxon entry begins mmon ecology and range.The greatly amplified morphological characterizations that follow are broken down by character and emphasize distinctive features.Treatments generally conclude with a short, concise 'notes' section that covers especially diagnostic features, similar species and, in the case of wellunderstood polyploids, ancestral taxa.All in all, this second edition fulfills the presumed goal of providing an update of Cobb\\s original field guide.This new guide is a fancier, glossier version of the original with new sketches, by co-author Elizabeth Farnsworth, to supplement the elegant simplicity of Laura Louise Fisher's original artwork.It is unfortunate that some of these newer drawings did not reproduce well and appear rather coarser than Fisher's plates.The line art is, however, reinforced with 105 illustrative color photos as well as numerous others added for art's sake.With few exceptions these photos add greatly to an appreciation of form and characteristics of the plants being illustrated.This field guide, while a wonderful and artistic production, is not without problems.Most seriously, in my opinion, is that it suffers from a certain amount of 'unevenness' in content, format and organization.Color plates appear outside of species treatments, either with the generic treatment or following full species treatments, on those pages reserved for 'secondary species'.I get a sense that their use within the book is more opportunistic than planned: Dryopteris with 13 taxa has four color plates; the monotypic OnocleQ, Marsilea and Deparia each have 2 plates apiece; and several genera, Azolla, Pleopeltis, Pteridiuni, Schizaea, Ophioglossum, Lycopodiella, Psuadolycopodiella and Isootes, have no photographic plates at all.Such organizational problems are not unique to the illustrations.As part of the introductory section, for example, there is a rather nice, 5-page, illustrated introduction to fern morphology.This section, however, is not integrated with the sometimes redundant, 7-page glossary at the end of the book.In this same vein, the introductory section 'Tern Habitats and Conservation\" is separated from the topically associated 'Terns in Cultivation and Culture\" section at the back of the book.",

    "abstract": "While making a floristic survey of the pteridophytes of the Highlands, North Carolina area (Macon County) with Dr. Warren H. Wagner, Jr., I discovered a population of Botrychium virginianum containing many small but fertile specimens. An apparently similar population has been described for the I\\Iountain Lake (Giles County) area in Virginia (Wagner, 1963, pp. 130-131.) Investigation of the Macon County plants showed a considerable percentage of the plants attached to large gametophytes. Whereas juvenile plants typically are found attached to a gametophyte (Bierhorst, 1958), the plants found near Highlands showed a wide range of developmental stages. Many were fully fertile with small leaves 3-5 cm broad (Fig. 1). These juvenile specimens have had the name B. virginianum var. gracile (Pursh) Lawson applied to them, but are not worthy of taxonomic recognition (Weatherby, 1935). Precociously fertile sporophytes may be due to abundant nutrition supplied by long-lived gametophytes. Gametophytes of most ferns usually die after the sporophyte has become self-sufficient. This is not strictly the case in the eusporangiate genus Botrychium where gametophytes have been reported still attached to sporophytes at least two years old (Foster, 1964) and up to eight years old (Jeffrey, 1896-97, pp. 271272). Campbell (1911, p. 18) mentions that fertile B. virginianum sporophytes with attached gametophytes were found by Jeffrey, but similar plants are not mentioned by later workers. Bierhorst (1958) believes that a relatively small number of gametophytes persist after giving rise to a sporophyte. He states that in areas where sporophytes of all ages are present it is not the older sporophytes with attached gametophyte which predominate,",

My fieldwork in the southwestern United States and Mexico has been concerned particularly with collecting spore-bearing material of as many species as possible to be used for studies of the gametophytes. In a number of instances species and varieties were collected in areas not previously recorded for the plants in question. These notes are intended, therefore, to bring distribution records and related matters up to date. The most recent floras and monographs are accepted as accurate accounts of previous collections. Unless otherwise stated, the collection numbers are mine. CHEILANTIIES MEXICANA Davenp. Knobloch and Correll (1962) state that this species is confined to Chihuahua and San Luis Potosi. However, its distribution is known to be more general. It is very abundant and well-developed in the mountains of Guanajuato between the towns of Guanajuato and Dolores Hidalgo (1968, 3078). It also occurs in northern Jalisco (1981) and to the northwest in Durango (3166, 3173). In the last named localities the plants were in much more exposed and drier habitats than the oak woods of Guanajuato. Ecologically this very close relative of C. lendigera (Cav.) Swartz is quite distinct; at least, all of my collections of the latter came from much more moist situations than those occupied by C. mexicana. C. LINDHEIMERI (J.

    "abstract": "Horticultural knowledge concerning the fertilization requirements of ferns is far greater than the literature indicates. Experienced fern growers have known for a long time that proper fertilization of ferns enhances their growth and beauty. Equally well known is the fact that ferns suffer readily from improper fertilization. Considering these two points, the complex reactions between plants and soil, and the reports of individual gardeners, the result is a confused potpourri of advice. Much of what is written by individual gardeners is solid, practical advice, but many times it is applicable only to a particular fertilizer or soil mix, pattern of watering, quality of the water, or other specialized condition. There is a need for trained personnel to ascertain through controlled studies more precisely the response of ferns to mineral needs. This information would be of great interest not only to the horticulturists, but also to ecologists and others who deal with ferns as experimental material. The diversity of fern habitats, which ranges from tree tops to rocks to heavy clay soils, opens up a whole field of possible investigations on soil and mineral studies. However, this paper is written with the needs of the amateur fern grower in mind, and concerns some of the basic practices and principles in providing minerals to ferns through fertilization.",

Hormonal concentrations of seven different gibberellic acids, GA7, GA4, GA3, GAg, GA1, GA5, and GA8, in order of decreasing relative activity, have been shown to be strikingly active in initiating formation of male reproductive organs in Anemia phyllitidis (L.) Swartz. In contrast, gibberellic acid has little or no effect on the gametophytes of a wide range of species from other families, such as the Blechnaceae, Pteridaceae, Polypodiaceae, Osmundaceae, Cyatheaceae, Davalliaceae, or Aspidiaceae (Voeller, 1964a, b). In a remarkable variety of respects, the effects of gibberellic acid on Anemia phyllitidis are indistinguishable from the effects of the naturally occurring antheridium-inducing hormone, antheridogen-B, produced by A. phyllitidis: (i) the two substances each show specificity of organ induction, i.e., antheridia are induced, but archegonia, rhizoids, papillae, etc., are not; (ii) the time interval between application of and response to either hormone is quite similar; (iii) the sequence of cell divisions giving rise to the organ is the same, and the resultant sperms swim actively and are apparently functional; (iv) and the dosage-response curve of the antheridogen is distinctive and paralleled by that for gibberellic acid.",

Alma Stokey w:a. born June 17, 1877, in Canton, Ohio, the second of five children of Margaret Purvines and Charles Frederick Stokey. She grew up in rolling, fertile eastern Ohio, which may explain why she was so content to spend most of her life in comparable New England. After High School in Canton, she taught in a public school before entering Oberlin College, then interrupted her studies by teaching to finance her college course, and took her B.A. at Oberlin in 1904, where she remained as an assistant in botany (1904-6). Her interests at college seem to have been as varied as in her later life. She sang in a choral group, as she was to do in others later. Not an athlete, with no hope of making a team, she nevertheless played basketball because practice players were needed. She was interested in foreign languages, and became proficient in Latin, German and French. Her interest in botany began under Dr. Frederick Grover, one of Oberlin's outstanding teachers. She attained her Ph.D. at the University of Chicago under the tutelage of Dr. John M. Coulter and Dr. W. J. G. Land, and published her first botanical articles The roots of Lycopodium pithyoides in 1907 and The anatomy of Isoetes in 1909. In 1908 she came to Mount Holyoke College as an instructor in botany, became an associate professor in 1911 and a full professor in 1916,",

    "abstract": "central Louisiana. Consideration of distribution of fern species in this region has been neglected except for incomplete references made by Brown and Correll (1942) and Moore (1956). The present study was initiated to prepare a checklist of species and their habitats within Lincoln Parish. Lincoln Parish is located in the central part of north Louisiana (Lat. 32?27' to 32?45'N and Long. 92025' to 92?55'W). The terrain consists of low, rolling, sandy or clay hills. The present vegetation is mainly second growth coniferous forest, with hardwood species restricted to small stream valleys and in related swampy or boggy regions. A preliminary survey indicated the existence of a number of probable fern habitats, such as open fence rows, open woodland, dense woodland, open bogs, and shaded bogs. The selection of twelve sites for examination and collection of fern species was made to include all the habitat types. Prior to 1962, ten fern species had been reported from this area. These were: Osmunda cinnamomea, Athyrium filix-femina, Thelypteris hexagonoptera, Polystichum acrostichoides, Pteridium aquilinum var. pseudocaudatum (Brown & Correll, 1938); Botrychium virginianum, Botrychium dissectum var. obliquum, Woodwardia areolata, Onoclea sensibilis, and Polypodium polypodiodes (Moore, 1956). During the present study, six species previously unreported from this area were found: Aspleniuim platyneuron, Osmunda regalis var. spectabilis, Woodwardia virginica, Thelypteris normalis, Ophioglossulm vulgatum, and Cystopteris fragilis. In addition, the reported, but unconfirmed, presence of the following species were noted: Woodsia obtusa, Athyrium thelypterioides, Adiantum pedatum, and Lygodilum japonicum. 33",

    "abstract": "The forests of Borneo are famous for their plant diversity, but this diversity is seriously threatened. Despite remarkable progress, the taxonomic status and geographic distribution of many species have not been clarified. Here, we explore the use of DNA barcoding to improve not only the recording of local species diversity, but also our understanding of the fern Tree-of-Life. We focused specifically on grammitid ferns collected at Gunung Tama Abu in Sarawak. The four new samples comprised three species of which two were studied using molecular phylogenetics for the first time. These three species were found to be nested in clades corresponding to the established generic taxonomy. The two sampled accessions of Acrosorus streptophyllus formed a sister clade to A. friderici-et-pauli. By increasing the inclusion of Acrosorus species from one to two in the assembled phylogenetic hypothesis, our results provide support to the monophyly of this genus based on DNA sequence data for the first time. The newly sampled Borneo accession of Scleroglossum pyxidatum was sister to a clade comprising accessions of S. sulcatum, whereas the sample of Prosaptia alata formed a clade together with other accessions of this species. In conclusion, DNA barcoding of samples obtained during fieldwork in remote but species rich places enhance the recording of the Tree-of-Life and enable the establishment of reliable DNA barcodes for species rich lineages.",

    "abstract": "The Marsileaceae is a small family of semi-aquatic ferns displaying numerous traits commonly observed in angiosperms, including heterospory, sophisticated hydraulic architecture, and high rates of atmospheric gas exchange. Despite these similar traits, Marsileaceae is comparatively ecologically limited. Most species are found in Marsilea which is sister to Regnellidium and Pilularia, together these two genera include only seven species. Here we studied the anatomy and physiology of Marsileaceae to better understand the potential constraints on ecological and species diversity in this family. We focused on epidermal anatomy and stomatal responses to changes in light and water availability, which are unique amongst ferns. We found two evolutionary strategies in Marsileaceae, one of morphological simplification, physiological inflexibility, and aquatic specialization in Pilularia; which contrasts with a strategy of maximizing photosynthetic carbon gain at the expense of high rates of water loss in Marsilea and Regnellidium. We conclude that aquatic environments provide evolutionary opportunities for physiological innovation with regard to stomatal function, as well as selective pressures that drive the canalized evolution of highly specialized aquatic forms.",

Eminent fern students of those earlier days had few specimens and those often in such curled-up, poor condition that it is not surprising the species did not stand-out as more definite entities. The farinose Notholaenas were usually determined as Notholaena cretacea Liebm. or as Notholaena candida (Mart. and Gal.) Hooker. With the large United States National Herbarium at hand, Dr. William R. Maxon straightened out much of the resulting confusion in this and other fern groups of western North America. There is, however, an entity, and to me a striking one, which has apparently always been determined as N. candida, or not named at all, and which Dr. Maxon seems to have overlooked. This fern has a unique aspect, distinguishing characters and a range distinct and separate from that of N. candida. Notholaena candida (Mart. and Gal.) Hook. (Cheilanthes candida Mart. and Gal.) was founded on Galeotti's collection no. 6442. In the discussion after the",

    "abstract": "That large section of Costa Rica which lies to the south of San Jose, its capital city, is nearly all wild, mountainous, sparsely inhabited, forested country. The backbone of the region is the non-volcanic Cordillera de Talamanca, which rises in the craggy summits of Chirripo (12,580 feet) to the most elevated point between Guatemala and Colombia. On the highest treeless summits of this range are found the northernmost outposts of the pdramo formation of the Andes; corresponding elevations in Guatemala support a vegetation far more Arctic-alpine than Andean in composition and appearance. The broken foothills of the Cordillera push down nearly or quite to the coasts, leaving at best a narrow coastal plain. Lofty, humid forests sweep up almost unbroken from the seashore nearly to the tops of the highest mountains. Although to the north of the Gulf of Nicoya the Pacific coast of Central America is nearly everywhere arid or semi-arid, in southern Costa Rica this side is almost as wet as the opposite Caribbean slope. Seven years' records from Pedregoso in the basin of El General show an annual rainfall ranging from 88 to 167 inches.1 The Pacific slopes of the Cordillera de Talamanca drain into the Rio Grande de Terraba, which flows for a long way parallel to the Cordillera. The upper portion of the Terraba Valley is the valley, or more properly basin, of El General. Aside from the pioneer explora-",

Upon arrival there we inquired of a local store keeper as to the location of a camp site. He suggested a shady spot at the rear of a school ground. When we questioned the propriety of setting up there he said, Well, I gave them the land and I reckon I can let you camp there.  As it was late, we quickly made ourselves snug for the night. Next morning, scholars began arriving before we were up. In fact they woke us by their subdued talk and speculations about our trailer outfit. We washed, made breakfast ready, ate and washed the dishes, with an increasing crowd of scholars surrounding us. The following morning Mrs. Ransier suggested that they sing for us, and sing they did. Two girls in particular treated us to a seemingly endless folklore song. Perhaps it was improvised! The school bell was all that stopped it, anyway. Then all the people felt it their duty to call on us, even an old tottering man and his wife. When it became known that we were going to look for  ebenoides,  one of the better class ladies volunteered the information that they grew upon her land, that she was just starting for home, and that she would be happy to take us right to the  ravine  but that College Professors had searched wihout finding any. We were dropped about half a mile out and started down the gully at once. It was extremely hot and sultry and the footing fierce. A quarter of a mile and sure 76",

    "abstract": "the ground in January. By March it is fully mature, and by fall has completely disappeared. B. alabamense starts growth in July and is fully mature in September, the fronds persisting until the next spring or early summer. It appears that the separation has not been completely perfected, however, as we find occasional plants that are not mature in late fall. I found one in December with an immature fertile frond, and in Professor Hopkins' herbarium there is a specimen collected by W. C. Dukes of Mobile, Alabama, that had an immature spike in October. It will take more field study with these two Botrychiums before this point can be settled. (Figures 8 and 9 were drawn from specimens that I collected near Mobile, Alabama.) In conclusion, I wish to express my gratitude to Mrs. Weatherby for making the excellent drawings, and to Mr. Weatherby, Dr. Maxon, and others for help in preparing this paper.",

It has been passed upon by the best fern authorities in the United States, and the writer does not know that its standing as a species has been questioned by any botanist. The fact that only three plants have been found at the only known station makes it one of the strongest single items of evidence for the hypothesis under discussion. Facts as to the presence of endemic species and of limited and peculiar areas of distribution which strikingly parallel those that appear in the ferns have recently been reported for the crustaceans, insects, fishes, reptiles, and the small burrowing mammals of Florida. Plans for the collation of this varied evidence are now in progress. One zoological study which discusses the problem at some length has already been published.6 FLORAL CITY, FLORIDA.",

The information included here was obtained during work in the field, herbarium and library while studying the flora of San Diego County. San Diego County lies in the extreme southwestern corner of the United States. It was one of the original twenty-seven counties into which California was divided by the State Legislature in 1851, but at that time comprised, in addition to its present 4,221 square miles, all of Imperial County and a part of what is now Riverside County.",

    "abstract": "Monterrey is the largest city in northern Mexico and capital of the state of Nuevo Le6n. It is joined by the Pan American Highway with Laredo, Texas, and Mexico City. A good highway extends from Monterrey westward to Saltillo which is located on the one hundred and first meridian. Because of Monterrey's strategic position, it is visited each year by many people from the United States. Some spend a few days there and then return to Texas. Others simply stop overnight on the way to more distant points. Since accommodations for visitors are many and good, members of the Fern Society may wish to make this city their headquarters while they survey the interesting ferns of the mountains roundabout. All species which are listed below from the quadrangle (25?-26? N., 100?-101? W.) can be seen on trips of a day's duration from Monterrey. The area under discussion is semiarid, mountainous country. It is located towards the northern end of the eastern Sierra Madre, but on the west includes a portion of the central plateau and in the northeast a lobe of the Coastal Plain. The rocks are preponderantly limestone, with the strata much folded. Those of the mountains are of Lower Cretaceous or Jurassic Age, but those in the north and also the plateau and Coastal Plain portions are of Upper Cretaceous age. The altitudinal range is from 300 meters on the Coastal Plain to 3600 meters in the mountains. The temperature varies with the altitude, whereas the rainfall decreases westward and is least on the plateau. The following statistics from a paper on the climatology of Mexico by Contreras Arias (1942) indicate the situation: Villa de Santiago, long. 100? 8' W., alt. 445 m., aver. ann. temp. 21.7? C., aver. ann. rainfall 1039 mm. 89",

Almost every area of forest boasts at least a few specimens of this beautiful fern, and in some of the hammocks it forms one of the most prominent forms of herbaceous vegetation. This species grows in a wide variety of habitats, being found in the thick humus on the ground surface, on the limestone ledges of large sink-holes, on the perpendicular sides of smaller limestone pot-holes, on rotting prostrate tree trunks, part way up the trunks of trees, or even high in their branches.",

    "abstract": "At least four species of the Gleicheniaceous genus Dicranopteris Bernh. grow in the Hawaiian Islands. These interesting ferns, known locally as uluhe or False Staghorn Fern, are D. glauca, D. linearis, D. owhyhensis, and D. emarginata. It is with the last of this group that we wish to deal in this paper. Dicranopteris emarginata was originally described in 1854 by Brackenridge as Mertensia emarginata (not to be confused with Mertensia emarginata Raddi, 1825). Since that time it has been known under several names, now all reduced to synonymy under D. emarginata (Brack.) Robinson. These are the following: Gleichenia emarginata Moore (1862),  Gleichenia emarginata (Brack.) Hbd. MacCaughey (1918), Gleichena dichotoma var. tomentosa Luerss. ex Wawra (1875), Gleichena dichotoma E. Bailey, pro parte (1882), Gleichenia dichotoma var. emarginata Hilleb. (1888), and Dicranopteris sandwicensis Degener (1940). The uluhe fern is now known to be native to the islands of Hawaii, Oahu, Maui, Kauai and Lanai, where it often grows rampantly in a variety of situations. It is a tomentose species which is readily distinguished from the much more common D. linearis by its hairy fronds. The muricate, basally slightly villous stipes measure about a meter high in most instances, though when they are supported by entangling vegetation they sometimes become twice or thrice as high: They branch profusely in the upper portions. The pinnules are rather fleshily coriaceous, and are covered below with a fulvous wool composed of branching hairs, but become glabrous with age. The ultimate pinnae vary from 9 to 23 cm. long and 4 to 7 cm. wide, and are elliptic-oblong to elliptic-lanceolate",

As the published records for the state are still very incomplete, a list of the new records from counties not mentioned in our previous paper on the Ferns and Fern Allies of Missouri1 or in Miss Pinkerton's paper under the same title,2 will be found here. The new records established in 1933 are designated on the list by an asterisk (*). All others are based upon collections by the junior author in 1934. Specimens of all of the collections have been deposited in the herbarium of the Missouri Botanical Garden and duplicates of many of them will be found in the Gray Herbarium and in other collections.",

    "abstract": "Cystopteris fragilis is widely distributed globally, particularly in the northern hemisphere and in temperate montane regions of the southern hemisphere. Nonetheless, there is limited published evidence of its physiological ecology. This is a report of the physiological ecology of C. fragilis growing in the crevices of a stone wall in Palisades, N. Y. during the summer of 2022 when the northeastern U. S. A. experienced an extended period of excessive heat and drought. Highest laboratory measurements of maximum rehydrated photosynthesis rate (Ac) occurred in June (1.83 µmol CO2 m–2 s–1) prior to the onset of the more severe heat and drought in July and August when the photosynthesis rates declined (1.47 and 1.58, respectively). The lowest rate was found in September (1.41) prior to onset of leaf senescence and dehiscence. Dark respiration (Rd) followed a comparable trend with the highest rate in June (0.82 µmol CO2 m–2 s–1), with lower rates in July, August, and September (0.40, 0.43, and 0.55, respectively). Additional evidence is presented on leaf fluorescence including chlorophyll concentration index (C.C.I.) as well as PS II data on quantum yield efficiency (Fv/Fm) and electron transfer per reaction center (ET0/RC) during each of the five months. This study provides the first evidence that C. fragilis can be a desiccation-tolerant, 'resurrection fern' capable of dormancy enduring extreme dehydration and resumption of normal physiological activity within 24 to 48 hours after heavy precipitation events.",

These two new species are described, illustrated, and discussed, and a key to distinguishing all other closely related species of the A. raddianum group in the Neotropics is also presented.

    "abstract": "The population dynamics of rock fern Asplenium septentrionale in Estonia was monitored from 1994 to 2020; the data were analysed to understand how the rhythm of local weather variables affects the population condition and renewal. Both fern clump size and life stage (sporeling, premature, mature, senescent) structure of the population were studied. Our results indicate that the population has been stable, with a high proportion of reproductive adults. Precipitation distribution through all seasons of the year had a major impact on population recruitment. June was the key period of the year determining the survival of young sporelings. Higher rainfall in the previous year supported higher numbers of premature clumps in the following year. The number of mature fern clumps was most influenced by weather conditions during winter months and precipitation at the end of summer. The long-term survival of mature clumps might be threatened if periods without rainfall extend into the growing season and occur during consecutive years. Monitoring methods of nationally protected fern species should be improved by including individual-based observations on life stage transitions of young sporophytes (sporeling to premature, premature to mature) for predicting future trends in population conditions.",

    "abstract": "Spore morphology was examined in the rare fern Botrychium lunarioides with the scanning electron microscope. Surface topography of the spore walls confirms the placement of B. lunarioides in the subgenus Sceptridium. Botrychium is a widespread genus of eusporangiate ferns classified within the family Ophioglossaceae. Clausen (1938) originally divided this genus into three subgenera based on vernation, dissection of the leaf blade, and gameto- phyte shape. Presently, four subgenera are recognized (Tryon and Tryon, 1982; Tryon and Lugardon, 1991): Botrychium, Japanobotrychium, Osmundopteris, and Sceptridium. Although some investigators (Kato, 1987 and discussion therein; Sahashi, 1976) have raised these subgenera to generic level, Wagner (1990) considered it best to retain the more conservative classification, at least for the present. Of particular use in placement of species within the proper subgenus has been spore morphology, in particular surface topography (Tryon and Lugardon, 1991). The scanning electron microscope (SEM) has proven a particularly use- ful tool for such studies. Botrychium lunarioides (Michx.) Sw. is a species restricted to the south- eastern United States. According to Warren H. Wagner (pers. comm.), is one of the rarest ferns in the United States, and not one botanist in a thousand has seen it. However, Watkins (1992) recently completed a status survey of this species in Alabama and while doing so discovered a number of new lo- calities. Also, Do et al. (1996) have shown this species to be more common in eastern Texas than previously thought. The species is considered to belong within the subgenus Sceptridium (Wagner and Wagner, 1993). Wagner (1992) gave an analysis of the distinctive features of B. lunarioides that differentiated it from other members of subgenus Sceptridium, and he placed it in a separate section, Hiemobotrychium. Thus, in spite of its distinctive characters, B. lu- narioides was still considered to belong to subgenus Sceptridium. However, no confirmatory evidence from spore morphology has been available. The pur- pose of this study is to provide that information. A recent study (Skoda, 1997) recommended placing B. lunarioides in a new monotypic genus as Holubiella lunarioides (Michx.) Skoda, based on a number of morphological features including tracheidal idioblasts in the leaf stalks. It remains to be seen how this proposal will be received by other pteridologists. For the purposes of the present manuscript, we shall follow the commonly",

    "abstract": "During the past year, a population of about 100 plants of Arachniodes simplicior (Mak.) Ohwi was found along nearly 100 m of the bank of a small, unnamed tributary of the Savannah River in North Augusta, South Carolina. The species was identified using Ching's (1934) treatment of Asiatic species of Rumohra Raddi, a genus now correctly designated Arachniodes Blume, as explained by Tindale (1961). The identification was confirmed by the United States National Herbarium. Specimens from the American population are described as follows (see also Figs. 1, 2): Rhizome moderately creeping, commonly 5-8 mm in diameter, densely covered with tan to cinnamon-brown, papery scales, these long triangular with auricularclasping bases, 0.5-2.5 mm wide, 3-8 mm long, the tips one cell wide and 2-4 cells long, the margins entire except for 1-3 trichomes, 3-5 cells long, near scale bases and a few basal teeth formed from outward distensions of two cell end junctures. Stipes commonly 0.5-4 cm apart, 15-46 cm long, 4-6 mm diameter at the base, often equal to or longer than the laminae, sub-terete, flattened on the upper surface and grooved toward the apex, tan at the base, pale green above, aging to a straw-yellow color, somewhat scabrous from small protuberances on which scattered scales are borne, the scales more densely distributed toward the stipe base, 2-12 mm long, and similar to those of the rhizome except more elongate and chocolate-brown, the venation consisting of 2 large and 3 small bundles at the base, reduced to 3 at the apex. Rachis unwinged, pale green, the upper surface grooved, the scales like those of the stipe except smaller. Costae yellow-green, with grooves continuous with those of the rachis, the scales smaller and more abruptly narrowing. Laminae 24-39 cm long, 26-34 cm wide, deltoid-pentagonal, 2-3-pinnate, coriaceous, perennial, the adaxial surfaces glossy dark green with yellow-green streaks along the costae and adjacent bases of pinnules, the abaxial surfaces uniformly pale green and not glossy, the apex gradually acuminate. Pinnae generally 1-pinnate, 3-4 alternate pairs below the terminal pinna, 1-6 cm distant, at 30-45? to the rachis, 8-16 cm long, 2-4 cm wide at the base except the basal pair, 2-pinnate with the base 8-10 cm wide, the petiolules 1-6 mm long, the apices gradually acuminate, the pinnules and venation anadromically arranged on all pinnae. Pinnules, except the lower pairs on the basal pinna pair, 16-22 alternate pairs, asymmetrically ovate-auriculate with an acroscopic basal lobe, 13-22 mm long, 5-10 mm wide, the petiolules narrowly winged, sessile or up to 1 mm long, the apices aristate, the margins with spines up to I mm long, with a few trichomes along the larger veins; basal pinnule pair on the basal pinna pair basiscopically produced with the upper about 1/3-2 the length of the lower, the latter 6-10 cm long, the ultimate segments resembling the pinnules of the 2-pinnate pinnae. Pinnule venation free, semi-dichotomous, not extending to the margins, the first branch arising anadromically. Sori dorsal, globular, arranged in a single row on each side of the pinnule main vein, terminal on smaller lateral veins, somewhat closer to the main vein than the margin. Indusia 0.5-1.0 mm in diameter, orbicular-reniform, attached at a deep sinus with often overlapping lobes, tan to slightly darker brown in the center, glabrous, the margins entire, persisting for about two months before being shed.

The horticultural history of the fern is summarized, beginning on a Barbados sugar plantation. A neotype for the species name and a standard for the cultivar name are selected and justified. 'Farleyense' is compared morphologically with wild and cultivated Adiantum tenerum, as well as other maidenhair ferns, and is found to be morpholog- ically consistent with classification as a cultivar of A. tenerum. Seldom are cultivars as prominent through time, as well known, or as trou- blesome taxonomically as the Barbados Farley fern. Discovered on a horticul- turally sophisticated Barbados sugar plantation in the mid-nineteenth century, the Farley fern won instant acclaim in British horticultural circles, and was promptly named as a species. The fern was thought, with reservations, at the time to have been derived from Adiantum tenerum Sw., which is abundant wild and cultivated in Barbados. The Farley fern spread to gardens around the globe, and has remained popular ever since. Despite-or possibly on account of-its horticultural prominence, the fern's history, biology, classification, and nomenclature are befuddled throughout the literature dealing with it. The fern has been treated variously as a species, variety, and as a cultivar. The aim of the present account is to provide an historical background on the Farley fern, to correct nomenclatural problems, and to provide a systematic morphological appraisal of its classification as a cultivar of A. tenerum.",

Hermaphroditic gametophytes were larger in double- spore than in single-spore cultures for cultures derived from both untreated and sterilized spores, whereas gametophytes were larger in single-spore than in double-spore cultures in contaminated cultures. However, gametophytes did not differ in size between double-spore and single-spore cultures derived from surface sterilized spores. The greatest antheridiogen response was observed in cultures with no treatment and the least antheridiogen response was observed in contaminated cultures. A standard method of preparing gametophyte cultures from spores involves the surface sterilization of spores using a dilute bleach (hypochlorite) solution (e.g., Banks et al., 1993). The purpose of this method is to reduce the effects of other organisms on treatments during experimental investigations of ga- metophyte growth and development. We, however, have been concerned that bleach may affect the extracellular matrix of the spore. An effect on the extra- cellular matrix of the spore could significantly affect investigations of aspects of gametophyte development such as antheridiogens, as antheridiogens must first affect the extracellular matrix of a spore or gametophyte cell to have an effect on spore germination and gametophyte development. To address the effects of contamination and surface sterilization of spores, we cultured ga- metophytes of the leptosporangiate fern Ceratopteris richardii Brongn. using untreated and surface sterlized spores, culturing untreated spores in both axe- nic and contaminated media.",

The developmental pattern of the sporangia of Sphaeropteris cooperi is compared to that of the sporangia of higher leptsoporangiate ferns. The most familiar and most frequently illustrated leptosporangia are those of the higher leptosporangiate ferns. The development of the sporangia of the higher leptosporangiate was described in a series of papers (Wilson,1958a, b, 1960) and is now well understood. In the sporangia of the advanced leptosporangiate ferns, as illustrated by species in the Polypodiaceae, Grammitidaceae, and Vittariaceae, it was shown that the stalk and the capsule of the leptosporangium develops from a single epidermal primordial cell that becomes divided into five initials or segments, rather than from the activity of an apical cell. Each one of these in turn divides, through a series of divisions to produce the mature sporangium. 0 contributes only to the formation of the stalk; I to a portion of the stalk and part of the proximal face of the capsule; II to the stomial region, the stalk, and to the proximal and distal faces of the capsule; and Segments III and IV to the rest of the annulus and to both the proximal and distal faces of the capsule. Although the stalk may be one-, twoor three-rowed at its base, the capsule is always subtended by a three-rowed stalk. The one-rowed stalk results directly from the horizontal orientation of the first division of the sporangial initial, whereas the twoand three-rowed stalks depend on the orientation of both the first division and also the division that produces I. A review of the history of our knowledge of the nature of the leptosporangium and its development was published in the introduction to the study of the ontogeny of the sporangia of Phlebodium aureum (L.) J. Sm. (Wilson, 1958a). Recent descriptions of sporangial development continue to reproduce the erroneous pattern apparently originated by Campbell (1905) that the sporangial initial produces a three-sided apical cell that cuts off several basal cells to form the stalk until a transverse division stops its activity by cutting off the cap cell. Other accounts are unclear, incomplete and often incorrect. (see Gifford and Foster, 1989; Bold et.al., 1987; Holttum et. al., 1970). No detailed ontogenetic studies have been published since the appearance of the paper on This content downloaded from 207.46.13.149 on Wed, 28 Sep 2016 06:18:20 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms WILSON: SPORANGIAL ONTOGENY IN SPHAEROPTERIS the sporangium of Anarthropteris lanceolata (Hook. f.) Pic. Serm. (as A. dictyopteris (Mett.) Copel.) (Wilson, 1960). As pointed out in a study of mature sporangia of species of the Polypodiaceae, Grammitidaceae, and Vittariaceae (Wilson, 1959), the cell arrangement in the sporangia reflect the ontogeny of these structures and, with but few exceptions, there is no reason to doubt that the development of the capsules follows the pattern of those of Phlebodium (Wilson, 1958a), Xiphopteris and Pyrrosia (Wilson, 1958b), and Anarthropteris (Wilson, 1960). Edwards (1996) expanded the examination of the structure of mature sporangia by initiating a survey of the cellular structure of the capsules of more than 110 species in 20 families. Three of these species were illustrated in his published abstract. Sporangia with four-rowed stalks, however, are known in several fern genera including Dipteris, Cheiropleuria, and members of the Cyatheaceae. Wilson (1959) pointed out that it was not possible to homologize the sporangial faces of Dipteris and Cheiropleuria with those of the higher leptosporangiate ferns. The known developmental patterns cannot give rise to a four-rowed stalk. Bower (1915) wrote that in Cheiropleuria sporangia with four-rowed stalks, the segmentation of the young sporangium, Appears to show a regular cleavage of the segments in two opposite rows, and the Subdivision of the two rows of segments of the stalk by walls in the plane of the drawings has given rise to the four rows of cells of the stalk, as seen in later stages. This suggests a distinctly different developmental pattern in these sporangia than is known. The only studies of the development of sporangia with four-rowed stalks are those of Bower (1915, 1923, 1926). Holttum and Sen (1961), in their paper Morphology and classification of the tree ferns did not make a detailed examination of the sporangia, but based their comments mostly on Bower's publications. For a clear understanding of the structure of the sporangia with fourrowed stalks their ontogeny needs to be studied in detail. Because it is readily available in cultivation in southern California, Sphaeropteris cooperi (F. Muell.) R.M. Tryon [Cyathea cooperi (F. Muell.) Domin] was chosen for study to serve as a model for the pattern of development of sporangia with four-rowed stalks. MATERIALS AND METHODS The material used in this study was collected from plants in cultivation in Los Angeles, California. A specimen of this fern has been deposited in the herbarium of Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden (Wilson 2067, RSA). Slides are deposited at Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden. Fertile pinnae of Sphaeropteris cooperi in early and increasingly mature stages of development were preserved in formalin-aceto alcohol (FAA). Sori were processed by three different methods: 1) Fertile pinnules were infiltrated with the tertiary butyl alcohol series, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 10,Lm. The sections were then stained in the Sharman (1943) series. 2) Fertile pinnules were cleared in 5% NaOH, bleached in 50% chlorine bleach, and stained in 3% tannic acid in 50% alcohol and 3% ferric chloride in 50% 205 This content downloaded from 207.46.13.149 on Wed, 28 Sep 2016 06:18:20 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms AMERICAN FERN JOURNAL: VOLUME 89 NUMBER 3 (1999) alcohol (the alcoholic stains were used to prevent maceration). After dehydration in alcohol, the sori were dissected from the pinnule lamina and placed on a slide in Diaphane. The sori were then teased to separate the sporangia and a coverslip was mounted. This technique resulted in an enormous amount of damage, but methodical searches of the slides and a large number of dissections revealed undamaged sporangia. This procedure of clearing and staining the sporangia allows both sides of each developing sporangium to be studied. 3) Young cleared fertile pinnules stained in tannic acid and ferric chloride were imbedded in paraffin, sectioned at 20pm, and mounted on slides. These preparations were studied to confirm the early division patterns observed in the other preparations. Mature sporangia were studied mounted in Crystal/Mount (Biomedia Corp., Foster City, California) on temporary slides. This process reduced the dehiscence of the capsules and at the same time prevented movement of the sporangia while being examined. All illustrations were made with the aid of a Leitz drawing tube on a Leitz microscope. Both sides of each cleared sporangium were drawn and each sporangial Segment is shaded to facilitate comprehension of the cell lineages in the developing sporangium. The shading patterns used conform with those used in earlier sporangial ontogenetic studies in order to allow for easier comparisons.",

The family is represented by a single species, Isoetes schwein- furthii. Also recorded for first time in Botswana were three other species: Ophioglossum lancifol- ium, Actinopteris dimorpha, and Marsilea minuta. Although the pteridophytes of southern Africa have been thoroughly and very capably surveyed (Schelpe, 1970; Jacobsen, 1983; Schelpe and Anthony 1986; Burrows, 1990), new explorations are adding to knowledge regarding their specific ranges. Botswana is a semi-arid country situated in the south- central part of the African continent and has three major ecological regions (Parson, 1993). In the northern region there are the Okavango Delta and the ancient lake beds of the Makgadikgali Pans. The southern area comprises the Kalahari Desert, characterized by fossil sand dunes and scrub and bush savan- na. Between the Okavango-Makgadikgali and the Kalahari Desert, is an inter- mediate ecological zone known as the Hardveld region, dominated by sandy soils.",

The potential existence of other hybrids among the four Hawaiian Cibotium species is discussed. Intensive investigations of Hawaiian pteridophytes over the past decade have revealed many interspecific hybrids, both published (Ranker, 1992; Wag- ner, 1993; Wagner et al., 1995; Palmer, 1997) and unpublished. These are rec- ognized usually by their coexistence with the parental species, morphological intermediacy, mostly sporadic occurrence, and more or less abortive spores. Here, I describe a recently discovered natural hybrid between two of the more common Hawaiian species of tree ferns of the genus Cibotium. The genus Cibotium includes about ten species ranging from Assam through southeastern Asia to Borneo and the Ryukyus, as well as other Pacific Islands, Mexico, and Central America (Kramer, 1990), with four species recognized in Hawaii (Palmer, 1994). The present paper describes a distinctive hybrid be- tween Cibotium chamissoi Kaulf.and C. menziesii Hook., presently known only from the island of Oahu, but probably more widespread on other Hawai- ian islands.",

Hoffm. at Copeland Creek on the North Umpqua River in Douglas County, while on a trip to collect the endemic monotypic Kalmiopsis leachiana (Hend.) Rehder, an interesting member of the heath family native only to southwestern Oregon. About sixty plants of A. septentrionale were growing in rock crevices around the south side of a badly weathered vescicular quartz boulder just above a number of Kalmiopsis plants. About 75 feet down the hill another rock of similar composition was discovered with another eleven plants on it. The site is at 2,320 feet elevation with a southerly exposure although the boulders are shaded by Douglas fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco, and Sugar Pine, Pinus lambertiana Dougl. In Colorado A. septentrionale is found at higher elevations, 5,000 to 8,000 feet (Harrington, 1964). This distinctive amphi-atlantic species of Asplenium is found in Europe, Central Asia, and Western North America. In the Western Hemisphere it is known from the east slope of the Rocky iMountains from South Dakota and Wyoming south to western Oklahoma New Mexico, Arizona, and Baja California. Kearney and Peebles (1960) report it from California, and Hulten (1958) shows it on his distribution map as occurring in central California near the Nevada border, although no specimens are cited by either source. The California locality is probably the collection by J. T. Howell (17803) reported by Ewan (1943). Howell collected A. septentrionale in crevices of granite rocks above Columbine Lake below Sawtooth Pass, east of Mineral King in Tulare County south",

The rains have been well distributed over the entire period, from a very early fall rain until the present writing, April 2. The first part of the fall and winter were unusually warm, making possible the early starting of all vegetation. The cooler than usual spring has tended to continue the growth of all plants through a much longer period than we normally expect. This type of weather has been excellent for some of our more rare Pteridophytes. It has been possible for nie to make a few short trips, and, while there has not been time to work over the material collected to a final analysis, some may be interested in a few notes regarding these collections. On March 16, 1935, the four following collections were made from the mesas near the former location of Camp Kearny, San Diego County: No. 1245-OPHIOGLOSSUM CALIFORNICUM Prantl, growing in abundance and with some plants reaching a height of 9 cm. above ground. No. 1246-ISOETES ORCUTTII Eat., growing in the same location as the above 0. californicum. The habitat was a gradual slope with underground seepage, but without chance for water to accumulate into a pool. Previous collections, No. 799, that I had made of Isoetes Orcuttii in the region of San Diego were found growing submerged in pools formed by seasonal rains. No. 1247-PILULARIA AMERICANA A.

    "abstract": "eighty years ago, that Valdemar Knudsen discovered such spectacular examples as Diellia Mannii, D. centifolia, and many, still mysterious varieties. Although I have spent many weeks hiking along the scenic trails through these many valleys, I was not lucky enough to run onto the particular slopes where these ferns grow. This is an event which is being saved for some fortunate botanist-in the course of his professional studies, or merely while on vacation. Hunting Diellia will probably remind that botanist of studying the rare spleenworts, and the habitat is very similar. Only when the particular hillsides that Knudsen alone knew of are rediscovered will the still unsolved problems of Diellia be clarified.",

    "abstract": "Most common ferns are easy to raise from spores, and in the early stages they do not require much space or an elaborate setup. For some time I have had it in mind to prepare a fairly extensive account of different methods, technical and otherwise, which may be used. So far, it has not been possible to complete that, but, in response to not infrequent letters, I have boiled down the essentials of two practical processes as described below. The simplest media on which to raise ferns from spores are (1) soil and (2) clay pots. It is a good plan to try both ways at the same time, and to start more than one culture at one time. Two general conditions should be noted. (1) In most fern species the spores will germinate best if sown fairly soon after ripening; (2) spore cultures require a good light. Except in summer when the sun is high and the temperature also likely to be high, the lightest window in the house is not too bright. Regarding the first point, the spores of some species remain viable for months, or even years; others, like those of Osmunda, must be sown immediately. 1. SOIL CULTURE. Finely sifted soil, consisting of a mixture of sand and light loam, is placed in pots with an excess of drainage at the bottom. The pots are kept with the bottoms immersed in water, and for each pot a cover of clear glass. Before planting the spores, it may be profitable to sterilize the pot and soil by subjecting to low oven heat, or in a steam pressure cooker for a half hour. Additional water should be supplied entirely from below. 2. CLAY POT CULTURE. The diagram sufficiently illustrates the simple setup. Sterilization of the pot and moss will prevent the advent of mosses and some algae. The prothallia may take somewhat longer to mature than when 95",

    "abstract": "During the summer of 1937 the writer drove from Philadelphia to Salt Lake City and back, visiting en route a number of fern localities; Mr. J. E. Benedict, Jr., of Washington, D. C., took part in the first half of this trip. Notes as to species observed which seem of general interest are here placed on record, except for the state of Colorado, on which a separate article has been prepared. Specimens obtained have been placed in the herbarium of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. MICHIGAN.-We barely entered this state late in May, paying a visit to Mr. and Mrs. Boydston, who live at Thorn Acres about four miles south of Niles, in Berrien County. Here in ponds and on sandy slopes at the edge of the floodplain of the St. Joseph river there is an unusual abundance of Equisetums, of which five species were recognized: arvense, fluviatile, laevigatum, palustre, and prealtum. This appears to represent a southern limiting station for E. palustre (var. americanum), for although it is here within a mile of the Indiana line the thorough exploration of the latter state by Mr. Deam has never turned it up there. IOWA.-A visit to Pikes Peak State Park in Clayton County yielded Selaginella rupestris, not heretofore reported from this county, and two varieties of Cystopteris fragilis. Examination of their rootstocks and indusia showed these to be vars. genuina and protrusa, the former growing on steep bluffs, the latter in humus-rich soil on gentler slopes. . . 28",

Yet these luckless migrants from moister habitats die. Only the xerophytes survive in these deserts of the walls. I wish to express here my appreciation of aid extended me by Dr. William R.

    "abstract": "Most modern writers accredit Angstroem with the original transference of Gmelin's Osmunda lanceolata to the genus Botrychium. Among botanists who have so given credit to Angstroem may be mentioned Fernald (Rhodora 17: 87-88. 1915),-Maxon (Rhodora 20: 19. 1918), Broun (Index North American Ferns, p. 35. 1938) and myself (Mem. Torr. Club 19(2): 90. 1938). Subsequent to my publication, S. J. Smith mentioned to me that Ruprecht had listed the binomial Botrychium lanceolatum nine years before the date when it was published by Angstroem. Ruprecht's ideas with respect to Gmelin's Osmunda lanceolata evidently underwent change in 1845. On page 33 of part 3 of Beitrage zur Pflanzenkunde des Russichen Reiches, he listed this as 488. Botrychium (Lunaria) lanceolatum* with the synonym Osmunda lanceolata Gmel. jun., 1768. This is the basis for the varietal combination under B. Lunaria cited by me on p. 90 of my Monograph. On p. 92 of part four of the Beitrage, Ruprecht listed Botrychium lanceolatum.* The 1. and * indicated that he regarded B. lanceolatum to be a species new to the flora of St. Petersburg. Ruprecht did not directly cite the basinym, but he cited his 48f/ mentioned above. Here Gmelin's binomial and the date of its publication were indicated, but no bibliographical citation. Ruprecht's intention appears clear. Since he did cite the date of Gmelin's publication, I am now inclined to accredit him with first valid publication of Botrychium lanceolatum. His binomial is neither a nomen nudum nor a nomemn dubium. Its application seems reasonably definite. The citation thus should be: Botrychium lan45",

According to geologists the lake was formed by deposits of glacial material closing the natural drainage basin. This glacial ridge on the west rising only forty or fifty feet above the lake has reversed the drainage system here, and is all that prevents the flow of water into the basin of the Susquehanna River through Starrucca Creek. As it is, the lake makes an outlet in a series of falls over a rocky ridge at the east into the Delaware River down Shehawken Creek, exactly at the junction of the east and west branches of the river. The lake has an elevation above sea level of 1795 feet.",

    "abstract": "The fern belonging to Mrs. Chisholm, of Proctor, Vermont, is of great interest to me because I was allowed to share in it, and a brief description of some of its main features may be of interest to others. The lawn on the eastern side of the house slopes rather abruptly toward a grove of young White Pines, and between the lawn and the edge of the grove a narrow concrete runway was constructed several years ago having connection with the water main, so that when a cleverly concealed cock is opened a very nice little brook ripples gaily along and under a rustic bridge, where it loses itself in a small pool. Many plants of the more common of the native ferns are planted along both sides of this brook, with a goodly sprinkling of Violets and Forget-me-nots, and a few early blooming garden plants which later are hidden by the growth of ferns. On the grove side of the brook and near the bridge, many stones carefully selected and brought in from a distance in many trips of the accommodating Ford were arranged by Mrs. Chisholm and much good and proper earth was pressed into every crack and cranny. Here many of the rock-loving species found in this state were tenderly set, and, more to the point, here they grow in great contentment. Walking Fern, Wall Rue and Maidenhair Spleenwort peep out from small crevices, Ebony Spleenwort stands with dignity at the base, and several plants of unusual forms, as well as the common form, of the Polypody crown the top of this crag '-all these on the sunny side. On the other side of the crag, which is always in the shade, more of these plants also grow, and associated with them are the rare variety of the Ebony Spleenwort, Hortonae, a fine plant of Scott's Spleenwort, 84",

    "abstract": "For years we had wanted a fern garden. We had tried to make ferns grow successfully in our city yard, and although we lost a good many, the aspidium varieties thrived better than anything else. Strange as it may seem, Goldianum, now eight years old, is very tall and large. We did not waste any more time in the city garden, but transferred our energies to our camp beside a lake in southern New Hampshire at an altitude of fourteen hundred feet above sea-level. The place selected for the ferns was the northerly slope of what had been a heavily wooded area. This was shaded by half-grown beeches, white and black birches, and swamp maples. Those trees furnished necessary shade, and an excellent windbreak, for the wind blows a great deal beside a lake. We were obliged to pull out many stumps and roots, leaving deep, rich leaf mould and many rocks-just the ideal soil and place for ferns. We made walks through this area and edged them with stones. All was in readiness now for the planting-our purpose being to try and grow as many varieties as possible. We can truthfully say we have never lost a fern yet. 59",

While there are many hundreds of acres which have not been built upon, most of such acreage comprises either salt-marshland or regions of grading and fill. It is not impossible that there may exist some small areas of natural marshland where the Osmundas may be found. I have found O. spectabilis on one of the narrow sand strips which border the ocean side of Great South Bay (Oak Island Beach). Even Manhattan, despite is great encrustations of asphalt, brick, and cement has at least some areas of rocky outcrops, including the park section at its northern end. The Bronx has the hundreds of acres along the Bronx River included within the Botanical Garden and Zoological Park area, where woods of native hemlock and other trees offer sites for ferns. Similarly, Queens Borough, although I cannot vouch for any specific ferns, offers park reservations which carry westward the conditions under which a number of species flourish on Long Island in general. Richmond-Staten Island-is the least citified of all five boroughs from its former state. While I have made no recent visit there, its central areas must still offer sites for the persistence of Dryopteris Goldiana and other related wood ferns, and its marshy woods presumably still provide sites for the Massachusetts fern, the narrow chain fern, and others. In earlier days, the area now lying within the boundaries of Kings County (Brooklyn) must have had approximately the same fern flora as adjacent Long Island regions still offer. When road traffic permits, it is still 148",

    "abstract": "Late in December, 1941, an opportunity came to renew acquaintance with the ferns of northwest peninsular Florida, guidance and transportation being generously furnished by Messrs. Edward and Robert St. John, whose studies there are widely known and appreciated.1 In view of the fact that differences of opinion as to the tixonomic and geographic relations of some of the species growing there appear to have arisen, a few notes on the trip may be placed on record here. OPHIOGLOSSUM.-Five species were seen, and the differences between the smaller ones proved to be more striking than had been anticipated. One of these, 0. pumilio E. St. John,2 is now realized to have been founded on a mixture, and its author advises me that he desires to withdraw it; but the other species described in the work cited are real entities. Some may have to be changed in status, as has been done by Clausen3 for 0. tenerum Mett., but apparently all are endemic forms, regardless of category. TRICHOMANES.-In the course of my studies on the soilreaction preferences of ferns, T. Petersii was tested at several points from Mississippi to South Carolina, and found to grow exclusively in soil of distinct acidity (act. ac. 30, pH 5.5). This species has also been collected at Constanza, Dominican Republic, and the geologic map shows this place to lie in an area of crystalline rocks, which may well give rise to soil of similar reaction. Then came the unexpected discovery4 of its occurrence in northwestern Florida, where only limestone was sup-",

We had just made an exhibit of forty-three species of native ferns collected in nearby localities and arranged in a naturalistic setting at the Flower Show of the Millbrook Club in Millbrook on September 15th, and with this collection as a nucleus we decided to add as many additional species native to New England and Middle Atlantic States as we could procure and force into good growth in this short time. With the aid of fern nurseries and through the kindness and generosity of fern collectors we were able at last to assemble a collection of sixty species, and, in most cases, a considerable number of each to insure our being able to present the ferns in naturalistic groupings. The following is a copy of the folder of which over five thousand were distributed to visitors at the exhibit. In this folder was given a list of the ferns exhibited, each numbered to correspond with the labels in the planting, thereby insuring the identification of the fern species. A paragraph was also included urging the public to grow ferns in the interest of conservation.",

Although more than fifty species have been collected in the state, many of these are restricted to the eastern forested parts and several others are western species of limited distribution in Oklahoma. In a detailed study of the flora and vegetation of Muskogee County made by the writer' from 1925 to 1929, a list of the pteridophytes was included. The collection of Muskogee County specimens has been deposited in the Herbarium of the University of Oklahoma. Although about 800 species of seed plants were collected, only 11 ferns and fern allies were noted. This is probably a greater number of pteridophytes than can be found in most counties in central and western Oklahoma. Muskogee County, having an area of 826 sq. mi., is located in northeastern Oklahoma in the transition zone between the oak-hickory forest on the east and the grassland on the west. Ferns do not grow in the commonest type of native vegetation, the tall grass prairie. Low hills of sandstone in the county are covered with the oakhickory forest and support ferns on the rock outcrops and rocky soil. One sandstone hill, appropriately named Fern Mountain, has a variety of ferns. It is the only known station in the county for two species and one of two stations for a third fern. Limited outcrops of limestone, which have a mesophytic maple-oak forest, occur on hillsides at the western border of the Ozark plateau.",

The brief sketch published in the JOURNAL brought me several most interesting letters which were ample compensation for the unabashed revelation of ignorance and added much to my interest in the ferns and several welcome exchanges. One of my new correspondents, Mr. F. Willard Bowman, of Douglaston, L.

Ascutney, Vt., all rich fern country. know one narrow cut near Ascutneyville, Vt., where take fern lovers, for here may be found a dozen or more varieties in superb growth-some of these not found in near-by territory. Mr. Bowman sent me some plants, among them a Woodwardia virginica, for which made an artificial swamp in my fernery where it grew very satisfactorily. Another friend, Professor W. L. Dix, of Trenton, N. J., sent me some beautiful plants of Lygodium palmatum which grew during the summer. can only hope they outlive the northern winter of Lake Sunapee, but I ha' me doubts. Among the many interesting experiences of the summer there were two episodes which will always remember. The first came about in this way. have three strong plants of Dryopteris filix-mas in my fernery (and did not steal them either!), but wanted desperately to find it growing naturally. Mr. J. G.

He listed 9 species and followed this work with several publications during the next ten years bringing his list up to 22 species. This was followed by the work of Cragin (1885, 1886) in which the number known for Kansas was reduced to 20. Smyth (1890) reported a total of 38 species and varieties for the state. Later Smyth (1911) reported only 32 species and varieties for the region. Before and after the work of Smyth a few miscellaneous references were made to Kansas Pteridophytes but nothing of significance was accomplished until the publication of Gates (1940). In his work Gates was able to find specimens of 26 species. This was apparently the first accurate list compiled. Several of the earlier records were apparently based on plants in cultivation. In the herbarium at the University of Kansas are to be found several specimens of these early collectors. On the label of several sheets the word cultivated appears. After the publication by Gates we find that Horr and Mci species has been found in Collier, Dade, Monr e 53",

The plants were growing under Ulmus and Quercus and were in various stages of development,-some just coming up, others having the sterile blade fully expanded and the fertile segment well developed, but the sporangia still green. Twenty plants were collected by my wife and me (R.T. & E.R.C. 5719); others were taken by R. V. Moran and R. F. Thorne, who accompanied us. Specimens are deposited in the herbaria of Cornell University and the University of Alabama. This seems to be the first record of the species in Alabama, although I have previously reported it from such nearby states as Mississippi, Louisiana and Florida (Clausen, 1938). Of twenty-four specimens of the Alabama plants, twenty-one have a basal sheath (remains of a previous leaf or leaves) about the base of the leafstalk, and three are broken off at the base and cannot be definitely checked for this character. The sterile blades are various: lanceolate-elliptical, ovate-elliptical, elliptical, and broadly oblong. The sporangia are not mature, but they appear as broad as long, not crowded and transversely oblong as Fernald (1939) described the sporangia of his variety pycnostichum, typified by plants from the Coastal Plain of Virginia. The Alabama plants are similar to certain specimens from Virginia in the shape of the sterile blade, the persistence of the basal sheath, and their development early in the season, but they also resemble (in presence of basal sheath, shape of blade, and sporangia) plants 105",

Leaves in six ranks, lanceolate, acute, spreading, spinulose-ciliate on each side of leaf. Spikes erect with lanceolate or ovate-lanceolate oblique sporophylls having 4-5 spinulose cilia on each side, 3.0-4.0 mm. long. Microsporangia few, confined to tip of the spike; microspores yellow with ca. 25 spines averaging 7p in length, the spores (including spines) 45p in diameter. Megasporangia more numerous; megaspores pale yellow to nearly white, subglobose, 0.5-0.6 mm. in diameter; exine mostly smooth with minute reticulations on apical and basal portions. The nearly smooth megaspores are of considerable interest as typical European material has strongly tuberculate-papillose megaspores, at least on the commissural faces.",

This chain was first started in the Fern Bulletin by Parish,2 later continued by Parish3 and Munz and Johnston4 for Southern California and now localized by Wiggins for San Diego County. Miss Kimball in 19115 published in the Fern Bulletin a short article on the San Diego County ferns but due to the difficulty of field trips she was unable to report on our mountain and desert species. Wiggins, when one considers that the Pteridophytes were only a small part of his research work on the San Diego County Flora, has covered the county in a very satisfactory manner. Any one who has ever had the pleasure of collecting in this region can well appreciate the work that he has done. The following additional stations (all easily reached by car) are now added to those already recorded by Wiggins, together with several species new to his checklist. Specimens examined are either in our local Natural History Museum, in Miss Kimball's collection or in my own personal herbarium. Thanks are due to Miss Kimball for her assistance in identification of the species.",

    "abstract": "word does not seem to occur at all in the King James' version Bible and is found only once in Shakespeare-in the oft-quoted reference in Henry I to fern seed as a prescription for invisibility. Shakespeare does have a reference to brakes in Venus and Adonis, by it seems likely that this does not mean a species but is a synonym for thickets. But if ferns are neglected in these two English classics of the seventeenth century, their mention in another type of literature of the period may be cited. An interest in log cabin life of early colonial times led me to a search for descriptions of various crafts of the period, including cooking equipment and recipes, and this, in turn, led to a cookbook by a most unexpected author. In a book auction list, a title by Sir Kenelm Digby, The Closet of Sir Kenelm Digby Knight Opened was intriguing in itself. Sir Kenelm is cited in most histories of science as the author of several essays. One, The powder of sympathy was given as an address before the Royal Philosophical Society about 1650. In this he ascribes to blue vitriol the virtue of healing wounds at a distance, and cites from his own experience the case of a stubborn duelling wound which was readily healed when a bloodied cloth was treated with the powder. In another essay on plant growth, he describes how the calcined ash of a plant can be caused to reconstruct the original plant. From this he reasons easily to conclusions regarding the resurrection of the bodies of departed saints, even those who may have been eaten by cannibals. 55",

    "abstract": "The exhibit came about in rather an unexpected way. At the Chicago Flower Show in April, I had been chairman of the exhibit for the Glen Ellyn Garden Clubs-a reproduction of a bit of our Bird Sanctuary during or immediately following a sleet storm. Due to the unusual and quite realistic result it attracted a surprising amount of attention, and Mr. Servas wished it repeated on a larger scale at the Horticultural Building. After several weeks of considering the difficulties and possibilities, it was finally decided that this was impractical, as the material used for the ice did not stay in good condition more than a week or two. In the meantime, I had suggested to Mr. Servas that a collection of ferns might be interesting, and it was finally decided to substitute ferns for ice, the exchange being much more fun for me, though perhaps not so attractive to the average visitor. I wrote Dr. Maxon to ask his opinion. His prompt reply was so cordial and enthusiastic that I decided in spite of the rather limited expense money allowed by the management and the very limited amount of time, I would swallow my fears and plunge in. It was then well past May first, and the Fair was to open June 1st. There followed a frantic amount of correspondence with dealers and fern enthusiasts, friends and strangers alike. The response was most gratifying. In almost every case the reply contained not only the information I had asked but also several names of people to whom I might write for other species. Six months would have been a better amount of time for this endless chain of letters. 117",

    "abstract": "One can hardly read the discussion with which Gilbert accompanies his publication of Polypodium vulgare var. Churchiael without noticing his lack of certainty as to its status and the feeling that he had assigned his variety to that species partly because no more satisfactory disposition of it seemed possible. His description was based on a plant with two fronds, one of which he preserved as the type. Unfortunately, his herbarium was left to a high school, where, according to report, it has been lost or destroyed, and a reference to. his type is therefore impossible. No other example of the variant was known until three years ago, when Miss Elsie M. Kittredge found a specimen near Florence, Vermont.2 It was taken up and transplanted to Mrs. Chisholm's garden in Proctor. In September, 1931, Miss Kittredge brought one of its fronds to the Fern Society's meeting at Brown's Mills, N. J., where it excited much interest and surprise, and later she very kindly contributed it to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. With stalked pinnae and a stipe abundantly clothed with scales, it looked more like a form of Polystichum acrostichoides than a polypody, and the more attentively one examined it, the more difficult became the acceptance of Gilbert's identification of it as a variety of Polypodium vulgare. Last August Dr. E. T. Wherry and I visited Mrs. Chisholm and had the satisfaction of seeing the curious and puzzling little plant alive and growing in her fasci-",

St. John, I have come to the inescapable conclusion that they are one and the same species. Early in 1939, a friend, returning from a trip to Brazil, brought me a few fern specimens for my herbarium, which she had collected near Rio de Janeiro. There were three or four entire, small plants with good roots, which appeared still to have some life and as they had been out of the ground only about a week, I set them in a pan of water over night, then potted and set them out in the greenhouse. Only one survived, which turned out to be Thelypteris dentata. In the winter of 1941-42, I made several trips down into the lime sink region between Gainesville and Ocala, where I collected a few small plants of T. dentata, and I also collected another one which I found growing within the city limits of Jacksonville; all of these I brought home and planted in my fern garden. About mid-spring of 1942, I took the Brazilian plant, which had grown considerably, out of the greenhouse and planted it in the garden, but in a place entirely apart from the Florida plants of T. dentata, so that I would not confuse them and could observe any differences. Several weeks later I noticed that the Brazilian plant was producing sporophylls so entirely different from any of the previous ones and from those of the native plants of T. dentata, that I took a sporophyll off of the Brazilian plant and from one of the Florida plants and sent them to Dr. Maxon with the query, Are these the same species?' Dr. Maxon replied that they were both Dryopteris dentata (Forsk.) C. Chr., as with his habitual 107",

The Louisiana prior to 1803 comprised what is now the central United States west of the Mississippi River, except the territory that later became Texas. However, the part concerned in this note refers, evidently, to what is now known as the state of Louisiana. Although remote from the Atlantic Coastal region and thus less accessible, collections of plants made in the eighteenth century became the basis of floras published in the first decade of the nineteenth century. European collectors, French and German, ventured into that wilderness when the population was scant. The following note in Flora 6: 336. 1823, records one fatality-the discoverer of the fern under consideration. Vor ungefahr 30 Jahren meldeten politische Zeitungen aus Amerika, das ein Hr.

These included general habit, appearance, color and position of the sori. The description was general and based largely upon gross characters. Benedict (1909) pointed out that although the D. cristata x marginalis hybrid which he described was intermediate in character, not all plants were intermediate to the same extent, some showing greater resemblance to one parent species, and some to the other. Fern hybrids have also been found to be sterile and to have a tendency to produce abnormal or abortive spores. In October of 1935, Dr. Benedict collected about 80 specimens of D. Goldiana x marginalis as well as twenty of each of the parent species. They were found growing in the same locality near Springdale, New Jersey. These leaves were pressed and constituted the material used in the present study. It was undertaken to study the hybrid in comparison with its parent species, particularly with regard to the basal scales and indusia, in order to determine the possibility of diagnostic characters in these structures, and upon what basis they might be differ55",

There is, fortunately, no longer a possibility that the southwestern groups will pass from the control of friendly countries and become closed to occidental explorers, as have the mandated Micronesian islands. It is now only a question of time until the Pacific will again be at peace and all its islands open to further scientific exploration. Many of these archipelagoes, for example the Solomons and the New Hebrides, are very nearly unexplored from a botanical standpoint; others, such as Fiji, are much better known. Although not in the actual combat area, Fiji is strategically important for its position; from a phytogeographic viewpoint also it is highly important, lying at the edge of the supposed old continental shelf and in the route of major plant movements from Papuasia eastward. It is just ten years ago that, as a Bishop Museum Fellow in Yale University, I made a collection of plants in Fiji.1 Herbarium studies in the interval have kept my",

In this Supplement also, correction was made of the earlier reports of the finding of Asplenium pinnatifidum in Berlin, Southington, and Sharon; for preserved specimens of these plants, upon re-examination, were identified as unusual forms of Asplenium ebenoides R.

On the basis of these findings it appears that in the last 70 years Scott's Spleenwort has appeared in six Connecticut towns-on limestone ledges in four towns in the northwestern part of the state, and on shale ledges in two towns in central Connecticut.",

Our party consisted of Mel T. Cook, of the Insular Experiment Station, William P. Kramer and Charles Z. Bates, of the United States Forest Service, and myself, and we were, as far as I know, the first botanists to climb the mountain. Dr. Cook and I were at that time prosecuting an ecological survey of the island. We were not equipped to prepare herbarium specimens on a large scale and our only collections were small pieces of the various plants, mostly in a sterile condition. Except for the ferns these were identified by N. L. Britton and Percy Wilson, who had shortly before completed their Flora of Puerto Rico. Cook and I were completely unacquainted with the vast majority of the species, he being a plant pathologist and I visiting Puerto Rico for the first time. Our ecological notes had to refer to plants by numbers, and the names, later furnished us by' Britton and Wilson, were then exchanged for the numbers in our final report. Puerto Rico was, theoretically, pretty thoroughly explored by the botanists. The chance that we would find a species, or even one new to the island, was nearly zero, since the ecologist does not deal with rari-",

The Lake Superior plant shrinks from such sites; it is found close to water, about falls and rocky inland lakes, in river gorges, and where rocky headlands turn one cheek from the weather-always where the night air is damp. Any good collector can get it his first day out, if he looks for Walking Fern; he will find Fragrant Fern instead. Water's statement2 is nearly accurate for the Fragrant Fern of Minnesota and Ontario: Although it prefers shaded cliffs, it can adapt itself to sunny situations without suffering much harm, if the western air, we repeat, is mellowed by dews and mists. Like people, plants are known by the company they keep. The associates of Fragrant Fern about Lake Superior are Bulblet Fern and Polypody. A typical station will wear a broken crown of Rusty Woodsia, with Polypody and Fragrant Fern in a zone below, Bulblet Fern close beneath, and Oak Fern nearby if the crevices",

    "abstract": "tains, California, and because of its furnishing food to elk and deer in winter is commonly called Deer-fern. During the last century American writers mostly called this fern Lomaria Spicant Desv., following the lead of Hooker and Baker, who maintained Lomaria as generically distinct from Blechnum, mainly on the basis of its strongly dimorphic fertile and sterile fronds. In 1900 Underwood, also recognizing both genera, took up the name Struthiopteris Scopoli (1760) in place of the much later Lomaria Willd. (1809), but wrongly attributed the combination Struthiopteris Spicant to Scopoli, whereas it had not been published until 1770 and then by Weis. Struthiopteris has since been adopted by the writer and many other American fern students, and it is in fact the name that must be applied to the Lomaria element if two genera are recognized. But even in Great Britain, despite the influence of Hooker and Baker's work, our plant appeared in many fern books as Blechnum Spicant, and most non-English writers-for example, Kuhn, Ettingshausen, Sturm, Luerssen, Makino, and Christmerged Lomaria in Blechnum, as advocated by Mettenius in 1856.1 More recently, Diels, Hieronymus, Christensen, Rosenstock, and most other fern students have regarded Blechnum in this inclusive sense, and not without reason. This view will presumably find general acceptance in the United States.",

From here Wayne is separated from Pike County by a line S 31? 45' W to the Wallenpaupack Creek, which there becomes the county line to the northern boundary of Monroe County. From here it follows this boundary line westerly to the upper reaches of the Lehigh River. Then in a northeasterly direction this river is the line for about five miles, and then the county line runs N two degrees W back to the New York State line. The county is about 50 miles in length and 20 miles wide at its widest part. It contains 720 square miles. Although there are some 40 villages in the county, the population is distinctly rural. Nearly the entire county is drained by the Delaware River. The divide between that river and the Susquehanna enters the county on the western border near the northern boundary. For a few miles it extends in a southeasterly direction to Lake Shehawken, where it is nearly halfway across the county. From this point it extends about seven miles southwesterly to Sugar Loaf Mountain, near the western boundary of the county. Then for a course of about 25 miles it follows the summit of the Moosic Range, close to and paralleling the western boundary of the county to a few miles below Waymart, where the Moosic leaves the county as the western boundary of the Lackawanna valley.

    "abstract": "Pteridophytes often play important roles in determining the nature of plant communities (Watt, 1947). This role is particularly pronounced in tropical cloud forests where the diversity and variety of growth forms in ferns often is very great. In this paper we describe an investigation between the relationship of branching and patterns of shoot distribution in a tree fern. We chose to study the distribution pattern of shoots of Lophosoria quadripinnata (J. Gmelin) C. Chr. (Lophosoriaceae), a small tree fern that occurs throughout the Neotropics (Tryon & Tryon, 1982), and attempted to relate the observed pattern of shoot distribution to the morphology and branching pattern of the species. The shoot morphology of this species has been described superficially by earlier authors. Bower (1926) illustrated a short segment of the axis and showed that the aboveground stems arise from a rhizome. Lucansky (1982) limited his comparison of the anatomy of Lophosoria and Metaxya to the erect stems. We therefore sought to understand the very prominent role Lophosoria quadripinnata plays in cloud forest vegetation by futher investigating its morphology and ecology.",

    "abstract": "-A survey of 42 glade sites in northeastern Iowa documented the occurrence of the northern plains Botrychium campestre at 12 sites. These populations represent a 200-350 km eastern range extension into a habitat previously unreported for this taxon. The presence of B. campestre with other northern plains disjuncts in the flora of these sites suggests that eastern Iowa glades may represent refugia for taxa whose ranges were more extensive during the Hypsithermal. Botrychium campestre W.H. Wagner & Farrar initially was located in 1982 in the Loess Hills of western Iowa. While at first believed to represent a Loess Hills endemic (Howe et al., 1984), subsequent investigation revealed it to occur in dry gravel or loess prairie sites from extreme southwestern Iowa to central Alberta (Lellinger, 1985; Wagner and Wagner, 1986; Coffin and Pfanmuller, 1988). Disjunct populations of this species also have been found in grasslands on beach dunes or on thin soil over bedrock along the eastern, western, and northern shores of Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, and the southern shore of Lake Superior (Wagner and Wagner, 1993). Although the most recent range map for this species (Wagner and Wagner, 1993) shows this taxon entering eastern Iowa, until now no populations were known east of Dickinson County in extreme northwestern Iowa (Peck et al., 1989). A single population of B. campestre was located in May 1993 on a limestone glade southwest of Rockford in Floyd County, Iowa. This station represented a 200 km range extension eastward into a previously undocumented habitat for this species. During May of 1994 and 1995, 42 additional glade sites, spread across 17 northeastern Iowa counties, were surveyed. Populations of B. campestre were located at 12 sites in 10 counties (Fig. 1).

One proved to be new species of Cnemidaria, the other a new, simply pinnate Trichipteris. I am always hesitant to describe new species based only upon single collections, as is the case with these, but each is highly distinctive from others in their respective genera.

    "abstract": "In 1904 Charles Werckle, the French-Costa Rican gardener and collector, sent a depauperate specimen of Neurocallis praestantissima (Bory) Fee to Hermann Christ, who was then working on the Filicales for Durand and Pittier's Florae Costaricensis. Christ described the fern as a new species, Pteris macrodictya (Bull. Herb. Boiss. II, 7: 267. 1907), and related it to P. haenkeana Presl and to P. podophylla Swartz. He remarked that although the specimen was sterile and fragmentary, the uniqueness of the new species laid in the entire margins, coarsely reticulate venation, and herbaceous texture of the pinnae, and in the general resemblance of the plant to Hemidictyum marginatum Presl, a set of characters not found in any of the known species of Pteris. Two months later, in his Appendice aux Primitiae Costaricensis Filic. V. (Bull Herb. Boiss. II, 7: 585. 1907), Christ corrected his earlier publication and recognized that the Werckle collection was actually the first continental record of N. praestantissima, described from the West Indies in 1845. This emendation was overlooked by Scamman (Rhodora 63: 205. 1961), who supposed that P. macrodictya Christ was P. grandifolia L. J. G. Baker made the same mistake as Christ did when he described and illustrated Pteris dominicensis Baker in Hooker (Ic. P1. 3: 1642. 1886), an error later corrected by Jenman (Ferns Brit. West Ind. & Guian. [Misc. Inf. Bot. Dept. Trinidad 23] 118. 1900). After the collection by Werckle, who as usual did not cite a locality for his plant, Neurocallis was never again reported for Costa Rica. But during a recent field trip to Patillo, in the mountains ENE of Tapantl, Prov. Cartago, I located a large population of this fern (G6mez & Kennedy 3345, CR). The specimens were collected in a dense rain forest, where several species of Bolbitis, Cyathea, Diplazium, and Thelypteris were abundant.",

France 11: 101. 1864), but this is a later homonym of I. braunii Unger published in 1850 for a fossil European species (Reed, 1945). Engelmann (1867), apparently unaware that I. braunii Dur. was a later homonym, transferred it to varietal status under I. echinospora. The use of the epithet braunii is legitimate, but it must be treated as a new name, and not as a transfer according to the Note under Article 72 of the Code. The correct citation is, therefore, I. echinospora Dur. var. braunii Engelm., not var. braunii (Dur.) Engelm. as used by Morton (1952) and ethers. Reed's (1945) use of the epithet braunii as a variety of I. muricata Dur. should, consequently, be var. braunii (Engelm.) Reed, not var. braunii (Dur.) Reed.",

But when one considers the entire peninsula of Baja California, it contains seven species of Spike-moss, five of which Tryon places in the subgenus Selayinella section Tetragonostachys (A. Braun) Hieron. (Ann. Mo. Bot. Gard. 42: 1-99. 1955). The other two belong in the subgenus Stachygynandrum series Circinatae, according to Alston (in Verdoorn, Manual of Pteridology, pp. 503-4. 1938). These seven Spike-mosses may be distinguished with the aid of the following key, and are illustrated here by line drawings in Plate 23 et seq. The drawings are offered as supplements to the excellent half-tone reproductions in Tryon's paper in order to emphasize certain details.",

Even if a considerable portion of the end is cut off (P1. 6, fig. 8) juvenile leaves are not formed by the new plant. Runners are produced at an early stage, from which a number of plants may originate (Fig. 9). Under favorable conditions of culture only about a year is required for growing a mature plant. Since Nephrolepis cordifolia produces tubers and runners in great abundance, its chances for success in nature are much greater than those ferns which lack such propagules.",

About five miles outside of Matura I slowed my jeep to observe a series of roadside crosses, religious signs, and finally a small house built up from the ground on stilts, the whole house covered with unusual metallic crosses and peculiar tangles of vines, obviously all man-made with considerable care. Since no one was in sight, I drove on slowly, observing the rich vegetation of the Mora forests crowding the highway. A short distance along the Toco road I saw the prophet walking along the roadside. My curiosity prompted me to halt the jeep and the next half hour was spent in conversation with this man of unusual dress and interesting philosophy. The prophet wore a dark blue cloak of heavy felt which he called his uniform. Adorning the blue felt was a white belt from which hung a carved dagger-like instrument. Over his chest was a series of white crosses, coin medallions, religious pictures, and even his own photograph taken by an earlier tourist. All these hung from aluminum painted safety pins.

Schott x oreopteris (Ehrh.) Maxon. Reed,2 in view of the apparent absence of one of the putative parents from the area, is inclined to doubt the hybrid origin of the specimen. He also draws attention to a unique character of D. oreopteris which was not commented on by Ewan, viz. the prickly exospores. During the past summer, Mr. Alan Morkhill, of Victoria, B. C., kindly allowed the writer to study a living plant of the original collection made in 1934 by Lohbrunner and Nichols at Alice Arm, B. C. Fronds from this plant were carefully checked with the type sheet (Lohbrunner & Nichols 9555) in the herbarium of the Provincial Museum at Victoria3 with complete agreement in all essential details. There can be no doubt of the authenticity of Mr. Morkhill's plant. The following table gives the result of a detailed comparison of the Lohbrunner and Nichols plant with a specimen of D. filix-mas (W. B. Anderson 16, from Chilliwack, B. C.).",

In this view, I am following Dr. George Neville Jones,2 as well as my own study of a large number of herbarium specimens. However, further field studies and anatomical observations are surely to be desired. Fernald's second variety is called E. hyemale var. affine (Engelm.) A. A. Eaton and the third var. robustum (A. Br.) A. A. Eaton. I recognize the same two varieties, but under the names var. pseudohyemale (Farwell) Morton and var. elatum (Engelm.) Morton. These two varieties are probably distinct, although this has been disputed (e.g. by Jones, op. cit.). The variety commonest in Canada and the northeastern United States is usually rather low and slender, although this is variable, some plants being quite robust. The only distinctive character is in the regularly and promptly deciduous teeth of the sheaths of the main stems. Most southern and western plants are much",

A single colony of some 50 plants or more was seen, but not a single fertile frond was present. Shaded ravine of a tributary of the Pegoua River, Concorde Valley, 200 m., no. 3130. DRYOPTERIS QUADRANGULARIS (Fee) Alston. This was published in the Pteridophyta of St. Kitts3 as a new combination to include the New World material of D. dentata (Forsk.) C. Chr. Alston apparently made this combination without having examined sufficient American material, for the characters used by him in separating D. dentata and D. quadrangularis completely break down. Dominica collections (16 numbers) of this complex alone show that D. quadrangularis cannot be upheld; for although no. 3459 from La Chaudiere is typical D. quadrangularis, no. 2597 from Milton is typical of what Alston calls Old World D. dentata, and the majority of my numbers show various combinations of characters of both species. To cite just a few: No. 1254, Imperial Road, has the lobation, slightly reduced lower pinnae, and long hairs of D. quadrangularis, with the rhachis and rhizome of D. dentata; no. 2877, Milton, has the slightly reduced pinnae and yellow rhachis of D. quadrangularis, with the lobation, hairs, and rhizome of D. dentata;",

Genevieve county in the southeastern portion of the Ozark Mountains, the junior author, in company with Dr. Robert Thorne, of the University of Iowa, discovered nearly fifty plants of Lycopodium obscurum var. dendroideum. The dark green, erect branches stood out in sharp contrast to the pale green color of the thick bed of Sphagnum compactum in which the plants were growing on the upper, shaded, steep slopes of one of the narrow bluff-rimmed sandstone gorges of the headwaters of the River aux Vases. The collection data are: Steyermark 72506, La Motte sandstone bluffs along upper reaches of River aux Vases, T 35 N, R 7 E, west part of sect. 34 and east half of sect. 33, 3?-4 miles northwest of Avon, Ste. Genevieve Co., August 30, 1951. This discovery marks a new southwestern limit of distribution for the species and its variety, hitherto known southwestward to Georgia and Tennessee. The sandstone region in which the discovery was made is famous for its harboring of other eastern and northern relics, such as Lycopodium complanatum var. flabelliforme, Dennstaedtia punctilobula, Goodyera pubescens, and Bryoxiphium norvegicum, which are isolated here at or near their southwestern limits of dispersal.

With my friend, Harry Monk, of Nashville, an indefatigable and accurate student of birds, I left Nashville on the morning of August 29, 1935. The plan was to stop along the road at any place that looked attractive and stay as long as we liked. I collected and photographed plants during the daytime and pressed them in the evening while my companion concentrated mainly on the birds. It seemed unwise to stop at the station of Scott's Spleenwort (x Asplenium ebenoides) at the Mount View School (Shaver, 1934) since it had been visited not many weeks before and found to be in an unusually flourishing condition, with only two plants present, however; or at the power plant dam at Rock Island where occurs the finest growth of Venus-hair Fern (Adiantum Capillus-Veneris) with which I am acquainted.

That the ferns should be first treated is logical, for with nearly 400 species this great plant group is dominant on rain-drenched, mountainous Dominica. During the past four years the writer has spent intermittent periods collecting on Dominica with the anticipation of finally publishing a flora of the island. As a result of these investigations 23 species of ferns are here added to the known list presented in Domin's work. Future additions will undoubtedly be made, for many pteridophyte species still unknown on Dominica are common to the two French islands Guadeloupe and Martinique, which lie close to the British island on the north and on the south.",

    "abstract": "Selaginella utahensis Flowers was described on the basis of two small specimens collected in southwestern Utah by Dr. W. P. Cottam.1 Through an unfortunate error in copying the wrong line of data from the field catalog on the specimen label, the type locality became misstated by about thirty-two miles and the mistake was not discovered until after the description was published. A correction appeared in a later issue of the journal.2 The type locality is on Lady Mountain, in Zion National Park, a high precipitous sandstone cliff arising about three thousand feet above the canyon floor, the latter being at an elevation of about four thousand feet at this point. In June 1951 I made a special trip to Zion Park for further study and collecting. The National Park Service has blazed a trail up the face of this mountain for the benefit of the more zealous hikers. It is extremely steep and tortuous, often crossing slopes where mere footrests have been cut in the smooth sandstone or leading up improvised stairs and along narrow ledges with a handrail or chain to steady the footing as one crosses. There are several ladders leading from one narrow ledge to",

Shackleton showed the writer a single plant of the hybrid fern Asplenosorus ebenoides (Scott) Wherry (Scott's spleenwort) growing in a crevice of a calcareous outcrop on a high bank of Hite's Branch, a tributary of the South Fort of Harrods Creek in Oldham County, Kentucky. Leaves were taken without disturbing the roots and these leaf specimens are in the herbarium at the University of Louisville. S. C. Thacher, an excellent amateur botanist of Louisville, informed the writer that he had discovered, in 1942, two locations of this hybrid, one in Clark County, Indiana, and the other in Bullitt County, Kentucky. The Clark County station is on a shady limestone outcrop above Fourteen Mile Creek, at the Tunnel Mill Boy Scout Camp. After two hours search with Mr. Thacher on June 10, 1951, only two plants were located. Originally this colony contained 13 plants but collectors have taken most of them. Previous reports from Indiana are those of Coulter' for stations in Crawford and Jefferson Counties, and Kriebel2 for Lawrence County. The Bullitt County station, which originally contained 3 plants, is on a shaded limestone outcrop near Indian Charles Spring at the Girl Scout Camp. A careful search of this area on September 28, 1951, did not yield a single one. As others knew of this station, they may have taken all the plants for specimens. Only one other report has been published for Kentucky: Linney3 found it growing on a fallen mass of sandstone near Salt Lick Creek, in Marion County. McCoy omitted it from",

Here on the Cumberland Plateau (elevation 2,000 feet) in a small swampy area and associated with Sagittaria and Sphagnum, we observed Osmunda regalis var. spectabilis, Osmunda cinnamomea and Woodwardia areolata; the latter growing in great abundance. Near the margin of the swamp which was rather densely shaded by oaks, tulip poplars, and maples were numerous plants of Thelypteris noveboracensis. As we continued our journey eastward, we halted some four miles nearer Monterey to note the several rather mediocre plants of Lygodiumn palmatum clinging to a crevice of a northward exposure of sandstone outcropping. They were a contrast, indeed, to the luxuriant growth of this fern a few miles farther east where it may be found along the sandy banks of shaded brooks. It was ten o'clock on July 20th before our party of 20 had reached Bee Rock, a high sandstone bluff one mile southeast of Monterey. This vantage point gave us a commanding view of the headwaters of the Calf-killer River some 600 feet below. Here our study proper was to begin. As we viewed this rugged expanse of wooded hillsides, with here and there an outcropping of sandstone, little did the party realize the difficulty of the course ahead. We would first descend rapidly from cliff to cliff and through crevices, then a more gradual descent would lead us down a two-mile valley westward. We would follow the course of a small stream-bed. At the lower end of the two-mile valley, we would cross the",

Of the ferns there are 3 families, 18 genera and 70 species and their subdivisions; of the fern allies, 3 families, 4 genera and 65 species and their subdivisions. All except one or two have been found in Keweenaw County and were collected chiefly at or near the old Cliff Mine location, in the old township of Clifton. All are probably common to Keweenaw, Houghton and Baraga counties, which comprise the Peninsula. As originally submitted, this paper contained some generic names that have been outlawed by recent International Congresses. As I have not the proceedings and no list of conserved names, Mr. C. A. Weatherby kindly consented to re-edit these parts and bring the nomenclature into accordance with the rules. I am under deep obligations to him and wish to express my heartfelt appreciation of his kindness and invaluable assistance, not only as to nomenclatural matters, but also in regard to Latin diagnoses, which I had failed to provide.",

    "abstract": "From the sands of Minnesota Point, the sandbar islands of Duluth harbor, along the rugged lake coast to the gorge of Pigeon River on the Canadian boundary, there occur many types of habitats suitable for growth of ferns. The climate, moderated by the large body of water, ample rainfall and fogs, has been conducive to the development of a fairly rich and varied fern flora. In this area of moist sands, exposed rocks, sheer cliffs, shady forest, swamp, and mossy ledges have been collected forty-two different taxonomic entities. The present paper is based on collections in the herbarium of the University of Minnesota at Minneapolis and the herbarium of the Duluth Branch. The genus Botrychium is represented by eight entities. Of these, B. Lunaria and B. matricariaefolium are local, only collected in Lake and Cook counties. B. multifidum and its varieties are encountered in the sands of Minnesota Point, at Duluth, and in grassy mats of vegetation on the lakeshore farther northeast. Ophioglossum vulgatum var. pseudopodum within our area is known only from a sandbar island in Duluth harbor, where it appeared in pioneer vegetation. Of the Osmundas the least frequent is 0. regalis var. spectabilis, known only from Devil's Track, in Cook County. The rare Asplenium Trichomanes is in the interior of Cook County. Athyrium Filix-femina var. Michauxii and its forms, elatius and rubellum, occur commonly throughout the area in moist habitats. In Gooseberry River Gorge on basaltic rocks, Cryptogramma Stelleri occurs sparingly; elsewhere it has been collected only from sedimentary rocks. On mossy rocks and in moist shady terrain grow 16",

C., and Dr. Ira L. Wiggins of Stanford University, California, on a trip of botanical exploration into the more remote regions of Sonora, Mexico. One of the most interesting features of this trip was the opportunity afforded to study some of the Arizona ferns as found growing in the Sonoran wilds. One of the first ferns to be collected in Sonora was Cheilanthes pringlei Davenport. Specimens were gathered amid the scenic loveliness of the Rio Magdalena. This winding river flows through a rugged and rockbound countryside, where its banks are lined deeply with many a tree and much luxuriant planting to beguile the nature lover. Wonderful specimens of Sycamore, Platanus wrightii, and Honey Mesquite, Prosopis glandulosa, were shade-bearers for myriads of annual and herbaceous plants. Above such groupings, among the rocks and boulders, were found numerous specimens of the Pringle Lip Fern. And, most assuredly, it was not alone as a fern species in such a habitat, as also collected hereabouts were Notholaena sinuata, Notholaena sinuata integerrima., Notholaena lemmoni, Cheilanthes lindheimeri, and others. Surely here is a fern that might well be popularly known as the Lace Fern, inasmuch as its fronds resemble nothing so much as most delicate lace work, woven of dark green segments and chestnut-brown scaly rachises. Mr. George E. Davenport named this delightful fern in honor of Mr. C. G. Pringle from specimens collected in Arizona. The fern described as Cheilanthes sonorensis Goodding is to be regarded, according to Dr. W. R. Maxon, as precisely this species. 43",

We present the results of an analysis of the annual variation in starch content in Matteuccia struthiopteris (L.) Todaro, cultivated in the Leiden botanical garden. Our results show a distinct seasonal variation in starch content, suggesting that the presence of trophopods is indeed functionally linked to seasonality, but we do not find a decrease in starch content corresponding to the period of leaf expansion that would clearly link the depletion of stored starch to the expansion of new leaves.",

    "abstract": "The fern genus Anogramma is characterized by the presence of annual sporophytes and tubercles that persist through dry periods. Tubercles may host embryos that develop when climatic conditions are more favorable. As information on the structure of the tubercle and sporophyte of Anogramma chaerophylla is incomplete, the objective of this work was to analyze anatomical characteristics during development and deepen knowledge of the adaptive strategies of this species. Spores were grown in-vitro and different stages of tubercle development and embryonic sporophytes were fixed in FAA, embedded in Paraplast and analyzed using light microscopy. Initially, the green gametophyte developed antheridia and archegonia in its thickened portion, where later bisexual tubercles differentiated. Embryos developed only from the archegonia located in the tubercles, with one embryo developing per tubercule. During sporophyte growth the reserves accumulated in the tubercle were consumed. Oversized cells were observed at the junction between the green gametophyte and the tubercle, suggesting a possible role in translocation of substances. The young sporophyte consisted of a short shoot and a prominent foot. The placenta comprised the foot cells and the adjacent tubercle cells. The first leaves protruded soon and developed early as photosynthetic organs. Sporophytes remained attached to the tubercles until advanced stages of development. Vegetative propagation was documented in smaller tubercles that did not develop gametangia. Because few sporophytes were observed in vivo, it is likely that natural populations are maintained through vegetative propagation of the gametophyte until favorable conditions encourage development of sporophytes.",

    "abstract": "Azolla Lam. is a genus of freshwater aquatic ferns which lives symbiotically with a nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium. There are seven designated species (Lumpkin & Plucknett, 1982), three of which grow natively in the neotropics and subtropics. A. microphylla Kaulf. (MI in this paper) is the only one whose range reportedly lies entirely within the tropics. From an arbitrary focal point at the Galapagos Islands, its distributlion extends north into the West Indies and Central America, and also across northern and central South America (Schofield & Colinvaux, 1969; Morton & Wiggins, 1971). Within South America, MI is purportedly centered in the lowlands of Brazil (Svenson, 1944). The MI species, or the MI X A. filiculoides (FI) hybrid (Van Cat et al., 1989), is also a superior Azolla for application as a biofertilizer with irrigated rice. Its rapid growth in hot, humid regions of South and Southeast Asia, combined with greater fungal resistance, makes MI more desirable than the indigenous A. pinnata (Maybbayad, 1987; Ventura et al., 1987; Choonluchanon et al., 1988; Liu & Zheng, 1989). The MI which have become field accessions are stored in the Azolla germplasm collection at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines. All of the MI accessions from which hybrids and F1 progeny have been made were collected in northwest Paraguay in 1979. MI 4017 and 4018, among the most heat-tolerant of the tested germplasm, are commonly grown in IRRI fields at Los Bafios and South Cobato (Ventura et al., 1987). A second survey was sponsored by IRRI in 1988 to gather additional agroecotypes of Azolla. This paper discusses the genetic results found from that survey. METHODS",

Newm., in Blair County, Pennsylvania (Wherry, 1942a). This significant find was not disclosed until 1941, when she and Elsie Canan located a larger colony of plants nearby and arranged to have the site verified by E.T. Wherry. At the time, this finding was regarded as the most remarkable disjunct occurrence of any species for the state of Pennsylvania (Wherry, 1942b); an honor that later when to Montia chamissoi (Ledeb. ex Spreng.) Greene (Wherry, 1964). Nevertheless, the Blair County site still maintained the presumed distinction of being the southernmost locality known for G. robertianum in North America (Ogden, 1981), with the nearest stations being 260 miles to the northwest in St. Clair County, Michigan and 300 miles directly north in Frontenac County, Ontario (Sarvela et al., 1981). The small number of herbarium specimens originating from the Blair County site indicates that it was a well-kept secret indeed, with only a handful of botanists who made collections there (Table 1). Most gave general directions to it as either miles northwest of 3 miles northwest of or 3.5 miles north of Duncansville. Thomas Darling, Jr. visited the site on August 25, 1956, and the specimen that he deposited at the Smithsonian (US) provides the most detailed locality information: among limestone rocks on northwest-facing talus slope near quarry, approximately 2 miles northwest of Hollidaysburg, near point where Burgoon Creek intersects Beaverdam Branch of Juniata River, Blair County. The most recent date of collection is August 10, 1957, when the site was visited by L.K. Henry (Table 1). No herbarium specimens taken from there since that date were located.",

I am reporting seven new locations for this fern in Louisiana. Throughout most of its range, T. petersii grows on rocks or soil and is rarely reported as an epiphyte. But in all Louisiana locations, it was epiphytic. I found T. petersii on Southern Magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora L.) and on American Beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.). On American Beech the fern usually occurs as a small population (ca. 25 cm2 or less) very close to the ground, usually on the buttress sides. On Southern Magnolia it usually forms large populations (ca. 900 cm2 or more) and is 3-10 dm above the base of the tree. In one location, the fern was about 3.5 m above the tree base. Southern Magnolia seems to be the preferred habitat; I have found 10 populations on it but only five on American Beech.",

Correll (Wrightia 2: 163-165. 1960) as a collection part a single plant from Hardin County, two miles south Saratoga. Lance Rosier, who led Correll to this location, assured him of other localities in the Big Thicket. But Rosier, now deceased, never disclosed any additional localities. While conducting an inventory bog habitats in Freestone County, in the company Glen Chervenka the Soil Conversation Service, I discovered a population Psilotum ntiidiun consisting ten sterile, immature plants 8-12 cm tall. All were found growing within a three square meter area on a seepage slope at the edge a wet, marshy meadow along a tributary Mustang Creek about 22 km west Oakwood. Two specimens, L. N. Lodwick 216 (MO, TEX), were collected, and verification was by Dr. H. C. Bold, the University Texas. The specimens were growing in a wet, peaty humus 5-8 cm deep underlain by a coarse, white sand which has been mapped as a member the Queen's City Formation (Geological Atlas Texas, Palestine Sheet, February 1968). The Psilottun was associated with a dense canopy Post Oak (Quercus stellata), Water Oak (Q. nigra), and Wax Myrtle (Myrica cerifera). Sphagnum subsecundlam was an intermittent ground cover in suitable microhabitats, but due to the dense shade, little ground cover occurred nearby other than the Sphaglnum. The only disturbance to the area is grazing by cattle, and it is unlikely that any other disturbance is imminent. This collection Psilotumn is the first recorded for the Post Oak Savannah region Texas and represents a disjunction approximately 200 km to the northwest Correll's collection, which is in the Pineywoods east Texas.Laurence N.

    "abstract": "Conrad Vernon Morton, named Walter Vernon Morton at the time of his birth on October 24, 1905, was the son of Walter Crow Morton and Nioma (later Noma) Bartholomew Morton. He was born in Fresno, California, where his parents had been life-long residents and his father had a roofing and building contractor's business. Walter Crow Morton died when Walter was still young, and in about 1917 his mother married Alva B. McCray, who also had been a resident of Fresno for many years. In fact, the McCray and Bartholomew families were friends. Mr. McCray was employed by the Santa Fe Railroad. The family home at Fresno included a vineyard and various gardens on the property, and so young Walter was introduced to plants at an early age. As a child, he planted and tended a small garden of his own. His mother was well known in the area for her rose garden; she grew about 130 varieties abundantly. During his junior high and high school years, the family lived in Berkeley, where Mrs. McCray's sister and family lived. The climate there was more moderate than in Fresno, and better for Mrs. McCray's health. When he was in high school Walter won a fellowship to the local Art Institute. Of all the students in the class, he was the only boy, and for this reason he did not pursue his study of art very far at that time. (After he began his professional career, however, he studied both painting and the piano diligently, and mastered and practiced both arts with great pleasure for himself and his friends for the remainder of his life. He was also greatly interested in the history of the cinema, in dramatics, and in philately. For a more ample account of Morton's non-botanical interests, see Ewan, J. A. 1973. Taxon 22: 271-274.) Morton entered the University of California at Berkeley in 1924. At that time he changed his given names to Conrad Vernon (the legal change was made on April 14, 1926). His interests at first included the physical sciences, mathematics, astronomy, and slavic languages and literature. During the latter part of his freshman year he began a course in general botany. In his sophomore year he studied elementary taxonomy under Prof. Willis L. Jepson. Apparently this course triggered a strong interest in taxonomic botany, for he took several more courses from Jepson, plus algology and mycology from Prof. Gardner, plant physiology from Prof. Holman, and cytology and genetics from Prof. Goodspeed. His first botanical collections were made around Berkeley in January 1926. Morton held tuition scholarships at the University for the last three of his undergraduate years. He was a Levi Strauss Scholar in 1925-26, a Henry Morgan Holbrook Scholar in 1926-27, and a Carrie M. Jones Scholar in 1927-28. He was elected to membership in the scientific fraternity Sigma Xi and in the biological sciences fraternity Phi Sigma. In October 1926 he was inducted into",

This plant also shares the trait of raised major veins with P. bifurcatum var. lanciferum, described in 1915. Morphological and molecular comparisons of this plant were made with members of the P. bifurcatum complex, particularly with P. bifurcatum and P. willinckii, to determine its true identity. We conclude that Platycerium 'Mount Lewis' is a variant of P. bifurcatum.",

    "abstract": "Wintergreen ferns keep their leaves for an entire year before replacing them with new leaves in the spring. The overwintering leaves of Dryopteris intermedia provide carbon to the new leaves, and if these old leaves cannot become prostrate before winter via the hinge that develops at the base of the petiole, they are frost damaged and broken, which may affect the development of the new leaves in the subsequent year. I compared the vernal development of new leaves in D. intermedia between plants whose old leaves were intact and those whose petioles had been experimentally broken in the fall to determine the importance of the softening of the petiole-base in old leaves to the development of new leaves. Compared to the control, plants whose old leaves had broken petioles had a one-week delay in the development of their new leaves. This delay demonstrates that the evolutionary development of the petiole hinge may have been critical to the functional benefit associated with new leaf development in the wintergreen leaf habit in ferns.",

We report sporangiasters in Parablechnum nesophilum, which is their first recorded occurrence in the Blechnaceae. We provide evidence of their homology to sporangia and discuss their functional significance. The presence of sporangiasters in P. nesophilum is surprising because the species has a well-developed indusium, and paraphyses are generally most common in exindusiate ferns. We surmise that these sporangiasters act as a second stage of protection for the developing sporangia after the indusium retracts. Alternatively, it is possible that sporangiasters may influence the vagility of spores by inhibiting dehiscence and limiting the ability of the annulus to disperse its spores.",

First, let it be assumed that some reader contemplates making his first hardy fernery; among his first questions will be, Where is the best position I can choose? In reply to that, I say the real essentials are shade and shelter from the roughest, battering winds that blow. In some gardens, shady corners or strips already exist and where they do not, they can usually be created by means of hedges or tall-growing plants, and it generally can be contrived to ensure that whatever is used to",

The sori are terminal on the anterior branches of the veins and are marginal in origin, although turned at maturity toward the lower side of the frond. The indusia are cup-shaped and originate as a low rim which grows until it assumes a spherical shape. The margins are later forced apart by the growing sporangia, but the indusia are never dehiscent, as they have been described. When young, the margins of the indusium are ciliate; however, the long, hyaline hairs are soon deciduous. 65",

This fern is known to be variable, since frequently it produces different forms of leaves, some of which, although rarely, have been observed by the writer to form more or less distinctly serrate margins. Occasionally parts of the leaves are laciniate. Hence, these resemble somewhat the leaves of Polypodium Mandaianum, its well known mutant, discovered by W. A. Manda of South Orange, New Jersey, some time before 1912, when the fern had already been introduced in the markets and exhibited at flower shows in this country and in Chelsea, England. Two years ago, one of the P. aureurn plants in the greenhouse formed, in addition to the typical leaves, a fertile leaf similar in all respects to that of Polypodium Mandaianum. The fern and its mutant are similar in",

One day I was surprised to find a few fronds growing in a space between the logs of the outer wall of Miller Roadhouse. In Livengood I have collected it two different years on a mossy shaded bank, where water is seeping down from overhanging cliffs, (nos. 1679 [1940], 4881 [1947]).

Near here is the famous glen where Asplenium ebenoides has become established and now is known to be self perpetuating. It was with no mean enthusiasm that I anticipated chasing this rare fern with the hope of finding a specimen, not represented in my collection at that time. I was met by Mr. R. B. Lavender, the plantation owner on whose property the glen is located. It was through his hospitality that I enjoyed a most delightful day. A small, clear stream flows through the picturesque woodland. On the steeply sloping sides, almost perpendicular in places, are huge conglomerate rocks. It is in the small crevices of these rocks that Asplenium ebenoides grows. A careful search revealed thirty-one small plants with leaves not more than one inch long. One sizeable plant was taken for my collection. From the spores of this specimen, fifty plants have been produced. The prothallia, which were then discarded, would have continued to produce hundreds of sporelings over an indefinite period. The spores were sown on April 18, 1946, and on April 18, 1948 the plant illustrated, having developed several fertile leaves seven to eight and one-half inches long, was preserved. Several of these plants have developed sporelings about their bases, and the prothallia lifted with the plants when they were individually potted obviously were alive and active at this writing. The aerial growths which have developed on the tips of leaves of a few of the plants will continue to grow if placed in soil. 36",

    "abstract": "With its thick, leathery leaves, reticulate venation, and large sori, Polypodium scouleri, located in a narrow band along the Pacific coast of North America, is the most distinctive member of the cosmopolitan P. vulgare species complex. Although early studies based on morphology and chromosomes yielded hypotheses about the relationships among some elements of this complex, phylogenetic alliances to P. scouleri were not proposed. Combining data from rbcL and trnL DNA sequences with isozymic analyses suggested that P. scouleri originated relatively recently and is closely allied to and sympatric with P. californicum and P. glycyrrhiza. Consistent with a hypothesis of recent origin, we detected no infraspecific isozymic variation across the range of P. scouleri. Although allopolyploidy is a common feature of the P. vulgare complex, P. scouleri stands out because it has not been implicated in the origin of any secondary (allotetraploid) species. However, as early as 1951, Manton reported a triploid individual that was morphologically similar to P. scouleri, but whose other parent could not be verified. Since that time, others have suggested that P. scouleri might be crossing with sympatric congeners, but no solid evidence has been obtained. The present study confirmed that P. scouleri hybridized with neighboring P. calirhiza, and showed that individuals with intermediate morphological features contained isozyme marker alleles from both parental lineages.",

    "abstract": "TWO NEW SITES FOR CERATOPIEKIS THALICTROIDES IN TEXAS.The Water Fern was first reported for Texas by Morton (Amer. Fern J. 57: 13-14. 1967) from the spring-fed backwater of the San Marcos River at San Marcos in Hays County. Hannen (Amer. Fern J. 59: 122. 1969) reported that this species was introduced into Spring Lake, the headwaters of the San Marcos River. Although the spring-fed area above Spring Lake Dam has been highly commercialized (it is now known as Aquarena Springs), Ceratopteris thalictroides (L.) Brongn. is quite abundant is shaded areas along the shoreline of Spring Lake. We also collected it in the river at San Marcos on 9 Aug 1975 (Petrik-Ott 1002, TAES, US). It grows most abundantly along the shaded banks of the San Marcos River to where the Blanco River joins it, about 5 km southeast of the springs. We often frequent springs in search of fresh-water red algae, and so after seeing C. thalictroides in such abundance at San Marcos, we decided to look for it at other springs. We were rewarded by a new find on 10 Aug 1975 in the Comal River at New Braunfels, Comal County, where it was growing abundantly along the muddy banks below Comal Springs in Landa Park (Petrik-Ott 1003, TAES, US). On 7 Sept 1975 we found another station at Salado, Bell County, in a small spring which flows into Salado Creek about /4 mile downstream from the State Highway 35 bridge across Salado Creek (Petrik-Ott 1004, TAES, US). However, we did not find it along the creek itself. The two new sites for C. thalictroides extend its range in Texas 17 miles to the southwest and 75 miles to the north-northeast of the San Marcos locality. The three spring areas in Texas where this species is now known occur along the Balcones Fault, which runs south from Cedar Springs, north of Dallas, to the area of Carrizo Springs southwest of San Antonio. There are numerous springs along this fault line, and because the waters of at least the larger springs provide constant environmental conditions (of temperature, among others), we believe that Ceratopteris may persist for an indefinite time and that additional sites may be found.-Aleta Jo Petrik-Ott, Department of Plant Sciences, College of Agriculture, and Franklyn D.

Bernh. is known in Texas only in the Guadalupe Mountains, Culberson Co. (Correll & Johnston, 1970). New Mexican collections have been made in these same Guadalupe Mountains, Otero or Eddy Co. (Blasdell, 1963, p. 67); in the White Mountain wilderness, northern Otero Co. (C. R. Hutchins, pers. comm.); and north of Taos, Taos Co. (Dittmer, et al., 1954, p. 28). In Utah, Flowers (1944) reported the species from Zion National Park, Washington Co.; Elk Mountain, San Juan Co.; and Brighton and Little Cottonwood Canyon, Salt Lake Co. There are no reports of this species from Colorado, Nevada, or farther north. In Arizona, C. bulbifera has previously been known only from the West Fork of Oak Creek Canyon, Coconino Co. (Kearney, et al., 1960, p. 44). I have recently collected specimens of it in Walnut Canyon, Coconino Co., at a site about 40 km northeast of the Oak Creek locality. A recent floristic study of Walnut Canyon by Joyce (1974) does not mention the occurrence of C. bulbifera, but my examination of his collections has revealed one specimen of this species (Joyce WC634, ASC) misidentified as C. firagilis (L.) Bernh. Blasdell (1963, p. 28) stated that C. bulbifera usually grows on neutral soils associated with limestone, whereas Anderson (1974) indicated that in Nebraska it occurs on sandstone. In Arizona, I have collected this species on both substrates. Cystopteris bulbifera is abundant in the lower portion of the West Fork of Oak Creek Canyon (1550 m), occurring in large colonies on the red sandstone talus and cliffs capped by Kaibab limestone. Associated fern species are Adiantum capillus-veneris , A. pedatuim, and Polypodium hesperium. At higher elevations in the canyon (2000 m), where Cystopteris fragilis, Dryopteris filix-mas, and Polystichulmio lonchitis are found, the Bulblet Fern occurs on limestone outcrops and boulders. At Walnut Canyon, C. bulbifera occurs in a few small colonies at 1800 m in the narrow gorge to the southwest of the Walnut Canyon National Monument Headquarters. Here, the plants grow in shaded seepage sites on vertical cliffs of Kaibab limestone. Associated species are Cheilanthes feei, Cystopteris fragilis, and Selaginella underwoodii. Putative hybrids between C. bulbifera and C. fragilis from Walnut Canyon are currently under investigation. Since the only previously reported chromosome counts for C. bulbifera were based on specimens from eastern North America, an attempt was made to obtain",

Material of Pronephrium lakhimpurense was collected in the eastern Himalayas. This fern is fairly common in Sikkim and the Darjeeling Himalayas; it grows on humus-rich, wet soils, especially near water courses, at 300-600 m elevation. Ampelopteris prolifera was collected on the Punjab plains. Leaf traces were studied from sectioned material, as well as from rhizome segments cleared in Schultz's macerating fluid.

Presl (1845, p. 56) also accepted the epiphytic and monotypic genus Ophioderma (Blume) Endl., which differs from Ophioglossum sensu stricto and from Cheiroglossa in having fronds that are narrow, strap-shaped, and entire or rarely forked at the apex, and in the median, basal position of a single or a pair of fertile segments: Sed Ophioderma ab Ophioglosso revera differt non solum habitu frondis fasciaeformi, sed praesertim venarum maculis simplicibus, venulis liberis nullis, exortu laterali spicae e vena media frondis. In the Index Filicum Christensen recognized neither segregate; Nakai (1925) rejected Cheiroglossa as a genus but upheld Ophioderma; Clausen (1938, p. 111) considered Cheiroglossa and Ophioderma to be subgenera of Ophioglossum; and Copeland (1947, p. 11) also submerged both into that genus, stating that a number of species are intermediate and link the three genera. Although there may be no cytological differences (Ninan, 1958), there are a number of morphological and anatomical reasons for separation at the subgeneric level (Chrysler, 1941; Nishida, 1952; Clausen, 1954, pp. 496-498; Maroti, 1965; van Cotthem, 1973). Several species and varieties have been proposed in subg. Cheiroglossa. Cheiroglossa malgassica (C. Chr.) Pic. Ser., from Madagascar, Reunion, and the Seychelles Islands, differs from typical 0. palmatum in having smaller fronds and areoles, in the fertile segments mostly inserted near the base of the sterile blade, and in a less deeply incised and thicker lamina and uniformly thick veins. Cheiroglossa louisii (Taton) Pic. Ser., from the Congo, has dichotomously segmented fronds with very long, narrow segments, hexagonal, elongate areoles with few included veinlets, and the fertile segments sometimes furcate. Only two collections are known of this species. Cheiroglossa austrobrasiliensis Brade, from Brazil, differs in lamina dimensions and color of the sterile segment and common petiole. It has narrow areoles, and the fertile segments are inserted both on the petiole and on the margins of the sterile segment. The present study is based on six large clumps of 0. palmatum collected at San Rafael de Vara Blanca, Province of Heredia, at 2000 m altitude. The plants grew as epiphytes on various trees, mostly Quercus sp. and Magnolia poasana Standl., together with other epiphytes, including Orchidaceae, Bromeliaceae, Araceae, and bryophytes. The area is a montane cloud forest, with rainfall averaging 3000 mm/year and temperatures 18?C. Voucher specimens are: Wagner & Gomez 1181 (CR), Lent 1615 (F), and Gomez 5070 (CR), and totalled 57 fertile fronds.",

On April 10, 1908 they visited La Carpintera, a series of hills between the cities of San Jose and Cartago. There they gathered, among other things, a specimen determined by A. C. Brade as Polypodium furfuraceum Schlecht. & Cham. that was unusual in having 16-21 lower pairs of pinnae pinnatisect, rather than entire, as is usual in P. furfuraceum. Many years later A. C. Brade described this peculiar plant as P. furfuraceum f. pinnatisectuin:  Differt a forma typica pinnis ex parte pinnatisectis; pinnis 12-16 infimis pinnatisectis, utrinque cum 3-7 segmentis; segmentae usque ad 7 mm longae. The type specimen label also reads in Brade's hand (? P. lindenianum Kze.), the name of yet another Polypodium with pinnatisect fronds. However, Brade's specimen is in fact the natural hybrid P. friedrichsthalianum Kunze x filrfliraceuim. Both parents are very common in the type locality and vicinity, where natural hybrid, P. x aspidiolepis Baker (P. friedrichsthalianum x thyssaiiolepis A. Braun), also occurs. The discovery of the hybrid nature of Brade's plant requires a change in its nomenclatural status:",

    "abstract": "Like many groups of tropical ferns, the family Hymenophyllaceae is not well represented in continental Africa, where only 30-35 species occur. Despite the moderate number, there is still some disagreement about the specific limits of several species (cf. Schelpe, 1970; Faden, 1974). There has not been a continentwide study of the family since the generic monograph of Copeland (1938), which is incomplete in species coverage and lacks species descriptions. No new species has been described from mainland Africa since Alston (1956). While I was working at the East African Herbarium from 1969 to 1972, I made several collections of a Trichomanes which appeared to represent an undescribed species. Herbarium studies at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and British Museum (Natural History) confirmed this conclusion and revealed that the species is widespread in eastern Africa. Field investigations also showed that it is ecologically distinct from its relatives in East Africa. Trichomanes ramitrichum Faden, sp. nov. Figs. 1-5 Trichomanes sp.

    "abstract": "Ecology, syntaxonomy and population size of Gymnocarpium dryopteris have been studied, especially during the period 1979–1991 by collecting data on 419 colonies in the Kuinderbos (a planted woodland in the Noordoostpolder, a polder reclaimed from the former Zuiderzee in 1942) and 74 colonies elsewhere in the Netherlands. In this paper the Kuinderbos population is compared with other Dutch populations (pleistocene area) in order to provide more insights in the ecology of the species and circumstances facilitating high density. Populations in Germany were studied as reference. In the period 1979–1991 the species was recorded in the Netherlands with at least 670 colonies, of which 89% are in the Kuinderbos. Gymnocarpium dryopteris prefers shadowed ditches and drainage trenches, but can grow at various other habitats as well. Especially at the western and southern part of the Netherlands, the species grows on canal walls. Sites with Gymnocarpium dryopteris belong to different communities. In the Kuinderbos stands of Picea sitchensis are preferred, while elsewhere in the Netherlands the species prefers the Quercion roboris-petreae (Fago-Quercetum) or Pseudotsuga mensiezii-stands. Gymnocarpium dryopteris is accompanied by 14 fern species, at the Kuinderbos by 12 fern species, with Athyrium filix-femina as characteristic species, often indicating potential sites. Rhizomes are shallow creeping, at average 2.6 cm below the surface (0.5–8 cm). It grows in the ecto-organic layer or just below this layer. At trench sides it often grows in the mineral layer. Most colonies are within the influence of the watertable. The Dutch colonies are small and colonies with more than 1000 fronds are rare. This probably indicates that most colonies are less than 20 years old. Colonies with more than 100 fronds are often fertile, with less than 20% of the fronds bearing sori. At the wall habitat small-sized individuals may be fertile as well. The high density in the Kuinderbos can be attributed to an optimal water supply from a peat subsoil, the composition of the ecto-organic layer consisting of Picea needles and an optimal light climate. The high density in Picea sitchensis within the Kuinderbos is unprecedented in Europe and makes these stands resemble the natural habitat of Picea sitchensis at the west coast of N. America.",

In Clapham, Tutin, and Warburg's Flora of the British Isles (p. 42, 1952) it is assigned the name Dryopteris uliginosa (A. Braun) Kuntze, but since such a name is not listed in Christensen's Index Filicum and Supplements I have been asked to clarify its status. The use of the epithet uliginosum in this context was the description of Aspidium spinulosum b) uliginosum A. Braun in Doell's Rheinische Flora (1843), which reads as follows: Moorliebender, kurzstachlicher Schildfarn. Strunk ziemlich kurz, mit wenigen, locker stehenden, breit-eifSrmigen, kurz zugespitzten, braungelben Spreublittchen; Wedel doppeltgefiedert-fiederspaltig, Fiederchen genahert, an der Basis auf der unteren Seite etwas breiter, die an der Basis stehenden ein wenig kiirzer als die folgenden; Zahne der Fiedertheilchen ziemlich kurz, stachelspitzig, anliegend. Diese noch weiter zu beobachtende Form wurder von A. Braun im Moos bie Freiburg mit der ersten Varietiit und mit Aspidium cristatum gefunden.

In 1929 and 1930 I made two visits to the Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet in Stockholm, and Dr. Hulten made arrangements for a joint collecting trip. Dr. Hulten was interested in studying the routes of migration to and from Asia. In 1932 Dr. Hulten joined me in Seattle and we went north on the Coast Guard ship Tahoe. We rented a small house in Unalaska and spent May and June in working the surrounding area intensively for early flowering plants, cryptogams, and marine invertebrates. Two weeks were spent in digging into an Aleut stone-age village near Dutch Harbor for artifacts, which were sent to the Riksmuseet. Several years later, I urged Dr. Ales Hrdlicka to continue the digging where we left off, which he did and collected a harvest of desirable material for the U. S. National Museum.",

Tiny clumps of filmy ferns, probably Mecodium sanguinolentum (Forst.) Copel. may be encountered; the clump will never extend very far, but it is amazing to find it there at all. Liable to be found also are small plants of Shining Spleenwort, Hanging Spleenwort, and Asplenium falcatum Lam., and the Trembling Bracken may also put in an appearance. These ferns are not likely to grow very large and indeed some may not survive at all when they grow out into full sunlight. But they will gradually add their modicum of humus and in the meantime are a lasting source of delight to the wandering botanist.

    "abstract": "For some years my professional activities were in fields of chemistry and geology, and my acquaintance with ferns was zero. Then in 1913 I was appointed Assistant Curator of Mineralogy in U. S. National Museum. Having built a house on a large lot next year, I decided to develop a wild flower garden there, and I made acquaintance of amateur botanists who guided me to some of notable plant localities around Washington. In a ravine along Potomac I was shown a colony of Walking Fern growing on a gneissoid rock, although according to the books it was supposed to grow on limestone. Having in my laboratory work just become familiar with then new conception of hydrogen-ion concentration, I wondered if this phenomenon might have a bearing on habitats of such plants. So I started looking for Walking Fern on different rock formations, and found it on many kinds in states within easy reach-Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. Tests of soil at roots showed that on average its reaction was indeed essentially neutral (as limestone is), and a paper on this subject was published in Journal of Washington Academy of Sciences in 1916. Then it seemed of interest to study other ferns in like manner, and in order to learn various kinds I bought a book called Who's Who Among Ferns, by W. I. Beecroft, of Boston. Whether this author ever did any scientific work on ferns I do not know, but at any rate his book-unlike too many more recent ones-was both simple and accurate, and made recognition of species an easy matter. In doubtful cases I took specimens to a",

By now it must have taken the lead. During the last year or two, Mr. Morton's articles on cultivated fern species, with their frequent references to southern California fern gardens, have cast some light on the reason for the rapid growth. It remained, however, for a recent four weeks visit to that area, with the much appreciated help of a number of local members, to make clear to me the extensive and growing interest on the part of dwellers in what local newspapers refer to as Southland. The climate of California, as far north as San Francisco, is conducive to year-round gardening. Daffodils bloom in January, at least in areas not too far from the coast or too high in altitude. Roses bloom the year-round. Apparently, almost every home owner is garden-conscious, and the interest is not merely in a few flower beds but in broader landscape effects. Ferns, I was informed by one adviser in interior and exterior decoration, are essential to provide finely divided foliage, as an offset to the plainer and coarser patterns of philodendrons and so forth. Nurserymen abound. In the yellow pages of one of the five or six large telephone books which are necessary to cover the sprawling metrop-",

The spores, now scattered in the envelopes, may also be sown directly by tapping them on the medium in a room where there is no air circulation. A sterile teasing needle (flamed over an alcohol lamp and cooled) or narrow scalpel is helpful to broadcast the spores from the envelope into the culture dishes. I believe this technique may be of value to those attempting to prepare pure cultures of fern spores. By using this method, there is far greater assurance of purity of spores from the beginning. I have tried the technique on a number of fern genera (Cyclosorus, Woodsia, Cyrtomium, Pteris, and others), sowing the uncontaminated spores on nutrient agar in test tubes. So far as it has been possible to determine, the cultures which resulted by this method were entirely pure. BOTANICAL GARDENS, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN.",

In all probability the production of numerous prothallia around the bases of the bulblets was due to the presence of sporangia on the bulblets. This last peculiarity is unquestionably the most remarkable feature of the hybrid varieties in the Cystopteris fragilis complex-a situation entirely unlike any other known species of fern that has been reported to our knowledge-that sporangia can be borne not only in sori, but also along the rachis at the bases of the pinnae, associated with the peculiar bulblets. Yet this condition, which seems so teratological, occurs as a more or less normal phenomenon in a large number of populations over a very wide geographical range.

    "abstract": "Most of the ferns that grow on rocks on walls are rather difficult to establish in flowerpots. The outstanding exception is Asplenium marinum. In a greenhouse from which frost is excluded it will grow in a pot to a far greater size than among the coastal rock clefts that are its usual habitat in Britain. But the other Spleenworts seem rather to resent being planted in pots, and a botanist recently mentioned to me that in his laboratory they find Asplenium viride impossible to keep in a healthy state. As I have had some success in growing these ferns in wire baskets, I thought a note on the method might be of interest not only to those members of the Society who, like me, grow them for pleasure in their greenhouses, but also to botanists and others who require a constant supply for scientific study. The wire baskets that I buy are of the usual horticultural pattern and the cheapest I can find. The best variety consist mainly of a thick wire wound spirally into the shape of a bowl, with three wires leading from the top edge to meet at a wire hook, from which the whole is suspended. When bought, the baskets are too large for my purpose, so I cut them down with wire clippers to about half size. I then line them with moss, my favourite being the common woodland moss Mnium hornum. It can be sliced off the woodland floor with thin sheets of the soil in which it grows. The advantage of taking this moss in slices of soil is that it will continue to grow and remain fresh throughout the year. The compost in which I put the ferns is made up of about equal parts of loam, sterile peat (or sometimes leaf-",

    "abstract": "On March 10, 1953, Mr. Ray Garrett, an amateur plant-collector, discovered a large colony of a strange fern growing on the shoulders of Florida Highway 905 near Florida City, in Dade County, Florida, which was not identified at the time. On December 28, 1953, the junior author visited the locality and collected a number of specimens (his no. 302), which were divided among his own herbarium, and those of the University of Florida and the U. S. National Museum. The fern was abundant along several miles of roadside south of Florida City and grows also in the bayheads and willow-thickets in the adjacent wet prairies along with Pteris vittata, Thelypteris normalis, Blechnum serrulatum, ragweeds, goldenrods, grasses, and other weedy flowering plants. It is aggressive, and wherever established it has spread in all directions rapidly, choking out other plants. Sterile plants have some resemblance to variants of Blechnum serrulatum and they have perhaps been passed by for that reason. The specimens were taken to the senior author, who recognized them as a species that she had collected in Jamaica, Trismeria trifoliata (L.) Diels. This is the first record of this genus in the United States. It is antions were made during studies supported by funds i ed through the University Center of Georgia and Dr. George H.

The choice fell on Hofmeister after it had been learned that these other men, whose standing today is no greater than Hofmeister's, would require too large a stipend as compared with the metamorphosed book-seller. Since Hofmeister's time, ferns and other pteridophytes have occupied a fundamental place in botanical studies which seek to discover the ancestry and path of developments of floweringand seed-plants in general. Not only among living ferns, but increasingly among their predecessors of earlier geological periods over a stretch of some five hundred million years, thousands of pages of research reports have been published in the years since Hofmeister first made clear the basic pattern of the life history of the successful land plant divisions. From the account by Goebel, one of Hofmeister's students, may be taken one final interesting comment which points up Hofmeister's genius: And in this connection, we may perhaps point out how much botany is indebted to those very investigators who were not professional botanists. Let us mention only K. F. Wolff, Ingen-Housz, A. v. Humboldt, Gartner, T. A. Knight, Hofmeister, Darwin, and Mendel.",

Their formulas are faultless, but their premises are wrong. The earth's surface is a vast mosaic of environments, and even in regions where one or the other type of substratum above mentioned is predominant, isolated patches of the contrasted type occur in greater or lesser quantity. The disseminules-spores or seeds-of plants fall alike on both, and, should a given taxon be indifferent to soil reaction it will grow equally well on both. On the other hand, those plants having specialized physiological characteristics, although they may grow sporadically anywhere, will form successful, self-perpetuating colonies only on the substratum to which they are adapted.

The plants imported from Japan are the species Davallia Mariesii; the other common species in cultivation is Davallia trichomanoides, which is often sold under the incorrect name D. canariensis, which belongs properly to another species, also in cultivation, but not so common. Most people like to obtain small plants and grow these on to maturity. As the plants grow, they are shifted to larger pots. When they nicely fill a six inch pot, they are ready to transplant to baskets. The foot (rootstock) should be placed at an angle across the top of the pots and green sphagnum moss tucked under it. The foot is anchored to the moss by using hairpin-shaped wires; this encourages them to send out side feet, which are also anchored down by wires. When the six inch pot is full of feet, the plant is ready to be shifted to the basket. In the basket, the are trained across the top of the sphagnum on top of the basket and eventually down over the sides. It is amazing how fast the plants will grow when given this moss cushion. The common Boston Fern (Nephrolepis) will respond also toc this type of treatment. Many people cut away the runners (the long, wiry strands), as they think they are unslightly and unnecessary, and then they wonder why their ferns do not fill out.

The veins, which reach the margin, are forked in this upper part of the frond, with the sorus placed dorsally on the distal fork. These are all characters that ally the beech-fern with the genus Thelypteris. An interesting feature of the beech-fern that is not mentioned apparently in the American literature is the presence of two hairs on the walls of the sporangia; these are of two types-acicular and capitate-glandular -and are well described and illustrated' by that careful fern student Christian Luerssen.

The presence of this species in Kansas is now certain with the discovery in the summer of 1955 of a large colony on shallow soil, over limestone, in a small ravine, located in an open bluestem prairie, 3 miles west of Neodesha, Wilson County (McGregor & Hartman 10267, 10861). A number of plants in the colony could be considered as Isoetes melanopoda forma pallida (Engelm.) Fern.

Numerous attempts have been made by several collectors to relocate the site from which the specimen was taken, but all have failed. The species has not been found elsewhere in Kansas.

    "abstract": "The history of fern is part of history of western botanical illustration. Drawings of ferns intertwine with art of 1500 years this story spans. To concentrate pri- marily on this history as it is revealed in published works over this time, an important theme becomes evident. As in so much scientific discovery, technological advances pave way for a growth of knowledge and more accurate perception. The advances in botanical are balanced between growing knowledge and talent of scientific artist and growing skill of his technician allies, woodblock cutter, etcher, engraver, lithographer, and photographer, and growing strengths of techniques themselves. The earliest existence of sound recognizable botanical art is affirmed on walls of Egyptian tombs. However, no examples of painted Greek and Ro- man art that were source of almost all medieval copies have survived, although it is known from Greek and Roman chronicles that such art did exist. The earliest botanical volumes that have survived were herbals. They were books about medicinal plants with descriptions and drawings of plants for identification. Among these plants were pteridophytes thought to have medic- inal properties. At least two species, Adiantum capillus-veneris and Polypodium vulgare, are in earliest manuscript dealing with depiction of plants that has come down to us today. The Codex Vindobonensis (Dioscorides, 512 AD), writ- ten and illustrated in Constantinople for daughter of Byzantine Em- peror of West, is a copy of Greek text De Materia Medica by Dioscor- ides, a first century AD physician and botanist. It is believed original work consisted of paintings by Crateuas of some 500 plants, with written part consisting of little more than their names and healing properties. According to British art historian Wilfred Blunt, Codex provided the link be- tween classical and modern botany, and paintings the link between an- cient Greek and modern European botanical illustration (Blunt and Steam 1994). From a facsimile of this text is a lovely, if somewhat primitive, illustra- tion of Adiantum capillus-veneris (Fig. 1). The manuscripts that made up source of medical and botanical knowl- edge for Medieval era were copies of Codex and other classical mate- rial. For nearly 1000 years, manuscripts produced were copies of copies made by illuminators with no or little botanical knowledge so that simplifi- cations, anthropomorphisms, and mistakes made identification of plants nearly impossible (Apulius, 1481). This problem was compounded because maintaining a fidelity to previously printed words and images was one of disciplines of Christianity in that period, which found heresy in observa- tion of nature itself.",

    "abstract": "1977), the systematic composition and major features of vascular epiphytes were examined, based on observations of living plants and a survey of specimens in the Gray Herbarium of Harvard University. Sixty-five families of vascular plants were listed, including the Psilotaceae, Ophioglossaceae, Schizaeaceae, Hymenophyllaceae, Polypodiaceae, Aspleniaceae, Aspidiaceae, and Davalliaceae. However, two major pteridophyte families, the Lycopodiaceae and the Selaginellaceae, were not included. These omissions in Madison's enumeration seriously distort the true incidence of pteridophytic epiphytes. A survey of the herbaria at the University of Michigan, the New York Botanical Garden, the Missouri Botanical Garden, the Field Museum, and the Smithsonian Institution revealed a very substantial number of epiphytic species in Lycopodium s.l. In fact, of the 374 species of Lycopodium s.l. examined, 192 species (51%) were epiphytic. All of the epiphytic species are in the segregate genus Huperzia s.l. (commonly treated as Lycopodium subg. Urostachys). Huperzia, including its 93 terrestrial members, accounted for 76% of all the species of Lycopodium s.l. examined. Huperzia species are far more common and diverse in the tropics than in the temperate zone. Only a few species occur in North America north of Mexico, of which the best known are the two terrestrial species L. selago and L. lucidulum, the epipetric species L. porophilum, and the epiphytic species L. dichotomum. The epiphytic members of Huperzia fall into two classes, with intermediates between the classes grading from one extreme to the other. At one extreme there is little or no differentiation of the sporophylls, the sporangia being borne on photosynthetic leaves on normal shoots. At the other extreme, there is strong differentiation of the sporophylls, which are also aggregated into dangling tassels. With few exceptions, the branch systems are pendent, the base of the plant being attached by a mass of roots to boughs and crotches of the supporting trees. Gametophytes of epiphytic species are found buried in leaf mold and mosses in the same habitat as the sporophytes (Bierhorst, 1971, p. 22). The large number of epiphytic Huperzia (192 species), when compared with Madison's enumeration, ranks this group as the 13th largest family of vascular epiphytes (out of a total of 65 families) and the 12th largest genus of vascular epiphytes (exclusive of the genera of the Orchidaceae, which was not broken beyond the family level in Madison's list). A comprehensive survey of the spike-mosses (Selaginella) would probably result in the discovery of some epiphytes, although the great majority of species are terrestrial or epipetric. At least five epiphytes are known in Selaginella.",

    "abstract": "John K. Small (1931, p. 1) once wrote that Florida should be known as the land of ferns. Several areas throughout the state have become famous for their abundance of these plants. Most notable are the rocklands of Dade County (Small, 1920a, b), the Pineola Grotto of Citrus County (Harper, 1916; Lakela, 1964), and the lakes region of Central Florida (Small, 1932, p. 15; Wherry, 1964, p. 28; Lakela & Long, 1976, e. g., p. 123). No one has even suspected until recently (Nauman, 1978) that Broward County boasted ferneries. Few even believe that a site remains unreported that contains the most impressive display of ferns in the southern end of the state. The site we hereby record is located in Sects. 5,6, T49S, R42E (Fig. 1) and contains almost half of the pteridophyte species known in tropical Florida. Furthermore, it appears to have the largest and healthiest populations in the state of some of the rarer species. We call the site the Creek because it represents a remnant of the Cypress Creek drainage system (Steinberg, 1976). Vegetation in the area is complex, with swamp forest, hammocks, pinelands, and fallow fields. A limestone outcrop of undetermined affinity (J. E. Hoffmeister, 1978, pers. comm.) forms a ridge on the western limit and islands near the eastern side. This broken ridge system was dissected by Cypress Creek before the area was drained by canals, and the central swamp is overlain with various depths of peat and sand. We have been studying the site since September 1976. During that time, we have discovered that it contains over 200 species of plants, and the list grows with each visit. Not only is the site the last remaining stronghold of ferns in southeastern Florida, but it contains range extensions for several plants (e.g. Asplenium trichomanes-dentatum, Catopsis floribunda, Polypodium ptilodon, Tectaria heracleifolia, Tectaria incisa, Tillandsia valenzuelana), and several species on the Smithsonian and Florida Committee Rare and Endangered Plant lists (e.g. Asplenium trichomanes-dentatum, Asplenium serratum, Epidendrum nocturnum, Ophioglossum palmatum, Tillandisa flexuosa). Cypress Creek Hammock is unique in several ways: in its number of ferns, for its range extensions, and for existing as an island of native vegetation in metropolitan Broward County. We believe that any one of these factors makes the site worthy of preservation, and that their combination makes it imperative. Some of our colleagues have been helpful toward this end by writing letters. We solicit letters or support in other ways from all those interested in ferns, plants, and native Florida habitats.",

    "abstract": "Ceradenia spectabilis, a new species, is described from Cerro del Torrá, an isolated peak in western Colombia well known for harboring rare and narrowly distributed species of plants. The new species is readily distinguished from its congeners by its broadly alate petiole and rachis, creeping rhizome with widely spaced leaves, and large oblanceolate leaves with elongate and ascending pinnae. Three other species, C. curvata, C. discolor, and C. pearcei, share characteristics in common with C. spectabilis including thick sub-spongiose laminae that are sparsely setose (or setae absent), provided throughout with whitish waxy glands, alate petioles and rachises, setose rhizome scales that are also provided with a few whitish waxy glands, and sub-marginal sori. However, Ceradenia spectabilis can be distinguished from each of them by its longer petioles (4–6 cm long vs. 2 cm or less), broader petiole wings (2.5–3.5 mm wide vs. 0.5 cm or less), and longer pinnae (up to 10 cm long vs. 4 cm long or less). Ceradenia spectabilis is known only from the type, despite extensive investigations in herbaria housing large collections of Colombian ferns. This new species brings the total number of Ceradenia species in Colombia to 25, and ca. 74 world-wide.",

We measured a series of physiological and biochemical indices after drought treatment and analyzed the expression of AVP1 homologous genes in A. nidus by RT-qPCR. The results indicated that A. nidus can adapt to drought by limiting stomatal conductance, thus inhibiting plant photosynthesis and reducing physiological activities. In addition, A. nidus can also change its osmotic potential by increasing proline content to maintain normal metabolic activities, and prevent the destruction of reactive oxygen species by increasing the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD). According to analysis of the relative expression levels of genes, AVP1-2 and AVP1-4 may be the drought-resistant genes of A. nidus. This study lays a foundation for further exploration of the drought tolerance mechanism and drought-resistant genes of A. nidus.",

    "abstract": "Salvinia minima is a relatively small, floating aquatic leptosporangiate fern in the family Salviniaceae. It is widely distributed in the horticultural trade as an ornamental plant for aquaria and aquatic gardens. Consequently, it has escaped into the natural environment where it produces large, dense mats of branching ramets that are often deleterious to other aquatic biota, particularly in tropical and mild temperate regions. This is a report of a laboratory experimental study of the growth, photosynthesis and dark respiration of S. minima, particularly addressing the variables in a way that is potentially relevant for environmental and ecological research applications. Photosynthetic carbon assimilation rates are inversely related to the leaf area of the ramets, and approximates a second-order polynomial function defined by non-linear regression analysis (p < 0.01); namely, A = 6.3761 - 0.3381 * L + 0.005 * L2, where A is CO2 assimilation rate (µmol m–2 s–1) and L is leaf area of the ramets (cm2). Data are also presented on the quantum yield efficiency (Fv/Fm) and electron transfer (ET0/RC) for ramet leaves of different sizes, indicating that low quantum yield efficiency most likely accounts for lower CO2 assimilation rates in more mature ramets with larger leaves. The dark respiration is approximately equivalent to 30% of the net photosynthesis CO2 assimilation rate. The relative growth rate (RGR) is 0.03 accounting for about a 4% gain in weight per day relative to the initial weight of the S. minima ramets.",

    "abstract": "Isoetes melanopoda Gay & Dureau, Blackfoot Quillwort, ranges from Georgia to Texas and north to South Dakota and New Jersey. Old collections are known from East Baton Rouge, Avoyelles, and Rapides parishes in Louisiana (Brown & Correll, 1942). More recent collections have been made from Calcasieu (Brooks & Maples, 1971) and Sabine (Carroll & Thomas, 1981) parishes. However, this species has been considered rare in the state (Thieret, 1980) and until the present finds the only extant population known in Louisiana was from a low woods in Sabine Parish. Recently, plants of I. melanopoda were found to be locally abundant and quite common in wet, low areas of unplowed soybean and cotton fields. The new habitat for I. melanopoda in Louisiana was discovered on 8 May 1984. A low wet area in an unplowed soybean field in Richland Parish provided the first find. All the surrounding parts of the field had been treated with herbicides to kill the winter weeds in preparation for spring planting. The low area was too wet for tractors to negotiate so it had been left unsprayed. Close examination of the area revealed that literally tens of thousands of plants of Isoetes melanopoda were thriving in the field. Many plants in the treated areas showed no ill effects of the herbicide, although all seed plants were dead. A week later the entire field, including the low area, was disced and planted in soybeans. During the period of a month I found new populations in Richland, Ouachita, Morehouse, Caldwell, Catahoula, West Carroll, Bossier, and Caddo parishes. All these populations contained plants that were much larger, more numerous, and less scattered than those previously collected from Sabine Parish (Carroll & Thomas, 1981). All populations found in the nine new parishes were either in cultivated fields (soybean-West Carroll, Richland, Catahoula; cotton-Morehouse; oat-Franklin; or open wet areas like pastures or hayfields-Caldwell, Ouachita, Bossier, Caddo). The areas might be flooded during heavy winter rains but in no areas were plants found completely submerged in water. The areas are dominated by Juncus and Cyperaceae with a few dicotyledons. The most abundant Juncus species are funcus biflorus, r. bufonius, [. diffusissimus, J. dudleyi, J. scirpoides, J. validus, and rarely [. effusus or J. coriaceus. Cyperaceae is represented by Carex frankii, Cyperus iria, C. pseudovegetus, Fimbristylis autumnalis, F. miliacea, F. vahlii, Scirpus koilolepis, and undetermined species of Eleocharis. Dicotyledons included Tillaea aquatica, Plantago hybrida, P. virginica, Callitriche peploides, Cerastium glomeratum, Ranunculus pusillus, Gratiola neglecta, G. virginca, Lindernia anagallidea, and Linaria canadensis. The sterile low specimens of Eleocharis and Juncus make the Isoetes specimens very difficult to locate at first. Concentrated searching reveals that Isoetes melanopoda",

    "abstract": "In preparing treatment of Polystichum for Flora of North America, it becomes desirable to name an undescribed species collected only once, in 1934, from northern British Columbia coast at Alice Arm. The importance of describing this poorly known species lies in its probable involvement in hybrid origins of P. andersonii Hopkins. The story begins with discovery that P. andersonii is a tetraploid (Taylor and Lang, 1963). At first it was thought it might be an autotetraploid (W. Wagner in Hitchcock, et al., 1969, p. 85), but a cytological analysis of a triploid hybrid between P. andersonii and P. munitum yielded 41 II's and 41 I's at meiosis (W. Wagner, 1973). Despite this evidence, W. Wagner doubted that P. munitum contributed a genome to P. andersonii because the characters of P. andersonii seem so distinct from those of P. munitum that ancestral affinity seems unlikely (W. Wagner, 1973). However, further study of these plants and comparison with other, well-documented cases of allopolyploidy in Polystichum indicated that, indeed, P. andersonii is an allotetraploid with P. munitum as one of its diploid ancestors (D. Wagner, 1979). The problem was that no species was known that could be considered second diploid parent of P. andersonii. It was not hard to predict what this second ancestor of P. andersonii would look like; exercise was similar to that used by W. Wagner (1971) in describing unknown diploid ancestor of Dryopteris cristata and D. carthusiana, known informally as D. semicristata. Dryopteris semicristata has not yet been found, but a herbarium specimen that matched predictions for second parent of P. andersonii, one collected at Alice Arm, was reported in my monograph (D. Wagner, 1979). The most important characters are completely divided pinnae coupled with presence of a vegetative bulbil. The Alice Arm plant was left undescribed at that time in hope that living material could be found to confirm prediction that it was indeed diploid. The material serving as type of this species remains only known collection. It is fragmentary, comprised of upper one-half of three fertile fronds, so that rediscovery is necessary to provide information about stem and lower part of leaves. I traveled to Alice Arm in 1975 to search for this intriguing plant. Unfortunately, although I did find P. braunii and P. setigerum, I did not find hoped-for diploid. It is not clear whether Alice Arm referred to on label is town (a ghost mining town in 1975) or inlet of same name, at whose head town is located. Nobody has yet reported finding this plant. In order to emphasize reality of this entity, and hopefully encourage search for it, it is formally named here, in honor of one of peoples in whose territory it",

    "abstract": "A Massachusetts population of Ophioglossum pusillum was studied to examine root connections between fronds. A 0.5 m2 sample section of turf contained 38 fronds, including a network of 10 fronds connected by a single root system approximately 40 cm long. Apparently large colonies of this species may consist of few genetically distinct elements, which may help to explain the lack of genetic variability found in some populations. The branching of the rhizome and formation of adventitious buds on roots in ferns of the Ophioglossaceae have been reported often (Petry, 1915; War- dlaw, 1953; Bold, 1967; Peterson, 1970; Bierhorst, 1971; Foster and Gifford, 1974; Kato et al., 1988). Field observations include descriptions of a colony of seven sporophytes of Ophioglossum petiolatum Hook. with a common root system (St. John, 1949) and several colonies of 0. vulgatum L. (as 0. pycnos- tichum (Fernald) A. Love & D. Love) of from four to ten plants connected by common root systems (Cascio and Thomas, 1993). Similar reports have been published documenting vegetative reproduction in 0. pusillum Raf., the north- ern adder's-tongue fern, in the field. Most are of two sporophytes derived from a single root system. In a large New Hampshire colony, Blake (1913) observed the occurrence of two plants from a common rootstock and referred to her- barium specimens with similar arrangements. Hagenah (1966) reported that many plants in an interdunal meadow along Lake Michigan had two fronds originating from a single rootstock. Edwards (1982) traced a single root con- necting two fronds of 0. pusillum for 1.8 m in a pasture in southern England. In a 1991 survey of a population of 0. pusillum in Franklin County, MA, I counted 901 fronds in an area of approximately 1 hectare (McMaster, 1994). Clusters of from 10-27 fronds were frequently observed within a radius of 0.5 meters. During summer, 1994, I excavated a 0.5 m2 section of turf from this wetland containing approximately 38 fronds of 0. pusillum. By carefully re- moving soil and dead vegetation and untangling the root systems of other vascular plants, I attempted to isolate the root system of each 0. pusillum. One cluster of ten fronds (seven with fertile fronds) of 0. pusillum was found to be connected by a dense network of roots (Fig. 1). The network was approximately 40 cm in overall length. It included one rhizome bearing two fronds, eight rhizomes bearing a single frond each, and three rhizomes with no frond. The largest rhizome had 26 lateral roots; another had 24. The small- est rhizome had six lateral roots. Several lateral roots appeared to have been severed during excavation. Root connections were found for six other clusters, each with from two to ten fronds, and each with severed roots. These observations suggest that apparently large colonies of 0. pusillum may",

B.S.P.; and walking fern, A. rhizophyllum L-a hybrid polyploid system of great complexity has developed, involving not only the interactions of these ferns but also more widespread taxa such as wall rue, A. ruta-muraria L.; forked spleenwort, A. septentrionale L.; and maidenhair spleenwort, A. trichomanes L. These hybrids are often of great interest because they combine widely different morphologies, producing striking intermediates. Recently Thomas N. Morgan of Carmel, New York, has turned up some unusual natural hybrids during his studies of the spleenworts in the Harper's Ferry region of Maryland and adjacent Virginia and West Virginia.

    "abstract": "Ferns will stand some sun, but most of them appreciate shade. The light shade of a lath house is most appropriate. Some ferns are hardy enough to stand wind, but when so exposed have ragged fronds and seldom look well, so it is essential to have your growing area protected from wind, whether the shade is provided by lath or trees. The sides of a fern plot should be protected by windbreaks of shrubs or a fence, especially along the west side, in the Los Angeles area. When we get the hot dry winds from the desert, which usually occur in the fall but may come at any time, humidity is very low. The ferns stand this dry atmosphere best in the fall, when the growing season is over and the next year's fronds still are snugly rolled up. In the spring, winds cause more damage. Spraying ferns daily, as well as the laths, walks and walls nearby, will help to increase humidity during the dry spells. Unfortunately, our Los Angeles water leaves deposits in the soil that are not desirable, but they do less damage than searing, dry winds! Baskets especially should be watched for dryness, but one should be careful not to water them too much. Water frequently rather than copiously. Naturally, the proper situation requires careful preparation of beds, with good, loose, well-drained soil. Many ferns should be planted beside rocks, as their roots get under the rocks and keep cool and moist. Also, such rocks help provide good drainage.",

When I chanced to mention this station to Miss Farida Wiley, of the American Museum of Natural History, she immediately wrote me: Don't show your Hartford Fern station to anyone, not even botanists, particularly not botanists! I hadn't realized before that this fern is something of a rarity. I was stimulated to try and raise it from spores, with little knowledge and no experience. Guided by the book by Edith Roberts and an article by Anne Seaman, and by personal advice from Boughton Cobb, the Rev. Jesse F. Smith, and Professor Forman McLean I tried various methods for six years without success. Half of my cultures were killed by fungi either in germination or in the prothallial stage, and the other half were killed by any fungicide that I tried, even the one recommended by Miss Seaman and used by her when she raised hundreds of ferns from spores. However, finally in January, 1960, a culture survived and by May, 1960, I had 24 healthy Hartford ferns. By October, 1960, they had graduated to 412 inch pots, and were sending out runners with many new fronds. In November, 1960, unfortunately they began to die and by May, 1961, they were to all appearance definitely dead.",

The same paper summarized some of the reports in the literature on the unusual resistance of sporocarps of the Marsileaceae to aging, drying, alcohol, and herbarium poisons. The present paper deals with the unusual resistance to moist heat of sporocarps of M. quadrifolia. On November 21, 1953, sporocarps of M. quadrifolia were collected at the botany pond of Eastern Illinois State College. A similar collection was made on November 3, 1953, by Dr. W. N. Stewart at the Kikapoo State Park in Illinois and forwarded to Dr. Paul D. Voth, of the University of Chicago, under whom the author was working at the time. When attempts were made to germinate sporocarps from each lot soon after collection, the results were poor. Few of the sporocarps opened typically, and relatively few spores were released. Few sporophytes were produced. However, when sporocarps were placed in a 65?C oven in a study of their moisture content, excellent germination results were obtained after two days of drying. Both lots of sporocarps were stored in a steamheated room in the Barnes Laboratory of Botany at the University of Chicago during the fall and winter. These sporocarps showed normal germination behavior by early spring.",

    "abstract": "A wall is a straight harsh line, which we all try to soften in order to have an attractive setting. Ferns are good for overcoming these straight lines. One I like to use is Microlepia platyphylla, a common fern in cultivation which seems to lack a common name. Here in southern California it will grow to seven or eight feet tall and is therefore an ideal background fern for landscaping along a wall that faces east or north. Good specimens with graceful arching fronds develop only with some sun. I have tried it in a shady corner, but the stipes become soft and do not have the sturdiness to hold up the large heavy fronds. Microlepia strigosa is another popular fern that can be used along a wall to create a soft, graceful effect. I have grown this one successfully where it receives the early morning sun or the late afternoon sun, and also where it receives filtered sunlight, or even in a location where it received no sun at all but had good light. It has been satisfactory in all these locations. In the sun the fronds are yellow-green and have a thick texture, whereas the ones in the shade with good light are greener and thinner. The Leatherleaf Fern, Rumohra adiantiformis (sometimes erroneously called Polystichum capense or Aspidium capense), also called Iron Fern, is popular with flower arrangers, because the fronds will last as long as three weeks after being cut. To have good texture and fronds that will stand up, the ferns must have a good deal of sun. Inland where I live is not considered a good location for ferns, for we are far enough away from the ocean to have dry heat in the summer and frost in the winter. However, Rumohra will grow well with me if given care. It desires morning sun until about eleven o'clock or the afternoon sun from three thirty p.m. on. Along the coast, where there is better humidity, it will taken even more sun. This fern is often called a buffer plant; when planted at the windy end of a wall it will break the wind and protect other ferns planted along the wall. 2637 NORTH LEE AVENUE, EL MONTE, CALIFORNIA. 174",

When in 1935 we eventually found a house on two lots, a lath house started to go up almost before we got settled. The first one was not large, only 16 by 20 feet with a roof eight feet high, but built so that it could grow in time. The uprights, redwood four by fours, were cemented into the ground, and the framework was constructed of two by fours, with laths for the roof. It is better to have a small lath house well conditioned than a larger one poorly cared for. After the small one is established, you can always add to it. This part of Los Angeles had once been swampland and salt grass grew everywhere. Salt grass roots are ropelike and go very deep, forming a sort of impenetrable mass of roots that sometimes completely cuts off drainage. Storm drains had not yet come and the water table was high in those years and the soil full of salt. Such a situation was mine, and so I eventually dug up the soil on the two lots two to four feet deep. I had a little grass and a mountain of roots to dispose of. But it was necessary to establish good drainage. A foundation of six inches of rocks was laid down. Every time we went for a drive, the old Hupmobile came home groaning with the weight of rocks. And we made many trips to the mountains for leaf mold. Our home was not far from peat beds at the foot of Baldwin Hills which used to catch fire and burn for months. Eventually the city controlled the fires and used the spot as a dumping ground for city sweepings. Over the years a",

The plants readily keyed to Polypodium hesperium Maxon, the taxonomic status of which is somewhat uncertain as evidenced by the fact that Maxon in Abrams1 and Harrington2 regard it as a distinct species, whereas Broun3 listed it as a variety of Polypodiutm vulgare L. and Fernald4 considered it a synonym of Polypodium vulgare L. var. columbianum Gilbert. Without attempting to decide the taxonomic status discrepancy, the collections here reported will be referred to as P. hesperium. The two colonies were growing in the crevices of rocks on mountain slopes covered with a pifnon-juniper association at an altitude a little over 7680 feet. Although the habitats were quite similar, they were separated geographically by over 30 miles.",

The aberrant collection, representing a small colony, has short stubby ultimate segments, rounded to acute at the tips, but the fronds are not as dissected as those of plants of B. multifidum from Shenandoah National Park. It corresponds well with the description of B. dissecturn var. oneidense (Gilb.) Farw. as given by Fernald in the 8th edition of Gray's Manual. When W. H. Wagner expressed an interest in seeing this collection I sent it, along with a number of others of the Sceptridium group of Botrychium. He confirmed my identification, but prefers to regard B. oneidense as a separate species. So far as we know this constitutes a new record for Tennessee and for the Great Smokies. Another collection, Fosberg 23958b, from Little Hunting Creek just east of Mount Vernon, on the Potomac River, Fairfax County, Virginia, as well as the one from Quebec, three miles west of Napierville (Fosberg 40154), also proved to be B. oneidense. The Virginia and Tennessee records rather amplify the known distribution of B. oneidense in the southeastern United States. It has previously been reported from Rockingham County, Virginia, by Clausen (1944); Yellow Creek, Graham County, North Carolina, by Clausen (1938); from Roan Mountain, Mitchell County, North Carolina, by Clausen (1943); and from Gatewood Switch, Pendleton County, West Virginia, by Strausgbaugh and Core (1952). The latter specimen has been verified by Dr. Wagner as B. oneidense (in litt. Aug. 7, 1960). The only localities south of Pennsylvania in eastern North 175",

Wherry near Fortney, Cherokee County, Alabama, in 1927. It has subsequently been found at another station in Alabama and in Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee, and Virginia. The distributional history of this plant was detailed by Werth, Evans, and Ware (Castanea 53(4):263271, 1988). It is interesting to note that the hybrid was first discovered in the deep heart of the south and that subsequent discoveries radiated to the north, west, and east of the original station. The last of these stations was discovered in 1982 by Donna Ware near Williamsburg on the Coastal Plain of eastern Virginia. On September 23, 1989, while field researching an environmental project in Baltimore County, Maryland, I discovered a colony of what I assumed at the time to be Dryopteris celsa Small. Several specimens were pressed for an ongoing project relating to the distribution of D. celsa and its hybrids in Maryland. Sometime later, while studying the specimens, I came to realize that they were not D. celsa, but appeared to possibly be Dryopteris Xaustralis, but this seemed incredible, and this possibility was dismissed at that time.",

    "abstract": "A size hierarchy describes the differences in size among individuals in a population. Size hierarchies are usually measured using the coefficient of variance or a similar parameter, the Gini coefficient (Weiner and Solbrig, 1984). These two parameters both compare the variance to the mean for size. A low variance (relative to the mean) indicates a small size hierarchy, while a large variance (relative to the mean) indicates a large size hierarchy. Experimental analyses have indicated that size hierarchies increase as plant density, and presumably inter- and intraspecific competition, increases (Weiner, 1985). The assumption that increased size hierarchies can be attributed solely to competition is valid only if other factors affecting size hierarchies can be controlled, as in an experimental plant colony. Among natural populations, size hierarchies cannot be attributed solely to competition (Weiner and Solbrig, 1985). Other factors, such as variation in microsite quality, genetic variation among individuals, predation, and age can affect size hierarchies. A previous analysis of the distribution of size in co-existing local populations of Diplazium pycnocarpon and Deparia acrostichoides (Hamilton, 1992) revealed that the local population with a greater density of ramets (i.e., Diplazium pycnocarpon), had the smaller size hierarchy. The greater size hierarchy for Deparia acrostichoides was attributed to a greater effect of spatial heterogeneity and greater genetic variability among ramets. Competition was eliminated as an explanation for the greater size hierarchy among ramets of Deparia acrostichoides because spatial autocorrelation analysis revealed that neighboring pairs of ramets tended to be the same size. If competition was the underlying process regulating size distribution, one would expect to see a much greater occurrence of negative correlations for size among neighboring pairs of ramets. There is a general lack of information regarding the factors affecting variation in size hierarchies among natural populations. This lack of information regarding pattern makes it difficult to develop an explanation, or even a strategy to seek an explanation, regarding the underlying processes. The purpose of this study is to provide information regarding variation in size hierarchies within natural populations. The data collected will reveal greater insight into processes generating size hierarchies, and suggest testable hypotheses regarding the significance of specific processes.",

Guard cell measurements were intermediate to the presumed diploid and tetraploid parental species suggesting that the hybrid is triploid.

    "abstract": "When we purchased home we acquired also trapezoidal piece of land at the end of the backyard about 65 X 20 X 55 X 15 feet. The northeast corner of the plot was good 2 feet lower than the back yard. The southwest corner-6 inches higher. Midway across the plot was bank with 45 degree slope. The plot was surrounded by trees on four sides with dead and decaying wild cherry tree in the center. The ground was covered with vegetation: mostly Broad-leaved dock (Rumex obtusifolius) interspersed with Gill over the ground (Nep,eta hederacea) and Burdock (Arctium lappa) on the higher southern section, and an almost pure stand of Celandine poppy (Chelidonium majus) on the lower northern section. Poison ivy flourished along two sides of the property line. It seemed like a good piece of land to because it would serve as buffer between property and potential building lot. But it looked like miserable piece of land to own if you cared about yards and growing plants. Even after we cut down the old and dying wild cherry trees on property, pushed over the dead tree in the middle of the plot, pulled the hundreds of celandines, poisoned the poison ivy and dug out the dock, the area looked hopeless. The trees on neighbors' properties shaded one part or another all through the day and the terrain was neither suited to gardening nor mowing. So we dubbed it our woods and decided to specialize in ferns and fern allies. Our first ferns were common ones of the area. Sometimes they were snatched from destruction by bulldozer and backhoe. Sometimes they were carefully selected from abundant patches in woodland areas. At all times they were lifted with soil on the roots and planted in holes well supplied with leaf mold. The second spring we watched Royal fern, Osmunda regalis, Interrupted fern, Osmunda claytoniana, Cinnamon fern, Osmunda cinnamomea, Lady fern, Athyrium asplenioides, Christmas 63",

It is distinguished from all other Costa Rican Pityrogramma species by a combination of once-pinnate-pinnatifid laminae, abundant whitish hairs on the petiole, rachis, and laminar surface, and complete lack of farina on the abaxial laminar surface. A hybrid between this species and Pityrogramma calomelanos (L.) Link, Pityrogramma ×watkinsii Testo is also described. It is morphologically intermediate to its progenitors and is characterized by an indument of whitish hairs on the petiole, rachis, and laminar surface, and sparse white farina on the abaxial surface of the lamina. The new species and hybrid are each known only from the type collections. Relationships to other species of Pityrogramma are discussed, and a key to Central American Pityrogramma is presented.",

The results demonstrate that the oogenesis of D. glaucum is similar to the core leptosporangiate ferns. The egg cell of D. glaucum was progressively isolated from the adjacent cells by forming a separation cavity and an egg envelope during maturation. However, during this process, a pore region consistently connected the egg and the ventral canal cell. Ultimately, a fertilization pore formed at the pore region when the egg matured. The nucleus produced conspicuous evaginations during later stages of egg development. The cytological features during oogenesis in D. glaucum more closely resembled the core leptosporangiate ferns rather than the basal leptosporangiate ferns (Lygodium and Osmunda), which possess no egg envelope or fertilization pore. The results provide new characteristics for interpreting the evolutionary history of the gleichenioid ferns.",

    "abstract": "Along rocky ledges in the deserts, grasslands, and oak-pine woodlands of the New World there occurs a polymorphic complex of ferns characterized by linear, pinnate-pinnatifid, paleaceous fronds, the sinuous cloak-ferns. Until recently little was known concerning the members of this complex other than gross morphological characteristics and even these have not been well understood. Anatomical data was non-existent until Tryon (1956) noted the peculiar presence of two vascular bundles in the stipes of the sinuous cloak-ferns. Cytological data was limited to the report of apogamy in the taxon sinuata (Woronin, 1908), and physiological information was restricted to studies of comparative toxicity in the taxa sinuata and cochisensis (Mathews, 1945). Ecological observations were scanty, indicating only wide eco logical amplitude in regard to substrates and elevations occupied by members of this complex (Weatherby, 1943). Numerous specific and varietal names have been proposed for the various entities of this polymorphic complex, and considerable taxonomic confusion has existed concerning the status of these taxa and the names to be applied to them (Tryon, 1956). This confusion was largely resolved by Weatherby (1943), who first clearly delimited the three major taxa within this complex: sinuata, cochisensis, and integerrima (Fig. 1). Despite the great morphological differences between sinuata and cochisensis, Weatherby (1943) considered the three taxa to be varieties of Notholaena sinuata (Lag. ex Sw.) Kaulf. due to the morphological intermediate position of integerrima. This treatment has been widely followed, despite the demonstration by Mathews (1945) that the taxa sinuata and cochisensis differ not only morphologically but also in their toxicity to livestock. Another major taxon of this complex, N. sinuata var. pruinosa (Fee) Fourn. or N. crassifolia Moore and Houlst. was not recognized by Weatherby (1943); however, he suggested it might be recognized as a distinct variety of N. sinuata. In his revision of the American species of Notholaena, Tryon (1956) did not recognize this taxon as distinct but synonomized it with A7, sinuata var. sinuata; but he",

    "abstract": "During the preparation of a monograph of Anemia subgenus Coptophyllum, a series of specimens from western South America and Panama was seen which was strikingly different from the species of Anemia familiar to me. Some of the specimens were noted as possibly belonging to a new species. The plants resemble A. flexuosa, also of western South America, in their dissection, oblique rhizomes, and hirsute stipes, and some specimens were labelled with this name. However, on closer examination, they were found to be quite distinct, being of smaller size, and possessing rather lax, short-petiolate fertile pinnae and floating stomates. These last characters tie it closely to Anemia brandegeea and A. intermedia of Mexico. The specimens closely matched the description and drawing of A. smithii Brade (1929) of western Brazil. Since I was unable to borrow the type of that species at the time, I tentatively placed these specimens under that name in my revision (Mickel, 1962). It was grouped with A. brandegeea and A. intermedia in a new section Adetostoma. Subsequently, however, I have obtained photographs of the isotype of A. smithii from the British Museum (Natural History), which shows that there is no question but that A. smithii is actually only a small specimen of A. tomentosa and not the same as the plants from the Andean regions. These plants thus represent an undescribed species.",

    "abstract": "The hybrid Polystichum × arendsii was first bred by Georg Arends at the turn of the 20th century. It was an artificial cross between P. munitum (Kaulf.) C. Presl, native to north western North America, and P. aculeatum (L.) Roth, occurring in the Eurasian region. In 1906 the well-known Swiss botanist Konrad H. Christ applied the name Aspidium × arendsii to this hybrid. In the following decades the fern was lost and its name was forgotten. The present study investigates the history of the hybrid. In the interim, the cross has been successfully carried out once again and a new description of P. × arendsii is provided. Study of herbarium material and comparison of the information supplied by Konrad H. Christ, as well as the analysis of the spores, confirmed that the hybrid corresponds with the original A. × arendsii and a necessary valid combination under Polystichum is provided.",

    "abstract": "Women have long been underrepresented in STEM, although there are certain fields within this umbrella that show less of a disparity — the biological sciences being one example. Within biology, pteridology has a rich history of female contributors involved since its inception. In this review we strive to highlight some of the foremost female pteridologists including Elizabeth Knight Britton, Alma Stokey, Irene Manton, Alice Tryon, Barbara Hoshizaki, and Florence Wagner. This is not an exhaustive list, but rather an insight into the strong maternal lineage of the fern and lycophyte community. While the field would not be the same without the work of many male pteridologists, herein we emphasize the important contributions that these founding women have made. Some of the research conducted by early female pteridologists was largely undermined by their time and circumstance; here we bring their lives and works to the foreground. Furthermore, we hope this paper inspires young botanists to enter our unique and historically rich field.",

    "abstract": "The Evolution and Diversification of the LypopodsThe lycopods, a diverse and ancient group of pteridophytes, form a major lineage of vascular plants.This lineage includes three orders, Lycopodiales, Selaginellales, and Isoetales, Each order contains a single extant family, but the group has a long and diverse fossil record beginning in the Devonian or possibly late Silurian.This fossil record is replete with many curious forms that have long captured the interest and imagination of those interested in plant evolution.Although lycopods have attracted the attention of paleobotanists and morphologists for many years, it is only within the last few years that systematists have initiated studies to critically evaluate taxa and their modes of speciation.While there is agreement that the lycopods form a clade distinct from all other vascular plants, there is some argument in the interpretation of the diversity and evolution within the lycopod lineage.This is an exciting time for systematic biologists.We are beginning to uncover, discover, and explore the modes and mechanisms of divergent and reticulate evolution in the lycopods, revealing their incredibly long history and amazing diversity.The following five papers are facsimiles of oral presentations given on 4",

Butters have not previously been known to overlap in their distributions (Tryon, 1957; Tryon & Britton, 1958). Two stations for var. simplex were found this past summer in the range of var. occidentalis. The collections are Dorn 1354 (RM) from Teton County in northwestern Wyoming and Dorn 1455 (RM) from Crook County in northeastern Wyoming. The collected plants have 32 spores per sporangium (var. occidentalis has 64 spores per sporangium) and have the morphological characters of var. simplex. Both varieties were found within 30 meters of each other at the Teton County station. Polystichum scopulinum (D. C. Eaton) Maxon has not previously been considered to occur in Wyoming. Actually, the locality is in Wyoming. Eaton (1880) gave the locality as Upper Teton Canion in eastern Idaho. The specimen was collected on a Hayden expedition, and Hayden's (1873) report leaves no doubt that the locality is Upper Teton Cafion, Teton County, Wyoming. The Idaho border runs perpendicular to the mouth of the canyon, and so the upper canyon is several miles inside Wyoming, where the Hayden maps show it. Hanna (1932) suggested that the locality was in Wyoming, but did not confirm it. Fernald (1924) placed P. scopulinum under P. mohrioides as a variety and quoted a description of the type region of P. scopulinum from Hayden (1873). The description is probably not of the locality, because the plant was collected on July 28 but the description is for the party's activities on July 29. I attempted to relocate the species, but was unsuccessful due to the extensive area and abundant potential habitat. Another Wyoming collection of P. scopulinum is in the Yellowstone National Park Herbarium (M. T. Doutt 155, July 20, 1930). It was collected in the Bechler River Canyon, Yellowstone Park, Wyoming. The Bechler River Canyon is about 40 miles north of the locality.",

Unlike the majority of coral atolls it has been elevated by tectonic forces about 5-6 m. The island is noted, for more than any other reason, as the last stronghold in the Old World of the giant tortoises that formerly roamed many regions of the earth. They now survive only in the Galapagos, where they are rare, and on Aldabra, where they are still abundant. The climate of Aldabra is dry and hot, and scarcely favors the development of much of a fern flora. Although ferns are prominent in several habitats, the fern flora is exceedingly poor. One species had been recorded prior to the Royal Society Expedition (19661967) and, despite some weeks of active collecting by two botanists and several other scientists interested in the vegetation, the known fern flora still remained a single species, Acrostichum aureum L., until a tiny colony of Nephrolepis biserrata (Swartz) Schott was found by Mr. S. A. Renvoise in a depression in a barren area of windbeaten rough limestone near the southeast coast. No further colonies, nor any other species, have been found on the atoll. That prominent and varied fern vegetation may be made up of essentially a single species is very odd, indeed. Acrostichum is a",

    "abstract": "In southeast Florida an association between the shoestring fern (Vittaria lineata) and the pantropical moss Octoblepharum albidum is conspicuous on cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto) trunks. As determined from quadrat studies, for maturing sporophytes, but not for gametophytes and tiny sporophytes, the frequency of association exceeded that expected by chance. The positive association suggests the moss facilitates the fern sporophytes. Based on a literature review and on new observations, the structure of the moss and its intimate relationship with V. lineata roots is consistent with the moss serving as a water-retentive \"mulch\" for V. lineata. In different habitats V. lineata can associate alternatively with the moss Syrrhopodon incompletus, and it sometimes grows on decaying petiole-base remnants or in petiole-base axils with no moss association. The only vascular epiphyte competing with V. lineata locally is the fern Phlebodium aureum. The lengths of its leaf blades, but not those of V. lineata, correlate with the lengths of immediately adjacent S. palmetto petiole-stumps. Phlebodium aureum is prominent where the stumps are long, whereas V. lineata dominates in trunk regions having no or small petiole-stumps, where it usually associates with O. albidum.",

    "abstract": "The ferns of Adiantum Series Gravesiana (Pteridaceae) consist of species that occur exclusively on Danxia (A. juxtapositum) and Karst (A. mariesii, A. longzhouensis, A. dentatum, A. obovatum, and A. gravesii) landforms. We cultured representatives of these six species from 20 different populations on both agar and soil to investigate and compare their gametophyte development. All species had the Vittaria-type pattern of spore germination except A. obovatum, for which we missed the best time to observe this developmental phase. However, two different patterns of subsequent development were observed: the Adiantum-type (i.e., naked, cordate mature gametophyte thallus) in A. mariesii, A. longzhouensis, A. juxtapositum, and A. gravesii and the Kaulinia-type (i.e., naked, ribbon-shaped mature gametophyte thallus) in A. dentatum and A. obovatum. All populations from A. juxtapositum and A. gravesii possess the same Adiantum-type, suggesting that Karst and Danxia soils were not the main factor causing the differences in gametophyte development. The Kaulinia-type adult thallus has not been observed previously in Adiantum and may be an adaptive strategy for survival within the relatively harsh micro-habitats experienced by A. dentatum and A. obovatum compared to other members of this series.",

    "abstract": "Microbial endophytes are integral factors in plant evolution, ecology, and physiology. However, the endophyte communities across all major plant lineages have yet to be characterized, and data are particularly scarce for lycophytes. Here we used a culture-based approach to survey the diversity of endophytic bacteria in five sympatric Lycopodiaceae species in central New York. The most notable endophyte isolated from this study is a bacterial species Allobranchiibius huperziae, which was only recently described from the roots of Huperzia serrata in China. The fact that the same endophyte was also found in our North American samples suggest a possible specific association with Lycopodiaceae species. The data and cultures from this study provide an important foundation for future metagenomic and functional studies to characterize better the diversity and significance of plant endophytes.",

    "abstract": "Revealing the unrecognized diversity within cryptic species has profound implications in the taxonomy, systematics, evolutionary studies, and species protections throughout plant groups. Isoëtes is prone to a high rate of cryptic speciation because of its morphological simplicity, stasis, and convergence. Phylogenetic studies revealed cryptic species in the genus from the Brazilian semi-arid region (the Caatinga), which comprises the least studied and most endangered flora in Brazil. Here we conducted morphological analyses and chromosome counts, and took advantage of phylogenetic analyses already published for the genus to provide a taxonomic revision of Isoëtes from the Caatinga. Isoëtes anamariae and I. harleyi are two new species, which were revealed by molecular data and subtle morphological characters. This study provides descriptions, chromosome counts, illustrations of the most important morpho-taxonomic characters of species from the Caatinga, and a key to identify them. All species from this region are diploid and we show the importance of diploids in detangling the origin of polyploids in Brazil.",

    "abstract": "The rather saline environment of a coral atoll seems scarcely the place to look for a terrestrial Ophioglossum, and none has heretofore been reported from any atoll to the best of my knowledge. Ophioglossum pendulum L., an epiphytic species, has been found on Mili, Namorik, Ebon, and Jaluit atolls, in the southern Marshall Islands (St. John, Occ. Pap. Bishop Mus. 17: 177-182. 1943; Stone, Micronesica 1: 155. 1964; Fosberg & Sachet, Atoll Res. Bull. 92: 2. 1962). Hence, my astonishment was great when I spotted a small colony of one of these diminutive plants along a path in a coconut plantation just outside a village while I was hurrying to be picked up by a small boat on Fassarai Islet, Ulithi Atoll, August 17, 1965. I stopped, verified the observation, and hastily collected a few specimens (Fosberg & Evans 47400, MICH, UH, US). Two relatively recent papers treat the genus Ophioglossum in the Pacific region (Clausen, Mem. Torrey Bot. Club. 19(2): 1-177. 1938; Wieffering, Blumea 12: 321-337. 1964). The viewpoints and characters used by these authors are very different, and the keys of neither of them work very readily on the Ulithi specimens. However, after studying very carefully the material and the descriptions, as well as specimens from elsewhere, I conclude that the plants seem to fall, according to both treatments, into Ophioglossum nudicaule L. f. The specimens are very slender and delicate, to over 12.5 (usually 8-10) cm tall, with the blade at most 17 x 12 mm, attached 8-20 mm from the base of the stipe, elliptic to broadly ovate or almost orbicular, sessile, acute to almost truncate at the base, acutish to more usually obtuse to rounded and slightly apiculate at apex, very thin, rather coarsely areolate by rather prominent veins, the areolae becoming smaller and more isodiametric toward the margins, some of them divided by thinner veins into 2 or 3 smaller areolae, or containing 1 or 2 free-ending veins, the marginal cells mostly irregularly elongate parallel with the entire margins, the main basal veins 6-8; in Fosberg & Evans 47400 0 (rarely 1 or 2) sterile fronds from the rhizome, these with the stipes about equalling the elliptic, oval, or oboval blades; peduncle to 10.5 cm, usually 6-8 cm, spike 8-16 mm long including the sterile, apical portion, 1.5 mm wide including the sporangia, the sterile portion of the axis between the sporangia 0.2 mm or less wide, sterile apical part, if uninjured, 1-2 mm long, subulate. An attempt to place this population in one of the varieties recognized by Clausen failed. The plants range in size from small, as in var. nudicaule (var. typicum of Clausen), to almost the maximum for var. grandifolium. Small plants could fit var. minus. The blade is the wrong shape for var. laxum or var. tenerum,",

    "abstract": "Psilotum nudum (L.) Palisot, a widespread member of the Psilophyta in tropical regions, has a limited distribution in parts of southeastern United States. Bold (1967, p. 268) lists it from Florida, Louisiana and Texas. According to Small (1938, p. 398), Psilotum, commonly called Whisk-fern, is not uncommon in parts of Florida and occurs north into South Carolina. Matthews (1941) states that Psilotum is apparently very rare in South Carolina, having been reported only from the following localities: Santee Canal, Berkeley County, Ravenel about 1847; Old neglected garden in South Carolina, M. A. Curtis in 1859; Bluffton, Beaufort County, Mellichamp in 1882, 1887, 1894. In 1954, Matthews found Psilotum on the Coker College Campus in Hartsville, Darlington County, South Carolina. On December 30, 1971, on the grounds of a residence in Kingstree, Williamsburg County, South Carolina, I noticed a small plant growing under a Camellia japonica. After close observation, there was no doubt that the leafless specimen, which was about four inches long, was Psilotum. The unique features were dichotomous branching, small scale-like appendages (enations) on the aerial shoots, and the absence of roots. No sporangia were present. There were several much smaller shoots connected to the larger plant by a common rhizomatous system. The larger specimen of Psilotum was taken with soil to the plant room in the biology department of Francis Marion College. It has continued to develop in a container with a two-foot palm under timed (twelve hours daily) fluorescent lighting. Several shoots have emerged from underground near the base of the aerial stem.",

In order to make some of the characteristics of these attractive little ferns more readily apparent to others who may not have an opportunity to acquire or examine specimens from the peninsula, drawings of certain features of each of the above species have been prepared and are presented here.

    "abstract": "In this autoradiographic study of protein synthesis during rhizoid differentiation in P vittata, total grain counts increase seven-fold, from 42 grains in the non-differentiated stage to 295 in the premitotic corona stage. This almost doubles to 624 in the postmitotic internally- segmented rhizoid stage (irc) and increases five times to 3,079 in the wheel stage that follows; the count then doubles to 6,120 grains in the later protrusion stage and approximately doubles again to 13,487 in the final young rhizoid stage. These results show that rhizoid initiation, differentia- tion, and growth are attended by significant increases in protein syntheses. Although the grain count over the cytoplasm increases seven-fold in the corona when compared to the non-differ- entiated cell, the relative percentage distribution for this compartment remains unchanged. How- ever, grain counts over the cytoplasm of postmitotic stages increase from 80% (irc) to 96% (wheel) to 97% (protrusion) and to 99% (young rhizoid) of the total count. In contrast, nuclear labeling reached a stationary phase in the irc and in the subsequent postmitotic stages. The first rhizoid in Pteris vittata L. is produced when the spore divides mitotically at germination; however, rhizoid formation may be more clearly observed later in gametophyte development, i.e., in the enlarged, vacuolated thallus cells that mature behind the regions of cell division and enlargement (Crotty, 1967). Increases in cytoplasmic RNA in the vicinity of the spore nucleus during primary rhizoid formation in Matteuccia struthiopteris (L.) Tod. were reported by Gantt and Arnott (1965). Extensive cytochemical studies of Pteris vittata by Crotty (1961, 1967) have provided detailed descriptions and analyses of the events at the light microscope level that accompany secondary rhizoid devel- opment, including RNA, protein, and polysaccharide syntheses. Additionally, these studies described a succession of developmental stages that occurred during the pre- and postmitotic rhizoid differentiation process (Fig. 1). Using a precise autoradiographic technique, Cohen and Crotty (1979) reported that the RNA in the anastomosing cytoplasmic strands around the nucleus of the corona (first stage of rhizoid differentiation) originated in the premitotic nu- cleus of this stage. In a later autoradiographic study, Cohen and Crotty (1990) demonstrated the existence of specific patterns of RNA synthesis in the stages of rhizoid differentiation in P vittata. The purpose of this study was to determine if protein synthesis during rhi- zoid differentiation, as measured by radioactive leucine uptake, could also be quantified and resolved into specific patterns. And, if so, can the results show a meaningful relationship to the earlier studies in P. vittata? In fact, the results of this investigation demonstrate that rhizoid differentiation is attended by",

    "abstract": "Pteris wallichiana Agardh was collected from Kerala, India, fixed in FAA, and processed for microtomy by conventional methods (Sass, 1958). Sections were stained following Cheadle, Gifford and Esau (1953). In addition, 2 KI and H2S04 was used for cellulose, the PAS reaction for insoluble polysaccharides (Jensen, 1962), and Toluidine blue '0' for cell walls (O'Brien, Feder & McCully, 1964). During our study of phloem structure in Pteris wallichiana we observed uncommon papillose thickenings on the walls of sieve cells, rarely in the rhizome and frequently in the rachis. These sieve cells were randomly distributed and generally belonged to the metaphloem. Sieve cells with this thickening did not appear to be structurally different from other sieve cells. The thickenings project 2.4-10.4 tum from the sieve cell wall into the cell lumen (Figs. 1-2). Phloem parenchyma cells having a common wall with sieve cells rarely show this type of thickening (Fig. 4). The thickening may be on only one side of the common wall or it may be on both sides of the wall of two adjacent sieve cells. Occasionally small fissures, some of which may be artifacts, appear in the papillose thickenings, which cause the thickening to appear to consist of different parts (Figs. 5-8). The thickenings are neither tyloses nor, apparently, a reaction to fungal infection. The thickenings are PAS-positive and give a confirmatory test for cellulose. They stain purple red with toluidine blue 'O', a staining reaction similar to the remaining part of the sieve cell wall. A membraneous lining is sometimes observed over the thickenings (Fig. 3). Similar wall th:ckenings have not been reported in sieve elements of other fern species. Warrington (1970) reported papillose cellulose thickenings of cell walls in the cortical cells of rhizome of Geocaulon lividum (Santalaceae), a dicotyledonous plant, but these thickenings were always in pairs on common cell walls.",

Later, Blanford (1888) reduced these species to varieties of C. farinosa. Hope (1901), Alston (1956), and Verma (1964) considered these taxa to be species. Panigrahi (1962) regarded the tetraploid occurring in Ceylon as Aleuritopteris anceps (Blanf.) Panigr. and the diploid as A. grisea (Blanf.) Panigr. Hope (1900, p. 250) apparently was the first to point out that C. anceps had two forms. His specimens, from near Simla in the western Himalayas, although collected at the same time as Blanford's, differed in being smaller, more delicate, and sometimes in having apparently concolorous rhizome scales. This led Hope to comment that his specimens seemed near to C. farinosa var. grisea (Blanf.) Blanf. These small specimens cannot be C. grisea, however, because that species has a naked rachis, always has concolorous, brown scales that are restricted to the stipe bases, and has a crenate or irregularly lobed indusial margin. Cheilanthes anceps, on the other hand, is characterized by its lanceolate to oblong-lanceolate fronds, scaly stipes and rachises, and lacerate indusial margins. Sufficient morphological and cytological differences occur between the two types of C. anceps to require their separation into varieties, but I hesitate to assign the rank of species to the two because of certain resemblances between them. In both, bicolorous scales are present on the stipe and rachis, the fronds are more or less lanceolate, and the indusial margin is always lacerate.",

    "abstract": "This study was carried out in the Gori Valley catchment of Uttarakhand, Western Himalaya, to document more fully the distribution and ecology of ferns and lycophytes at a montane site divided into 7 elevation sampling zones from 1,800–4,000 m (subtemperate to alpine) across a distance of approximately 30 km. A total of 16 families, 33 genera, and 92 species were found. Species richness, total species density ha–1, diversity, and Pielou's species evenness per elevation zone (m) were calculated for each zone. The data were used to evaluate three hypotheses addressing changes in density and species distribution in relation to the biogeographic and climatic conditions across the seven elevation sampling zones. Total density of ferns and lycophytes tended to decrease from Zone 1 toward Zone 7; although Zones 1-3 (sub-temperate) had clearly higher mean densities than those in Zones 5-7 (alpine). The highest density was found in Zone 1 (Lilam 1,800 m) and lowest density was found in Zone 6 (Burfu 3,450 m). After finding a significant difference among all mean densities for each elevation zone (p < 0.001), using a non-parametric Welch's ANOVA, a Games-Howell test for pairwise comparisons of the means showed that each of the mean densities for species in Zones 1 to 3 was significantly different from each of the species densities in Zones 5 to 7 (p < 0.05). The mean densities for Zone 4 were not significantly different from any of the other zonal mean densities (i.e., 1–3 and 5–7), suggesting that Zone 4 is a transitional zone between two end member Zones (1–3 and 5–7).",

    "abstract": "A new species, Lellingeria cantarensis, is described from the cloud forests of Cerro Jefe, an isolated mountain peak in central Panama known for its high levels of endemism and species diversity. It appears most similar to L. kaieteura and L. epiphytica, both of which also have dorsiventral rhizomes, clathrate rhizome scales with ciliate margins and abaxial hairs on the rachis. The new species is distinct from those two species, and from all other congeners, by its small laminae (less than 6 cm long), truncate laminar base, and the abaxial side of rachis is densely pubescent. Lellingeria subimpressa is also similar to L. cantarensis but it differs by having a glabrous rachis. None of the similar species are sympatric with L. cantarensis; they are restricted to Costa Rica, South America, or Caribbean Islands. A phylogenetic analysis using five plastid markers and 94 other grammitid taxa confirms the new species as sister to the Lellingeria suprasculpta clade with strong support. Lellingeria cantarensis is known only from the type and one additional collection from the type locality, and it is one of ten Lellingeria species found in Panama; it is also the only endemic Lellingeria in the country. We also provide a key to the species that occur in Panama and neighboring Costa Rica. With the addition of this new species, the total number of Lellingeria species becomes 51 worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Glacier National Park encompasses over one million acres in the mountains of northwestern Montana, along the United States–Canada border. Our survey of online databases indicates that the earliest extant fern and lycophyte collections from this area were taken by Robert S. Williams in 1892. In the summer of 1919, Paul C. Standley, a botanist with the United States National Museum, conducted a survey of the flora of the newly created Park and recorded 39 species of ferns and lycophytes. In 2002, a revised flora for the Park by Peter Lesica increased this number to 61. Here we summarize 130 years of collections-based research on the ferns and lycophytes of Glacier National Park, documenting how our understanding of the flora has changed through time. In the summer of 2019, the lead author conducted a field survey to relocate as many ferns and lycophytes as possible within park boundaries. In parallel, we scoured herbarium online portals and databases for high-resolution digitized specimen images to confirm or refute historical vouchers of ferns and lycophytes collected from the Park. In a few cases, specimen loans were requested from herbaria to confirm our determinations. The results from our combined field and online herbarium studies are presented here. Of the 61 taxa recognized by Lesica in 2002, we were able to confirm all but seven. In sum, we recognize here a total of 71 fern and lycophyte taxa for the Park. Most previously unreported taxa belong to Botrychium, a genus that has seen a flurry of recent taxonomic work by co-author Farrar and collaborators. These new data are presented here together with updated nomenclature and discussion to provide a current taxonomic account of the fourteen fern and lycophyte families known to occur in Glacier National Park. We anticipate this study will provide a useful foundation for further investigations in the Park.",

    "abstract": "Lycopodium phlegmaria L. is an epiphyte commonly found growing on the trunks and branches of forest trees in Singapore. It is a widely distributed species in the Old World tropics, ranging from Africa to Polynesia. Its pendulous stems are covered with spirally arranged, stiff, ovate-lanceolate leaves (Fig. 1). Both the sterile portions of the stems and the strobili branch dichotomously (Figs. I and 2). The sporophylls are smaller than the foliage leaves and are arranged more compactly along the branches. In most cases, the sporophylls are grouped terminally on determinate stems. However, instances of foliage leaves appearing along the strobilus branches have been observed (Fig. 2). This is reminiscent of the condition seen in L. selago L., where the fertile zones alternate with the sterile and the foliage leaves are not much different from the sporophylls (Bower, 1935, p. 200). Recently, a portion of L. phlegmaria detached from the parent plant was found lying on damp ground on the secondary forest at the MacRitchie Catchment area in Singapore. It was still green, and the ends of the fertile branches showed growth following detachment. Under the humid conditions of the forest floor, the ends of the branches had reverted to vegetative growth and had produced one or two young plants each (Fig. 4). Roots had grown from the base of some of these young plants. In one instance, the extension of a strobilus branch was an elongate stem with long internodes (Fig. 3). At the nodes were leafy structures similar to the sporophylls. In the axils of these structures were obviously vegetative buds, some of which had developed into vegetative shoots (Fig. 3). Longitudinal sections of the strobilus branches revealed the gradual transformation of the sporangia from fertile to sterile in the acropetal direction. The fertile, spore-containing sporangia had thickened outer cells along the inner and radial walls. Sterile sporangia lacked these characteristically thickened outer cells. Sporangia along the vegetative outgrowths were mere protuberances, without any differentiation whatsoever. As in ferns, root development was endogenous and very close to the vascular strand. Placing the ends of strobilus branches from cultivated L. phlegmaria on moist vermiculite similarly stimulated development of vegetative shoots after about four months. The new growths had excessively elongate interodes, the sporophylls were smaller until foliage leaves were produced when the axis turned upwards. Roots formed at the points of turning after a further period of two to four months. These shoots could then be removed as plantlets. These observations give support to Bower's (1908, p. 164) theory that foliage leaves essentially are sporophylls with the sporangia completely suppressed. In this respect, it should be noted that the strobili of L. obscurum L. and L. flabel-",

    "abstract": "Asplenium is one of the largest and most interesting genera of ferns in the neotropics. Many of its species are distinctive and quite easy to identify, but a few others, notably A. auritum Swartz, A. cuspidatum Lam., and A. radicans L., are so highly variable that intensive monographic studies will be required to define their specific and infraspecific limits. During my studies of the genus for the Ferns and Fern Allies of a total of 40 species (including a number of varieties) have been recognized in this small Central American country. One of these is new. Asplenium williamsii Stolze, sp. nov. Figs. 14.

    "abstract": "Cuba, Jamaica, and parts of South America. The species belongs to the heterophyllous subg. Stachygynandrum, which is characterized by the stems (at least distally) and the vegetative leaves of branches having 2 rows of smaller, usually appressed, median leaves and 2 rows of larger, spreading lateral ones. Contrasting with this is subg. Selaginella, with plants homophyllous throughout, i.e., leaves are borne on all sides of the stem and branches and all are appressed for most of their length. Subgenus Stachygynandrum is sharply divided into two groups, one having stems articulate, or at least constricted at or near the nodes and here usually discolored, and with rhizophores produced dorsally. The other group, containing S. pallescens, has stems neither articulate nor with discolored or constricted nodes, and with rhizophores produced ventrally, Selaginella pallescens and its nearest relatives commonly have the stems densely caespitose, often forming rosettes. They tend to curl inward when dry, then uncurl again when moisture is introduced, thus giving rise to the common name Resurrection Plant. Taxonomy of the entire S. pallescens complex in the neotropics needs careful re-examination. There are several species which I feel are not truly distinct, and yet there are some hitherto unrecognized variants, which perhaps should be formally treated as varieties or forms. Some very closely related species are: S. cuspidata (Link) Link and var. elongata Spring, S. harrisii Underw. & Hieron., S. microdendron Bak., S. millspaughii Hieron., and S. pulcherrima Liebm. During a study of the genus for the Ferns and Fern Allies of Guatemala, it appeared to me that most of these species might better be included under S. pallescens, for whatever differences were noted by previous authors appear to be thoroughly inconsistent. On the other hand, some new features have come to light which seem significant and consistent enough to indicate recognition of some specimens at the varietal level. In his study of the spores of heterophyllous Selaginellae, Hellwig (Ann. Mo. Bot. Gard. 56:41/1 164. 1969) annotated a number of specimens in various herbaria as S. pallescens, red-stemmed variant. Some other minor features have been discovered to be consistent with stem color on these specimens, and the combination of",

Bedd., has been reported as escaped from cultivation in Gadsden County, Florida since 1957 (Wherry, 1964), and recently Short (1980) published an account of its discovery in Lee County, Alabama. This species subsequently has been found in three widely disjunct locations in Georgia (Fig. 1). In late summer of 1980, my wife and I led a fern field trip in central south Georgia for the Georgia Botanical Society. During the field trip, Marge White and Frieda Polsfuss (fern hobbyists from middle Georgia) showed several of us some pressed fronds of a fern which Mrs. White had collected in Houston County, Georgia. Upon superficial examination, most of us identified the plant as a form of Athyrium, although the possibility of its being a Diplazium was suggested. A frond was given to Lloyd H. Snyder, Jr. (a fern hobbyist from Atlanta), who discovered the same fern beneath a highway bridge in Berrien County, Georgia the following day. Specimens from Houston and Berrien Counties were shown to Dr. Murray Evans of the University of Tennessee, who confirmed the identity of both as Diplazium japonicum. The two sites were rechecked in October to determine the extent and condition of",

    "abstract": "North American distribution maps for the Northern Holly Fern, Polystichum lonchitis (L.) Roth, show a disjunct range from alpine areas in the western United States and Canada to the northern Great Lakes region, the Gaspe Peninsula, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Greenland (Fernald, 1935; Hulten, 1958, 1968; Wagner, 1979). One isolated station at Richmond Gulf on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay (Rousseau, 1974; Payette & Lepage, 1977) links the northern range of this species in Alaska, British Columbia, and Alberta with its distribution on the coast of Greenland. Rouleau (1956) reported P. lonchitis from Labrador but without locality data or specimen citation. Since a specimen has never been located to verify this report, the occurrence of the Northern Holly Fern in Labrador has been considered doubtful (Rousseau, 1974; Payette & Lepage, 1977) links the northern range of this species in Grenfell-Forbes Northern Labrador Expedition of 1931, noted that Rev. Hettasch had seen P. lonchitis growing on Ogualik Island (Cod Island) on the Labrador coast (57?47'N, 61?47'W) but had not collected it. This brief mention may have been the basis for Rouleau's including it in his list for Labrador. Our recent collections from the Schefferville region (Lei s. n., 20 July 1980, MTMG; Waterway 2140, 30 July 1981, MTMG, CAN) confirm the presence of P. lonchitis in the central interior of the Quebec-Labrador peninsula. In 1980, a specimen was collected from a population of about ten to fifteen individuals growing on a protected, east-facing slope of Geren Mountain in the saddle between Geren Mountain and Sunny Mountain (55?04'N, 67?14'W). The plants were small (10-15 fronds each) and separated from one another by distances of about 0.5 m. Phegopteris connectilis, Carex scirpoidea, Salix vestita and Anemone parviflora were observed at the same site.",

There was then no one in China who knew ferns or how to study ferns. There was no literature available except Engler and Prantl's Die Natiirlichen Pflanzenfamilien (1898-1902), and there was not a single fern specimen correctly identified in the small herbarium that had just been initiated in Beijing. It seemed unimaginable to start studying ferns under such hopeless circumstances. It was his strong will that surmounted all the difficulties he met with at the beginning. For literature, for example, he wrote to the then world authorities on ferns, such as H. Christ, C. Christensen, W. R. Maxon, and E. B. Copeland, asking for reprints of their papers and monographs on ferns. Thanks to their generous help, he obtained within a few years practically all the available literature chiefly concerning Asiatic ferns of that time to start his work with.",

    "abstract": "Adiantum trapeziforme L. was discovered by the late George N. Avery in February 1980. He found a single plant growing at the top of a low spoil bank in an area kept humid by runoff from a nearby water-pumping station, and he collected a single fertile frond (Avery 2207, FTG). The fern grows in an area shaded by the exotic weed trees Schinus terebenthifolius and Albizzia lebbeck. Avery took us to see the plant in late 1982; we visited the site again in January 1984. Both times we looked for evidence of young Adiantum plants. No sporelings were ever found, although the original plant appears to be growing well and produces spores regularly. The Adiantum might represent a persistent plant from cuttings dumped at the site, but, as no evidence for dumping was found, we concluded that the plant is a true escape. The future of this species in South Florida is problematical. It grows in a relatively protected area and is not likely to be destroyed by human activities in the near future, but it apparently has not spread in the four years since its discovery. Whether it is capable of becoming truly naturalized is not clear. In March 1983 the senior author found approximately seven plants of Adiantum anceps Maxon & Morton growing on the vertical walls of trenches cut into rocky ground, along with Ctenitis sloanei (Poeppig ex Sprengel) Morton. The plants were growing in the shade of Schinus terebenthifolius. Undoubtedly water collecting at the bottom of the trenches helped maintain a humid environment. Two voucher specimens have been collected (Herndon 702 and Avery 2501, FTG). This species has spread within its rather specialized habitat, suggesting that the climate in South Florida is conducive to its growth. The colony is in an area of active commercial development and will likely be destroyed before the plants spread to more protected areas. Still, the habitat in which the plants grow is quite similar to the pinnacle rock areas found in some Dade County parks. Given the continuous supply of spores from cultivated plants and the availability of apparently suitable habitat in protected areas, it is likely that this species will sooner or later become an established member of our naturalized flora.-Alan and Rhonda Herndon, 15301 S.W. 306th St., Homestead, FL 33033. 29",

    "abstract": "While examining types for the Pteridophyta of Peru I encountered evidence of general confusion as to the identity of the Andean cristatum Hook. & Grev., as well as to its type specimen and early illustrations. The protologue calls attention to the principal characters that separate it from related species: It is distinguished no less by the serrated or spinulose crested midrib and rachis, than by the large and conspicuous involucres. The accompanying illustration clearly depicts the numerous foliar toothlike processes (lamellae) that spring from the abaxial side of veins and costae, perpendicular or oblique to the plane of the lamina. Also shown is a subglobose receptacle, quite distinct from the usual elongate to turbinate receptacles seen in most related species. Morton (1968) based his section Buesia on . . having some accessory wings not in the plane of the frond in addition to the subglobose to clavate receptacles. Within the section he included cristatum and five other species. Section Buesia in turn is included within the subgenus which is characterized by the essentially glabrous lamina and conspicuously serrate ultimate segments. There is a type folder at the British Museum marked Hymenophyllum cristatum & G., with a pencilled question mark preceding the printed Type Specimen. On the sheet (Fig. 1) are two separate specimens, neither of which are cristatum, but are instead (Sw.) Sw., a common species from the Neotropics. This species is a member of subg. Hymenophyllum, sect. Ptychophyllum, according to Morton (1968) and is quite distinct from cristatum in that it lacks any sort of lamellae on the costae or veins and the receptacles and indusia are elongate. The upper specimen is labelled Spruce 5422., H. pedicellatum Kze.?, in Andibus Ecuadorensibus; the lower is annotated Herb. John Smith, Sw. Pinned beside Spruce 5422 is an exact copy of t. 148, from the Icones Filicum (Hooker & Greville, 1829). This illustrates cristatum, complete with enlargements of the subspherical indusium, globose receptacle and conspicuous lamellae. Glued beside the lower plant is a label containing exact data for the type collection of cristatum (Jameson, Mt. Cayambe, etc.). One can only assume that the drawing and Jameson label were inadvertently affixed to the wrong sheet. At any rate, neither specimen can be the type of the latter, label and attached illustration notwithstanding. In a loan from Kew I discovered a type folder marked H. fucoides that contains a sheet (fig. 2) with two different collections, both from Hooker's herbarium. The upper left, marked H. fucoides, Quito, Jameson, is not a type, but it is properly identified to species, as it has (among other characters) ovate, subentire indusia and the veins and costae lack lamellae. The right and lower plants, marked 8(2?)9, Hymenophyllum, Forests of the Andes, have subspherical sori, toothed indusia, many conspicuous lamellae on veins, and somewhat flexuous rachises (annotated by Morton as cristatum).

    "abstract": "Mexico with its ca. 76 species of Selaginella has the third highest number of species of any country in the New World. During the course of my preliminary studies aimed to prepare the treatment of the family Selaginellaceae for the Pteridoflora of Mexico Project (Mikel, Smith, Palacios-Rios, and collaborators, in prep.), a new species was uncovered among a loan of Selaginella specimens from Veracruz sent to me by M. en C. Monica Palacios-Rios (XAL). Later, Biol. Horalia Diaz Barriga (IEB) provided me with additional material of the new species from Queretaro. Since this novelty is to be included by Biol. Diaz Barriga (pers. comm.) in her treatment of the genus Selaginella for Flora del Bajfo, a formal description is required, which I provide below. Further additions to Mexican Selaginella are foreseen as ongoing studies by the author continue.",
