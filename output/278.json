First, this system becomes a nonimpulsive system by applying an appropriate transformation. Secondly, the existence and uniqueness of the solution are obtained by an F-contractive operator and a fixed-point theorem on metric space. Simultaneously, the generalized UH-stability is established based on nonlinear analysis methods. Thirdly, a novel numerical simulation algorithm is provided. Finally, an example is used to illustrate the correctness and availability of the main results. Our study is a beneficial exploration of the dynamic properties of viscoelastic turbulence problems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We analyze a time-delay Caputo-type fractional mathematical model containing the infection rate of Beddington–DeAngelis functional response to study the structure of a vector-borne plant epidemic. We prove the unique global solution existence for the given delay mathematical model by using fixed point results. We use the Adams–Bashforth–Moulton P-C algorithm for solving the given dynamical model. We give a number of graphical interpretations of the proposed solution. A number of novel results are demonstrated from the given practical and theoretical observations. By using 3-D plots we observe the variations in the flatness of our plots when the fractional order varies. The role of time delay on the proposed plant disease dynamics and the effects of infection rate in the population of susceptible and infectious classes are investigated. The main motivation of this research study is examining the dynamics of the vector-borne epidemic in the sense of fractional derivatives under memory effects. This study is an example of how the fractional derivatives are useful in plant epidemiology. The application of Caputo derivative with equal dimensionality includes the memory in the model, which is the main novelty of this study.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, we replace the standard numerical approach of estimating parameters in a mathematical model using numerical solvers for differential equations with a physics-informed neural network (PINN). This neural network requires a sequence of time instances as direct input of the network and the numbers of susceptibles, vaccinated, infected, hospitalized, and recovered individuals per time instance to learn certain parameters of the underlying model, which are used for the loss calculations. The established model is an extended susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model in which the transitions between disease-related population groups, called compartments, and the physical laws of epidemic transmission dynamics are expressed by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The system of ODEs and its time derivative are included in the residual loss function of the PINN in addition to the data error between the current network output and the time series data of the compartment sizes. Further, we illustrate how this PINN approach can also be used for differential equation-based models such as the proposed extended SIR model, called SVIHR model. In a validation process, we compare the performance of the PINN with results obtained with the numerical technique of non-standard finite differences (NSFD) in generating future COVID-19 scenarios based on the parameters identified by the PINN. The used training data set covers the time between the outbreak of the pandemic in Germany and the last week of the year 2021. We obtain a two-step or hybrid approach, as the PINN is then used to generate a future COVID-19 outbreak scenario describing a possibly next pandemic wave. The week at which the prediction starts is chosen in mid-April 2022.",

The study thoroughly investigates the implications of time delays inherent in vaccine preparation and administration, the transition from treatment to recovery, and the timeline from exposure to infection. The model is strengthened by establishing essential mathematical properties such as nonnegativity, boundedness, existence of solutions, and equilibria. An estimate of the basic reproduction number is provided to facilitate a preliminary understanding of disease behavior. Furthermore, the local stability of disease-free and endemic equilibria is examined in relation to the basic reproduction number, highlighting the model’s capacity to predict disease dynamics. Moreover, the global stability of the equilibria is essential for understanding the ultimate impact of the disease, as the initial incidence may or may not continue its influence in the presence of counteracting effects such as vaccination and treatment throughout the system. Finally, the results are tested with parameters chosen from recently collected data on the dynamics of COVID-19, and numerical examples are presented to support the theoretical concepts proposed.

The existence, uniqueness, and global asymptotic stability of equilibrium points are investigated and some criteria are established. Next, Hopf bifurcation analysis is executed, and the critical values of such bifurcation parameters as fear and delay for the determinate system are obtained. Then we extend it to a random environment and study the boundedness of expectation of solutions and the global asymptotic stability. Finally, the main findings are validated by numerical examples. It is worth noting that the specific influences of fear by predator, time delay, and white noise are explored numerically. Simulation figures intuitively exhibit that fear, delay, and white noise bring serious influences on the stability of the system. Fear from predator leads to a lower equilibrium state of prey and predator, and it can change the system stability from unstable to stable after exceeding a certain critical value. The time delay has a significant impact on the system stability by producing Hopf bifurcations accompanied by limit cycles, and even lead to multiple stabilities. Larger white noise can change the system stability from stable to unstable.",

    "abstract": "This study proposes a dynamical epidemic model $SIR$ incorporating a nonlinear saturated incidence and nonlinear recovery rates. The model considers the influence of available resources, the ratio of the infected population, and the decrease of interventions on the spread of infectious diseases. The use of a nonlinear incident rate as a monoid-type equation improves the study compared to a constant-type incident rate because the spread of infection is now determined by the force of the illness and the number of infected individuals available to disseminate the infection. The consideration of recovery rate, which includes the minimum and maximum feasible recovery rates and the amount of resources available for treatment, makes the research more advantageous. The conditions for the existence of the equilibria have been established. Furthermore, stability analysis and bifurcation have been carried out using Lyapunov's direct method, the Routh–Hurwitz criterion, and Dulac's creation under each set of conditions. A numerical simulation was conducted using $MATLAB$ . As the value of the preventive measure increases, the results indicate a considerable decrease in the infected compartment. In addition, the recovered population is growing as more resources, such as oxygen cylinders, hospital beds, and vaccination doses, become available.",

Though the model was originally proposed by De Pillis et al. (Math. Comput. Model. 37:1221–1244, 2003), to make the model more realistic, we have added a delay term into the model, and it has incorporated novelty in our present work. The stability of existing equilibrium points in the delay-induced system is studied in detail. Global stability conditions of the tumor-free equilibrium point have been found. It is shown that due to this delay effect, the coexisting equilibrium point may lose its stability through a Hopf bifurcation. The implicit function theorem is applied to characterize a complex function in a neighborhood of delay terms. Additionally, the presence of Hopf bifurcation is demonstrated when the transversality conditions are satisfied. The length of delay for which the solutions preserve the stability of the limit cycle is estimated. Finally, through a series of numerical simulations, the theoretical results are formally examined.",

    "abstract": "Supply chain efficiency is critical to enterprises and can affect their competitiveness. The supply chain faces an uncertain and complex external market environment, facing the problem of supply chain efficiency optimization; the traditional optimization method is ineffective, which can better face the current environment and deal with problems. It has advantages in optimizing supply chain efficiency and has been widely used. This paper first expounds on the importance of supply chain management status, the limitations of traditional supply chain management methods, and reinforcement learning in the application of supply chain optimization. Then, through experiments, reinforcement learning, supply chain optimization problems, and the analysis of related algorithm design, the optimal algorithm focuses on inventory management optimization. Finally, this paper points out the future research directions and development trend of the supply chain efficiency optimization algorithm based on reinforcement learning.",

The pointwise-like convergence of the nonlocal normal operator is cast as a new type of two-scale operator-point convergence, which we call condensated convergence. The results hold for general integrable kernels, a setting which is favored in numerical simulations. We support this analysis with numerical convergence studies using a piecewise linear discontinuous Galerkin discretization and show an $\\mathcal{O}(\\delta ^{2})$ rate of convergence of solutions, also exhibiting an $\\mathcal{O}(h^{2})$ convergence, where h is the mesh size.",

We investigate the nonlinear behavior of multi-component plasma. For this effective approach, named homotopy perturbation, transformation approach is suggested. This scheme of nonlinear model generally occurs as a characterization of waves in traffic flow, multi-component plasmas, electrodynamics, electromagnetism, shallow water waves, elastic media, etc. The main objective of this study is to provide a new class of methods, which requires not using small variables for finding estimated solution of fractional coupled frameworks and unrealistic factors and eliminate linearization. Analytical simulation represents that the suggested method is effective, accurate, and straightforward to use to a wide range of physical frameworks. This analysis indicates that analytical simulation obtained by the homotopy perturbation transform method is very efficient and precise for evaluation of the nonlinear behavior of the scheme. This result also suggests that the homotopy perturbation transform method is much simpler and easier, more convenient and effective than other available mathematical techniques.",

In this paper, we review and investigate several aspects of bond-based peridynamic models. We present a detailed description of peridynamics theory, applications, and numerical models. We display the employed BB-PD integral kernels together with their differences and commonalities; then we discuss some consequences of their mathematical structure. We critically analyze and comment on the kinematic role of nonlocality, the relation between kernel structure and material impenetrability, and the role of PD kernel nonlinearity in crack formation prediction. Finally, we propose and present the idea of extending BB-PD to fluids in the framework of fading memory material, drawing some perspectives for a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the peridynamics in fluids.",

Furthermore, artificial intelligence-based feedforward neural networks (ANNs) are utilized with hybridization of a generalized normal-distribution optimization (GNDO) algorithm and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) to study the heat-transfer equations and calculate the approximate solutions for the momentum of a non-Newtonian fluid. Legendre polynomials based Legendre neural networks (LNN) are used to develop a mathematical model for the governing equations, which are further exploited by the global search ability of GNDO and SQP for rapid localization convergence.

    "abstract": "Abstract Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women. Chemotherapy is primarily used for patients with stage 2 to 4 breast cancer. Most chemotherapy drugs are effective at destroying rapidly growing and proliferating cancer cells. However, drugs also damage normal, rapidly growing cells, which can lead to serious side effects. Breast cancer treatment with chemotherapy can affect heart health. Side effects of chemotherapy on the heart are called cardiotoxicity. Therefore, we have constructed a mathematical model from the breast cancer patient population. In this article, we utilize the Caputo–Fabrizio fractional order derivative for mathematical modeling of the breast cancer stages in chemotherapy patients. The use of Caputo–Fabrizio fractional derivative provides a more valuable insight into the complexity of the breast cancer model. The stability of the fractional order model is also proven by the $\\mathscr{P}$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:mi>P</mml:mi> </mml:math> -stable approach of the fixed point theorem. Also, the numerical simulations are performed via Laplace Adomian decomposition method to establish the dependence of the breast cancer dynamics on the order of the fractional derivatives. Based on the geometric results in the figures, we can conclude that the magnitude of the fractional order has a considerable impact on the days, which the maximum or minimum of the system solutions are reached, with a shift in the time at which this happens as the fractional order decreases from 1. However, it is obvious that the solutions of Caputo–Fabrizio fractional model approach the relevant results of the classical integer order system, when the fractional order approaches to 1.",

Additionally, the development of resistance by pests, as a result of adaptation to the environment, can impact the precision of pest control strategies. Hence we suggest implementing a nonlinear pulse state-dependent feedback control system, considering resource limitations, to investigate the influence of varying pesticide fatality rates on pest outbreaks. This paper takes into account the fear effect and anti-predator behavior to accurately portray the farmland ecosystem.

Remarkably, the system exhibited diverse bifurcation phenomena associated with pesticide-related parameters. Furthermore, the system demonstrated a multistability phenomenon involving the coexistence of the order-1 periodic solution and the limit cycle. This suggests that altering control strategies can disturb the initial coexistence status of pests and natural enemies. It also underscores that resource limitations can indeed impact the outbreak patterns and frequencies of pests. In addition to the variability in pesticide fatality rates, the inclusion of natural enemy releases in the nonlinear pulse strategy contributes to the model exhibiting complex dynamic characteristics. All these findings are substantiated by numerical simulations.",

We investigate a system of coupled differential equations, which contains the dynamics of the diffusion between infected and asymptomatic people. The consequence is accordingly connected with a macroscopic rule for the individuals. In this analysis, we utilize the concept of a fractional chain. This type of chain is a fractional differential–difference equation combining continuous and discrete variables. The existence of solutions is recognized by formulating a matrix theory.

The research indicates that the solution trajectories of the model ultimately stabilize either at the real equilibria or at pseudoequilibrium on the model’s switching surface.

In addition, we derive the exact expression of the probability density function of the stationary distribution by solving the corresponding Fokker–Planck equation under the condition of disease persistence and analyze the effects of random noises on stationary distribution characteristics and the disease extinction. Epidemiologically, the change of the concentration of air pollutants affects the conditions for disease extinction and persistence. The increase in the inflow of pollutants and the increase in the clearance rate have negative and positive impacts on the spread of diseases, respectively. We found that an increase in random noise intensity will increase the variance, reduce the kurtosis of distribution, which is not conducive to predicting and controlling the development status of the disease; however, large random noise intensity can also increase the probability of disease extinction and accelerates disease extinction. We further investigate the dynamic of the stochastic model, assuming that the inflow rate switches between two levels by numerical experiments. The results show that the random noise has a significant impact on disease extinction. The data fitting of the switching model shows that the model can effectively depict the relationship and changes in trends between air pollution and diseases.",

In this paper, we propose a fractional-order nonlinear mathematical model to describe the prelude of deteriorating quality of water cause of greenhouse gases on the population of aquatic animals. In the proposed system, we recall that greenhouse gases raise the temperature of water, and because of this reason, the dissolved oxygen level goes down, and also the rate of circulation of disintegrated oxygen by the aquatic animals rises, which causes a decrement in the density of aquatic species. We use a generalized form of the Caputo fractional derivative to describe the dynamics of the proposed problem. We also investigate equilibrium points of the given fractional-order model and discuss the asymptotic stability of the equilibria of the proposed autonomous model. We recall some important results to prove the existence of a unique solution of the model. For finding the numerical solution of the established fractional-order system, we apply a generalized predictor-corrector technique in the sense of proposed derivative and also justify the stability of the method.

In this paper, by assuming that the infection rate is affected by the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, we obtained a stochastic SIRV model.

Next, by creating an appropriate Lyapunov function, the existence of the stationary distribution for the model is proved. Further, the explicit expression for the probability density function of the model around the quasi-equilibrium point is obtained.

    "abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in Xinjiang, estimate the real-time reproduction number ( $R_{t}$ ) of HPV infection, evaluate the effectiveness of local prevention and control policies, and provide a theoretical basis for cervical cancer (CC) control strategies in the region. Methods: Using the R0 package, the R software was employed to estimate the dynamic changes in the real-time reproduction number ( $R_{t}$ ) of HPV infection in Xinjiang from January 2015 to December 2019. Four methods—Maximum Likelihood Estimation (ML), Exponential Growth (EG), Sequential Bayesian (SB), and Time-Dependent (TD)—were used to calculate the $R_{t}$ values. The study compared the results from these methods to determine the most reliable approach for estimating HPV transmission. Results: Among the four methods, the TD method provided the best fit for observed and predicted cases. The estimated overall $R_{t}$ was 1.1381 (95% CI: 1.0762–1.1972). For the periods 2015–2017 and 2017–2019, the $R_{t}$ values were 1.2827 and 1.0544, respectively. Notably, the Rt value showed a downward trend after 2017 but remained above 1, indicating continued transmission of HPV. Conclusion: Although HPV infection rates in Xinjiang appear to be decreasing, the persistent $R_{t}$ values suggest that HPV transmission has not been fully controlled. This highlights the urgent need for strengthened prevention and control measures to reduce HPV-related cervical cancer risk in the region.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Due to the combination of time delay and nonlocal reaction, which is more consistency with the reality of the interaction, we propose and investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of the delayed reaction–diffusion system with nonlocal effect. We first study the stability and the bifurcations of the constant steady state induced by diffusion and nonlocality. Meanwhile, we show the sufficient conditions that can lead to the occurrence of Hopf bifurcations, Turing bifurcations, double Hopf bifurcations, and Turing–Hopf bifurcations. Then we discuss the impact of the time delay on stability and bifurcation. By the method of a transcendental polynomial equation with second-order transcendental term we get the conditions of Hopf and Turing–Hopf bifurcations with respect to delay parameter. Subsequently, we give the normal form expression for Turing–Hopf bifurcation in the general delayed reaction–diffusion system with nonlocal effect. Finally, we apply the obtained results to the model and numerically illustrate the spatiotemporal patterns induced by Turing–Hopf bifurcation.",

The goal of this work is to establish links between the two by focusing on the most foundational scenario on both sides – the homogeneous diffusion setting. To this end, we study a denoising by inpainting (DbI) framework. It averages multiple inpainting results from different noisy subsets. We derive equivalence results between DbI on shifted regular grids and homogeneous diffusion filtering in 1D via an explicit relation between the density and the diffusion time. We also provide an empirical extension to the 2D case. We present experiments that confirm our theory and suggest that it can also be generalized to diffusions with nonhomogeneous data or nonhomogeneous diffusivities. More generally, our work demonstrates that the hardly explored idea of data adaptivity deserves more attention – it can be as powerful as some popular models with operator adaptivity.",

By transforming each affine function within the objective function of the GAMPP into a variable in outer space, the GAMPP is reformulated as an equivalent problem. Subsequently, the equivalent problem is relaxed into a series of linear relaxed problems, leveraging the properties of parabolic functions. Following the development of several branch reduction techniques, an outer space branch reduction bound algorithm is designed, which is based on the branch-and-bound framework and the relaxation methods. Additionally, the complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed alongside a convergence analysis.

    "abstract": "In recent decades, the sterile insect technique (SIT) and incompatible insect technique (IIT) have emerged as promising strategies for suppressing mosquitoes and controlling mosquito-borne diseases. To optimize these approaches and design cost-effective release strategies, mathematical models incorporating periodic switching and density-dependent survival probabilities have been developed to explore mosquito population dynamics. These models often exhibit rich and intricate behaviors. In this study, we introduce a periodically switched mosquito population suppression model that employs the Beverton–Holt-type survival probability, replacing the classic Ricker-type survival probability that increases the complexity of model dynamics. Through theoretical analyses and numerical simulations, we identify that the dynamical complexity observed in such models primarily stems from the interactions between wild and sterile mosquitoes, rather than the specific form of the survival probability. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to disentangle the dynamical complexity mechanisms in mosquito population models. These findings not only advance our understanding of density-dependent regulation but also provide actionable insights for optimizing SIT-based control strategies to achieve cost-efficient vector suppression.",

Developing a more comprehensive mathematical model is therefore essential for gaining deeper insights into the dynamics of HTLV-I transmission. This paper introduces an integrated model to study the infection dynamics of HTLV-I, aiming to address gaps in our understanding of its transmission mechanisms. Compared to previous studies, our model incorporates key advancements, including the consideration of immune delay caused by actively infected cells, the inclusion of stochastic effects among different cell types, and the comprehensive integration of cell-to-cell transmission mechanisms, making it more biologically realistic. By constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions, we establish relevant conditions and use them to prove the uniqueness, positivity, and global existence of solutions, the existence of a stationary Markov process, and the eventual extinction of latently and actively infected cells. To corroborate our theoretical results, we perform numerical simulations employing biologically relevant parameter values, which elucidate the influence of cell-to-cell transmission and critical parameters on the infection dynamics.",

The considered system exhibits significant distinctions from existing studies due to the presence of unknown dynamics, including time-varying control gain, parametric nonlinearities and external disturbances. Firstly, the issue of approximating unknown nonlinear functions is solved by utilizing the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) approximation technique. Moreover, adaptive laws for unknown parameters are designed based on adaptive estimation methods. Furthermore, the Nussbaum gain function (NGF) technique is also used to deal with the unknown time-varying control gain. Subsequently, an NN-based adaptive FTTC law is successfully developed to achieve the finite time convergence. The proposed control law guarantees that the system output tracks the given reference signal and the tracking error can converge to a small neighborhood of zero within a finite time, while also ensuring that all signals of the closed-loop system remain bounded. In the end, the effectiveness of the proposed control law is verified through two simulation examples.",

One of the significant tools to study operators is to utilize the convolution product. The dynamic techniques of convolution have attracted numerous complex analyses in current research. In this effort, an attempt is made by utilizing the said techniques to study a new linear complex operator connecting an incomplete beta function and a Hurwitz–Lerch zeta function of certain meromorphic functions. Furthermore, we employ a method based on the first-order differential subordination to derive new and better differential complex inequalities, namely differential subordinations.",

The optimal control theory is applied to the stochastic model, revealing some important new insights. Theoretical results are illustrated by way of simulations.",

In this study, we estimated the serial interval and reproductive number of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron B1.1.529 variation, which can serve as indicators of the transmission potential of the Omicron variant in Korea from November 25 to December 30, 2021. By examining 427 local omicron cases and constructing 65 transmission pairs, we estimated a mean continuous interval of 2.23 days and a mean number of regenerations of 1.30 for one of the kindergarten transmission chains using maximum likelihood estimation. Our research indicates that Omicron has a shorter serial interval, faster transmission, and greater immune evasion capacity than earlier variants. To effectively control community transmission of Omicron, it is necessary to rapidly track recent contacts, isolate asymptomatic individuals, adhere rigorously to public health policies, and enhance immunization efforts among teenagers. The retrospective analysis of the indexes may give us new guidance for the new infectious diseases in the future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, we propose an improved mathematical model that can describe bone remodeling. This process involves the activities of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes, and bone mass density. Bone remodeling is an important process that maintains bones in the human body by balancing formation and resorption. The proposed model is formulated as a system of differential equations that incorporate recruitment rates and porosity interaction. The local stability analysis was carried out using the Routh–Hurwitz criteria. The global stability analysis is conducted by using Lyapunov functions. The stability analysis provides the conditions for stable remodeling. Numerical simulations are illustrated to validate stability conditions and demonstrate the effects of parameter variations on cell populations and bone density. The results provide a framework for understanding bone-remodeling mechanisms and have potential applications for predicting bone health.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bacteria and other environmental entities pose constant threats to human health, often causing allergies and inflammation. The complement system (CS), a vital component of the immune system primarily found in the liver, acts as the first line of defense against such invaders. In response to a pathogenic invasion, the complement system rapidly initiates a series of events to mount a defense. While activated complement components can eliminate threats, not all activation leads to complete elimination; some prime the pathogen for a higher-order defense in a process known as opsonization. We propose a nonlinear deterministic ordinary differential equation model and use it to study the dynamics of activated complement system’s interaction with bacterial infection, focusing on key elements of complement-mediated attacks. We analyze the model, investigating the qualitative changes in the disease dynamics, as well as the quantitative changes in the level and severity of the infection, under parameter variation. Using different functional response functions, including the nonlinear Hill hazard function (HHF), we explore scenarios where the activated complement system interactions coexist with, or eliminate, the invading bacteria. From our results, we show that a robust complement system response can efficiently eliminate free-floating bacteria. In other scenarios, depending on the strength of the activated complement system, it can only slow the bacterial infection without eliminating it, while it can also be overwhelmed by the infection, highlighting the need for higher immune responses. Bifurcation points, where a change in the dynamics occurs as certain parameters are perturbed, are illustrated both analytically and numerically. The work presented is a first step in understanding the innate immune response as well as the adaptive immune response, when necessary, to disease infection.",

First, the existence and uniqueness of the global nonnegative solution of our model is obtained, which is the basis for the discussion of the dynamical behavior of the model. And then, we derive a sufficient condition for exponential extinction of infectious diseases. Furthermore, through constructing a Lyapunov function and using Fatou’s lemma, we obtain a sufficient criterion for the existence and ergodicity of a stationary distribution, which implies the persistence of the disease. In addition, the specific form of the density function of the model near the quasiendemic equilibrium is proposed by solving the corresponding Fokker–Planck equation and using some relevant algebraic equation theory. Finally, we explain the above theoretical results through some numerical simulations.",

The intricate interplay of these factors within social networks remains a puzzle yet to be unraveled. In this study, we conduct a stability analysis within a network-organized SIR model incorporating dual delays to explore the influence of direct and indirect incubation periods on disease spread. Additionally, we investigate how compound networks affect the critical incubation period. Our findings reveal several vital insights. First, by examining crossing curves and the dispersion equation, we establish the conditions for Turing instability and delineate the stable regions associated with dual delays. Second, we ascertain that the critical incubation value exhibits an inverse relationship with a network's eigenvalues, indicating that the Laplacian matrix does not solely dictate periodic behavior in the context of delays. Furthermore, our study elucidates the impact of delays and networks on pattern formation, revealing distinct pattern types across different regions. Specifically, our observations suggest that effectively curtailing the spread of infectious diseases during an outbreak is more achievable when the incubation period for indirect contact is shorter and for direct contact is longer. Namely, our network framework enables regulation of the optimal combination of $(\\tau _{1},\\tau _{2})$ to mitigate the risk of infectious diseases. In summary, our results offer valuable theoretical insights that can inform strategies for preventing and managing infectious diseases.",

    "abstract": "Emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, manifest in outbreaks of varying magnitudes. For large-scale epidemics, continuous models are often employed for forecasting, while discrete models are preferred for smaller outbreaks. We propose a discrete susceptible-infected-susceptible model that integrates interaction between parasitism and hosts, as well as saturation recovery mechanisms, and undertake a thorough theoretical and numerical exploration of this model. Theoretically, the model incorporating nonlinear recovery demonstrates complex behavior, including backward bifurcations and the coexistence of dual equilibria. And the sufficient conditions that guarantee the global asymptotic stability of a disease-free equilibrium have been obtained. Considering the challenges posed by saturation recovery in theoretical analysis, we then consider the case of linear recovery. Bifurcation analysis for of the linear recovery model displays a variety of bifurcations at the endemic equilibrium, such as transcritical, flip, and Neimark–Sacker bifurcations. Numerical simulations reveal complex dynamic behavior, including backward and fold bifurcations, periodic windows, period-doubling cascades, and multistability. Moreover, the proposed model could be used to fit the daily COVID-19 reported cases for various regions, not only revealing the significant advantages of discrete models in fitting, evaluating, and predicting small-scale epidemics, but also playing an important role in evaluating the effectiveness of prevention and control strategies. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses for the key parameters underscore their significant impact on the effective reproduction number during the initial months of an outbreak, advocating for better medical resource allocation and the enforcement of social distancing measures to curb disease transmission.",

The first model to be defined is the usceptible-Isolated-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SAIRD) epidemics model and then the S-A-I-R-D-Information Index (SAIRDM) model that corresponds to coupling the SAIRD model with the negative feedback. Controlling the information about nonpharmaceutical interventions is considered by the addition of a new variable that measures how the behavioral changes about isolation influence pandemics. An analytic expression of a replacement ratio that depends on the absence of the negative feedback is determined. The results obtained show that the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium is determined by the value of a certain threshold parameter called the basic reproductive number R0 and the local stability of the free disease equilibrium depends on the replacement ratios. A Hopf bifurcation is analytically verified for the delay parameter. The qualitative analysis shows that the feedback information index promotes more changes to the propagation of the disease than other parameters. Finally, the sensitivity analysis and simulations show the efficiency of the infection rate of the information index on an epidemics model with nonpharmaceutical interventions.",

The quartic Catmull–Rom spline owns shape adjustability based on inheriting the features of the cubic Catmull–Rom spline. Some modeling examples show that the shape of the quartic Catmull–Rom spline can realize both global adjustment and local adjustment by changing the free parameters. In addition, we give three schemes for optimizing the shape of the quartic Catmull–Rom spline, which can generate the spline with minimal internal energy, the shape-preserving spline, and the monotonicity-preserving spline. Numerical examples indicate that the proposed schemes are effective and the quartic Catmull–Rom spline is more practical than the cubic Catmull–Rom spline in data interpolation.",

The proposed technique is used to investigate the effects of Gaussian white-noise and Gaussian colored-noise perturbations on the potential source and resistance in fractional stochastic electrical circuits. The proposed method’s robustness and efficiency were demonstrated by comparing its results to those of the stochastic Runge–Kutta method (SRK). The valuable point in this article is that the resulting numerical scheme is able to combine two powerful methods that can be extended into more complex stochastic models. The comparison of different fractional derivatives using Mathematica 12 software has been obtained and the simulation results demonstrate the merit of the contributed method.",

We emulate local assembly structures of the surrogates and thus only require a moderately sized network that can be trained efficiently in an offline phase. This enables large compression ratios and the online computation of a surrogate based on simple forward passes through the network is substantially accelerated compared to classical numerical upscaling approaches.

Mellin transform methods are mainly used to find the pricing formula, and explicit formula for the option price is derived as an integral equation representation. The formula has two free boundaries which are represented by the coupled integral equations. We propose the numerical scheme based on recursive integration method to implement the integral equations and show that our approach with the proposed numerical scheme is accurate and efficient in computing the prices.

The nonlinear anisotropic diffusion equations, specially Perona–Malik model, are powerful tools that improve the quality of the image by removing noise while preserving details and edges. In this paper, we propose a powerful and accurate local meshless algorithm to solve the time-fractional Perona–Malik model which has an adjustable fractional derivative making the control of the diffusion process more convenient than the classical one. In order to overcome the complexities of the problem, a suitable combination of the compactly supported radial basis function method and operator splitting technique is proposed to convert a complex time-fractional partial differential equation into sparse linear algebraic systems that standard solvers can solve. The numerical results of classical and fractional models are explored in different metrics to demonstrate the proposed scheme’s effectiveness. The numerical experiments confirm that the method is suitable to denoise digital images and show that the fractional derivative increases the model’s ability to remove noise in images.",

    "abstract": "Abstract It is widely accepted that financial data exhibit a long-memory property or a long-range dependence. In a continuous-time situation, the geometric fractional Brownian motion is an important model to characterize the long-memory property in finance. This paper thus considers the problem to estimate all unknown parameters in geometric fractional Brownian processes based on discrete observations. The estimation procedure is built upon the marriage between the bipower variation and the least-squares estimation. However, unlike the commonly used approximation of the likelihood and transition density methods, we do not require a small sampling interval. The strong consistency of these proposed estimators can be established as the sample size increases to infinity in a chosen sampling interval. A simulation study is also conducted to assess the performance of the derived method by comparing with two existing approaches proposed by Misiran et al. (International Conference on Optimization and Control 2010, pp. 573–586, 2010) and Xiao et al. (J. Stat. Comput. Simul. 85(2):269–283, 2015), respectively. Finally, we apply the proposed estimation approach in the analysis of Chinese financial markets to show the potential applications in realistic contexts.",

The first result provides a sufficient condition for forward invariance of a set under discrete dynamical systems of specific type, namely time-reversible ones. The condition involves only the boundary of the set. It is a discrete analog of the widely used tangent condition for continuous systems ( viz. the vector field points either inwards or is tangent to the boundary of the set). The second result is nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) scheme for dynamical systems defined by systems of ordinary differential equations. The NSFD scheme preserves the hyperbolic equilibria of the continuous system as well as their stability. Further, the scheme is time reversible and, through the first result, inherits from the continuous model the forward invariance of the domain. We show that the scheme is of second order, thereby solving a pending problem on the construction of higher-order nonstandard schemes without spurious solutions. It is shown that the new scheme applies directly for mass action-based models of biological and chemical processes. The application of these results, including some numerical simulations for invariant sets, is exemplified on a general Susceptible-Infective-Recovered/Removed (SIR)-type epidemiological model, which may have arbitrary large number of infective or recovered/removed compartments.",

Similar to the deferred or error correction techniques, a provisional solution of the ODE is preferentially calculated by any lower-order scheme to satisfy given initial conditions, and the corresponding error is investigated by fully connected neural networks and structured to obtain sufficient magnitude of the error. Numerical examples are illustrated to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.",

This study considers the Rabinovich system through Caputo and Atangana–Baleanu fractional derivatives to detect its chaotic nature. First, the existence and uniqueness of the solutions of the fractional-order systems are proved using the combination of the Picard–Lindelöf theorem and the Banach contraction principle. Then, a numerical approximation of the fractional systems is developed. The fractional Rabinovich system is found to exhibit a chaotic behavior verified via Lyapunov exponents. However, the fractional-order models do not enter into chaotic behavior at the same fractional-derivative order. Bifurcation diagrams referring to variation of the fractional-order derivatives are provided. Chaotic attractors for both cases of the fractional-derivative representation of the system are depicted. The two fractional-order models of the system show sensitivity to initial conditions. A master–response synchronization was developed in the context of the Atangana–Baleanu fractional derivative. The master and the response systems showed a strong correlation, proving the system’s applicability in solving real problems, including secure communications.",

Considering the intrinsic stochasticity in the involving biochemical reactions, a general chemical master equation model for describing the process from oligomer production to fibril formation is established, and then the lower-order statistical moments of different molecule species are captured by the derivative matching closed system, and the long-time accuracy is verified using the Gillespie algorithm. It is revealed that the aggregation of monomers into oligomers is highly dependent on the initial number of misfolded monomers; the formation of oligomers can be effectively inhibited by reducing the misfolding rate, the primary nucleation rate, elongation rate, and secondary nucleation rate; as the conversion rate decreases, the number of oligomers increases over a long time scale. In particular, sensitivity analysis shows that the quantities of oligomers are more sensitive to monomer production and protein misfolding; the secondary nucleation is more important than the primary nucleation in oligomer formation. These findings are helpful for understanding and predicting the dynamic mechanism of amyloid aggregation from the viewpoint of quantitative analysis.",

Noteworthy, people are usually concerned about the mutual influences between two families of respiratory viruses, like co-circulation or co-infection. We fitted a unified model to weekly reported severe COVID-19 cases and the confirmed influenza A laboratory cases in HKSAR, respectively, using the R package POMP to obtain the best fitting and parameter estimates. The reconstructed transmission rates of the COVID-19 (/influenza A) versus the weekly reported influenza A (/COVID-19) confirmations between April 2022 and April 2024 were also compared. Our numerical results suggest that influenza confirmations remained either at a very low level or were absent before 2023, while starting from 2023, the influenza epidemic re-emerged as expected because of the resumption of international travels and other social communications. Besides, the peak of influenza cases in April 2023 favored the form of the peak of COVID-19 between May–June, 2023. Additionally, during the sudden abolishment of the zero-case policy in mainland China (December 2022 to January 2023), we estimated that there were approximately 381 cases imported from mainland China into HKSAR. We estimated the potential number of imported COVID-19 severe cases from mainland China to Hong Kong and revealed some potential population-level interference between the two families of respiratory viruses.",

In the current digital age, the widespread application of online social networks has accelerated the dissemination of information regarding these diseases, influencing the interplay between disease spread and information diffusion. To address this, we propose the $UAU$ – $SEPIR$ model, a novel two-layered network propagation model inspired by the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. This model, constructed using a micro-Markov-chain approach, features an upper layer for information diffusion (the $UAU$ model) and a lower layer for disease propagation (the $SEPIR$ model). We derive the epidemic threshold, which is influenced by the dynamics of information diffusion, the network topology of disease spread, and the pathways from exposed to infected to recovered individuals. Through extensive random simulations, we confirmed the validity of our model. The research findings reveal that both model parameters and network topology play crucial roles in shaping the interaction between information diffusion and disease spread. Additionally, in random networks, adaptive behavior of individuals significantly enhances the inhibition of disease transmission. Overall, Our study provides theoretical insights into the interplay between social-network dynamics and the early outbreak stages, offering valuable support for disease prevention and control strategies.",

We prove well-posedness of the model and existence of optimal controls that minimize dangerous contacts. Then we study, in a two-step procedure, the mean-field limit as the number of commercial ships and pirate ships is large, deriving a mean-field PDE/PDE/ODE model. Via Γ-convergence, we study the limit of the corresponding optimal control problems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We consider the optimal control problem for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with random coefficients under the recursive-type objective functional captured by the backward SDE (BSDE). Due to the random coefficients, the associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation is a class of second-order stochastic PDEs (SPDEs) driven by Brownian motion, which we call the stochastic HJB (SHJB) equation. In addition, as we adopt the recursive-type objective functional, the drift term of the SHJB equation depends on the second component of its solution. These two generalizations cause several technical intricacies, which do not appear in the existing literature. We prove the dynamic programming principle (DPP) for the value function, for which unlike the existing literature we have to use the backward semigroup associated with the recursive-type objective functional. By the DPP, we are able to show the continuity of the value function. Using the Itô–Kunita’s formula, we prove the verification theorem, which constitutes a sufficient condition for optimality and characterizes the value function, provided that the smooth (classical) solution of the SHJB equation exists. In general, the smooth solution of the SHJB equation may not exist. Hence, we study the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the SHJB equation under two different weak solution concepts. First, we show, under appropriate assumptions, the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution via the Sobolev space technique, which requires converting the SHJB equation to a class of backward stochastic evolution equations. The second result is obtained under the notion of viscosity solutions, which is an extension of the classical one to the case for SPDEs. Using the DPP and the estimates of BSDEs, we prove that the value function is the viscosity solution to the SHJB equation. For applications, we consider the linear-quadratic problem, the utility maximization problem, and the European option pricing problem. Specifically, different from the existing literature, each problem is formulated by the generalized recursive-type objective functional and is subject to random coefficients. By applying the theoretical results of this paper, we obtain the explicit optimal solution for each problem in terms of the solution of the corresponding SHJB equation.",

Moreover, we choose the stepsize of our algorithm which is independent on the Lipschitz constant of the gradient of the objective function by using a linesearch technique, and then a weak convergence result of the proposed algorithm is analyzed.

Through the way, the left and right Caputo fractional derivatives operational matrices for these polynomials are derived. Based on the Pontryagin maximum principle, the necessary optimality conditions for this problem reduce into a two-point boundary value problem. The main and efficient characteristic behind the proposed method is to convert the problem under consideration into a system of algebraic equations which reduces many computational costs and CPU time. To demonstrate the efficiency, applicability, and simplicity of the proposed method, several examples are solved, and the obtained results are compared with those obtained with other methods.",

We show that RNNs retain a partial signature of the paths they are fed as the unique information exploited for training and classification tasks. We argue that these RNNs are easy to train and robust and support these observations with numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data.

The consequence system of nonlinear equations typically trades with high computation burden. This dilemma can be overcome by establishing a fast numerical algorithm procedure without a reduction of numerical accuracy. The proposed algorithm forms a linear system with constant coefficient matrix at each time step and produces numerical solutions, which remarkably gains many computational advantages. In terms of analysis, a priori estimation for the numerical solution is derived to obtain the convergence and stability analysis. Additionally, the algorithm is globally mass preserving to avoid nonphysical behavior. Two benchmarks, including a single solitary wave to both equations, are given to validate the applicability and accuracy of the proposed method. Numerical results are obtained and compared to other approaches available in the literature. From the comparisons it is clear that the proposed approach produces accurate and precise results at low computational cost. Besides, the proposed scheme is applied to study the effect of the viscous term on a single solitary wave. It is shown that the viscous term results in the amplitude and width of the initial condition but not in its velocities in the case of a single solitary wave. As a consequence, theoretical and numerical findings provide a new area to investigate and expand the high-order algorithm for the family of wave equations.",

However, in terms of change-points, there is still a lack of epidemiological studies on the incidence of HPV infection and CC in Xinjiang,China. This research aims to identify significant changes in the trends of HPV infection and CC prevalence in Xinjiang through change-point analysis (CPA) to provide scientific guidance to health authorities. HPV infection and CC time-series data (from January 2011 to December 2019) were collected and analyzed. Meanwhile, their change-points were detected with binary segmentation method and the PELT method. Furthermore, patients were assigned into three groups based on their different ages and subsequently subjected to an analysis employing a segmented regression model (SRM). It was evident that for the monthly HPV time series, the binary segmentation method detected three change points in August 2015, February 2016, and September 2017 (with the most HPV cases). In contrast, the PELT method detected two change-points in September 2015 and April 2017 (with the most HPV cases). For the monthly CC time series, the binary segmentation method identified two change points in October 2012 and August 2019 (with the most CC cases), whereas the PELT method identified three change points in October 2012, August 2019 (with the most CC cases), and October 2019. The SRM demonstrated varying numbers of change points in distinct groups, with HPV infection and CC having the higher growth rate in the 30–49 and 40–59 age groups, respectively. Based on above results, this research was conductive to comprehending the epidemiology of HPV infection and CC in Xinjiang. In addition, it offered scientific guidance for future prevention and management measures for both HPV infection and CC.",

The model includes the implementation of vaccination measures for susceptible, and treatment and quarantine measures for infected in order to control the spread of the disease. The optimal control strategies for the spread of disease are mainly investigated. Our research focuses on four main aspects. Firstly, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the global positive strong solution to the control system by employing the theories of semigroups of operators. Secondly, we demonstrate the existence of optimal control through the utilization of functional analysis techniques. Thirdly, we establish the first-order necessary optimality conditions that the optimal control must satisfy, employing the methods of convex perturbation. Lastly, we provide numerical examples and simulations to verify the feasibility of optimal control.",

With no resistant commercial citrus varieties or curable chemicals currently available, HLB remains the top threat to the world citrus industry. In this paper, two dynamic models of citrus HLB are proposed based on the preference and diffusion of citrus psyllids. The first model is a single-patch model of HLB with vector preference. The basic reproduction number of the model is calculated, and dynamic properties of the single-patch model, including the existence and local stability of the disease-free equilibrium, are analyzed. By sensitivity analysis, the parameters that have a significant impact on the basic reproduction number are identified. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate that the preference of citrus psyllids is not conducive to disease prevention. Considering the diffusion of citrus psyllids between two patches, a two-patch diffusion model of HLB with preference is formulated. The global basic reproduction number of the diffusion model is determined, and the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium is established under certain conditions. Finally, numerical simulation results explore how the preference behavior of the vector and the coupling strength between two patches affect the HLB transmission.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, we consider the stochastic optimal control problem for jump-diffusion models with state constraints. In general, the value function of such problems is the discontinuous viscosity solution of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation since the regularity cannot be guaranteed at the boundary of the state constraint. By adapting the stochastic target theory, we obtain an equivalent representation of the original value function by means of the backward reachable set. We then show that this backward reachable can be characterized by the zero-level set of the auxiliary value function for the unconstrained stochastic control problem, which includes two additional unbounded controls as a consequence of the martingale representation theorem. We prove that the auxiliary value function is the unique continuous viscosity solution of the associated HJB equation, which is the second-order nonlinear partial integro-differential equation (PIDE). Our paper provides an explicit way to characterize the original (possibly discontinuous) value function as a zero-level set of the continuous solution of the auxiliary HJB equation. The proof of the existence and uniqueness requires a new technique due to the unbounded control sets and the presence of the singularity of the corresponding Lévy measure in the nonlocal operator of the HJB equation.",

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have implemented nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including national workplace and school closures, personal protection, social distancing, contact tracing, testing, home quarantine, and isolation. To evaluate the effectiveness of these NPIs in mitigating the spread of early COVID-19 and predict the epidemic trend in the United Kingdom, we developed a compartmental model to mimic the transmission with time-varying transmission rate, contact rate, disease-induced mortality rate, proportion of quarantined close contacts, and hospitalization rate. The model was fitted to the number of confirmed new cases and daily number of deaths in five stages with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. We quantified the effectiveness of NPIs and found that if the transmission rate, contact rate, and hospitalization rate were approximately equal to those in the second stage of the most strict NPIs, and the proportion of quarantined close contacts increased by 3%, then the epidemic would die out as early as January 12, 2021, with around 1,533,000 final cumulative number of confirmed cases, and around 55,610 final cumulative number of deaths.",

To overcome this difficulty, we consider the relaxed model, in which admissible controls are measure-valued processes and the relaxed state process is governed by a stochastic differential equation driven by a continuous orthogonal martingale measure. This relaxed model admits an optimal control that can be approximated by a sequence of strict controls by the so-called chattering lemma. We establish optimality necessary conditions, in terms of two adjoint processes, extending Peng’s maximum principle to relaxed control problems. We show that relaxing the drift and diffusion martingale parts directly as in deterministic control does not lead to a true relaxed model as the obtained controlled dynamics is not continuous in the control variable.",

Multi-scale features are first extracted from the input point cloud using dense map convolution with different expansion rates, and the pyramid pooling module and self-attention mechanism are added. By applying the same pooling operation to regions of different sizes and numbers, the network is made to accept inputs of arbitrary size. Self-attention is used to weight the features to establish global correlation and improve the feature extraction capability. The features are then extended by the Self-Attention NodeShuffle (SA-NS) module, which uses a graph convolution layer to fuse neighbour information and learn new point features from the latent space. Finally, the coordinate reconstruction module is used to generate a dense up-sampled point cloud. Using the existing dataset to train and test the network and compare it with the existing up-sampling network, the experimental results show that PPSA-PU is better in terms of evaluation metrics and performance, and has better generalisation and robustness.",

The calculations were performed on a worked example: the fluorescence of a single two-level atom pumped by a resonant laser field. This pump laser is described classically (by a function, not an operator). Our aim is first to built a Kolmogorov-type equation (K-equation) for the atomic state, so that the two parameters θ , φ that define this density matrix are random functions of time, therefore the atomic density matrix is a random density matrix. Such an approach, initiated for gas kinetics, was not yet applied to quantum phenomena, whereas it is especially tailored to very quick events well separated (in time) like the quantum jumps observed in spontaneous emission of photons by an atom. Here, we try to clarify the basis of our statistical approach leading to the K-equation below, and we present the main results deduced from it. We explain finally that our approach can be interpreted in terms of Everett’s theory of many-worlds, because at every emission a new history begins for the atom, with two nonoverlapping wave functions.",

Then, an appropriate sliding mode control law is proposed to satisfy the reachability condition. On this basis, the ISS criterion for the sliding mode dynamics (SMDs) is given, and the controller gain matrix is also obtained.

This can drastically reduce the computational cost of determining the departure point. Then, we solve the derived system reflected by the single virtual characteristic curve. Moreover, an efficient strategy for the derived linear system of equations is provided. Four examples are tested to demonstrate the adaptability and efficiency of the proposed method. The test results show that the proposed method has third- and fourth-order accuracy in time and space, respectively. In addition, compared with the existing method of solving the problem along two particles with different velocities, we confirm that the proposed method significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining accuracy well.",

The center manifold theorem and bifurcation theory are used to show that the model can undergo flip and Hopf bifurcations. Codimension-two bifurcation associated with 1:2 resonance is analyzed by applying the bifurcation theory. Numerical simulations are performed not only to verify the correctness of theoretical analysis but to explore complex dynamical behaviors such as period-6, 7, 10, 12 orbits, a cascade of period-doubling, quasi-periodic orbits, and the chaotic sets. The maximum Lyapunov exponents validate the chaotic dynamical behaviors of the system. The feedback control method is considered to stabilize the chaotic orbits. These complex dynamical behaviors imply that the coexistence of predator and prey may produce very complex patterns.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A classic approach for solving differential equations with neural networks builds upon neural forms, which employ the differential equation with a discretisation of the solution domain. Making use of neural forms for time-dependent differential equations, one can apply the recently developed method of domain segmentation. That is, the domain may be split into several subdomains, on which the optimisation problem is solved. In classic adaptive numerical methods, the mesh as well as the domain may be refined or decomposed, in order to improve the accuracy. Also, the degree of approximation accuracy may be adapted. Therefore, it is desirable to transfer such important and successful strategies to the field of neural-network-based solutions. In the presented work, we propose a novel adaptive neural approach to meet this aim for solving time-dependent problems. To this end, each subdomain is reduced in size until the optimisation is resolved up to a predefined training accuracy. In addition, while the neural networks employed are by default small, we propose a means to adjust also the number of neurons in an adaptive way. We introduce conditions to automatically confirm the solution reliability and optimise computational parameters whenever it is necessary. Results are provided for several initial-value problems that illustrate important computational properties of the method.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The recently derived Hybrid-Incidence Susceptible-Transmissible-Removed (HI-STR) prototype is a deterministic compartment model for epidemics and an alternative to the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model. The HI-STR predicts that pathogen transmission depends on host population characteristics including population size, population density and social behaviour common within that population. The HI-STR prototype is applied to the ancestral Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) to show that the original estimates of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) basic reproduction number $\\mathcal{R}_{0}$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>R</mml:mi> <mml:mn>0</mml:mn> </mml:msub> </mml:math> for the United Kingdom (UK) could have been projected onto the individual states of the United States of America (USA) prior to being detected in the USA. The Imperial College London (ICL) group’s estimate of $\\mathcal{R}_{0}$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>R</mml:mi> <mml:mn>0</mml:mn> </mml:msub> </mml:math> for the UK is projected onto each USA state. The difference between these projections and the ICL’s estimates for USA states is either not statistically significant on the paired Student t -test or not epidemiologically significant. The SARS-CoV2 Delta variant’s $\\mathcal{R}_{0}$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>R</mml:mi> <mml:mn>0</mml:mn> </mml:msub> </mml:math> is also projected from the UK to the USA to prove that projection can be applied to a Variant of Concern (VOC). Projection provides both a localised baseline for evaluating the implementation of an intervention policy and a mechanism for anticipating the impact of a VOC before local manifestation.",

Thirdly, we can see that the proposed scheme is unconditionally energy-stable by defining the modified energy and selecting the appropriate parameters.

In contrast to some existing results, the impulsive moments are determined by preset events, i.e., the event-triggered mechanism is used. Based on the fractional-order Lyapunov stability theory and fractional-order differential inequality, the quasiconsensus criteria are derived; furthermore, the prescribed error bound is given. Then, Zeno behavior for the considered event-triggered control method is excluded. Finally, numerical examples are given to shown the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

More precisely, we treat the space-periodic case in three space dimensions and consider a full discretization in which the classical Crank–Nicolson method ( θ -method with $\\theta =1/2$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:mi>θ</mml:mi> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mo>/</mml:mo> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn> </mml:math> ) is used to discretize the time variable. In contrast, in the space variables, we consider finite elements. The convective term is discretized in several implicit, semi-implicit, and explicit ways. In particular, we focus on proving (possibly conditional) convergence of the discrete solutions toward weak solutions (satisfying a precise local energy balance) without extra regularity assumptions on the limit problem. We do not prove orders of convergence, but our analysis identifies some numerical schemes, providing alternate proofs of the existence of “physically relevant” solutions in three space dimensions.",
