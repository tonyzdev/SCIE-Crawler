    "abstract": "Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic skin disease affecting hair follicles in intertriginous areas, characterized by deep, recurrent, painful nodules and abscesses, fistulae, sinus tracts, and scarring. With a prevalence of 1-4%, HS is not an uncommon disease. Several risk factors have been linked with the development of HS, such as genetic predisposition, smoking, and obesity, leading to the hypothesis that HS develops as a result of environmental triggers in a genetically susceptible individual. Smoking has been recognized as one of the environmental factors with the most impact on HS. This review aims to provide a comprehensive and holistic view on how smoking habits affect the incidence, severity, treatment, and pathophysiology of HS. A growing body of published literature has reported the association between smoking and HS, despite limitations in proving the causal relationship due to the retrospective design of the available studies. There is a consensus that patients with HS who are active smokers have a higher number of affected body areas than patients with HS who do not smoke or have stopped smoking. Similarly, it is recommended for patients with HS to discontinue tobacco use because of its association with weaker treatment response. Studies on the pathophysiological mechanism of smoking on the skin show that tobacco smoke with many of its chemicals as well as nicotine promote the proinflammatory cytokines found in HS lesions, activate the nicotinic acetylcholine (nAChRs) and aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AHRs), and further suppress Notch signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Umbilical endometriosis has an estimated incidence of 0.5%-1% of all patients with endometrial ectopia. It is a very rare disease, but should be considered on the differential diagnosis of umbilical lesions. We report on a case of spontaneous umbilical endometriosis in a 38-year-old woman, with a dark brown nodule periodically bleeding, associated with severe abdominal pain. There was no history of endometriosis and she had not been pregnant before. Laparoscopic visualization of pelvic cavity showed bilateral ovarian endometrioma (it was removed while sparing the ovaries). Surgical treatment proved effective. Cutaneous endometriosis could be a sign of internal endometriosis. Presentations may be atypical and pose diagnostic difficulty, mimicking other acute diseases, e.g., skin neoplasm, folliculitis, etc., but it should be suspected in any female presenting with a painful or bleeding mass close to the umbilicus or abdominal surgical scar.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis is often difficult. Even though most cutaneous lesions will heal spontaneously, their duration cannot be predicted in an individual case. In general, only large, multiple or diffuse lesions of the face, head and neck need to be considered for therapeutic intervention. Pentavalent antimonials (sodium stibogluconate and meglumine antimoniate) administered intralesionally or parenterally (IM or IV) are the mainstays of systemic therapy despite the toxicity associated with their use. The objective of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy of intramuscular pentavalent antimonial compound meglumine antimoniate alone and in combination with intralesional therapy in the treatment of Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis. Study was conducted as a case controlled interventional prospective study. On the basis of demonstration of Leishmania tropica (LT) bodies in the skin slit smears/skin biopsies, 60 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis were included in the study. The patients were randomly allocated to three groups of 20 patients each: group 1 treated with intramuscular injection of meglumine antimoniate (20 mg Sb/kg/day, maximum 850 mg) for 21 days; group 2 treated with intralesional injection of meglumine antimoniate (0.5 mL, 42.5 mg of Sb) into each lesion along with intramuscular injection of meglumine antimoniate (20 mg Sb/kg/day, maximum 850 mg) for 21 days; and group 3 as a control group. The patients were followed-up for therapeutic safety and efficacy at 10, 20 and 90 days. The rate of complete cure was 55% in group 1, 75% in group 2 and 10% of spontaneous cure cases in group 3. The conclusions derived from this study are limited by the relatively small number of patients. The combination of intramuscular meglumine antimoniate along with intralesional administration of the agent is superior therapy to intralesional administration of meglumine antimoniate alone.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin D exerts its physiological functions on calcium and bone metabolism in humans through the active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25(OH)2D3). The other spectrum of vitamin D activities includes important effects on cellular proliferation, differentiation and the immune system. These effects are mediated through the intracellularly located vitamin D receptor (VDR). VDR is a member of the steroid, estrogen and retinoid receptor gene family of proteins that mediate transcriptional activities of the respective ligands. The VDR complex binds in the nucleus to the vitamin D responsive element on the gene. Several polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene have been described including FokI in exon 2, BsmI and ApaI in intron 8 and TaqI in exon 9. Alterations in vitamin D-1,25 (OH)2D3 levels and polymorphisms of VDR gene have been shown to be associated with several malignant or autoimmune diseases such as sclerosis multiplex, breast cancer, diabetes mellitus, malignant melanoma, and psoriasis vulgaris. The effects of VDR gene polymorphisms including immunomodulation, stimulation of cellular differentiation and inhibition of proliferation make it a possible candidate for therapy of psoriasis as well as for the psoriasis gene modification. The objective of this article is to present the state-of-the-art in the VDR gene polymorphism research in psoriasis vulgaris.",

    "abstract": "Our aim was to draw attention of clinicians, dermatovenereologists and ophthalmologists to the possible association of vitiligo and ocular findings characteristic of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). According to our clinical experience, POAG is relatively often diagnosed or previously diagnosed in patients treated for vitiligo. We found no literature report directly connecting vitiligo and POAG. The articles mentioning glaucoma, i.e. increased intraocular pressure (IOP), are mainly based on secondary type of glaucoma as a direct consequence of vitiligo treated by corticosteroids. On the other hand, there is a substantial number of articles elaborating the association of vitiligo with ocular findings in known clinical syndromes. During a 2-year period, from May 2007 to May 2009, 42 patients with vitiligo were examined at University Department of Dermatology and Venereology and referred for previously appointed ophthalmologic examination at University Department of Ophthalmology, Split University Hospital Center. All patients with vitiligo underwent complete ophthalmologic examination including visual field analysis, in order to treat and follow up or diagnose newly discovered POAG. Of 42 patients with vitiligo suspect of glaucoma, POAG was confirmed in 24 (57%) patients. Age median of all vitiligo patients was 56 (range 19-82) years. In patients with vitiligo and glaucoma, the duration of vitiligo was twofold that recorded in patients with vitiligo alone, the difference being statistically significant (z=3.3; P<0.001). The risk of developing glaucoma in vitiligo patients was 4.4-fold in >56 age group versus <56 age group and 3.5-fold in patients with >13 year versus patients with <13 year duration of vitiligo. Multivariate logistic regression for glaucoma development according to vitiligo duration (< or =13 years vs. > or =13 years) and patient age (< or =56 years vs. > or =56 years) pointed to the association of glaucoma development and age and yielded a 92% probability for the association of glaucoma development and vitiligo duration. Therefore, we believe that patients treated for vitiligo should regularly undergo complete ophthalmologic examination with special attention paid to POAG irrespective of age, sex, severity, localization and duration of the disease. Although performed in a relatively small sample and over short period of time, the results of this pilot study demonstrated that this association was not accidental. Additional studies in a greater sample of vitiligo patients and POAG are expected to provide definitive answers and conclusion on the association of these two diseases.",

Unstimulated whole saliva was collected and analyzed by using electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. History data, subjective complaints and objective findings on oral mucosa were recorded. The concentration of metal ions was investigated in correlation to burning mouth syndrome, erythema of oral mucosa, pH and smoking habit. Results showed a higher Ni concentration in patients with metal restorations, especially wearers of predominantly base metal appliances. The concentration of Cr showed no difference between patient groups. Although burning mouth syndrome was more frequent in the group with dental casting alloys, there was no correlation between higher Ni and Cr concentrations and burning mouth syndrome. Erythema of oral mucosa was a common finding in study patients, but did not correlate with salivary Ni and Cr ion concentrations. Salivary Ni and Cr concentrations were not related to either pH or smoking habit.",

In most patients, genital lesions are asymptomatic; however, bleeding, dyspareunia and other symptoms have been described. We report a case of a 45-year-old woman with numerous blue-to-red, scaly papules that spread over the entire area of both labia majora. The patient reported occasional pruritus and burning sensations, discomfort during the intercourse, and significant psychological burden. Histopathologic analysis of the lesion confirmed the diagnosis of angiokeratoma, and all lesions were electrocauterized under local anesthesia. The results of the treatment were very satisfactory, with no side effects or complications. During one-year follow-up, no relapses were noted and the patient remained asymptomatic. Therefore, dermatovenereologists should be aware of angiokeratomas and respective therapeutic options when examining a patient with pruritic, painful, or bleeding lesions in the genital region.",

    "abstract": "Athletes practicing and competing outdoors are exposed to considerable UV radiation and at an increased risk for the development of UV-related skin conditions, including skin cancer. Risk factors for skin cancer include genetics, immune status, and particularly UV radiation. Independent factors, such as phototype, family or personal history of melanoma, number of nevi, atypical nevi and solar lentigines, as well as sunburn history are also important risk indicators for skin cancer, especially melanoma (1-3). Additionally, exercise-induced immunosuppression may contribute to the development of skin cancers (4). To the best of our knowledge, only one article has been previously published analyzing the effects of UV exposure in triathlon athletes (5). Our aim was to analyze sun protection habits of athletes competing in the Croatian Olympic and Super Sprint triathlon and screen them for skin cancer and other skin lesions. Participants completed a questionnaire consisting of questions regarding personal and family history, phenotypic characteristics, training habits, and sunlight-related risk factors. Additionally, a total body skin examination was performed by a board-certified dermatologist. Skin type, number of melanocytic nevi, presence of atypical nevi, solar lentigines, as well as suspicious lesions were recorded (Figure 1). The study population consisted of 95 participants, 65 (68%) men and 30 (32%) women. Approximately 30% of participants spent 4 to 6 hours per week outdoors, while 21% spent more than 10 hours outdoors per week. Regarding sun protection habits, more than 90% of participants stated it was important to use sunscreen, however, almost 50% rarely used sunscreen while training, 27% frequently used sunscreen, while only 3% always used sunscreen. A staggering 20% of participants never used sunscreen. Unsurprisingly, almost a third of the athletes (26%) reported previously having severe sunburns with blisters. Almost 10% reported a positive family history of melanoma and one reported positive personal history of melanoma. Skin examinations revealed that nearly half of the participants (46%) had solar lentigines, 25% had atypical nevi, while 2 participants presented with actinically damaged skin and 2 participants with actinic keratoses. The majority of the triathletes (around 57%) had less than 20 nevi on their skin, while only around 10% had between 50 and 100 nevi. No lesions that were suggestive of invasive skin cancer - non-melanoma skin cancer or melanoma - were identified. UV exposure is usually exceeded in most activities performed outdoors with exposed skin, even if they are performed in sunny conditions for only a short amount of time. The limit for UV exposure was exceeded more than 30 times during the Ironman Triathlon World Championship 1999 in Hawaii, as reported by Moehrle. Additionally, despite the application of water-resistant sunscreen (SPF 25+), these triathletes showed sunburn on sun-exposed skin, which was most probably due to water exposure, sweating, and friction (5). Other studies evaluating skin cancer and sun protection habits of outdoor athletes indicate that most do not appear to be aware of the serious potential health risks of extensive sun exposure (6-8). Even though no invasive skin cancer was detected in our athletes, a significant number of participants presented with solar lentigines and a fair amount with atypical nevi, both considered risk factors for skin cancer. Additionally, a large proportion of participants had a history of severe blistering sunburns, which is not surprising given that 20% never use sunscreen. Our results indicate that it is necessary to advise and educate outdoor athletes about sun-smart behavior. Avoiding training and competing in periods with high sun exposure, wearing adequate clothing, and applying water-resistant high-protection sunscreen regularly and sufficiently are practices and habits that should be encouraged. Screening for skin cancer is a valuable measure and should be performed in high-risk individuals such as triathletes.",

The alopecic skin was atrophic and lighter than the chronically sun-exposed forehead. Some lonely hairs were observed, as well as depression of temporal veins. Systemic examination was unremarkable. A diagnosis of frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) was established, no biopsy was performed, and treatment with hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/daily with topical minoxidil was promptly started. After 6 months, the patient stopped the drugs because no clinical improvement was observed. More than one year later, she returned with the same symptoms demanding new treatment. We opted to change the immunosuppressant/immunomodulator to methotrexate monotherapy 20 mg once a week to improve adherence. Patient achieved clinical stabilization within seven months of treatment. She maintained with the same clinical features as described above but had an eyebrow tattoo made, and perifollicular erythema was no longer present (Figure 1). FFA is a cicatricial alopecia caused by immune-mediated inflammatory infiltrate lymphocytes in the infundibulo-isthmic region of the hair follicle. Its etiopathogenesis is unknown, and it usually occurs in postmenopausal Caucasian women. Clinically, FFA presents with progressive loss of frontotemporal hairline resulting in a lighter skin compared with the forehead and with absence of follicular ostia. Perifollicular erythema, pruritus, pain, the lonely hair sign, and partial or total scarring eyebrow loss can be encountered as well. Biopsy is no longer necessary, but if it is done it is important to remember that there are no pathological criteria, at present, to distinguish FFA from lichen planopilaris (1,2). There have been no randomized clinical trial on AFF treatment. Topical drugs such as corticosteroids, minoxidil, and calcineurin inhibitors as well as systemic treatments such as 5α-reductase inhibitors, hydroxychloroquine, retinoids, and methotrexate can usually be used (1,2). The Frontal Fibrosing Alopecia Severity Score should be used during treatment (3), especially regarding the search for perifollicular erythema, which is well-known for having a direct correlation with progressive disease (4). In a retrospective study with 19 patients at Duke University, methotrexate monotherapy achieved stabilization in one of two patients. The mean duration of therapy was 16 months, and the dose varied between 15-25 mg once a week (5). Unfortunately, the variable course of this disease and the possibility of spontaneous stabilization lead to risk of overestimating the effects of the prescribed treatments (1). After clinical stabilization, drug withdrawal could be attempted with frequent clinical observation. This difficulty persists as no patient is likely to agree with that.",

    "abstract": "The use of fumaric acid esters in the treatment of psoriasis was first proposed in 1959. In the 1980s, more standardized oral preparations of fumaric acid esters were developed, containing dimethylfumarate and monoethylfumarate as the main compounds. In 1994, the drug was approved for the treatment of psoriasis in Germany, and since then it has become the most commonly used systemic therapy in this country. In the last few years, an oral integrator containing dimethylfumarate and monoethylfumarate (Psocaps, Dermatika s.r.l., Padua) has also been available in Italy for the treatment of psoriasis. In this paper we report on the history of treatment using fumaric acid esters and we describe our own experience during and following the treatment with such drugs in 41 patients affected by mild vulgar psoriasis. In our trial, an improvement in cutaneous psoriasis was observed in 46% of treated patients, while side effects were noticed in 52% of patients; only three patients dropped out due to gastrointestinal problems. Our results are comparable to literature data in terms of efficacy, safety and side effects.",

No case of concomitant occurrence TEN and severe granulocytopenia following the treatment with cefuroxime has been reported to date. Herein we present a case of TEN that developed eighteen days of the initiation of cefuroxime axetil therapy for urinary tract infection in a 73-year-old woman with chronic renal failure and no previous history of allergic diathesis. The condition was associated with severe granulocytopenia and followed by gastrointestinal hemorrhage, severe sepsis and multiple organ failure syndrome development. Despite intensive medical treatment the patient died. The present report underlines the potential of cefuroxime to simultaneously induce life threatening adverse effects such as TEN and severe granulocytopenia. Further on, because the patient was also taking furosemide for chronic renal failure, the possible unfavorable interactions between the two drugs could be hypothesized. Therefore, awareness of the possible drug interaction is necessary, especially when given in conditions of their altered pharmacokinetics as in case of chronic renal failure.",

While, regarding the other lesions ( junctional melanocytic nevus, in situ MM, superficial spreading MM, non-melanoma cancers) discriminative values were not found. P16  was over expressed on sun exposed sites and was hypo expressed on non-sun-exposed areas , founding a statistical significance correlation ( p < 0.03); while,  p16 expression was over expressed in patients  ≥ 61 while it was hypo expressed in patients ≤ 60 ( p = 0.09).",

Oral mucosa has a function of providing a barrier and promoting immune and inflammatory responses, thus protecting the body. During the aging process, those functions deteriorate, allowing the action of predisposing agents. There is thus the need of better knowledge of the conditions of oral health in the Brazilian population, allowing for adoption of preventive measures. Oral cavity examination should be routinely performed in the elderly on a yearly basis, as a preventive measure which would reduce the morbidity and mortality in this population.",

A case of a 43-year-old female patient with unrecognized adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent Cushing syndrome is reported. Besides numerous skin lesions, the patient presented with a rapidly progressive leg ulcer due to venous thrombosis. The initial skin symptoms appeared on her lower leg one month prior to admission. The patient was treated with oral prednisone, however, rapid progression of the skin lesion was observed. On admission the patient presented with a large, very painful ulceration, partially covered with a crust, on the right lower leg with several satellite smaller ulcerations. The other leg showed no changes. Moreover, the patient had pronounced hirsutism and skin darkening on the face, and Muehrcke's lines were observed on all her nails. Microscopic findings of skin biopsy were uncharacteristic, with some signs of angiopathy and vasculitis. Based on the elevated serum levels of ACTH and cortisol, and the result of dexamethasone suppression test, ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome was diagnosed. Sonography of leg veins revealed a recanalized thrombus of the right popliteal vein with reflux. The patient was transferred to surgical department where both suprarenal glands were removed. Upon suprarenal gland removal, significant improvement of the patient's general condition and rapid healing of the leg ulcer were observed. Briefly, this patient is presented to point out that a leg ulcer caused by venous insufficency may mimic fulminant purpura or some other type of vasculitis in patients with Cushing syndrome.",

The test also has a role in the diagnosis of food allergies characterized by clinical signs associated with the digestive system. Yet, in spite of numerous studies, the test itself has hitherto not been standardized. Our study enlisted 151 children less than two years of age, who exhibited suspect skin and/or gastrointestinal manifestations of food allergy to cow's milk, and in whom tests failed to prove early type of allergic reaction. Atopy patch test was positive in 28% of the children with atopic dermatitis, 43% of the children with suspect gastrointestinal manifestation and 32% of the children with skin and gastrointestinal manifestations of food allergy. In our experience, atopy patch test is an excellent addition to the hitherto used tests for the diagnosis of food allergies. It targets specifically delayed type hypersensitivity reactions, which are difficult to confirm with other diagnostic tools. It is furthermore simple to perform, noninvasive and produces a minimum of undesired side effects. For these reasons, it should become part of the routine diagnostic toolset for food allergies to cow's milk in infants and children, and applied before a food challenge test.",

    "abstract": "Morbihan disease (MD), also known as Morbihan syndrome, persistent facial edema and erythema, lymphedema, and facial edema in acne, is a rare and often unrecognizable entity, that presents with a slow occurrence of persistent lymphoedema of the upper two-thirds of the face (1,2). A 30-year-old woman presented to our Department with persistent, asymptomatic face edema and erythema lasting for 18 months. She was previously treated for rosacea with doxycycline (100 mg/day for four months) without improvement. Dermatological examination revealed erythematous, nonpitting, solid edema located on the mid-forehead, nose, and cheeks with sparse erythematous papules and pustules on the entire face including the chin and comedones, papules, and pustules on the back (Figure 1 and Figure 2). She was otherwise healthy and was not taking any medication. Laboratory tests with immunological tests and Quantiferon test together with MRI of the orbits, chest X-ray, chest high-resolution computed tomography, cranial X-ray, and abdominal ultrasound were all within normal limits. Histopathology revealed dermal edema, perivascular and peri-adnexal lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, and sebaceous gland hyperplasia. Based on the typical clinical picture, histopathological findings, and the exclusion of several differentials the diagnosis of MD was established. The patient was treated with oral isotretinoin (20 mg/day for eight months) without regression of solid edema and erythema on the face but with complete regression of acne on the trunk. She was started on oral corticosteroids (prednisolone, 20 mg/day for two months followed by reduction of the dose over three months), again with only slight short transient improvement and rapid relapse of facial erythema and edema. The patient refused any other suggested treatment. We treated our patient for a total 2 years and followed up for 5 years. The pathogenesis of MD is still unknown. It is considered a clinical variety or a complication of rosacea or acne which does not tend to regress spontaneously. It is believed that chronic inflammation in patients with MD is due to acne or rosacea causing structural damage to blood and lymph vessels (1,3,4). However, cases of MD without previous history of rosacea and acne have been reported supporting the distinct disease theory (3,4). Edema and erythema are localized on the upper half of the face affecting the forehead, glabella, eyelids, nose, and cheeks. Although the symptoms may come and go, MD usually does not improve without treatment (5). Several therapeutic options have been reported, although there is no established standard treatment for MD. Reported therapy includes short-term oral isotretinoin (0.5 mg/kg/day), long-term oral isotretinoin (40-80 mg/day, 10-24 months), long-term doxycycline, combination of systemic corticosteroids and antibiotic (prednisolone 20 mg/day for 2 weeks and doxycycline 200 mg/day for 12 weeks), slow-releasing doxycycline monohydrate (40 mg/day for 6 months), long-term minocycline (50 mg/day for 4 months), and a combination of both oral retinoid and ketotifen (isotretinoin 0.7 mg/kg/day for 4 months, ketotifen 2 mg/day for 4 months) (1,2,6,8). The disease is frequently recalcitrant to therapy, and only several cases of successfully treated patients with MD have been reported (1,2,4, 6-8). We presented a patient with characteristic features of MD, which is a persistent, cosmetically disturbing condition, unfortunately mostly refractory to therapeutic measures.",

Objective of this study is assessment of the demographic and clinical characteristic, including comorbidities, of patients with acne with a special focus on adult female acne (AFA). This cross-sectional study analyzed the medical records of 354 patients with acne (323 outpatients and 31 hospitalized). Data concerning patient age, sex, lesions morphology and distribution on body areas, duration of the disease, Body Mass Index, and dermatologic and systemic comorbidities were collected. 61% of all patients were female, 45.37% of women were classified as AFA. The median age of patients with acne was 24 years and 32.5 years for AFA. The face was the most commonly affected area; patients with AFA had lesions on their back than less frequently non-AFA. Predominant eruptions were pustules and papules. 38.7% of patients had concomitant systemic chronic disease, 15.25% had an endocrinologic disorder, and 6.21% had thyroid gland dysfunction. Women with AFA had endocrinologic disorders more frequently (P=0.002), whereas cutaneous signs of hyperandrogenism were observed less frequently than in the non-AFA group (P=0.034). AFA possess distinct clinical features and it should raise suspicion towards possible underlying endocrinologic disturbance.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic and relapsing, non-contagious inflammatory skin disorder, characterized by skin barrier impairment and baseline immune irregularities. The literature on the relationship between AD and cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity is inconclusive. There is an ongoing debate whether contact sensibility (CS) is found more or less often among patients with AD. Aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence of contact sensitivity (positive patch test reactions) in patients with and without AD. We patch tested a total of 2143 patients (563 men and 1580 women). There were 226 patients with history of AD; 61 (27%) men and 165 (73%) women. The patient group without AD consisted of 1917 patients, 502 (26%) male and 1415 (74%) female patients, who were referred to our Department with clinical suspicion of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). A patch test was performed with the baseline series, and readings were performed on days D2, D3, and D7. Among patients with AD, 109 (48.2%) had a positive patch test reaction to at least one allergen, whereas 1094 (57.1%) patients with no history of AD had a positive patch test reaction. The most common positive allergens in patients with AD were nickel (II) sulfate (13.3%), thimerosal (12.4%), cobalt (II) chloride (11.5%), methylisothiazolinone (MI) (8.4%), fragrance mix I (6.6%), potassium dichromate (5.3%), methyldibromo glutaronitrile (4.0%), and carba mix (4.0%). The results of our study agree with previous findings that there is no significant difference in prevalence of CS between the atopic and nonatopic populations.",

In patients with a tendency towards exacerbation, we performed mild peeling with 5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) solution 3-4 times during the treatment. Twenty-minute treatments were applied on 38 patients, 29 women and 9 men, during 3.5 months on average. Median age of patients was 21 years (range, 16-29). Clinical assessment included an assessment of scars, pore size, skin moisture, vascularization, and skin firmness and elasticity. As confirmed by photographs taken before and after therapy, the treatment proved to be clinically effective in decreasing acne scars and persistence of effects. Flattening of acne scars was observed in 79% of the patients. The results depended on duration of scars persistence as well as on a the type of scars. The best results were achieved with younger scars as well as with superficial and ice pick scars. Side effects involved a very mild retinoid dermatitis and more often acne exacerbation. The therapy was clinically effective and the patients accepted the treatment very easily. Local therapy of acne scars with tretinoin by iontophoresis can in some cases successfully replace invasive techniques, and could also be combined with those techniques.",

    "abstract": "The year 2020 has been marked by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by an RNA virus called SARS-COV2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus). The fight against this epidemic has become the center of our daily clinical practice as well as of our private lives, in which avoiding infection has become one of our most important goals. Even though COVID-19 is a potentially lethal disease, especially for the elderly and people with chronic diseases, it did not cause all the other life-threatening diseases to vanish. On the contrary, many scheduled medical activities and procedures, especially preventive and non-urgent internal and surgical activities, had to be postponed due to COVID-19 crisis. This interruption in the health care system can negatively affect the diagnosis and management of our patients with other health issues, namely malignant skin tumors, of which melanoma is the most aggressive. In this letter, we as dermatovenereologists from the Croatian Referral Centre of The Ministry of Health for Melanoma needed to express our concern regarding the increasing number of patients with delayed diagnosis of skin cancer, with special emphasis on melanoma detection and treatment. In the last few months, a large number of our newly-diagnosed patients with melanoma, as well as those with non-melanoma skin cancers, reported that they had noticed a suspicious skin lesion a few months ago but decided not to seek help from dermatologist due to the worrisome epidemiologic situation. In the current environment, clinical skin examination may be viewed as less important and thus postponed, but neglecting melanoma throughout the virus outbreak may lead to increased rates of morbidity, mortality, and consequently a greater financial burden for the health system (1). There are several reasons for such a relaxed attitude towards skin health in our patients. Unlike cardiac, pulmonary, or digestive difficulties, which patients consider life-threatening and for which they seek emergency care despite the coronavirus pandemic, skin tumors do not cause great subjective or significantly noticeable objective symptoms. Moreover, all of the skin tumors and especially melanoma , mostly present as small changes of just a few millimeters in diameter in the early stage at which they are prognostically most favorable. For the average person with no medical education, such small lesions usually do not cause any concern as they have no awareness of the fact that small and inconspicuous skin lesions may be dangerous and potentially even lethal. According to the recommendations concerning patient management during COVID-19 pandemic, oncological examinations should still be performed regularly (2). In spite of that, the cancelation of appointments, especially by patients who are being monitored for high-risk lesions, is inevitable when COVID-19 is disrupting everyone's lives. With the pandemic evolving and no clear solutions in sight, now is the time to emphasize the importance of self-examination and teledermatology in early melanoma diagnosis. Even though diagnosing and managing pigmented skin lesions usually requires face-to-face examinations and dermoscopy as a crucial tool in early melanoma detection, in these times, and especially for people with a higher risk of SARS-COV2 infection, remote communication could prevent delays resulting in worse prognosis and could also eliminate the risk of infecting healthcare workers. Moreover, teledermatology can also be initiated by doctors asking patients to monitor lesions between clinical visits (3). However, we should not rely solely on this technology but should instead assess every patient individually and insist on a face-to-face examination for those at greater risk, with the aim that, if necessary, surgery be performed in timely manner. The collaboration between general practitioners and dermatologists represents an important aspect of achieving the most rational and effective health care in terms of performing triage of patients who can be assessed by teledermatology as well as referring to hospital centers those who need face-to-face examination and further treatment. During the first breakout of the epidemic in March 2020, the multidisciplinary team for melanoma from the Croatian National Referral Melanoma Centre provided recommendations for the management of patients with melanoma during COVID epidemic, designed according to the guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) (4) and considering the specifics of health care and clinical practice in the Republic of Croatia. Due to epidemic circumstances, preventive actions such as Euromelanoma and many other campaigns that included massive preventive skin examinations of the population and which were conducted for years by Croatian dermatologists throughout the country, could not be organized this year. This is particularly worrisome because on average about 800 patients are diagnosed with melanoma annually in Croatia, of which 60 during public health preventive actions. Despite these circumstances, we were able to maintain public awareness of the importance of early skin cancer recognition by sending the message through different media such as newspapers, television, and social media (Facebook and Instagram). We find that now more than ever it is essential to remind and teach the population about the importance of regular monthly skin self-examinations and recognition of atypical lesions. Clearly, a thorough dermatological examination includes full skin examination from head to toe. Herein we would also like to remind our readers that most skin cancers develop in the head and neck area, which is the most UV-exposed part of the body. Therefore, despite the epidemic conditions, the removal of patients' masks and thorough inspection of the face is mandatory. We find it most practical and efficient to perform the body and scalp examination first, followed by the face examination after the patient gets dressed. Prior to removal of the mask, we ask the patient not to talk during close examination. Even though this could make dermoscopic examination harder to perform, we strongly suggest wearing a protective shield and mask during close examination whenever possible. Between patients, the examining room should be disinfected and ventilated. As doctors, we live in uncertain times when we are heavily burdened by the currently unstoppable COVID epidemic, always awaiting new instructions from the state administration every day and wondering whether perhaps tomorrow we dermatologists will be assigned solely to the service of patients with COVID-19. In the end, we would like to once again remind you that despite the ravaging COVID pandemic and all the epidemiological measures that come with it, other diseases still exist. It is expected of us to draw attention to the still growing incidence of skin cancers and the serious consequences that can occur as a result of a delayed diagnosis.",

HES is defined by persistent and marked eosinophilia and eosinophil-related organ damage in the absence of any evident cause of hypereosinophilia. Two variants of HES have been characterized, with different prognosis and possible associations with malignant diseases such as myeloid leukemia or T-cell lymphomas. The lymphocytic variant of HES (L-HES) is characterized by the presence of T cell clones, IL-5 expression and possible progression to T-cell lymphoma. Besides steroid therapy, the anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody mepolizumab is considered as a target therapy for L-HES. The myeloproliferative variant of HES (M-HES) is associated with an increased risk of myeloid leukemia and good response to anti-tyrosine-kinase therapy. The imatinib target is a kinase resulting from an 800-kb deletion on chromosome 4. The fusion gene Fip1-like 1-platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (FIP1L1-PDGFRA) has been validated as a marker of response to anti-tyrosine-kinase therapy. Early identification of HES variants is crucial for the rapid introduction of early and appropriately adjusted therapy.",

Axillary artery was palpated and a mixture of local anesthetic agents was injected into the neurovascular sheet above and below axillary artery at the site of strongest artery pulsation. The local anesthetic solution comprised equal volumes of lidocaine 2% and bupivacaine 0.5% without adrenaline, in a total volume of 30-40 mL, depending on body mass. This technique is used in more than 150 patients per year at our department. In the present study, 158 patients undergoing upper extremity surgery under brachial plexus block were retrospectively assessed. Successful anesthesia was achieved in 135 (85.0%) patients using brachial plexus block alone, 19 (12.5%) patients required additional medication, two patients required supplementation with intravenous regional anesthesia, and another two patients required general anesthesia. The incidence of successful blocks, latency time of onset, local and systemic complications or allergic skin reactions were investigated. There were no significant complications attributed to the anesthetic technique.",

    "abstract": "Dear Editor, The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, and remains a global challenge. COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), transmitted primarily through respiratory droplets and aerosols. Even though the COVID-19 vaccine has become available since December 2020, the main preventive measures still include social distancing, hand washing, and the use of protective face masks. By May 22, 2021, 3,437,545 deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2 have been registered by WHO, confirming the burden of this disease (1). Consequently, the pandemic has become a challenge for health care systems, as they had to be focused on the care of patients with COVID-19. During the first lockdown from March to May 2020, it was advised to postpone clinical visits whenever this could be done without risk. This recommendation was mainly aimed at older patients and those with chronic diseases, as it has been shown that they are at greater risk for complications from COVID-19. Renal transplant recipients (RTRs) are at a greater risk for infections and different cancers due to their permanent immunosuppressive therapy. The most common malignancies in RTRs are skin cancers, particularly non-melanoma skin cancers. It has been estimated that RTRs have a 65-250 times higher risk for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 10 times higher risk for basal cell carcinoma, and 2-5 times higher risk for melanoma when compared with the general population (2-4). RTRs are at a higher risk for complications from COVID-19, not only because of their immunosuppressive therapy but also because of different comorbidities, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus (5). Therefore, RTRs tend to limit their medical visits and postpone clinical examinations for skin cancer screenings. Moreover, during clinical visits the patients are commonly asked to keep their protective masks on, increasing the risk of overlooking their facial skin changes. Herein we present two RTRs who developed skin cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the tumors were diagnosed with a significant delay. Patient 1 A 67-year-old woman with unknown primary kidney disease received a renal allograft from a deceased donor in 2014. The immunosuppressive protocol included antithymocyte globulin induction with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroid maintenance. In January 2020, she had noticed a reddish squamous lesion on her right cheek, which enlarged slowly. Since there were no other symptoms, she postponed the dermatologic examination. Additionally, she further postponed the visit to her physician during the pandemic as she wanted to avoid social contact as much as possible. One year later, at the nephrologist's examination, she was asked to take off her face mask for a skin check, and two skin tumors on her right cheek were noticed (Figure 1). One lesion was located at the angle of her mandible and presented as a hypertrophic, sharply marginated lesion with central crusting and a diameter of 2 cm. The other lesion was at the right zygomatic region and appeared as a scaly, erythematous lesion with a diameter of 7 mm. The patient was referred to a dermatologist, and a biopsy of both lesions was indicated. The pathohistological analysis revealed cutaneous SCC in situ for the mandibular lesion and actinic keratosis for the zygomatic lesion. SCC in situ has been excised, and actinic keratosis was treated by cryosurgery. Patient 2 A 66-year-old woman received a renal allograft from a deceased donor in 2010 due to chronic glomerulonephritis without biopsy. The immunosuppressive protocol included basiliximab induction with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroid maintenance. In June 2020, an erosion occurred at her left infraocular area and did not heal but instead gradually enlarged. The patient suspected that the wound developed due to the friction from the rim of her eyeglasses. Six months later, the nephrologist noticed the erosion which was 10×5 mm in size with a slightly elevated, pearl-colored margin (Figure 2). The patient was referred to a dermatologist who indicated tumor excision due to suspected basal cell carcinoma. The pathohistological analysis confirmed the clinical diagnosis. DISCUSSION Both presented patients did not inform their family physicians about their skin changes because they avoided all non-nephrological medical visits during the pandemic. The additional reason for the diagnostic delay was the fact that they kept the masks on their faces during most examinations, with the skin lesions behind the mask consequently remaining unnoticed. The problem of diagnostic delay of skin cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic has been recognized by several studies. Canadian authors compared the number of biopsies for skin cancers during the first 15 weeks in 2020 and during the same period in 2019. They found a decrease in the number of biopsies for non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) and melanoma of 18% and 27%, respectively (6). A multicenter study performed in northern-central Italy showed that the number of skin cancer (NMSC and melanoma) diagnoses fell by 56.7% in weeks 11 to 20 of 2020 compared with the average number noted in the same periods of 2018 and 2019 (7). Furthermore, a single-center retrospective study in Italy demonstrated that the number of advanced skin cancers surgically treated between May 18 and November 18, 2020, was significantly higher than in the same period in 2019. These findings led the authors to conclude that the surgical excisions were postponed due to the delay in follow-ups, which resulted in increased incidence of advanced skin cancers (8). RTRs are at particular risk of severe consequences from diagnostic delay with regard to skin cancers. Namely, skin cancers in RTRs are more aggressive and are associated with a higher incidence rate of metastases and recurrences than in the general population (9). Therefore, RTRs should be advised to regularly check their skin for potential skin cancer, which includes self-examinations and dermatologic follow-ups.",

A remarkable clinical response was achieved in both patients with a 50% or greater improvement in baseline PASI at week 2 after therapy initiation and a 90% or greater improvement at week 6 in one patient and at week 14 in the other. Both patients also reported a significant decline in their arthritis symptoms shortly after the introduction of infliximab. The concomitant use of infliximab and methotrexate in these two patients resulted in rapid and sustained remission of psoriasis with no major adverse effects detected.",

Therefore, it is important to be aware of the possible complications and to be able to manage them properly. Complications in cutaneous surgery are not very often, but they can be serious and worrisome including bleeding, infections, allergic reactions, syncope, wound dehiscence, necrosis, and others. In this article special attention is given to bleeding, which is the most common complication in this field. The best way to reduce the number of possible complications is to recognize patients at risk.

    "abstract": "The Ukraine is one of the European countries with the fastest growing number of cases of HIV. In the European Centre for the Epidemiological Monitoring of AIDS (EuroHIV) year-end report 2005, the number of newly diagnosed HIV infections in the Ukraine was the second highest in the WHO European Region. Women are increasingly contributing to the spread of HIV/AIDS. HIV infection by sexual contact is the most common way of HIV transmission among women. Reported HIV/AIDS cases from the official epidemiological register of the Ukrainian Centre for AIDS Prevention between 1995 and 2005, alongside data from seroepidemiological monitoring since 2002 were analysed. During 1987, 6 individuals (5 women) were registered with HIV. In 1995, the reported number of HIV infections increased to 1,490 (554 women), a 34-fold increase in comparison with 1994. In the newly infected HIV cases, the proportion of women rose from 37.2% in 1995 to 41.6% in 2005. There has also been a considerable increase in mother-to-child transmission of HIV since 1995. Between 1987 and 1994, the proportion of children among the newly HIV infected people was 2.2%. In 2005, it was 18.2%. In 2005, 13,770 new cases (8,044 men and 5,726 women) were registered, corresponding to about 28 cases per 100,000 population. HIV posed no significant problem in the Ukraine before 1995. Since 1995, there has been a considerable increase in the number of registered cases, especially among women. The significant increase in HIV infection among newborn children shows that women are contributing ever more to the propagation of HIV/AIDS too. Unless effective preventive measures are taken, and unless there is more investment in development projects, an HIV/AIDS epidemic may become a threat not only in the Ukraine, but also in neighboring European countries. The promotion of gender equality as well as investment in the education of girls and women should be improved to effectively prevent AIDS.",

    "abstract": "Dear Editor, The diagnosis of malignant melanoma accounts for 1-2% of all cancer diagnoses, around 4% of all malignant skin diseases, and 80% of all skin cancer deaths (1). The prognosis depends on several factors including tumor size, Clark level, Breslow thickness, location, ulceration, and presence of metastases. Detection of lymph node metastasis is initially accomplished by clinical examination and by operative evaluation for occult metastasis using sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) when indicated (2). Lymph nodes (LN) with melanoma metastasis may appear normal in early stages, but eventually they become dark, firm, and enlarged (3). In 2017, a 32-year-old female patient was referred to our ward by a dermatologist following a biopsy excision of a nevus under her right breast that tested positive for a cutaneous melanoma grade T2aNx with a Breslow thickness of 1.9 mm, with no sign of ulceration and no history of previous illnesses or chronic diseases. Based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) guidelines, wide excision with a sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy was indicated (4). The patient was injected with 0.4 mL CiTc 99m Nanocoll in all four quadrants around the primary scar. A 2 cm wide elliptical excision was performed circumferentially around the scar and to the depth of the muscular fascia of the thorax. With the aid of a gamma probe, a single radioisotope positive lymph node was located in the ipsilateral axilla, but 5 dark pigmented lymph nodes situated behind the SLN were visualized during manual dissection and thought to be consistent with metastatic disease (Figure 1). Due to this new finding, an excisional biopsy of all pigmented nodes was performed. Histology of the excised skin did not demonstrate any further cancerous cells. The size of the SLN was 15 mm, and immunohistochemistry for Melan A was negative for metastatic melanoma. Histological analysis of the darkly pigmented nodes was negative for metastatic melanoma as the pigment was demonstrated to originate from the dermal tattoo on the patient's back that had been removed by dermabrasion 3 years before melanoma development (Figure 2, Figure 3). Dermal tattooing results in initial sloughing of the overlying epidermis, variable dermal inflammation, and gradual assimilation of pigment into macrophages. Much of the pigment is rapidly carried into regional draining LN, which was shown in 2010 on a SKH-1a mouse model, and causes lymphadenopathy which is thought to be a result of local inflammation (6). Importantly, even after removal of the offending cutaneous tattoo the tattoo pigment can persist in draining or distant nodes visible to the naked eye (7). In such cases, LN can mimic metastatic malignant melanoma and may prompt the surgeon to proceed with radical lymph node dissection which may not be necessary. Despite clear guidelines for melanoma treatment in the general population, there are several questions that need to be addressed: firstly, how should a physician approach a patient with unknown history of tattoo removal, a diagnosis of melanoma, and intraoperative darkly pigmented lymph nodes? Secondly, due to the lack of scientific data and treatment protocol, if the SLN is normally colored while other regional nodes are darkly pigmented, what should the treatment plan entail?",

    "abstract": "Dear Editor, Granuloma annulare (GA) is an asymptomatic, chronic, and relatively common granulomatous skin condition which presents with annular papules usually slowly progressing into plaques on the extremities and the trunk. It usually presents with non-scaly, erythematous, annular plaques on the distal extremity (1,2). The pathogenesis of GA is still unknown, although a variety of possible factors contributing the disease have been reported, including drugs (3), insect bites, sun exposure, trauma, vaccinations, and viral infections (e.g. hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, Epstein-Barr virus) (1). Several cases in which GA developed on residual skin changes from herpes zoster have also been reported (4). A 47-year-old woman presented with erythematous-livid plaques on the dorsa of her hands and linear and circular lesions on her neck, gradually spreading for the last 4 months prior to admission at our Department (Figure 1a and Figure 1b). She reported excessive thirst and sweating in the last 30 days, but did not consider it significant since it was summer. The patient was otherwise healthy and was not taking any medications. Mycological swabs taken from the dorsal parts of both hands and the neck were negative. Biopsy of the skin changes was consistent with GA, showing palisading granulomatous inflammation which surrounded degenerated collagen within the dermis. A routine laboratory check revealed increased levels of glucose (23 mmol/L) and HgbA1C, while lipid and thyroid hormone levels were normal. Fasting blood sugar lever was 17 mmol/L. Therapy with topical corticosteroid (betamethasone cream) for skin lesions was initiated and applied two times daily for 2 weeks. The patient was immediately referred to an endocrinologist and insulin therapy was initiated due to diabetes mellitus. Complete remission of the skin changes was observed on the follow-up visit after 3 months. There are many clinical variants of GA such as localized, generalized, disseminated, subcutaneous, arcuate dermal erythema, and perforating GA (1). The localized form of GA is most common with annular plaques on the distal extremities. In addition to the typical lesions on the dorsal side of both hands, our patient also presented with atypical, circular lesions around her neck. The relationship between GA and systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, thyroid disorders, dyslipidemia, and malignancies remains unclear (5). It is also uncertain whether genetic factors influence susceptibility to GA. Familial cases have been documented, but studies investigating the association between the disease and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes have yielded inconsistent results (6). Increased frequency of HLA-B35 in patients with the generalized form has been reported in a few studies (7). GA mostly affects children and young adults, mostly women. Many cases of GA resolve spontaneously within 2 years, but relapses occur in many patients. Treatment is divided into localized skin therapies and systemic therapies (1). High potency topical corticosteroids along with intralesional corticosteroids are the most common localized treatments (8). Systemic therapy includes corticosteroids, chloroquine, dapsone, and isotretinoin (1,9). Cryotherapy and UV-therapy can also be used, although with limited efficacy (10). GA is a common idiopathic disorder of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue that can be associated with a variety of underlying conditions such as diabetes mellitus. The relationship between GA and diabetes mellitus is still unknown. Since skin lesions preceded the diagnosis of DM in our patient and complete remission of skin changes occurred with induction of insulin therapy, it is important to perform routine laboratory test in every patient.",

    "abstract": "Dear Editor, Cutaneous leiomyomas (CL) are rare, benign smooth muscle tumors of the skin (1). There are 3 subtypes with different origins and histopathologic features: piloleiomyoma, genital leiomyoma, and angioleiomyoma (2). Pilar leiomyoma is the most common subtype originating from arrector pili muscles of pilosebaceous unit. It presents as painful solitary or multiple papulonodules (2,3). A 30-year-old woman presented to our outpatient clinic with numerous painless, itchy papules on her gluteal region that had been present for 10 years. Dermatologic examination revealed red-brown, smooth, grouped papulonodules on bilateral gluteal regions (Figure 1). These lesions had appeared after intramuscular injections and had increased in number. Family history was unremarkable. A punch biopsy was performed with pre-diagnoses of keloid and tumoral infiltration. Histopathologic examination showed neoplastic infiltration with large bundles of spindle-like smooth muscle cells with acidophilic cytoplasm under epidermis (Figure 2). Neoplastic cells were stained by smooth muscle markers actin and caldesmon (Figure 3). Based on the clinical and histopathological findings the diagnosis of pilar leiomyoma was established. Pelvic and renal ultrasonographic examinations were normal. The patient's lesions were asymptomatic except for mild itching and she is currently in follow-up without any treatment. Pilar leiomyomas mostly manifest around the ages of 10 to 30 and are located on the trunk and extensor surfaces of the extremities. Lesions are firm, red-brown or skin-colored papulonodules with diameters varying from several mm to 2 cm (2). Differential diagnosis includes dermatofibroma, neurofibroma, smooth muscle hamartoma, neuroma, adnexal tumors, and painful papulonodular lesions such as glomus tumor (1,2). Our case clinically resembled keloid with red-brown, stiff nodules with epidermal thinning. In the literature, a patient with cutaneous pilar leiomyoma was diagnosed with eruptive keloid and treated with cryotherapy and intralesional steroid injections before histopathologic verification of pilar leiomyoma. He had multiple painless, red-purple papulonodules on the chest and arms (3). The case of a 53-year-old man with a history of multiple firm and painful lesions on the back showing segmental distribution and diagnosed with keloid-like leiomyoma was also reported (4). CL should be considered in the differential diagnosis of keloid-like lesions with atypical location and that are resistant to treatment. Cutaneous leiomyomas have different clinical presentations and many differential diagnoses, but CL can be diagnosed by histopathological examination. In all CLs, histopathologic examination shows bundles of spindle-shaped smooth muscle cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, a cigarette-like nucleus, and a perinuclear halo. Smooth muscle markers actin and desmin are routinely positive. Histopathologic examination in our case also revealed bundles of spindle-like smooth muscle cells with large acidophilic cytoplasm; smooth muscle markers actin and caldesmon were positive. While solitary lesions are frequently sporadic cases, multiple lesions may be related to hereditary conditions such as Reed's syndrome (multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatosis), hereditary leiomyomatosis, and renal cell cancer (2). These two hereditary conditions have been reported to be associated with a heterozygous germline mutation in fumarate hydratase gene (4). Our patient was considered a sporadic case due to lack of family history and uterine leiomyoma and normal renal ultrasonography. Treatment of CL depends on the number of lesions and presence of symptoms (1). Surgical excision is the gold standard in the treatment of solitary and self-limiting lesions (2). However, recurrence can be more commonly observed in patients with multiple lesions (1). Drugs targeting smooth muscle contraction such as nifedipine, nitroglycerin, and phenoxybenzamine are recommended for pain management. Methods such as cryotherapy and carbon dioxide laser ablation have been tested but their efficacy was found to be limited (1,2). In our patient, lesions were asymptomatic and few in number; we thus suggested follow-up without any treatment. CL are rare benign smooth muscle tumors of the skin. They are difficult to diagnose by clinical evaluation, but the diagnosis can be established by histopathologic examination. In patients with atypical keloid-like papulonodular lesions like our patient, pilar leiomyoma should be considered and histopathologic examination should be performed for the diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Tumor staging of melanoma is a crucial step for estimating patient prognosis, deciding on therapy approach, and efficient collection, analysis, comparison and communication of scientific data across borders and research groups. Recently, the Melanoma Staging Committee of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) has proposed a revision of the widely used melanoma staging system, using an evidence-based approach, to reflect the improved understanding of this disease. Important adjustments were made related to the role of mitotic rate as a prognostic factor, definition of N category and classification of all microscopic nodal metastases, regardless of the extent of tumor burden, and specifically including micrometastases detected by immunohistochemistry as stage III. These revisions are to be implemented by early 2010 and are likely to be adopted and incorporated in international guidelines. Within the updated AJCC staging system, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) remains a standard-of-care diagnostic procedure, widely accepted as an important prognostic tool. According to current recommendations, SLNB is routinely offered as a staging procedure in patients with tumors more than 1 mm in thickness. Beyond its prognostic value, the therapeutic benefit of this procedure in improving overall survival yet remains to be proven. This article reviews and discusses the new aspects and challenges of the current staging recommendations for melanoma.",

It is characterized by symmetrically distributed, round, erythematous iris lesions, with remarkable tendency of recurrence. The purpose of this randomized retrospective study was to summarize our experience concerning the etiology, clinical variants and management of EM. We present 12 EM patients, along with laboratory, clinical and histopathologic analysis, and an overview of the treatment used. According to clinical presentation and histopathologic analysis, there were six cases of EM major, five cases of EM minor and one case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In five patients, EM was associated with the use of certain drugs (terbinafine, azithromycin, diclofenac, piroxicam). In three patients, the disease was triggered by the herpes simplex virus infection. In four cases, the etiologic factor (involved in the occurrence) of EM remained unknown. We also present an unusual case of an HIV-positive patient with multiple acral target lesions without mucosal involvement, which developed upon antiretroviral therapy discontinuation. To our knowledge, no case of such EM occurrence has yet been reported. There are various etiologic factors and numerous clinical presentations of EM, including acral target lesions and atypical widely distributed cutaneous and mucosal lesions.",

Anti-TNF agents were developed approximately one decade ago by rheumatologists and today represent one of the most effective classes of drugs in severe psoriasis resistant to 2 out of 3 \"classic\" systemic therapies (methotrexate, cyclosporine, and PUVA). Recent studies on psoriasis pathogenesis were focused on early steps of the inflammatory cascade, i.e. activation of T cells with a recently described phenotype Th17 and consequent expression of interleukins (IL) 12 and 23. IL12 and IL23 have a common p40 subunit that is a target of a new therapeutic class, fully human monoclonal antibodies anti IL12/23: ustekinumab and ABT-874. Randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis using ustekinumab and ABT-874 showed PASI 75 achievements at week 12 in 80% and 93% of patients, respectively. Larger studies are ongoing in order to assess the safety profile of this new therapy. As anti-TNF drugs represent an important and effective treatment of psoriatic arthritis and moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, comparative studies are needed to assess the advantages, the safety and the place of anti-IL12/23 in the era of biologic therapy.",

Answers from 841 students were analyzed. 36.94% had undergone HIV testing and only 14.84% were tested more than once. Unprotected vaginal sexual contacts with casual partners including forced contacts were reported by 27.23%. Intravenous drug use was reported by 1.66%. Male students reported higher prevalence of sex-related risky behavior and more frequent HIV testing. Professional injuries with exposed needles were reported by 29.13% of students. It is important to more actively popularize HIV testing in students, explain risk factors of HIV transmission, and to a organize needlestick injury prevention and control program.",

We present a case of autosomal-recessive lamellar ichthyosis in a 47-year-old man who was referred to our outpatient eye clinic for treatment of primary keratouveitis of the right eye with keratolysis and exudation in the anterior chamber. A diagnosis of cicatricial ectropion with serious lagophthalmos was established on examination. The patient underwent tectonic penetrating keratoplasty, cataract extraction, and intra-ocular lens placement with no perioperative complications. The patient was subsequently treated with oral fluconazole 200 mg once daily for 12 days due to a positive fungal culture for Candida albicans and systemic oral acyclovir 250 mg 3 times per day for 12 days as prophylaxis for a labial herpetic infection. Post-operative complications included corneal rejection and nonhealing neurotropic epithelial defect of the graft. Long-term treatment with topical cyclosporine (Ikervis®) and dexamethasone led to resolution of the corneal rejection. Lubrication with artificial tears containing hyaluronic acid, perfluorohexyl octane (Evotears®), and vitamin A ointment led to symptomatic relief of dry eye disease. The patient was referred to a dermatologist and was started on systemic retinoid acitretin at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg per day. Ten months after surgery, the patient's visual acuity was 0.1 based on the Snellen chart and the corneal graft was stable. Infection in the cornea can rapidly progress to corneal melting in patients with severe cicatricial ectropion. A good patient outcome depends on the interdisciplinary approach to patient management by the ophthalmologist, dermatologist, and plastic surgeon.",

    "abstract": "Dear editor, Condylomata accuminatum (CA) is a human papillomavirus (HPV) related sexually transmitted infection (STI), clinically characterized by solitary or even clustered dark red or pink lesions solely affecting the anogenital area (1). CA involving the extragenital, non-mucosal skin has been sporadically reported (2-4). Diagnosis of CA is usually straightforward when the lesions are located on the anogenital area. However, involvement of extragenital skin may pose a diagnostic challenge. Herein, we report a rare case of giant linear extragenital CA without coexisting genital lesions, diagnosed with a synergic intervention of dermatoscopy and clinics. A 70-year-old Caucasian man was referred to our department for an atypical asymptomatic seborrheic keratosis presenting as a linear verrucous plaque (20 × 2 cm) with few solitary reddish satellite papules on the abdomen (Figure 1, a). No similar lesions were present in both cutaneous and mucosal districts. Medical history was unremarkable, and the patient denied having recent sexual intercourse or any history of condylomas. Remarkably, the patient underwent a diet in the last 8 months that resulted in a loss of 30 kg. We employed dermatoscopy to further assess the lesions, highlighting a finger-like pattern on the main lesion (Figure 1, c), while satellite lesions presented a mosaic pattern (Figure 1, b). The clinical appearance and these dermatoscopic findings were suggestive of condyloma acuminatum (CA), but due to its extraordinary presentation we also performed an incisional biopsy. Histopathological examination reviled features compatible with the diagnosis of CA (Figure 1, d, e). To better characterized the HPV genotype (high-risk and low-risk HPV) a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from lesional tissue sample was performed and found HPV type 6 positivity. The lesions were successfully removed by electrosurgery. Regular follow-up was scheduled. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) were also screened, namely syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia trachomatis, and HIV status. In addition, laboratory tests and imaging examinations (radiography of the chest and ultrasound examination of the abdomen) revealed no pathological findings. CA involving the extragenital skin has been reported within intertriginous areas, including the inframammary fold, the groin, and the axillary vault, as well as mucosal surface such as intraoral and conjunctival mucosa (1-5). In most cases, extragenital CA coexisted with genital lesions. Staples et al. reported three obese patients with extragenital CA on the skin of the abdominal pannus (3). However, all of the patients had involvement of the inguinal folds, from where the CA had extended. Generally, CA is acquired by genital, oral, or anal sexual contact. Among the wide spectrum of HPV genotypes, types 6 and 11 are responsible of 90% of CA (1). Our paradigmatic case allows us reflect on the concept of transitory immune dysregulation due to a significant amount of weight loss, and the position of the lesions in particular seems to suggest that frictional triggers may disrupt the barrier integrity, leading to higher probability of infection. Dermoscopy is a noninvasive diagnostic tool with a significant role in the assessment of melanocytic and non-melanocytic skin tumors. Furthermore, the utility of dermatoscopy has expanded to the field of inflammatory and infectious skin disease, where dermoscopy enhances the differential diagnosis between them. Seborrheic keratosis, as the most common benign epithelial tumor, can occur anywhere in the skin excluding the palms, soles, and mucosa (6). In the anogenital area, seborrheic keratosis usually resembles CA. However, dermatoscopically, seborrheic keratosis can be immediately identified by the presence of milia-like cysts, comedo-like openings, fissures, finger-print structures, and sharply demarcated borders (6). In contrast, reports of CA dermoscopy suggested four different dermoscopic patterns: fingerlike, mosaic, knoblike, and the most commonly, an unspecific pattern (7). Our case showed that dermoscopy of extragenital CA presented a mosaic pattern in an early stage of CA, while fully developed lesions revealed a fingerlike pattern, as has previously been reported by Dong et al. (7), where two different stages of clinical development of CA exhibit distinctive dermoscopic patterns, which correlates with our case. We did not observe the typical dermoscopic features of seborrheic keratosis. CA arising in an extragenital area is very rare and perhaps also underestimated. Thus, dermatologists should be aware of this unusual presentation even in the absence of genital HPV involvement. Moreover, dermoscopy may facilitate CA recognition in a such uncommon location. To our knowledge, this is the first report of extragenital condyloma acuminatum documented dermoscopically.",

    "abstract": "Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease primarily affecting apocrine gland-rich areas of the body and presenting with painful nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts, and scarring (1). HS is a defect of the follicular epithelium; some have therefore called for the naming the disease acne inversa instead of hidradenitis suppurativa. The term acne inversa links the pathogenesis to acne and reflects the fact that it is an expression of follicular occlusion in localizations inverse to acne vulgaris (2). HS typically occurs after puberty. Studies have shown that the average onset is in the second or third decades of life (3). One of the most frequently cited risk factors for HS is cigarette smoking. Another significant risk factor for HS is obesity. About one-third of patients with HS have reported a family history of the disease (4). A clinically relevant staging and disease severity assessment is essential for the development of evidence-based treatments. There are several scoring systems for the assessment of disease severity of HS, including Hurley staging, HS Physician's Global Assessment (PGA), the modified Sartorius score (MSS), and the HS Severity Index (HSSI). Each of these assessments has both advantages and limitations in daily practice; there is currently no gold standard (5-8). The Hurley staging system is the simplest and most widely used instrument for HS classification in routine clinical practice. It classifies HS into three stages. HS-PGA is relatively easy to apply and is frequently used to measure clinical improvement in clinical trials of medical treatments (5). The system describes six disease stages, increasing in severity on a scale from 1 to 6 (9). MSS is a more detailed and dynamic classification system based on the counting of individual nodules and fistulas within seven anatomical regions. The system, which was developed by Sartorius et al. and later modified, is the first disease-specific instrument for dynamically measuring clinical severity of HS (10). The treatment of HS includes topical clindamycin, triamcinolone acetonide, clobetasol, topical resorcinol, oral antibiotics, hormonal therapy, oral retinoids, and biologic therapies (11). Biologic therapies are increasingly used in patients who fail to sufficiently respond to antibiotic and hormonal treatments. Adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept have all been tested in the treatment of HS but vary in effectiveness and in how well they have been studied. Subcutaneous weekly adalimumab (160 mg at week 0, 80 mg at week 2, and 40 mg each week thereafter) is the only biologic agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA) for the treatment of HS, and it is recommended as first-line therapy for patients with moderate-to-severe disease who are intolerant or unresponsive to oral antibiotics (12). The first male patient aged 59 years was referred to our Department with very long history of HS. The first symptoms had been unrecognized and presented as a pilonidal cyst 25 years ago as well as cysts on the intergluteal region treated with multiple surgical interventions and systemic antibiotics. The first hospitalization at our Department was in 2016. In addition to HS, the patient had diabetes mellitus (DM) type II and hypertension. A physical examination showed multiple abscesses, fistulas, and nodules in the axillary, inguinal, perianal, gluteal, and intergluteal regions; Hurley staging: stage II, PGA staging: IV, DLQI: 24 (Figure 1, Figure 2). Microbiological repeated swabs showed numerous bacteria such as Esch.coli, S.aureus, Serratia.spp, Enterococcus spp, St.epidermidis, and Proteus mirabilis. Laboratory tests which included complete blood cell count, biochemistry, serology for syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B and C infection together with chest X-rays were all within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasound examination found no abnormalities. Quantiferon test was positive. After the monotherapy with isoniazid, a repeated Quantiferon test two months later was negative. The patient was treated with betadine solution and pus drainage until 2018, when at the Department of Dermatology and Venerology prescribed adalimumab in doses of 80 mg initially, 40 mg ×2 on the first day and the day after that, then 80 mg after fifteen days followed by 40 mg every ten days. After 16 weeks of treatment with adalimumab, Hurley staging was II, PGA IV, DLQI 3. The second male patient aged 28 years was referred to our Department with a shorter history: the first symptoms were presented as pilonidal sinus in 2012, after that in 2015 as inflamed nodules and fistulas in the axillary and inguinal regions. In 2018, physical examination showed the same nodules with a more intense character as well as furuncles on the scalp and skin of the back, with Hurley staging stage II, PGA staging III, DLQI 14 (Figure 3, Figure 4). Until the disease was diagnosed, the patient was treated several times with peroral antibiotics, while laboratory tests which included complete blood cell count, biochemistry, serology for syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B and C infection together with chest X-rays were all within normal limits with the exception of elevated cholesterol (6.1). Abdominal ultrasound examination found no abnormalities. Quantiferon test was negative. The following therapy was administered during hospitalization: Humira (adalimumab) initial dose 160 mg, a dose of 80 mg after 14 days, and after 7 days 40 mg, in addition to local therapy with 10% resorcinol solution at the location of the skin changes. After 16 weeks of treatment with adalimumab, Hurley staging was II, PGA staging was III, and DLQI index was 3. Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic, recurrent inflammatory and debilitating skin disease of the terminal hair follicle that usually presents after puberty with painful, deep seated, inflamed lesions in the apocrine gland-bearing areas of the body, most commonly the axillary, inguinal, and anogenital region (3). Biological therapies have been increasingly used for patients who failed to sufficiently respond to antibiotics and hormonal treatments. Adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept have all been tested in the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa but vary in effectiveness and in how well they have been studied. Subcutaneous weekly adalimumab (160 mg at week, 80 mg at week 2, and 40 mg each week thereafter) is the only biologic agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA) for the treatment of HS and is recommended as first-line therapy for patients who moderate-to-severe disease and who are intolerant or unresponsive to oral antibiotics (5,12). Treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa remains a considerable challenge and should be individualized according to the state and extent of the disease. Therapeutic options for hidradenitis suppurativa were long restricted to the use of local disinfectants and systemic antibiotics as well as repeated incisions and drainage, which produce only short-term benefits. Our patients showed regression of lesions after sixteen weeks of biological therapy.",

    "abstract": "It is known that eosinophilia is associated with different inflammatory disorders including atopic dermatitis. The eosinophils and their toxic products are seen in tissue specimens from inflammation foci e.g. in asthma and their granule products seem to be major causes of the tissue destruction of epithelial cells in the airways. ECP levels have been found elevated in activated eosinophils like in atopic dermatitis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the values of ECP found in 80 children with atopic dermatitis (aged 1-7 years) and SCORAD index between 20-70.Fluoroenzymeimmunoassay UNI CAPR ECP (Pharmacia Diagnostic) in vitro test system for the quantitative measurement of Eosinophil Cationic Protein (ECP) in children serum with atopic dermatitis was performed. Uni CAP ECP assay is specifically for use with Uni CAP 100, a dedicated measuring instrument (2.5ml or 4ml vacutainer hemogard, SST glass tube). Anti-ECP, covalently coupled to ImmunoCAP, reacts with the ECP in the patient serum specimen. After washing, enzyme labeled antibodies against ECP are added to form complex. After incubation unbound enzyme anti ECP is washed away and the bound complex is then incubated with developing agent. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence of the evaluate is measurement. To evaluate the test results, the response for the patient samples are transformed to concentrations with the use of a calibration curve. Referent values were to 20 μ g/l. SCORAD index was calculated according to ETAC study group. ECP values in sera of 80 children were established between 3.25 to 75.7 μ g/l. Elevated ECP levels were found in 25 of children (20.8 to 75.7 μ g/l) mean value was 35.7μ g/l. The most elevated ECP values were in AD children with SCORAD index between 55 and 60. In 25 sera of children with atopic dermatitis ECP levels have been found elevated connected with activated eosinophils. Determination of released ECP may be one way to monitor conditions involving eosinophil activation and may be of value in monitoring the effect of therapy.",

    "abstract": "Dear Editor, Desmoplastic melanoma (DM) is a rare histological subtype of melanoma, usually presenting as a slowly-growing, amelanotic, discoid, and/or firm lesion composed of spindle cells with abundant collagen (1). It is more common on sun-exposed areas, especially on head and neck in elderly patients (2). Regional lymph node involvement is reported to be less frequent than in other cutaneous melanomas (3). Desmoplastic melanoma can clinically mimic a wide spectrum of benign and malignant lesions, including Bowen's disease, desmoplastic nevus, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, lentigo maligna, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, peripheral nerve sheath tumors, cysts, or hypertrophic/keloid scars (4). Regarding its appearance, at the time of diagnosis DM frequently presents as advanced lesions with deep infiltration. A 60-year-old man presented with an one-year history of an asymptomatic, erythematous, well-defined plaque in the right lumbar region (Figure 1). Dermatological examination revealed a 5×5 cm, pink/red infiltrated plaque accompanied by a 6 mm dark-brown melanocytic lesion. Dermoscopically, atypical vascular structures in the form of linear, irregular, and dotted vessels, milky-red areas, and atypical pigment network, and streaks were observed near the melanocytic lesion (Figure 2). A 4 mm punch biopsy was performed on the erythematous plaque next to the melanocytic lesion, and a dermal-based, paucicellular proliferation of atypical spindle cells without melanin in a sclerotic stroma was found histologically (Figure 3, a). Immunohistochemically, dermal spindle cells were stained with S-100 and HMB45 antibodies (Figure 3, b). The patient was histologically diagnosed with melanoma, of the desmoplastic subtype. The lesion was totally excised with 2 cm clear margins. A diagnosis of nonulcerated nodular melanoma with a Breslow thickness of 4 mm and a mitotic index 1/mm2 was established. Sentinel lymph node biopsy revealed no metastases. No systemic metastases were detected in PET-CT scanning and cranial magnetic resonance imaging. The patient remained under follow-up and has been free of any local recurrence or primary or systemic metastasis for 3 years. Dermoscopic characteristics of DM are not well known, probably due to it not being considered a melanocytic lesion. Debarbieux et al. first reported the dermoscopic features of desmoplastic melanoma in six cases (5). They found that only half of the cases presented one classical feature of a melanocytic lesion, whereas the other cases were diagnosed based on the presence of figures of regression such as white scar-like and peppering, multiple (>4) color, and melanoma-related vascular patterns (five out of six) such as linear-irregular vessels and milky-red areas (5). In the largest DM case series, Jaime et al. reported that all DM featured at least 1 melanoma-specific structure, with atypical vascular structures being the most common (6). Similarly, in our patient dermoscopy showed an atypical pigment network and streaks, atypical vascular structures, and milky-red areas, which is predictive for melanoma. We reported this case to serve as a reminder to consider desmoplastic melanoma in the differential diagnosis of pink tumoral lesions despite its rarity and atypical localization.",

    "abstract": "Dear Editor, Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is a subepidermal bulla, characterized by severe itching, lichenoid or nodular prurigo-like lesions, skin erosion, scars, milia, and nail dystrophy, resulting from COL7A1 mutation. Herein, we report a case of dominant DEB with a G2043R mutation in COL7A1. A-25-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our clinic for recurrent intense pruritis and hypertrophic scars on the abdomen (Figure 1, a). She presented with paper-like scars on her forehead, breast, back, buttock, and extremities (Figure 1, b) with mild toenail hypoplasia (Figure 1, c), but no symptoms on the fingernails, hair, teeth, or esophagus. She had developed erosions at the ankle joint a few days after birth. Her parents and four siblings had no related symptoms. She had been diagnosed with DEB at 11 months based on clinical and histopathological findings. Erythema, bullae, and skin ulcers had healed with scarring on the extensor surface of the lower legs at 7 years (Figure 1, d). Histopathological findings revealed subepidermal bulla with lymphocyte and eosinophil infiltration in the upper dermis (Figure 1, e). Immunofluorescence staining with type VII collagen antibody showed uneven faint localization at the basement membrane zone (Figure 1, f). Electron microscopy showed scanty and hypoplastic anchoring fibrils (Figure 1, g). Following ethical approval, informed consent was obtained in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines, DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes of the patient, and exome sequence analysis was performed. A heterozygous single nucleotide substitution c.6127G>A in exon 73 of COL7A1 was found, which converts glycine to arginine residue, designated p. G2043R. Since COL7A1 is a giant gene with 118 exons and 9276 base pairs, exome sequencing is convenient to determine the mutated gene. In dominant DEB, pathogenic mutations usually occur in glycine substitutions within the type VII collagen triple helix (1). The mutation impedes the trimer formation of collagen and disrupts the normal location of anchoring fibril. The particular localization of mutated collagen VII protein could vary based on the position of mutated glycine residue. In our patient, the mutated collagens were observed sparsely and unevenly at the basement membrane, but can accumulate granularly within the basal keratinocytes (2,3). G2043R mutation such as in the present case has been previously described with dominant DEB in Italian, Hungarian, Norwegian, Mexican, Scottish, Finnish, American, Chinese, and Japanese cases (1). Given the widespread geographical distribution of this mutation and its occurrence as a de novo event like in our case, G2043R can be one of the mutational hotspots in dominant DEB (1). Symptom severity in dominant DEB varies in the same mutation or intra-familial cases, and symptoms regress with age (4). The patient had severe blisters on her legs in early childhood; however, as her age increased, the hypertrophic or atrophic scars on the lower abdomen and extensor surface of her lower legs became the primary skin symptoms. It is presumed that some factor will compensate for the vulnerabilities.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) (Osler-Weber-Rendu Syndrome) is a rare autosomal dominant vascular disorder characterized by the presence of multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and recurrent bleeding episodes. The diagnosis is based on the Curacao criteria: (i) spontaneous recurrent epistaxis, (ii) mucocutaneous telangiectasia, (iii) AVMs of visceral organs, and (iv) first degree relatives with a similar condition (1). Due to a common genetic pathway and SMAD4 gene mutation, juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) may coexist with HHT (2). The disease burden is high in overlapping HHT/JPS, but digital clubbing may be the only physical finding. Continuous meticulous management may improve the quality of life and reduce the risk of complications. In 2000, a 15-year-old female patient was diagnosed with HHT based on epistaxis, multiple pulmonary AVMs, and a father who had similar symptoms. Other visceral AVMs were excluded. No telangiectasia was noted. On several occasions, pulmonary AVMs were managed with coil embolization (Figure 1), which successfully led to the resolution of dyspnea and cyanosis. Recurrent gastrointestinal bleedings led to severe transfusion-dependent anemia. Multiple polyps in the stomach, small intestine, and colon were repeatedly endoscopically removed, confirming the coexisting JPS. Genetic testing was not performed. Proctocolectomy was performed to prevent malignant transformation in the digestive tract. Telangiectasias are the dermatological hallmark of the HHT and occur in up to 90% of patients with the typical onset in childhood, becoming more apparent with increasing age. They are most frequently found on the face, with highest incidence on the nose, lips, tongue, and ears, followed by the fingertips, trunk, and feet; telangiectasia is recognized as the most common of the three criteria required for the diagnosis of HHT (1). Interestingly, no cutaneous telangiectasia developed in our patient during years of follow-up. However, pulmonary AVMs led to digital clubbing of her both fingers and toes (Figure 2). Digital clubbing is the focal enlargement of the connective tissue in the terminal phalanges, consequently changing the shape of nails, which become abnormally curved and shiny. It is associated with various infectious, neoplastic, inflammatory, and vascular conditions (3). Despite its well-known prevalence in certain conditions, the pathogenesis of this phenomenon remains elusive. Vascular, neural, and hormonal mechanisms have been considered, implicating the role of a wide range of substances, such as prostaglandins, bradykinin, estrogen, platelet-derived growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and growth hormone, however, none of these mechanisms provide a unifying explanation (4,5). In digital clubbing, the increased vascularity in the nail-bed leads to hyperplasia of fibrous tissue and edema, resulting in a loss of the hyponychial angle, fluctuance of the nail-bed, and an abnormal phalangeal depth ratio (5). The clinical assessment of the clubbing is based on the measurement of the distal phalangeal depth (DPD) of the finger (at the nail base) and the interphalangeal depth (IPD). A DPD/IPD ratio >1 is defined as clubbing, while a DPD/IPD ratio <1 is defined as normal (3). Clubbing is a potentially reversible phenomenon provided that the underlying condition is cured (4,5). In the context of pulmonary AVMs, abnormal communication between the pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein outside the capillary bed leads to right-to-left shunt physiology that clinically presents as dyspnea, cyanosis, and clubbing. Embolization of AVMs as the first-line therapy resolved systemic symptoms in our patient, and therefore no other treatment options were pulmonary considered further. However, 20 years later, despite the treatment, the severe clubbing of her both fingers and toes remained (Figure 2). Based on our findings, HHT should be considered in differential diagnosis of patients with digital clubbing resulting from AVMs, in particular when no skin telangiectasia is present.",

    "abstract": "Dear Editor, We present a case of proximal pyogenic granuloma in 4-year-old child. The patient presented to our Department due to a fast-growing lesion on the proximal part of the nail unit. The lesion had appeared over several weeks, and it was extremely painful for the child. On the day of the 1st visit, the lesion was not bleeding but was very painful during examination and photo-documentation. Clinically, it presented as an exogenous tumoral lesion of the proximal 1/3 of the nail, partially exulcerated with one part exhibiting coagulated hemorrhage and with uneven coloration (Figure 1). The lesion was not sharply demarcated. Dermoscopically, the majority of the lesion presented an unspecific dermoscopic structure, orange background color, and matched the criteria for a vascular lesion: few unspecific vessels and hemorrhage. The sticky fiber sign was also present (Figure 2). Since the lesion was fast-growing and due to the unspecific dermoscopic appearance, the child was referred to a pediatric surgeon and a complete excisional biopsy of the lesion was performed. The dermoscopy of pyogenic granuloma has been already described (1). The histology report confirmed pyogenic granuloma. Pyogenic granulomas of the nail unit are not a common finding, but our case confirms that even this location can be site of this type of benign lesion. It more commonly found in the periungual region and can be expected due to adverse effects of different kinds of systemic therapies. However, due to differential diagnosis that includes different types of tumors occurring at the nail unit, most importantly amelanotic melanoma and SCC, it is suggested to excise or take a biopsy of this type of lesion to be able to exclude aggressive tumor types, which are very rare but not impossible the in pediatric population (2). In cases of unquestionable diagnosis, several local treatments are available. Since the lesion presented a destructive nature in our case, we decided to perform excisional biopsy followed by histology, which in our case was both a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure.",

The purpose of this review is to provide an update of the biologic agents reported to have been used in treatment of diseases that affect the oral mucosa, as off-label indications. Identification of cases studies referring to the use of biologic agents in patients with Sjogren syndrome (including patients with MALT-lymphomas), pemphigus (vulgaris, foliaceous, paraneoplastic), mucous membrane pemphigoid, oral lichen planus, Behcet’s disease, orofacial granulomatosis, and recurrent aphthous ulceration (RAU), was achieved using Pubmed –Medline database , performing both electronic search (with key words infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, rituximab, efalizumab, epratuzumab and alefacept , oral diseases, oral manifestations, dermatologic diseases, immune mediated diseases, biologic agents , anti-TNF agents, monoclonal antibodies, anti-B cell agents, anti T-cell agents ) and hand search to identify articles that referred specifically to patients with oral involvement..  According to the literature so far the use of BAs in patients that suffered from refractory forms of the immune-related diseases of the oral mucosa seems in general a clinically encouraging therapeutic option, but not without side effects including secondary infections, and also with a questionable economic cost-effect. Indeed, more studies in larger groups and longer period of time are required in order to confirm their efficacy and safety.",

    "abstract": "While the first traces of interest in skin diseases date back to the 14(th) century recipes from Glagolitic manuscripts, the scientific beginnings of dermatovenereology might be associated with the beginning of the 19(th) century, when in the Rijeka region a 'new disease', called after the village of Škrljevo, was studied by Giovanni Battista Cambieri. This, however, has not been the only disease named after a Croatian toponym; in 1826, Luca Stulli of Dubrovnik was the first to describe the 'mal de Meleda', nowadays recognized as a form of hereditary palmoplantar keratoderma. In 1876, Carl Heizmann, a Croatian from Vinkovci by birth, was one of the founders of the American Dermatological Association. In 1894, the first department for dermatologic and venereologic patients was opened at Sestre milosrdnice (Sisters of Charity) Hospital in Zagreb. The beginning of the 20(th) century brought an accelerated development to Croatian dermatovenereology; in 1910, while still in its experimental phase, the drug Salvarsan was used in Zagreb for the treatment of syphilis. In 1921, the chair of dermatovenereology was established at Zagreb School of Medicine, and in 1927, Franjo Kogoj was the first to describe the spongiform pustule. In 1950, Ante Vukas from Rijeka developed a special method of epidermotectoscopy. If one remembers that the first history of AIDS was written by the Croatian Mirko Dražen Grmek, it would be allowed to concur that the history of dermatology and venereology on the Croatian soil has been characterized by a fascinating profusion and dynamism.",

    "abstract": "Caloric restriction (CR) extends the lifespan of diverse animal species and is currently the only therapeutic intervention known to attenuate aging and increase longevity in laboratory animals. The effect of CR on intrinsic skin aging is not well understood. To study this issue, we took advantage of transgenic alphaMUPA mice that spontaneously eat less (20-30%) when fed ad libitum and live longer compared to their wild type (WT) FVB/N control mice. Herein we determined morphometric skin parameters in young (6-7 months) and aged (17-18 months) alphaMUPA and WT mice. In addition, we transplanted skin grafts excised from the aged or young alphaMUPA and WT mice into both types of young mice, to test whether the systemic environments of alphaMUPA and WT mice could affect the grafts differently. The results have shown that the mean epidermal thickness, number of hair follicles and number of dermal blood vessels were similar in all four groups regardless of age or mouse type. In addition, the post-graft specimens of all four groups exhibited increase in all parameters measured, in particular a remarkable 6-7 fold increase in epidermal thickness. However, no significant differences were detected in the post-graft samples between the four experimental groups. Our findings indicate that, at least in FVB/N mice, parameters measured in normal or grafted skin depend primarily on the intrinsic cutaneous capacity rather than on circulating factors as determined by age or reduced calories.",

Patch testing with 5% nickel sulfate in vaseline applied on test strips was used to determine nickel sulfate hypersensitivity. During 36 months, 955 patients presenting to the Department Allergology Clinic underwent patch testing with a standard series of allergens including 5% nickel sulfate in vaseline. Positive reaction to nickel was recorded in 123 subjects. During the three-year period, positive reaction to nickel was recorded in 12.87% of study subjects, which was significantly lower than the prevalence of nickel hypersensitivity reported in the literature. Our study confirmed the lifestyle and habits to play a major role in the development of nickel hypersensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Alpha hydroxy acids (AHA's) diminish the cohesion between corneocytes at lower stratum corneum layers, affecting the intercellular ionic bonds. According to E.J. Van Scott, the weakening of cohesive intercellular forces happens via three mechanisms: through hydratisation reduction of electronegative ionic groups in the cells and changing the medium between charges: the dissolution of desmosomes in the intercellular space. There are visible effects of AHA-based cosmetic products on rejuvenation of skin after long-term usage. For cosmetic products based on alpha hydroxy acids (AHA), the pH value of the skin is one of the most important indicators of their efficacy, since their mechanism of action has a direct influence on the pH changes at the epidermal cell level. To examine skin pH changes total number of examined subjects was 120, aged 19 to 66. The pH was determined on the measurement points on left and right cheeks: 1. Before application of a cream ; 2. thirty minutes after application of a cream ; 3. four weeks after application of a particular cream, and eight weeks after application of a particular cream. Measurement method: electrometric in vivo method of skin pH determination digital pH meter, equipped with a Mettler single pore flat electrode measurement points: skin surface of 9 cm2 beside the left and right ear. Environmental conditions average: temperature = 21°C ; humidity 42% on first, 60% on second, and 50% on third and fourth measurements. Subject response: 50 out of 120 (42%). The placebo cream (A) and AHA's cream with pH 2, 9 (B) ; 3, 6 (C), and 5.1 (D) were tested. Average change of skin pH for A cream (pH 6, 1) was from 0.29 to – 0, 18 and – 0, 15 for B cream (pH 2.9) was from – 0, 36 to – 0, 11, and – 0, 32 to – 0, 46. For C cream (pH 3.6) from – 0, 12 to – 0, 20 and from – 0, 18 to – 0, 23, and for D cream (pH 5.1) from 0, 26 to 0, 33, and 0, 30 to – 0, 07. More acid AHA-based creams with lower pH of about three causes a greater decrease in skin pH than the creams with pH higher than five, which don't contain AHA's in the form of free acid, or the creams containing no AHA's at all. The improvement of the method of electrometric measurement of skin surface pH in vivo will allow a quick control of the skin pH decrease, which is the basic prerequisite for the efficacy of AHA-based cosmetic products. It is to be expected that further research into all the mechanisms of action of AHA's will help towards establishing these substances as more than a passing fashion, i.e. as a true contribution of our decade to the cosmetics of 21st century.",

    "abstract": "In the etiopathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD) there are well known interactions among genetic, environmental, skin barrier, pharmacologic, stress and other emotional problems and immune factors.Genetic determinate of expression of AD as a pure or mixed with concomitant respiratory or intestine allergy depends on genetic susceptibility. Although many genes are involved in the development of allergic diseases, there has been particular interest in chromosome 5q31-33, 3q21, 1q21 and 17q25.Immunologic abnormalities of type I and type IV reactions have been described in patients with AD. Immunologic triggers are aeroallergens, food allergens, microbial products, and autoallergens and contact allergens. The immunologic reactions determinate many features of AD, as well as a cell mediated or delayed hypersensitivity. Type 2 (TH2) and type 1 (TH1) cytokines contribute to the pathogenesis of skin inflammation in AD. The currently accepted model proposes a predominant TH2 cytokine milieu in the initiating stages or acute lesions of AD and a mixed TH1 and TH2 pattern in chronic lesions. This biphasic pattern of T cell activation has been demonstrated after epicutaneous application of aeroallergens using patch-test. After 24 hours increased expression of IL-4 mRNA and protein ; IL-5, IL-13 is observed, after which IL-4 expression declines to base levels. In contrast, IFN-γ mRNA is strongly expressed at the 48- to 72-h time points as development of TH1 lymphocytes is mediated by the cytokines IFN-γ and IL-2. Type 2 cytokines are thought to account for coincident eosinophilia and elevate IgE production and attraction of macrophages, which in turn produce IL-12, a known activator of the TH1-type immune response which suppress IgE production. So, AD skin contains an increased number of IgE-bearing Langerhans cells (LC) that, via the high-affinity IgE receptor FCє R1, is thought to bind allergens, as a major IgE binding receptor as there are several types of these receptors. LC play important role in cutaneous allergens presentation to TH2 cells via major histocompatibility molecules. These bridgings trigger a cascade of immunologic events. In chronic AD lesions LC are present in increased numbers and have increased amounts of IgE bound to high-affinity surface receptors. LC have been shown to be hyperstimulatory to helper T cells and can activate helper T cells to the TH2 phenotype in the initiating phase of the disease. Degranulation of eosinophils occurs in the dermis with the release of toxic proteins like major basic protein and could account for much of the inflammation. Mast cells are increased in number and produce mediators other than histamine that induce pruritus, and may have as effect on IFN-γ expression. Mast cells cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 are important for IgE production and mast cell chymase may induce eosinophil infiltration into AD lesional skin. There is elevated production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by peripheral monocytes. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has at least two potential roles in the initiation of AD. Firstly, it reduces IFN-γ production from helper T cells and thereby favoring initial, dominant TH2 immune response and, secondly, it directly enhances IgE production by B lymphocytes by increased secretion of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. Many lesions of AD result from scratching thereby it is tempting to speculate that immune perturbations in genetically predisposed individuals provoke the release of local pruritogens and keratinocyte-derived cytokines further drive the previously described immune response.",

    "abstract": "Sustaining a burn injury is often a traumatic experience, with long-term physical and psychosocial effects. The increasing numbers of survivors from burn injuries has focused research and clinical attention on the psychological consequences of such injuries. The objective of the authors was to analyse the recent literature regarding the prevalence of psychological problems in burn-injured patients as well as the optimal psychiatric treatment. Throughout case reports the authors described different clinical manifestations of these psychological problems. The recent literature suggests that the trauma of larger burn injuries can affect people in different ways: depression, regression, PTSD, anxiety and psychotic symptomatology are relatively common sequelae. A high percentage of burn patients have important predisposing factors for burn injuries, such as substance abuse, psychosis, organic brain syndromes and personality disorders, family dysfunction, or, in the case of burned children, frank neglect. The presence of psychiatric problems in burn patients has been found to have an impact of their burn care and long term adjustment. In case of the patients treated at the Clinic of Traumatology in Zagreb, all of them were hospitalised because of the serious burn injuries, and most of them had previous psychological problems. The first patient (M.P, male, age: 74) set herself on fire in a suicide attempt. Like most patients who have tried suicide by fire, he had serious third degree burns. They covered 45% of his body (total body surface area -TBSA). He died after 40 days of hospitalisation. The second patient (E.C., male, age: 59 ) was admitted to the hospital with third degree burns (TBSA: 40%). He developed depressive simptomatology. The third patient (A.D., male, age: 22) had a previous history of substance abuse. He was admitted to the hospital with third degree burns (TBSA:35%), and his hospital stay was 91 days. The manner in which the burn injury was sustained was hot water. The fourth patient (A.P., male, age: 63) suffered from alcohol dependence. He was admitted to the hospital with third degree burns (TBSA :30%), and his hospital stay was 109 days. The fifth patient (D.L., male, age:56) had a previous psychiatric history of psychotic disorder. He was admitted to the hospital with the third degree burns (TBSA:5%) Conclusion: In the process of monitoring and treatment of patients who suffer from burn injuries, psychological problems needs to be taken into account. It may be manifested through different symptoms, and confront clinicians with problems of optimal treatment that is required. In the holistic approach to the treatment of burn injured patients, psychiatric care is necessary to improve the health and the quality of life of these patien",

    "abstract": "At the beginning of the 28th year of the life of our Acta Dermatovenerologica Croatica Journal, we experienced so many challenges which are quite difficult to grasp of and which nobody could predicted in advance. It all began with some vague information from Wuhan about a new virus which was spreading quickly and which eventually led to a lock-down in our country as well. We had hoped that this would not have such a big impact on the life of the Journal, in fact we hoped that may some of our potential authors would have more time to finalize their previous research and send us their manuscripts. But everything changed in the early morning on March 22 when Zagreb experienced the most devastating earthquake in the last 140 years. We lost the building of the Department of Dermatology and Venereology which was the headquarters of the Journal as well as the building of the School of Medicine University of Zagreb where the server of our Journal was situated. Like many other buildings in Zagreb, both will be unusable for a long time. After overcoming our initial shock from the earthquake, we realized that our server had broken down and we are still having significant difficulties in getting all the data out of it. All of this has resulted in a large delay in the preparation of this issue, which we hope to compensate with the hard work of the editorial board and the editorial office. We have also introduced some changes. I would like to express my great gratitude to the longstanding Editorial assistant Mrs. Gordana Duckic who was part of the editorial team for many years and contributed a lot to the development of the Journal. I would like to welcome Mrs. Marijana Gelo who will be part of our editorial team in the future. We also have some new members of the Editorial Board, and hope to introduce some new members and other novelties during this special and challenging year. I hope you will enjoy reading articles in this issue and follow us in the future.",

    "abstract": "Episodes of excessive vasospasm are common in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon (RP). Pharmacological treatment may often result in side-effects such as hypotension, leading to discontinuation of treatment. Review of therapeutic interventions with regard to tendency towards hypotension was done in medical databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Medline to summarize the current state of the knowledge. Despite the episodes of blood pressure drops caused by hypotension, calcium channel blockers (CCB) have been widely used in RP as first-line treatment medication. The use of other CCB apart from nifedipine is controversial due to the variety of results in clinical trials. A clinical study comparing the efficacy and tolerability of losartan with nifedipine revealed a significant reduction in RP severity, frequency of episodes, and reported adverse effects. Application of oral sildenafil 100 mg/d as an add-on therapy increased microvascular blood flow in secondary RP, while being well-tolerated and with no withdrawal from the study. Topical vasodilators may be applied as an adjuvant therapy for patients with RP. Clinical studies approved 10% nifedipine cream and 10% nitroglycerine gel as an efficient RP therapy with side-effects comparable with placebo usage. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as cold avoidance, stress management, and smoking cessation are recommended in reducing episodes of RP. Calcium channel blockers, with a particular emphasis on nifedipine, in combination with non-pharmacological management seem to be the optimal way to treat the patients with a tendency to hypotension.",

    "abstract": "Naphthalanotherapy (NT) is a therapeutic procedure that uses mineral oil obtained from petroleum. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the duration of NT combined with an individually adjusted rehabilitation program (IARP) on pain, morning stiffness (MS), fatigue, and physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). A total of 29 consecutive patients with PsA were divided into two groups. Group 1 (n=17) participated in a two-week and Group 2 (n=12) in a three-week intervention program. Pain (using the Visual Analogue Scale - VAS), fatigue (VAS and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue - FACIT-F), duration of MS (minutes), and physical function (Health Assessment Questionnaire - HAQ) were assessed before and after therapy. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 20, with P<0.05. There was a significant improvement in VAS-pain, VAS-fatigue, MS, HAQ, and FACIT-F before vs after therapy: Group 1:5.88±1.62 vs 3.94±1.25, P=0.001; 6.59±1.73 vs 4.35±1.73, P=0.001; 35.47±31.64 vs 23.71±29.30, P=0.001; 1.43±0.78 vs 1.23±0.74, P=0.001; 25.88±10.89 vs 30.71±10.65, P=0.009; Group 2: 6.17±1.27 vs 3.92±1.44, P=0.001; 6.50±1.93 vs 3.75±1.71, P=0.001; 38.42±32.00 vs 21.25±17.31, P=0.006; 1.47±0.79 vs 0.93±0.54, P=0.008; 25.00±9.87 vs 36.83±7.20, P=0.001, respectively. Regarding the length of the therapy, significant difference was reached only in FACIT-F (P=0.009). Two-week and three-week NT combined with IARP are equally efficient in reduction of pain and MS, as well as in improving physical function in patients with PsA. The three-week program showed an additional effect on reducing fatigue assessed by the FACIT-F score.",

Two periods were investigated: June 1946 to February 1961 (the period of validity of the Orders of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany - SMAG) and March 1961 to August 1990 (period of validity of the GDR regulation).During the two periods of investigation, 3% of the women compulsorily committed to the closed venereology ward Leipzig-Thonberg were prostitutes. 9% of women were compulsorily committed as sexually promiscuous individuals during the first period of investigation, and 13% during the second period. During the first period, mainly adult women with a venereal disease were compulsorily committed. These women were treated for gonorrhea or syphilis. In contrast, the majority of compulsorily committed individuals during the second period were underage girls without a venereal disease. In conclusions: 1) Whereas mostly prostitutes and sexually promiscuous individuals were compulsorily committed to venereology wards in the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), the proportion of prostitutes and sexually promiscuous individuals in Leipzig-Thonberg was very small. 2) In the 1950s, mostly adult women with venereal diseases were compulsorily committed in the FRG and GDR. 3) A comparison with the closed venereology facility in Berlin-Buch (GDR) shows a similar age distribution among compulsorily committed women in the 1970s and a general decline of venereal diseases.",

The lesion had appeared over a period of six months, had an irregular color, non-specific dermoscopic features, and resembled squamous cell carcinoma. The physical examination revealed three more atypical melanocytic lesions (on the abdomen, back, and buccal mucosa), and multiple swollen occipital, postauricular, as well as superficial and deep cervical lymph nodes. After clinical evaluation, the patient reported having another in situ melanoma (submammary region) excised 7 years ago. All the lesions were excised and sent for histopathologic examination, which was compatible with primary cutaneous melanoma. Total body computed tomography revealed the presence of multiple visceral metastases, and the patient was referred to an oncologist. He did not consent to proceed to genetic testing. The occurrence of multiple primary melanomas (MPM) is a rare but recognized phenomenon. The estimated incidence of a second primary tumor ranges from 0.2% to 8.7% in large retrospective reviews. While 63% to 88% of patients with MPM are reported to have two primary tumors, the occurrence of more than four primary melanomas is considered exceedingly rare (1-2). Whether the presence of multiple primary melanomas is a function of increased genetic susceptibility of the individual, consistent exposure to a common exogenous promoter of malignancy, or a combination of these two factors remains to be elucidated. These patients should undergo intensive dermatologic screening for the rest of their lives and should consider genetic testing.",

    "abstract": "Dear Editor, Dapsone is a dual-function drug with antimicrobial and antiprotozoal effects and anti-inflammatory features (1). In dermatology, it is a first choice for conditions such as leprosy, IgA pemphigus, dermatitis herpetiformis, and linear IgA bullous dermatosis, or an adjunctive treatment for, e.g. bullous pemphigoid (BP) and pemphigus vulgaris (1). However, dapsone is associated with some adverse effects, including methemoglobinemia (1). Methemoglobin (MetHb) concentrations of less than 15% usually cause no symptoms in patients with normal hemoglobin concentrations (2). Herein, we report the case of a patient with BP who developed dyspnea because of dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia that was as mild as 4.7%. A 93-year-old man was diagnosed with BP based on skin manifestations (Figure 1, a and b), histopathological findings (Figure 1, c and d), and anti-BP180 NC16A antibody titer determined by chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (279 U/mL) 3 years earlier. His comorbidities included diabetes mellitus, chronic heart failure, right pleural effusion, and brain infarction. The patient had been successfully treated with oral prednisolone, so the steroid was tapered to 4 mg/day. The blisters recurred, however, and new ones kept developing even though the prednisolone was increased to 25 mg/day. Dapsone (75 mg/day) was begun as adjunctive treatment, and new blister formation ceased. At one week from dapsone initiation, the patient developed dyspnea, and his oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry decreased to 88% on room air. At presentation, his blood pressure was 118/78 mmHg, the heart rate was 95 beats/minute, and axillary temperature was 36.3 °C. Neurological examination and consciousness findings remained unchanged compared with findings before dyspnea onset. Chest examination showed normal breath and heart sounds, but lip and peripheral cyanosis was present. Blood tests revealed a white blood cell count of 12,920/μl; red blood cells, 370×104/μl; hemoglobin, 11.7 g/dl; and CMV antigenemia (or C7-HRP), negative. Chest CT and echocardiography indicated no remarkable change compared with imaging from one year earlier. Arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.454, PaO2 63.1 mmHg, PaCO2 35.4 mmHg, HCO3- 24.3 mmol/L, SaO2 92.4%, and MetHb of 4.7%. These findings indicated a saturation gap (difference between SpO2 and SaO2) induced by MetHb. Upon cessation of dapsone, MetHb levels and SpO2 returned to normal and the dyspnea resolved, implicating dapsone in the methemoglobinemia (Figure 1, e). Differential diagnoses were pulmonary disease, heart disease, neuromuscular disease, sepsis, and drug intoxication. These possibilities were ruled out by the physical examination, drug history, vital signs, blood tests, and chest CT and echocardiography. In normal individuals, MetHb levels are less than 1% (2). Healthy patients with normal hemoglobin concentrations develop cyanosis at MetHb level of 15-20%, dyspnea at 20-50%, and coma at 50-70%, and die at more than 70% (2). However, patients with hematologic disease, acidosis, or cardiopulmonary diseases, for example, present with symptoms even with MetHb levels less than 15% (2,3). We inferred that our patient presented with dyspnea even under mild methemoglobinemia because he had anemia, chronic heart failure, and right pleural effusion. The occurrence of dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia with obvious symptoms is rare (1,4). Clinicians should be aware that methemoglobinemia symptoms are influenced not only by MetHb concentrations but also by comorbidities.",

Many chemical mediators of itch have been described or are hypothesized such as histamine, prostaglandin E2, serotonin, opoid peptides, such hachykinins and interleukin-21. The pathophysiology of pruritus is reviewed, showing that itch and pain share the common neuroanatomic pathways but are distinct sensory modalities.\r\nPruritus, which is the most common dermatologic complaint (more than 50% of dermatologic patients), has an extensive differential diagnosis. It can present with or without skin eruptions. Positive diagnosis is frequently based on careful patient history, physical examination, and labortory evaluation.Primary dermatologic conditions associated with pruritus include inflammatory conditions, infestations or infections, and neoplastic conditions. Systemic disorders associated with pruritus include endocrinologic, hepatobiliary, hematologic and neoplastic disorders, and chronic renal failure. The best results in the management of pruritus are achieved by alleviating the underlying cause.

Our intention was to show difficulties in diagnostic management of this recurrent and complex psychiatric disorder which may inconvenience clinicians. Neither laboratory tests (including bacteriology) nor X-ray of the skull identified any significant pathology. Although histopathology excluded skin malignancy, it showed an unspecific pattern not attributable to the most probable skin conditions like pyoderma gangrenosum or infection. Psychiatric consultation was inconclusive. Despite undetermined diagnosis, the patient was eligible for reconstructive surgery, which restored his scalp coverage. Different skin conditions may share very similar spectra of clinical symptoms, and even deep medical investigation does not always enable us to define the observed condition. However, both laboratory and imaging tests are necessary to exclude infections or potential malignancies before the diagnosis of dermatitis artefacta is established, whereas psychiatric consultation may or may not identify mental issues.",

    "abstract": "Dear Editor, Linear immunoglobulin (Ig) A bullous dermatosis (LABD), one subtype of subepidermal autoimmune bullous skin diseases (AIBDs), is characterized by linear deposit of only IgA along the basement membrane zone (BMZ) on direct immunofluorescence (DIF) (1,2). Patients showing linear deposits of both IgA and IgG are diagnosed with linear IgA/IgG bullous dermatosis (LAGBD) (3,4). Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is another type of subepidermal AIBD characterized by clinically pruritic erythematous skin lesions with vesicles on the elbows, knees, and buttocks with granular IgA deposits of IgA by DIF (5). In this study, we report a Japanese case of a patient who showed possible concurrence of DH and LAGBD based on clinical, histological, and immunological findings. A 72-year-old Japanese man who had a past history of dyslipidemia and resected lung cancer but was not taking any medicines, presented with a one-year history of blistering skin lesions. Physical examination revealed erythemas and peripherally arranged vesicles and erosions on the bilateral elbows, knees, and the buttock (Figure 1, a-c). Mucous membranes were not involved. The results of all laboratory tests were within normal ranges, except for increased serum IgA level 351 mg/dL (normal ranges; 46-260 mg/dL). Skin biopsy histopathologically showed subepidermal blisters infiltrated with neutrophils and eosinophils (Figure 1, d). DIF showed deposits of IgG, IgA, and complement component 3 along the BMZ mainly in granular but partially in a linear pattern (Figure 1, e-g). Circulating IgG (Figure 1, h) and IgA (Figure 1, i) autoantibodies were not detected by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) of normal skin, however, circulating IgA (Figure 1, j) but not IgG (Figure 1, k) antibodies were bound to both the epidermal and dermal sides by IIF of 1M NaCl-split normal skin. Commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for BP180 NC16a domain, BP230, and type Vll collagen (MBL, Nagoya, Japan), showed negative results for both IgG and IgA antibodies. IgG in-house ELISA for full length BP180 was also negative. IgG and IgA immunoblotting analyses of different antigen sources, including normal human epidermal and dermal extracts, recombinant proteins of NC16a, and C-terminal domains of BP180 region, BP230, purified laminin 332, and concentrated culture supernatant of HaCaT cells for LAD-1, were all negative. IgA ELISAs of tissue- and epidermal-transglutaminases were negative (1.92 AU/mL and 20.98 AU/mL, respectively; normal range <22.0 AU/mL). The patient was successfully treated with only topical corticosteroids with occasional mild local relapses. Japanese DH is different from European DH in some respects, i.e., DH is very rare in Japan due to genetic/HLA difference, absence of celiac disease, and frequent fibrillar IgA deposition in DIF. Therefore, we believe that this case is interesting as a rare Japanese DH case with complicated conditions. The clinical and immunochemical characteristics in the present case were compatible for both DH and LAGBD. Clinical features of vesicles on erythemas on the knees and buttock suggested DH, while histopathological features were compatible with LAGBD but also with DH, DIF results suggested both LAGBD and DH, and the results of IIF of 1M NaCl-split skin suggested LAGBD. All biochemical studies for autoantigens were negative, which suggested DH. However, autoantigens are not clearly detected in many LAGBD cases, either. IgA anti-epidermal transglutaminase antibody, a DH marker, was negative, but the titer was relatively high but within normal range. Therefore, we considered that this case might have developed DH and LAGBD concurrently. However, there may be two other possibilities: [1] this case was DH and non-pathogenic circulating autoantibodies were secondary production, and [2] LAGBD cases may sometimes show granular-linear BMZ deposition of IgG and IgA. Future studies on similar cases are needed to clarify our speculations.",

The whole process should be observed and distinguished through the variable or prism of time. The fact that melanoma metastases are detected in visceral organs at the stage when they are macroscopically visible does not imply that their onset has occurred much earlier. Additionally, it is quite obvious that the entire process is not driven by melanoma but rather only the initial stage of metastatic cell dissemination, whereas the later stage of metastatic cell proliferation is driven by other factors, firstly by mutated genes in the presence of melanoma or without it. Dissemination of metastatic cells occurs at approximately the same time in all melanomas, at MIS transition to MM, but is not immediately followed by metastatic cell proliferation; instead, some time has to elapse for a particular gene mutation to occur, and this timing varies among melanomas. Following dissemination of metastatic cells to visceral organs, they remain inactive, and in this period the presence of melanoma is not necessary anymore for metastatic cell proliferation, as they are waiting for a signal to start multiplying. This is clearly discernible from the fact that melanoma is today detected and removed frequently and early, but visible metastases then develop in the absence of melanoma, which may also regress spontaneously. Accordingly, MM is no longer necessary for metastasis later on. Finally, let me rephrase the title: melanoma is only responsible for initial dissemination of metastatic cells, whereas subsequent proliferation of metastatic cells is driven by other factors, most probably mutated genes.",

    "abstract": "Dear Editor, Primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg-type (PCDLBCL-LT) is a rare and aggressive neoplasm. A timely diagnosis may prevent fatal outcomes; physicians should take this entity into consideration when assessing non-specific lesions on the lower limbs. We present a 69-year-old woman with a 1-month history of a firm plaque on her left leg. Physical examination revealed an asymptomatic, indurated, smooth, and erythematous plaque on the pretibial region of her left extremity (Figure 1, a). The rest of the physical examination was normal. Histological examination revealed cohesive sheets of a dense cell infiltrate in the dermis, composed of large round immunoblast-type cells with prominent nucleoli, and the presence of mitoses. Immunohistochemical stains were positive for CD20, Bcl2, and MUM1 (Figure 1, b-d). Additionally, c-MYC and Ki67 exhibited a 20% positivity; CD3 and CD10 were negative. The diagnosis of PCDLBCL-LT was established. Imaging and blood workup ruled out systemic involvement. Treatment with R-CHOP chemotherapy was initiated, with complete tumor regression by the third cycle. The patient completed 6 cycles and has remained disease-free after 18 months. Primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (CBCL) are lymphoproliferative disorders that appear on the skin without evidence of extracutaneous manifestations at the time of diagnosis (1). They represent 25 to 35% of all primary cutaneous lymphomas (2). In 2018, an updated version of the 2008 WHO-EORTC classification divided CBCLs into 5 subtypes: PCDLBCL-LT, primary cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (PCMZL), primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL), Epstein-Barr virus-positive mucocutaneous ulcer (EBVMCU), and intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (3). PCDLBCL-LT is the least common subtype, representing approximately 10% of all CBCLs and only 4% of all cutaneous lymphomas (2,3). Although the pathogenesis for most CBCLs is still unknown, positive serology for Lyme disease in a significant number of patients has been recognized as a probable etiologic association (4). PCDLBCL-LT is more frequent in women, and the mean age of presentation is 76 years. It usually presents as erythematous or bluish nodules, and up to 75% of the cases appears on one or both legs (1). Although infrequent, other locations have been reported, including the head, neck, trunk, and upper extremities (5). Workup should include a complete physical exam, skin biopsy, blood tests, and imaging (2,3). Histopathology shows a diffuse infiltrate in the dermis composed of large B-cells (centroblasts and/or immunoblasts) with extension to subcutaneous cellular tissue. These cells have round nuclei that are more than twice the size of normal lymphocytes, with prominent nucleoli. The immunophenotype of PCDLBCL-LT is CD20+, CD79a+, CD10-, and Bcl-6+/-, and strongly expresses Bcl-2, MUM1/IRF4, and FOX-P1 (1-3). Unlike the other indolent subtypes, PCDLBCL-LT is generally more aggressive with a poor prognosis. The 5-year disease survival rate is of approximately 50% (5). Management depends on the body surface area, location, and the patient's age and general health. To date, chemotherapy with R-CHOP remains the first line of therapy for PCDLBCL-LT, resulting in complete remission in up to 92% of cases (2). The prognostic characteristics of most PCDLBCL-LTs require timely and appropriate diagnosis and treatment.",

    "abstract": "Dear Editor, Maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis (MPCM), formerly telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans (TMEP), is an uncommon form of cutaneous mastocytosis first described on 1930 (1). It is more frequent in adults, and early diagnosis is crucial since it has been reported to be associated with serious underlying systemic disorders, such as myeloproliferative diseases and severe manifestations like anaphylaxis (2,3). Treatment of MPCM depends on the presence of systemic involvement and/or the clinical symptoms of the disease itself. A 52-year-old woman was referred to us with pruritic brown red telangiectatic macules located on her arms, chest, and back (Figure 1, a, b, c) that had appeared over a period of 5 years. The patient also reported photosensitivity and facial flushing. Physical examination revealed a positive Darier sign (Figure 1, d) without other clinical signs suggestive of systemic involvement (e.g. lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, malabsorption syndrome). Skin biopsy demonstrated abundant mast cells infiltration with granulomatic metachromasia (Giemsa stain; Figure 2, a) while immunohistochemistry demonstrated mast cells positivity in CD117/c-KIT (Figure 2, b). A detailed laboratory investigation was carried out, including complete blood count (IgE:1800 IU/mL), peripheral blood film examination, bone marrow biopsy, liver function tests, and serum tryptase levels (7 ng/mL). All performed tests were normal, thus excluding systemic disease. H1 receptor antagonists are considered the first-choice therapeutic option for control of symptoms among patients with skin mastocytosis (4,5). In our case, despite the standard application of an increased dose of different H1-receptor antagonists combined with topical steroid preparations, the patient showed no response to treatment and suffered a significant adverse influence on her quality of life and daily activities. Recent studies in single cases or small case-series have shown promising results for omalizumab in mastocytosis (6-8). Accordingly, our patient was switched to omalizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks for a one-year period. Both pruritus and flushing significantly improved after 2 months of treatment with only anti-IgE, and fully resolved during the fifth month of treatment. Almost 18 months, later the patient remains fully controlled with apparent significant improvement of her quality of life. The mechanisms of action for omalizumab in patients with mastocytosis are not well known. Omalizumab inhibits binding of IgE to the surface of mast cells and basophils by forming complexes with free IgE in serum, and this represents a possible explanation of the reduction of mast cell and basophil activation (9). In the future, omalizumab may be considered as a good alternative therapeutic option in cases where antihistamines have failed, though more research is necessary.",

One year later, a small erosion appeared at the same localization and healed spontaneously. During 1990, sharply delineated reddened patches on the nose and cheeks were observed. Unfortunately, she had no medical documentation about the previous diagnostic procedure and treatment. Only according to personal history data, she was at first treated with some intralesional injections, probably corticosteroids. Then she started with local application of 5-fluorouracil, Efudix cream. The above described centrofacial crust formation appeared during 3 to 4 month local application of 5-FU, twice daily because of suspect carcinoma of the skin, as patient said. Pathohistologic analyses of two biopsy specimens from the cheeks did not confirm either the above mentioned diagnosis, any of differential diagnostic skin diseases, too. She was only treated locally with antiphlogistics for three weeks. The result was complete regression of skin changes, suggesting that it was an extensive local skin reaction to the prolonged and uncontrolled application of the local cytotoxic drug 5-fluorouracil.",
