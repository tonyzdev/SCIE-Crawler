    "abstract": "We developed a set of informant-based items describing performance of activities of daily living (ADL) by patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) to identify which ADL are useful for assessment of patients in clinical trials. Evaluation of ADL is an important outcome measure in AD clinical trials. For clinical trial measurement, ADL should have broad applicability, good test-retest reliability, scaling to cover a range of performance, and sensitive to detect change in disease progression. A total of 45 ADL items developed from literature review and clinical experience were administered to informants of 242 AD patients and 64 elderly controls as part of the multicenter Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Instrument protocol. Half of the subjects were re-evaluated at 1 and 2 months and all at 6 and 12 months. Controls performed virtually all ADL items optimally at baseline and at 12 months. Among subjects with AD, 27 of the 45 ADL were widely applicable, i.e., performed at baseline or premorbidly by >90% of subjects; showed good test-retest reliability between baseline and 1 and 2 months; correlated with MMSE scores of AD patients cross-sectionally; and showed a decline in performance from baseline to 12 months in at least 20% of AD patients. ADL could be identified that capture change in functional ability in patients across the entire range of the MMSE. The remaining 18 ADL included several that may be useful for trials that target specific populations, e.g., women with AD. Because change on specific items depends on baseline MMSE, ADL evaluation should include items relevant to the severity of dementia of patients enrolled in a clinical trial …",

    "abstract": "Dementia is a growing public health problem for which early detection may be beneficial. Currently, the diagnosis of dementia in primary care is dependent mostly on clinical suspicion on the basis of patient symptoms or caregivers' concerns and is prone to be missed or delayed. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to ascertain the prevalence and contributing factors for missed and delayed dementia diagnoses in primary care. Prevalence of missed and delayed diagnosis was estimated by abstracting quantitative data from studies of diagnostic sensitivity among primary care providers. Possible predictors and contributory factors were determined from the text of quantitative and qualitative studies of patient, caregiver, provider, and system-related barriers. Overall estimates of diagnostic sensitivity varied among studies and seemed to be in part a function of dementia severity, degree of patient impairment, dementia subtype, and frequency of patient-provider contact. Major contributory factors included problems with attitudes and patient-provider communication, educational deficits, and system resource constraints. The true prevalence of missed and delayed diagnoses of dementia is unknown but seems to be high. Until the case for dementia screening becomes more compelling, efforts to promote timely detection should focus on removing barriers to diagnosis.",

This paper describes development of the battery and preliminary data from the initial UDS evaluation of 3268 clinically cognitively normal men and women collected over the first 24 months of utilization. The subjects represent a sample of community-dwelling, individuals who volunteer for studies of cognitive aging. Subjects were considered “clinically cognitively normal” based on clinical assessment, including the Clinical Dementia Rating scale and the Functional Assessment Questionnaire. The results demonstrate performance on tests sensitive to cognitive aging and to the early stages of Alzheimer disease in a relatively well-educated sample. Regression models investigating the impact of age, education, and sex on test scores indicate that these variables will need to be incorporated in subsequent normative studies. Future plans include: (1) determining the psychometric properties of the battery; (2) establishing normative data, including norms for different ethnic minority groups; and (3) conducting longitudinal studies on cognitively normal subjects, individuals with mild cognitive impairment, and individuals with Alzheimer disease and other forms of dementia.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiologic evidence suggests that individuals with higher IQ, education, occupational attainment, or participation in leisure activities have a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer disease (AD). The concept of cognitive reserve (CR) posits that individual differences in how tasks are processed provide differential reserve against brain pathology or age-related changes. This may take 2 forms. In neural reserve, preexisting brain networks that are more efficient or have greater capacity may be less susceptible to disruption. In neural compensation, alternate networks may compensate for pathology's disruption of preexisting networks. Imaging studies have begun to identify the neural substrate of CR. Because CR may modulate the clinical expression of AD pathology, it is an important consideration in studies of “preclinical” AD and treatment studies. There is also the possibility that directly enhancing CR may help forestall the diagnosis of AD.",

    "abstract": "Background: Several sets of diagnostic criteria have been published for vascular dementia since the 1960s. The continuing ambiguity in vascular dementia definition warrants a critical reexamination. Methods: Participants at a special symposium of the International Society for Vascular Behavioral and Cognitive Disorders (VASCOG) in 2009 critiqued the current criteria. They drafted a proposal for a new set of criteria, later reviewed through multiple drafts by the group, including additional experts and the members of the Neurocognitive Disorders Work Group of the fifth revision of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) Task Force. Results: Cognitive disorders of vascular etiology are a heterogeneous group of disorders with diverse pathologies and clinical manifestations, discussed broadly under the rubric of vascular cognitive disorders (VCD). The continuum of vascular cognitive impairment is recognized by the categories of Mild Vascular Cognitive Disorder, and Vascular Dementia or Major Vascular Cognitive Disorder. Diagnostic thresholds are defined. Clinical and neuroimaging criteria are proposed for establishing vascular etiology. Subtypes of VCD are described, and the frequent cooccurrence of Alzheimer disease pathology emphasized. Conclusions: The proposed criteria for VCD provide a coherent approach to the diagnosis of this diverse group of disorders, with a view to stimulating clinical and pathologic validation studies. These criteria can be harmonized with the DSM-5 criteria such that an international consensus on the criteria for VCD may be achieved.",

This ambiguity may be related to factors such as the age and gender of subjects with dementia. Therefore, the objective of this study was to calculate the relative frequencies of AD, LBD, VaD, FTD, and HS among 382 subjects with dementia from the State of Florida Brain Bank and to study the effect of age and gender on these frequencies. AD was the most frequent pathologic finding (77%), followed by LBD (26%), VaD (18%), HS (13%), and FTD (5%). Mixed pathology was common: Concomitant AD was present in 66% of LBD patients, 77% of VaD patients, and 66% of HS patients. The relative frequency of VaD increased with age, whereas the relative frequencies of FTD and LBD declined with age. Males were overrepresented among those with LBD, whereas females were overrepresented among AD subjects with onset age over 70 years. These estimates of the a priori probabilities of dementing disorders have implications for clinicians and researchers.",

At present, a number of unvalidated CGIC scales are used in clinical trials, with various methods for making ratings. The ADCS-CGIC was designed on the basis of a survey of ADCS clinicians and by adapting existing instruments. It includes an organized but unstructured format, with which a clinician can address clinically relevant change. The instrument's reliability and validity were assessed in a prospective trial of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy subjects over a 12-month period. It showed good short-term reliability at 1 and 2 months, with 90 and 94% of AD subjects, respectively, rated as having changed not at all or only minimally. The ADCS-CGIC's face validity was demonstrated by untreated AD subjects rated as having worsened over time at both 6 months (56% rated as having worsened) and 12 months (81% rated as having worsened), whereas only 2% of control subjects showed minimal worsening. As a measure of predictive validity, ADCS-CGIC ratings at 12 months were significantly associated with change on four severity scales. As with other measures, change ratings were sensitive to dementia severity. Moderately impaired subjects showed greater worsening than other subjects. ADCS-CGIC ratings of greater worsening were made after the informant interview, regardless of whether informants or subjects were interviewed first. The ADCS-CGIC is a valid and reliable instrument for use in clinical trials.",

As part of an overall ADCS protocol to develop new instruments to be used in trials of treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD), patients with mild to moderate AD and cognitively normal elderly were administered a battery of five tests at least three times over 1 year. The tests included word list learning with delayed free recall, a recognition memory test for faces, a series of letter and digit cancellation tests to measure concentration, tests of praxis, and a series of maze completion tasks designed to assess planning and executive function. A version of the digit cancellation task was reliable and sensitive to a broad range of dementia severity so that it could provide a useful addition to the present version of the ADAS. Performance on the word learning task with delayed recall and a subset of the mazes task were impaired even in mild AD, so these tasks may be useful in trials involving mild or at-risk subjects. Performances on the facial recognition task and on the praxis tasks were not related to dementia severity, so these tasks would not be useful to evaluate treatments. Therefore, the major outcome of this investigation was the identification of some potential addtions to the present ADAS that extend both the cognitive domains and the range of symptom severity covered.",

The calculations were based on worldwide demographics of the elderly and age-specific prevalence and incidence values of dementia, estimated from a meta-analysis. In a sensitivity analysis, different prevalence sources were used. The worldwide number of persons with dementia in 2000 was estimated at about 25 million persons. Almost half of the demented persons (46%) lived in Asia, 30% in Europe, and 12% in North America. Fifty-two percent lived in less developed regions. About 6.1% of the population 65 years of age and older suffered from dementia (about 0.5% of the worldwide population) and 59% were female. The number of new cases of dementia in 2000 was estimated to be 4.6 million. The forecast indicated a considerable increase in the number of demented elderly from 25 million in the year 2000 to 63 million in 2030 (41 million in less developed regions) and to 114 million in 2050 (84 million in less developed regions). In conclusion, the majority of demented elders live in less developed regions, and this proportion will increase considerably in the future.",

Overall, 51 studies (58%) reported significant effects of lower education on risk for dementia, whereas 37 studies (42%) reported no significant relationship. A relationship between education and risk for dementia was more consistent in developed regions compared with developing regions. Age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographical region moderated the relationship.Lower education was associated with a greater risk for dementia in many but not all studies. The level of education associated with risk for dementia varied by study population and more years of education did not uniformly attenuate the risk for dementia. It seemed that a more consistent relationship with dementia occurred when years of education reflected cognitive capacity, suggesting that the effect of education on risk for dementia may be best evaluated within the context of a lifespan developmental model.",

Six raters administered the Folstein Mini-Mental State to 22 of these stable elderly subjects, and five raters administered the standardized version to 26 of these subjects. Each subject was tested on three different occasions 1 week apart. Each rater tested 4-6 subjects at the first and third weeks and 4-6 different subjects at the second week. The analytic technique used was one-way analysis of variance to estimate the interrater variance and the intrarater variance. Results The intrarater variance on all occasions was reduced by 86% and the interrater variance was reduced by 76% when the Standardized Mini-Mental State was used; the reductions in variance were significant (p less than 0.003). The intraclass correlation for the Mini-Mental State was 0.69; for the standardized version it was 0.90. It took less time to administer the Standardized Mini-Mental State than the Mini-Mental State. Conclusions The Standardized Mini-Mental State had better reliability than the Mini-Mental State in this study group. Although the improved reliability of the Standardized Mini-Mental State was achieved by reducing measurement noise, this advantage would likely occur in a broad spectrum of patients.",

Review of various consortium data shows that more than 30% of AD cases exhibit cerebrovascular pathology. However, certain vascular lesions such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, microvascular degeneration, and periventricular white matter lesions are evident in almost all cases of AD. Whether these vascular lesions are coincidental or causal in the pathogenetic processes of AD remains to be defined. Although systemic vascular influences such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, and other cardiovascular disturbances may be responsible for such pathology in AD, it is equally intriguing that about one third of patients diagnosed with vascular dementia (VaD) will have AD-type pathology at autopsy. Moreover, previous studies have revealed that deficits in cholinergic indices related to the basal forebrain neurones are apparent in multi-infarct dementia. In this short review, we evaluate cerebrovascular pathology of AD in light of peripheral vascular pathophysiology implicated in the etiopathogenesis of the dementia. We also consider pathological findings in relation to genetic influences such as apolipoprotein E that may shed light on the link between AD and VaD. In view of these commonalties, it is reasonable to consider the same treatment strategies for both AD and VaD.",

This work reports projections of the incidence of Alzheimer disease(AD) that will occur among older Americans in the future. Education adjusted age-specific incidence rates of clinically diagnosed probable AD were obtained from stratified random samples of residents 65 years of age and older in a geographically defined community. These rates were applied to U.S. Census Bureau projections of the total U.S. population by age and sex to estimate the number of people newly affected each year. The annual number of incident cases is expected to more than double by the midpoint of the twenty-first century: from 377,000 (95% confidence interval = 159,000–595,000) in 1995 to 959,000 (95% confidence interval = 140,000–1,778,000) in 2050. The proportion of new onset casess who are age 85 or older will increase from 40% in 1995 to 62% in 2050 when the youngest of the baby boomers will attain that age. Without progress in preventing or delaying onset of Alzheimer disease, both the number of people with Alzheimer disease and the proportion of the total population affected will increase substantially.",

    "abstract": "The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was recently proposed as a cognitive screening test for milder forms of cognitive impairment, having surpassed the well-known limitations of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). This study aims to validate the MoCA for screening Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD) through an analysis of diagnostic accuracy and the proposal of cut-offs. Patients were classified into 2 clinical groups according to standard criteria: MCI (n=90) and AD (n=90). The 2 control groups (C-MCI: n=90; C-AD: n=90) consisted of cognitively healthy community dwellers selected to match patients in sex, age, and education. The MoCA showed consistently superior psychometric properties compared with the MMSE, and higher diagnostic accuracy to discriminate between MCI (area under the curve=0.856; 95% confidence interval, 0.796-0.904) and AD patients (area under the curve=0.980; 95% confidence interval, 0.947-0.995). At an optimal cut-off of below 22 for MCI and below 17 for AD, the MoCA achieved significantly superior values in comparison with MMSE for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and classification accuracy. Furthermore, the MoCA revealed higher sensitivity to cognitive decline in longitudinal monitoring. This study provides robust evidence that the MoCA is a better cognitive tool than the widely used MMSE for the screening and monitoring of MCI and AD in clinical settings.",

There are now more than 1000 scales available to measure QoL, and it is important that they are assessed for reliability and validity. This study aims to assess the reliability and validity of the Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD) scale, which is dementia specific and brief and uses the patient's own responses. Two separate samples of people with dementia (sample 1, n = 60; sample 2, n = 201) were assessed. Five focus groups were conducted involving both people with dementia and their caregivers; the focus groups showed that people with dementia had higher hopes for their QoL than their caregivers did for them. Questionnaires about the scale were completed by 71 health care professionals working with people with dementia. The scale was found to have good content validity with no additional items required and all items necessary. It also correlated well with the Dementia Quality of Life scale (0.69) and with the Euroqol-5D scale (0.54), indicating good criterion concurrent validity. Construct validity was also good with the principal components analysis showing all 13 items of the QoL-AD loaded on component 1. Interrater reliability was excellent with all Cohen's kappa values >0.70. Internal consistency was excellent with a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.82. Some people with severe dementia and a Mini-Mental State Examination score as low as 3 were able to satisfactorily complete the QoL-AD. The QoL-AD has very good psychometric properties and can be completed with people with a wide range of severity of dementia.",

This paper describes the history of Version 3 development and the UDS data that are freely available to researchers. Methods: UDS Version 3 was developed after years of coordination between the National Institute on Aging-appointed Clinical Task Force (CTF), clinicians from ∼30 ADCs, and the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC). The CTF recognized the need for updates to align with the state of the science in dementia research, while being flexible to the diverse needs and diseases studied at the ADCs. Version 3 also developed a nonproprietary neuropsychological battery. Results: This paper focuses on the substantial Version 3 changes to the UDS forms related to clinical diagnosis and characterization of clinical symptoms to match updated consensus-based diagnostic criteria. Between March 2015 and March 2018, 4820 participants were enrolled using UDS Version 3. Longitudinal data were available for 25,337 of the 37,568 total participants using all UDS versions. Discussion: The results from utilization of the UDS highlight the possibility for numerous research institutions to successfully collaborate, produce, and use standardized data collection instruments for over a decade.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiologic evidence suggests that individuals with higher IQ, education, occupational attainment, or participation in leisure activities have a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer disease (AD). The concept of cognitive reserve (CR) posits that individual differences in how tasks are processed provide differential reserve against brain pathology or age-related changes. This may take 2 forms. In neural reserve, preexisting brain networks that are more efficient or have greater capacity may be less susceptible to disruption. In neural compensation, alternate networks may compensate for pathology's disruption of preexisting networks. Imaging studies have begun to identify the neural substrate of CR. Because CR may modulate the clinical expression of AD pathology, it is an important consideration in studies of \"preclinical\" AD and treatment studies. There is also the possibility that directly enhancing CR may help forestall the diagnosis of AD.",

    "abstract": "Debate exists regarding differences in the prevalence of Alzheimer disease (AD) in African Americans and Hispanics in the United States, with some evidence suggesting that the prevalence of AD may be considerably higher in these groups than in non-Hispanic whites. Despite this possible disparity, patients of minority ethnoracial groups often receive delayed diagnosis or inadequate treatment for dementia. This review investigates these disparities by conceptualizing the dementia disease process as a product of both biological and cultural factors. Ethnoracial differences in biological risk factors, such as genetics and cardiovascular disease, may help to explain disparities in the incidence and prevalence of AD, whereas race-specific cultural factors may impact diagnosis and treatment. Cultural factors include differences in perceptions about what is normal aging and what is not, lack of adequate access to medical care, and issues of trust between minority groups and the medical establishment. The diagnosis of AD in diverse populations may also be complicated by racial biases inherent in cognitive screening tools widely used by clinicians, but controlling for literacy level or using savings scores in psychometric analyses has the potential to mitigate these biases. We also suggest that emerging biomarker-based diagnostic tools may be useful in further characterizing diverse populations with AD. Recognizing the gap in communication that exists between minority communities and the medical research community, we propose that education and outreach are a critical next step in the effort to understand AD as it relates to diverse populations.",

There are limited data available on the prevalence and incidence of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and nonamnestic mild cognitive impairment (naMCI) from population-based studies. The Einstein Aging Study, a systematically recruited community-based cohort of 1944 adults aged 70 or older (1168 dementia free at baseline; mean age, 78.8 y; average follow-up, 3.9 y), provides the opportunity to examine the prevalence and incidence rates for dementia, Alzheimer dementia (AD), aMCI, and naMCI by demographic characteristics. Dementia prevalence was 6.5% (4.9% AD). Overall dementia incidence was 2.9/100 person-years (2.3/100 person-years for AD). Dementia and AD rates increased with age but did not differ by sex. Prevalence of aMCI was 11.6%, and naMCI prevalence was 9.9%. aMCI incidence was 3.8 and naMCI incidence was 3.9/100 person-years. Rates of aMCI increased significantly with age in men and in blacks; sex, education, and race were not significant risk factors. In contrast, naMCI incidence did not increase with age; however, blacks were at higher risk compared with whites, even when controlling for sex and education. Results highlight the public health significance of preclinical cognitive disease.",

We analyzed 1.5-T brain magnetic resonance imaging data from 46 cognitively normal elderly individuals (NC), 33 mild cognitive impairment and 43 AD patients. Hippocampal and ventricular analyses were conducted with 2 novel semiautomated segmentation approaches followed by the radial distance mapping technique. Multiple linear regression was used to assess the effects of age and diagnosis on hippocampal and ventricular volumes and radial distance. In addition, 3-dimensional map correction for multiple comparisons was made with permutation testing. As expected, most significant hippocampal atrophy and ventricular enlargement were seen in the AD versus NC comparison. Mild cognitive impairment patients showed intermediate levels of hippocampal atrophy and ventricular enlargement. Significant effects of age on hippocampal volume and radial distance were seen in the pooled sample and in the NC and AD groups considered separately. Age-associated differences were detected in all hippocampal subfields and in the frontal and body/occipital horn portions of the lateral ventricles. Aging affects both the hippocampus and lateral ventricles independent of AD pathology, and should be included as covariate in all structural, hippocampal, and ventricular analyses when possible.",

Twenty nondiabetic subjects with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to AD were randomized to receive metformin then placebo for 8 weeks each or vice versa. CSF and neuroimaging (Arterial Spin Label MRI) data were collected for biomarker analyses, and cognitive testing was performed. Metformin was found to be safe, well-tolerated, and measureable in CSF at an average steady-state concentration of 95.6 ng/mL. Metformin was associated with improved executive functioning, and trends suggested improvement in learning/memory and attention. No significant changes in cerebral blood flow were observed, though post hoc completer analyses suggested an increase in orbitofrontal cerebral blood flow with metformin exposure. Further study of these findings is warranted.",

The intervention group performed exercises specifically designed to improve auditory processing speed and accuracy for 100 min/d, 5 d/wk for 6 weeks; the control group performed more passive computer activities (reading, listening, visuospatial game) for similar amounts of time. Subjects had a mean age of 74 years and 60% were men; 77% successfully completed training. On our primary outcome, Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status total scores improved 0.36 standard deviations (SD) in the intervention group (P=0.097) compared with 0.03 SD in the control group (P=0.88) for a nonsignificant difference between the groups of 0.33 SD (P=0.26). On 12 secondary outcome measures, most differences between the groups were not statistically significant. However, we observed a pattern in which effect sizes for verbal learning and memory measures tended to favor the intervention group whereas effect sizes for language and visuospatial function measures tended to favor the control group, which raises the possibility that these training programs may have domain-specific effects. We conclude that intensive, computer-based mental activity is feasible in subjects with mild cognitive impairment and that larger trials are warranted.",

    "abstract": "A recent paper by Bialystok et al in Neuropsychologia (vol. 45, pgs. 459 to 464) suggested that early bilingualism produced a statistically significant 4.1-year delay in onset of memory loss symptoms in older individuals with Alzheimer disease, possibly reflecting an increase in the cognitive reserve of these individuals. That study focused on multilingual elderly patients of whom 90% were immigrants. Our memory clinic, in Montreal Canada, has the advantage of having a large set of individuals who are either multilingual immigrants to Canada, or who are nonimmigrants but raised in both official languages of Canada—French and English. We thus attempted to replicate the above findings using a larger cohort in a different setting. We examined age at diagnosis of Alzheimer disease and age at symptom onset for all unilingual versus multilingual participants, and then for those who were nonimmigrant English/French bilinguals. Overall, we found a small but significant protective effect of more than 2 languages spoken, but we found no significant benefit in bilinguals overall in relation to age at diagnosis or age at symptom onset. However, in the immigrant group, the results mirrored those of Bialystok et al with 2 or more languages delaying the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease by almost 5 years. A trend toward the same effect was also seen in nonimmigrants whose first language was French. In contrast, in nonimmigrants whose first language was English, no such effect was found. These results are discussed in relation to the earlier findings and the theory of cognitive reserve.",

Over a 20-year period, 40 published articles satisfied the inclusion criteria. Only 4 of these were qualitative and 5 were cross-national. The review revealed a lack of consistency across studies regarding how knowledge was operationalized, approaches to sampling, response rates, and data collection instruments used including validated scales. A consistent finding across the vast majority of studies was the only fair to moderate knowledge and understanding the general public had. The most common misconception was that dementia was a normal part of aging and there was a lack of clarity about at which point normal age-related memory loss problems become severe enough to indicate dementia. Knowledge of dementia was found to be particularly poor among racial and ethnic minority groups where several myths about causes of dementia were found. Findings point to the need for more educational and advocacy programmes on dementia to be developed particularly in low-income to middle-income countries.",

    "abstract": "Although persons with dementia are frequently hospitalized, relatively little is known about the health profile, patterns of health care use, and mortality rates for patients with dementia who access care in the emergency department (ED). We linked data from our hospital system with Medicare and Medicaid claims, Minimum Data Set, and Outcome and Assessment Information Set data to evaluate 175,652 ED visits made by 10,354 individuals with dementia and 15,020 individuals without dementia over 11 years. Survival rates after ED visits and associated charges were examined. Patients with dementia visited the ED more frequently, were hospitalized more often than patients without dementia, and had an increased odds of returning to the ED within 30 days of an index ED visit compared with persons who never had a dementia diagnosis (odds ratio, 2.29; P<0.001). Survival rates differed significantly between patients by dementia status (P<0.001). Mean Medicare payments for ED services were significantly higher among patients with dementia. These results show that older adults with dementia are frequent ED visitors who have greater comorbidity, incur higher charges, are admitted to hospitals at higher rates, return to EDs at higher rates, and have higher mortality after an ED visit than patients without dementia.",

    "abstract": "The initiation of Alzheimer disease (AD) prevention studies has placed greater emphasis on the need to accurately detect individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) given their increased risk for developing AD. Several studies reporting on the incidence and prevalence of aMCI have also found that a substantial number of aMCI cases at baseline assessments revert to normal cognition at subsequent assessments. This instability presents a major challenge to intervention studies aimed at preventing the onset of clinical symptoms associated with aMCI. Reversion rates from 25 studies were used for this meta-analysis which found an overall reversion rate of approximately 24%. When the studies were separated by their setting (community vs. clinic), substantial differences in reversion rates were noted with clinic-based studies having a much lower reversion rate (14%) than community-based studies (31%). North American and European studies had high heterogeneity of reversion rates, whereas Asian studies had moderate levels of heterogeneity and significantly lower rates of reversion. Continued improvement in diagnostic and classification methodologies may help in more accurately identifying aMCI cases which are less likely to revert to normal cognition.",

The present study examined the relation between use of vitamin E and vitamin C and incident Alzheimer disease in a prospective study of 633 persons 65 years and older. A stratified random sample was selected from a disease-free population. At baseline, all vitamin supplements taken in the previous 2 weeks were identified by direct inspection. After an average follow-up period of 4.3 years, 91 of the sample participants with vitamin information met accepted criteria for the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. None of the 27 vitamin E supplement users had Alzheimer disease compared with 3.9 predicted based on the crude observed incidence among nonusers (p = 0.04) and 2.5 predicted based on age, sex, years of education, and length of follow-up interval (p = 0.23). None of the 23 vitamin C supplement users had Alzheimer disease compared with 3.3 predicted based on the crude observed incidence among nonusers (p = 0.10) and 3.2 predicted adjusted for age, sex, education, and follow-up interval (p = 0.04). There was no relation between Alzheimer disease and use of multivitamins. These data suggest that use of the higher-dose vitamin E and vitamin C supplements may lower the risk of Alzheimer disease.",

Patients with AD were randomly assigned to receive either the cognitive intervention or a mock (placebo) intervention for 5 weeks. The placebo group then crossed over to receive the intervention. During the intervention, AD patients showed significant improvement in recall of personal information, face-name recall, and performance on the Verbal Series Attention Test. Improvement did not generalize to additional neuropsychologic measures of dementia severity, verbal memory, visual memory, word generation, or motor speed, or to caregiver-assessed patient quality of life. Results suggest that although face-name training, spaced retrieval, and cognitive stimulation may produce small gains in learning personal information and on a measure of attention, improvement does not generalize to overall neuropsychologic functioning or patient quality of life.",

Data for this study was collected from 434 individuals consecutively evaluated at a university-based Alzheimer's Center. A total of 96 participants were diagnosed with MCI, 105 were cognitively normal, and 233 had dementia. Informant ratings of participants' abilities were obtained across different functional domains reflecting everyday abilities related to memory, language, visual spatial abilities, planning, organization, and divided attention. As expected, the demented group was significantly more impaired than the healthy control and MCI groups across all of the functional domains. The MCI group also showed significantly more functional impairment relative to healthy controls in all of the functional domains. Examination of the effect sizes as a measure of the magnitude of functional impairment in the MCI groups relative to controls showed that the greatest degree of impairment occurred within the Everyday Memory domain. The current findings suggest that individuals with MCI demonstrate deficits in a wide range of everyday functions but that the magnitude of these changes is greatest for those functional abilities that rely heavily on memory.",

    "abstract": "Vascular risk factors for Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) have been evaluated; however, few studies have compared risks by dementia subtypes and sex. We evaluated relationships between cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, and obesity), events (stroke, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and myocardial infarction), and subsequent risk of AD and VaD by sex in a community-based cohort of 3264 Cache County residents aged 65 or older. Cardiovascular history was ascertained by self-report or proxy-report in detailed interviews. AD and VaD were diagnosed using standard criteria. Estimates from discrete-time survival models showed no association between self-reported history of hypertension and high cholesterol and AD after adjustments. Hypertension increased the risk of VaD [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 2.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95-7.44]. Obesity increased the risk of AD in females (aHR 2.23, 95% CI 1.09-4.30) but not males. Diabetes increased the risk of VaD in females after adjustments (aHR 3.33, 95% CI 1.03-9.78) but not males. The risk of VaD after stroke was increased in females (aHR 16.90, 95% CI 5.58-49.03) and males (aHR 10.95, 95% CI 2.48-44.78). The results indicate that vascular factors increase risks for AD and VaD differentially by sex. Future studies should focus on specific causal pathways for each of these factors with regard to sex to determine if sex differences in the prevalence of vascular factors have an influence on sex differences in dementia risk.",

    "abstract": "A cascade of pathophysiological events is triggered in Alzheimer disease (AD) that ultimately involves common cellular signaling pathways and leads to cellular and network dysfunction, failure of neurotransmission, cell death, and a common clinical outcome. The process is asynchronous, meaning that viable neurons remain as targets for therapy even in the diseased state, and each stage of the cascade affords the possibility for therapeutic intervention. Cholinesterase inhibitors are the only available treatment in the United States for patients with mild to moderate AD, helping maintain cognitive and functional abilities in most patients and conferring beneficial behavioral effects in some. Memantine is an NMDA receptor antagonist that has recently been approved in Europe for treatment of moderately severe to severe AD and is under investigation in the United States. Its mechanism of action may include enhanced neurotransmission in several systems as well as antiexcitotoxic effects. There are data regarding the effectiveness of the combination of memantine with cholinesterase inhibitors that will be useful for the practicing clinician. Other agents have shown some benefit in clinical trials, including the antioxidants vitamin E, selegiline, and Ginkgo biloba extracts, although the weight of evidence regarding their effects is not sufficient to define clinical practice. Potential future therapies currently are in development that target multiple aspects of the illness cascade, including aberrant inflammation, neurotrophic function, and processing of beta amyloid and tau proteins. These newer approaches hold promise for disease modification but are as yet unproven. Whether or not disease-modifying or preventive therapies become a reality, clinicians will be faced with AD patients who require treatment at all stages of illness for the indefinite future. Cholinergic and emerging noncholinergic medications will likely prevail as the standards of treatment for years to come.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review of the literature focuses on the influence of ethnic, cultural, and geographic factors on the caregivers of patients with dementia. In particular, we explore the impact of cultural expectations on five important questions: 1) Do the characteristics of dementia affect caregiver burden? 2) Do characteristics of the caregiver independently predict burden? 3) Does the caregiver affect patient outcomes? 4) Does support or intervention for caregiver result in reduced caregiver burden or improved patient outcomes? 5) Finally, do patient interventions result in reduced caregiver burden or improved patient outcomes? Our findings suggest that noncognitive, behavioral disturbances of patients with dementia result in increased caregiver burden and that female caregivers bear a particularly heavy burden across cultures, particularly in Asian societies. Caregiver burden influences time to medical presentation of patients with dementia, patient condition at presentation, and patient institutionalization. Moreover, interventions designed to reduce caregiver burden have been largely, although not universally, unsuccessful. Pharmacological treatments for symptoms of dementia were found to be beneficial in reducing caregiver burden. The consistency of findings across studies, geographic regions, cultural differences, and heathcare delivery systems is striking. Yet, there are critical differences in cultural expectations and social resources. Future interventions to reduce caregiver burden must consider these differences, identify patients and caregivers at greatest risk, and develop targeted programs that combine aspects of a number of interventional strategies.",

In this review, we consider the evidence for early-life risk factors for this illness. We propose that risk factors that predict neuropathology are largely distinct from those related to the clinical expression of Alzheimer disease. Early-life risk factors for pathology include genes, chromosomal abnormalities, head injury, insulin resistance, and inflammation. With regard to risk factors for clinical expression of Alzheimer disease, six general groups of childhood exposures are reviewed: (1) perinatal conditions, (2) early-life brain development, (3) early-life body growth, (4) early-life socioeconomic conditions, (5) environmental enrichment, and (6) cognitive reserve. The literature reviewed suggests that risk of Alzheimer disease is probably not determined in any single time period but results from the complex interplay between genetic and environmental exposures throughout the life course. Enhancement or preservation of brain or cognitive reserve could delay the onset of Alzheimer disease and in some cases prevent the disease from occurring altogether.",

Neurobiological and neuroimaging characteristics of amnestic-type MCI have been investigated, but few comprehensive neuropsychiatric studies have been reported. The aim of this preliminary study was to define the neuropsychiatric features of the amnestic-type MCI and compare them with those of mild AD and normal controls. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was used to assess the neuropsychiatric symptoms in three age and education comparable groups, i.e., 28 MCI, 124 mild AD, and 50 normal subjects. Individual subscores of the 10 NPI symptoms and total NPI scores were compared between the MCI patients and the other 2 groups. The results of this preliminary investigation showed that MCI patients frequently manifested neuropsychiatric symptoms. The most common symptoms in the MCI group were dysphoria (39%), apathy (39%), irritability (29%), and anxiety (25%). There were significant differences in apathy, dysphoria, irritability, anxiety, agitation, and aberrant motor behavior between the MCI and control groups; in contrast, only delusions were significantly less common in MCI compared with mild AD. There was a significant difference between the MCI and control groups on total NPI scores (p = 0.001), but not between the MCI and mild AD groups (p = 0.304). Amnestic MCI is associated with significant neuropsychiatric symptoms, especially mood disturbances and apathy. Psychotic symptoms are significantly more common in the early stage of AD than in MCI. These results are derived from a limited clinical sample and require confirmation in longitudinal community-based investigations.",

Women (n = 1844), aged 70 to 81 years at initial cognitive interview in 2000, are members of the Nurses' Health Study cohort. Women completed six tests of cognitive function encompassing general cognition, verbal memory, category fluency, and attention. We repeated the assessment 2 years later. We used linear regression models to obtain multivariate-adjusted mean differences in initial test performance, and in cognitive decline over time, across categories of sleep duration (≤5,6,7,8,9+ hours/night), frequency of snoring (never, occasionally, regularly), and sleep difficulties (rarely/never, occasionally, regularly). In analyses of initial test performance, women sleeping ≤5 hours/night scored worse than women sleeping 7 hours/night (mean difference on global score combining all cognitive tests = 0.15 standard units, 95% CI: −0.28, −0.02). Women who regularly had difficulty falling or staying asleep scored 0.11 units lower on the global score (95% CI: −0.22, 0.01) compared with those who rarely had difficulty sleeping. These differences were equivalent to the mean differences in score observed between participants who were 4 to 5 years apart in age. We found no associations with snoring or with any of the sleep variables and cognitive decline over 2 years. Associations between sleep patterns and initial cognitive function may be clinically relevant given that diminished cognition is a risk factor for dementia. However, the lack of an association with prospective cognitive decline warrants further investigation.",

Forty-eight mild cognitive impairment subjects received structural and ASL-MRI scans at baseline and clinical and neuropsychologic assessments annually. Thirteen subjects became demented during the period of longitudinal observation (2.7±1.0 y). Cox regression analyses suggest that baseline hippocampal volume [relative risk (RR)=0.99, P=0.004], baseline right inferior parietal (RR=0.64, P=0.01) and right middle frontal (RR=0.73, P=0.01) perfusion were associated with conversion to dementia. Results from linear mixed effects modeling suggest that baseline perfusion from the right precuneus predicted subsequent declines in Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (P=0.002), Functional Activates Questionnaire (P=0.01), and selective attention (ie, Stroop switching, P=0.009) whereas baseline perfusion from the right middle frontal cortex predicted subsequent episodic memory decline (ie, total recognition discriminability score from the California Verbal Learning Test, P=0.03). These results suggest that hypoperfusion as detected by ASL-MRI can predict subsequent clinical, functional, and cognitive decline and may be useful for identifying candidates for future Alzheimer disease treatment trials.",

    "abstract": "Current evidence suggests that car crashes in cognitively impaired older drivers often occur because of failure to notice other drivers at intersections. We tested whether licensed drivers with mild to moderate cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer disease (AD) are at greater risk for intersection crashes. In this experiment, 30 participants drove on a virtual highway in a simulator scenario where the approach to within 3.6 seconds of an intersection triggered an illegal incursion by another vehicle. To avoid collision with the incurring vehicle, the driver had to perceive, attend to, and interpret the roadway situation; formulate an evasive plan; and then exert appropriate action on the accelerator, brake, or steering controls, all under pressure of time. The results showed that 6 of 18 drivers with AD (33%) experienced crashes versus none of 12 nondemented drivers of similar age. Use of a visual tool that plots control over steering wheel position, brake and accelerator pedals, vehicle speed, and vehicle position during the 5 seconds preceding a crash event showed inattention and control responses that were either inappropriate or too slow. The findings were combined with those in another recent study of collision avoidance in drivers with AD that focused on potential rear end collisions. Predictors of crashes in the combined studies included visuospatial impairment, disordered attention, reduced processing of visual motion cues, and overall cognitive decline. The results help to specify the linkage between decline in certain cognitive domains and increased crash risk in AD and also support the use of high-fidelity simulation and neuropsychologic assessment in an effort to standardize the assessment of fitness to drive in persons with medical impairments.",

    "abstract": "Recent experimental evidences suggest protective and trophic effects of ginseng in the memory function of Alzheimer disease (AD). Thus, we investigated the clinical efficacy of Panax ginseng in the cognitive performance of AD patients in an open-label study. Consecutive AD patients were randomly assigned to the ginseng (n=58) or the control group (n=39), and the ginseng group was treated with Panax ginseng powder (4.5 g/d) for 12 weeks. Cognitive performances were monitored using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer disease assessment scale (ADAS) during 12 weeks of the ginseng treatment and at 12 weeks after the ginseng discontinuation. MMSE and ADAS scales showed no baseline difference between the groups. After ginseng treatment, the cognitive subscale of ADAS and the MMSE score began to show improvements and continued up to 12 weeks (P=0.029 and P=0.009 vs. baseline, respectively). After discontinuing ginseng, the improved ADAS and MMSE scores declined to the levels of the control group. These results suggest that Panax ginseng is clinically effective in the cognitive performance of AD patients (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00391833).",

    "abstract": "Lesions of Alzheimer disease are associated with low-grade but sustained inflammatory responses. Activated microglia agglomerate in the center of senile plaques. Reactive astrocytes marginate the amyloid β-protein (Aβ) deposits and extend their processes toward the center of plaques. Both microglia and astrocytes are known to secrete a wide variety of molecules involved in inflammation and are potential sources of proinflammatory elements in the brain. Dystrophic neurites occur in senile plaques with such glial reactions, suggesting the relevance of inflammatory responses to the neuronal degeneration in Alzheimer disease. Activated glial cells are, therefore, targets of anti-inflammatory therapy of Alzheimer disease. However, evidence also indicates that these cells eliminate Aβ from the brain. Aβ is produced continuously in both the normal and the AD brain. Under normal conditions, Aβ is removed successfully before it accumulates as extracellular amyloid fibrils. Even in Alzheimer disease, a large portion of Aβ may be cleared from the brain with a small portion being left and deposited as neurotoxic senile plaques. Both in vivo and in vitro studies showed the effective uptake of Aβ by microglia. Before clinical application, it must be determined whether the treatment that suppresses glial activation and inflammatory responses inhibits Aβ removal by glial cells.",

    "abstract": "Objective To compare the real-world clinical effectiveness and long-term clinical trajectory in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) treated with combination (COMBO) therapy consisting of cholinesterase-inhibitor (CI) plus memantine (MEM) versus CI alone versus no treatment with either. Methods Three hundred eighty-two subjects with probable AD underwent serial clinical evaluations at a memory disorders unit. Cognition was assessed by the Information-Memory-Concentration subscale of the Blessed Dementia Scale (BDS) and function was assessed by the Weintraub Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADL) at 6-month intervals. One hundred forty-four subjects received standard care without CI or MEM (NO-RX), 122 received CI monotherapy, and 116 received COMBO therapy with CI plus MEM. Mean follow-up was 30 months (4.1 visits) and mean cumulative medication treatment time was 22.5 months. Rates of decline were analyzed using mixed-effects regression models, and Cohen's d effect sizes were calculated annually for years 1 to 4. Results Covarying for baseline scores, age, education, and duration of illness, the COMBO group had significantly lower mean annualized rates of deterioration in BDS and ADL scores compared with the CI (P<0.001; Cohen's dBDS=0.10−0.34 and dADL=0.23−0.46 at 1 to 2 y) and NO-RX groups (P<0.001; Cohen's dBDS=0.56−0.73 and dADL=0.32−0.48 at 1 to 2 y). For the COMBO group, Cohen's d effect sizes increased with treatment duration. Similar comparisons significantly favored the CI over the NO-RX group on the BDS. Conclusions COMBO therapy slows cognitive and functional decline in AD compared with CI monotherapy and no treatment. These benefits had small-to-medium effect sizes that increased with time on treatment and were sustained for years.",

A clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is inaccurate even among experienced investigators in about 10% to 15% of cases, and biomarkers might improve the accuracy of diagnosis. Importantly for the development of putative disease-modifying drugs for Alzheimer disease, biomarkers might also serve as indirect measures of disease severity. When used in this way, sample sizes of clinical trials might be reduced, and a change in biomarker could be considered supporting evidence of disease modification. This review summarizes a meeting of the Alzheimer's Association's Research Roundtable, during which existing and emerging biomarkers for AD were evaluated. Imaging biomarkers including volumetric magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography assessing either glucose utilization or ligands binding to amyloid plaque are discussed. Additionally, biochemical biomarkers in blood or cerebrospinal fluid are assessed.

The relationship of fitness to Alzheimer disease (AD)-related brain change is understudied, particularly in the hippocampus, which is disproportionately affected in early AD.

ND (n=56) and early-stage AD patients (n=61) over the age of 65 years had magnetic resonance imaging and CR fitness assessments. Voxel-based morphometry techniques were used to identify AD-related atrophy. We analyzed the relationship of CR fitness with white and gray matter within groups, assessed fitness-related brain volume change in areas most affected by AD-related atrophy, and then analyzed differential fitness-brain relationships between apoE4 carriers. Atrophy was present in the medial temporal, temporal, and parietal cortices in patients with mild AD. There was a significant positive correlation of CR fitness with parietal and medial temporal volume in AD patients. ND patients did not have a significant relationship between brain volume and CR fitness in the global or small volume correction analyses. There was not a significant interaction for fitness×apoE4 genotype in either group. In early-stage AD, CR fitness is associated with regional brain volumes in the medial-temporal and parietal cortices suggesting that maintaining CR fitness may modify AD-related brain atrophy.",

Thus, reductions in the biochemical activity of choline acetyltransferase were generally more extensive in neo- as opposed to archicortical regions in LBD (especially hallucinating cases) and in PD, whereas muscarinic receptor binding was significantly increased in LBD and PD but not in AD. Nerve growth factor receptor (P75) assessed immunocytochemically in the archicortex were decreased in PD and, to a lesser extent, in LBD in conjunction with reductions of neuronal numbers in the nucleus of Meynert (Ch4), but were relatively spared in AD. These observations indicate that although AD is primarily associated with dysfunction of cholinergic axonal input to the cortex, LBD and PD are more likely to involve degeneration of the basal forebrain cholinergic system.

The model was applied to eight patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and three age-matched healthy volunteers who received intravenous injections of (S)(-)11C-nicotine and 11C-butanol. The uptake and time course of radioactivity in different brain regions were assessed by positron emission tomography (PET). The rate constant k* was formulated by dividing the K2 rate constant for 11C-nicotine with the K, rate constant for 11C-butanol and thereby minimizing the influence of CBF on the quantitated binding of 11C-nicotine. The rate constant k2* for 11C-nicotine giving a quantitative measure of binding in the brain tissue was significantly higher in the temporal and frontal cortices as well as in the hippocampus of AD brains as compared with controls, indicating deficits in specific nicotinic binding in these brain areas of AD patients. A significant and negative correlation was obtained between cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination) and k2* of 11C-nicotine in the temporal and frontal cortices as well as in the hippocampus. The described kinetic model allowed in vivo quantification of nicotinic receptor binding in brain, which will be of importance in the future for evaluation of diagnosis, progress of disease, as well as the therapeutic effects in the treatment of AD.",

Apart from early stages, both hemispheres are affected, but pronounced asymmetries may be present. With the exception of Parkinson's disease with dementia, the complete pattern is rarely seen in other dementing conditions, which usually lead to more global, frontal or multifocal metabolic impairment. Severity of dementia is mainly correlated with temporo-parietal rCMRGlu reduction, probably irrespective of the cause of dementia, and the neuropsychological profile is related to the asymmetry of metabolic alterations. Procedures are available for assessment of the typical pattern that yield comparable results in different laboratories, and have a high accuracy for discrimination between normals and probable AD. Diagnostic accuracy is better for presenile than for senile dementia of Alzheimer type, and for moderate to severe cases than for mild dementia. A definitive judgement of the diagnostic value of FDG PET in AD is hindered by the lack of sufficient data with diagnosis confirmed at autopsy.",

Twentysix patients with early AD and 16 nondemented elderly controls were studied. Awareness of deficits was determined by using (a) a discrepancy score between subject's and caregiver's ratings on a memory questionnaire, (b) a discrepancy score between subject's and caregiver's ratings on an activities-of-daily-living scale, and (c) a clinical rating of dementia awareness for patients. Whereas self-ratings of memory and activities of daily living were not significantly different between AD patients and controls, these two measures differed significantly when AD patients' ratings were compared with those of their caregivers. Measures of awareness of deficits correlated with one another and were primarily associated with performance on tests of executive and visuospatial functions but not with depression. Early AD is characterized by a failure of self-monitoring. Deficits in self-monitoring have been proposed to occur after damage to the frontal lobes and other cerebral areas. Impaired awareness of memory and functional deficits in AD is related to cognitive impairments, which may involve frontal and right hemisphere connections.",

A poor perception of emotion could account for some behavioral symptoms. The aim of this study was to assess the perception of emotion in patients with FTD and to compare it with that of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). Fifty subjects performed the tests: 20 patients with probable AD, 18 patients with FTD, and 12 matched controls. The two patient groups did not differ in age, sex, severity of dementia, duration of the disease, and language tests. Subjects had to recognize and point out the name of one of seven basic emotions (anger, disgust, happiness, fear, sadness, surprise, and contempt) on a set of 28 faces presented on slides. The three groups were equally able to distinguish a face displaying affect from one not displaying affect. Naming of emotion was worse in patients with FTD than in patients with AD (correct answers 46% vs. 62%; p = 0.0006) who did not differ significantly from controls (72%). Anger, sadness, and disgust were less recognized in FTD than in AD patients who did not differ from controls, whereas fear and contempt were poorly recognized in both groups of patients compared with controls. These findings argue for different neural substrates underlying the recognition of various basic emotions. Behavioral disorders in FTD may be partly due to an impaired interpretation of the emotional environment.",

    "abstract": "Subjects with Parkinson disease (PD) frequently develop dementia with greater than one-third meeting neuropathologic diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer disease (AD). The objective is to identify clinical and neuropathologic differences between Parkinson disease with dementia (PDD) subjects, with and without coexistent AD pathology. Neuropathologic examination was available on subjects diagnosed by clinicopathologic criteria with PDD−AD (N=23) and PDD+AD (N=28). A small subset of subjects with PDD−AD and PDD+AD had received at least 1 standardized neuropsychologic assessment. PDD+AD subjects were significantly older at age of PD onset and death, progressed to onset of dementia in less time, and had a shorter duration of PD symptoms before the onset of dementia. Education, responsiveness of L-dopa and dopaminergic medications, presence of cognitive fluctuations and hallucinations, and mean Mini-Mental State Examination, Global Deterioration Scale, Functional Assessment Staging, and Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale scores did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. The PDD+AD group had significantly greater total plaques, neuritic plaques, total tangles, and Braak stages compared with PDD−AD. This study suggests that it is difficult to distinguish PDD+AD and PDD−AD on the basis of movement, clinical, and neuropsychologic assessment. PDD−AD and PDD+AD have similar degrees of dementia and approximately half of PDD subjects have enough AD pathology to attain a neuropathologic diagnosis of AD. PDD can develop in the absence of significant Alzheimer pathology.",

    "abstract": "Progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) is a clinical syndrome characterized by motor speech impairment and agrammatism, with relative sparing of single word comprehension and semantic memory. PNFA has been associated with the characteristic pattern of left anterior insular and posterior frontal atrophy, including the motor and premotor regions and Broca's area. Postmortem histopathologic evidence has shown that PNFA is usually associated with tau pathology, although focal Alzheimer disease pathology and tau-negative, ubiquitin-TDP-43 inclusions also have been reported in association with this clinical syndrome. We performed a detailed analysis of motor speech errors in 18 patients with PNFA and investigated their neural correlates using voxel-based morphometry on magnetic resonance imaging scans. Seven patients demonstrated only apraxia of speech (AOS) errors, whereas 11 showed AOS along with dysarthria. Slow rate of speech, effortful articulation with groping, and consonant distortions were the most common AOS errors. Hypernasality was the most represented dysarthric feature and dysarthria was most often classified as spastic, hypokinetic, or mixed spastic-hypokinetic. Neuroimaging results demonstrated that patients with AOS-only and AOS plus dysarthria showed atrophy in the left posterior frontal, anterior insular, and basal ganglia regions when compared with controls. Patients with AOS plus dysarthria showed greater damage than patients with AOS-only in the left face portion of primary motor cortex and left caudate. PNFA is a distinct frontotemporal lobar degeneration clinical syndrome associated with characteristic clinical, neuroimaging, and pathologic features. The clinical features are driven by the severity of left frontal and caudate damage.",

A prospective study of a representative rural community sample (N = 1,146) aged 65+ years examined self-reported exercise habits and measured global cognitive function using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). A composite variable \"exercise level\" combining type, frequency, and duration of exercise was created with three levels: \"high exercise\" (aerobic exercise of ≥ 30 minute duration ≥ 3 times a week), \"low exercise\" (all other exercise groups), and \"no exercise.\" Cognitive decline was defined as being in the 90th percentile of decline in this cohort, ie, declining by 3 or more MMSE points during the 2-year interval between two assessments. In a multiple regression model, high exercise level at the baseline assessment was negatively associated with, ie, was protective against, being in the group with the greatest amount of decline at the follow-up assessment, after adjusting for likely confounders (odds ratio = 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.19, 0.78).

The MCI group categorized based on LM-II cutoff has a higher conversion rate per year (24%), but also a higher reversal rate and missed diagnosis rate, whereas the group based on AVLT-II cutoff has a lower conversion rate per year (12%), but also a lower reversal rate and missed diagnosis rate.

Participants were 41 patients with Alzheimer disease and their caregivers. Dementia severity, functional impairment, awareness of memory deficit, and behavioral disturbance were measured and examined in relation to caregiver burden. Positive correlations were found between caregiver burden and both impaired awareness of memory deficit and behavioral disturbance. Regression analyses demonstrated that both impaired patient awareness of memory deficit and behavioral disturbance contributed to caregiver burden over and above dementia severity and functional impairment. However, when both were entered together into regression equations, only behavioral disturbance contributed to caregiver burden. Of the problem behaviors, measures of disinhibition contributed most to caregiver burden. These data further our understanding of the multiple contributors to caregiver burden.

We postulate that since systemic infection can provoke the enhanced synthesis of inflammatory mediators in the brain, such diseases may promote the onset of dementia. We carried out a nested case-control study using the General Practice Research Database. Cases were patients with incident dementia, and controls without such a diagnosis. Infectious episodes in the four years preceding diagnosis were counted using diagnostic codes, or prescription codes for anti-infective drugs. We considered age, sex, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and frequency of consultation as potential confounders. There were 9954 valid cases, and 9374 valid controls. Cases were on average older, more likely to be female, to smoke and to have diabetes, than the controls. There was an increased risk of diagnosis of dementia in those patients older than 84 with infections (OR for 2 or more infections compared with 0 or 1 = 1.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.7). Smoking and diabetes mellitus were also shown to markedly increase the risk of diagnosis of dementia. We have shown a positive association between episodes of infection and increased likelihood of diagnosis of dementia in the very elderly. Smoking and diabetes mellitus are associated with onset of dementia in the elderly. The evidence from this study may represent cause and effect, since there is a credible biologic explanation.",

The metabolic syndrome is comprised of 5 cardiovascular risk factors that include abdominal obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein levels, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome, similar to that for cognitive disorders, increases dramatically with age. Several possible mechanisms may explain an association between the metabolic syndrome and cognitive decline including microvascular and macrovascular disease, inflammation, adiposity, and insulin resistance. Although some of the individual components of the metabolic syndrome have been linked to risk of developing dementia and cognitive impairment, few studies have looked at the components of the metabolic syndrome as a whole. We found, in 3 separate studies involving elders of different ethnicities, that the metabolic syndrome is a risk factor for accelerated cognitive aging. This was especially true for elders with the metabolic syndrome and with elevated serum level of inflammation. If metabolic syndrome is associated with increased risk of developing cognitive impairment, regardless of mechanism, then early identification and treatment of these individuals might offer avenues for disease course modification.",

    "abstract": "Summary: New molecular information about Alzheimer disease (AD) is appearing at an unprecedented rate. Much interest centers on the βA4 amyloid protein, which is progressively deposited in senile plaques and blood vessels in AD brain tissue. The discovery that some kindreds with familial AD have a mutation in the gene coding for the βA4 amyloid precursor protein (APP) suggests that this mutation alone may be sufficient to cause the full spectrum of clinical and pathological changes that characterize AD. Although APP point mutations may turn out to be relatively rare causes of AD, the idea that accelerated βA4 deposition is an early and critical event in many patients continues to gain support from studies in humans, animals, and cultured cells. Identification of the biochemical steps leading to production of the βA4 peptide from APP is now a critical issue. Recent reports indicate that normal lysosomal processing pathways can produce carboxyl-terminal fragments of APP that contain the entire βA4 sequence, and are therefore potentially amyloidogenic. The mechanisms by which such intermediate forms are further processed and released, resulting in extracellular βA4 deposits in plaques and vessels, are yet to be determined. It is likely that full elucidation of the βA4–producing pathways will ultimately yield new therapeutic approaches to this complex and tragic disorder.",

Methods A systematic literature review was conducted of all studies of cardiovascular risk factors for incident AD listed in PubMed in English from 2000 to 2007. Risk factors included hypertension, diabetes, exercise, alcohol intake, smoking, B complex vitamins, homocysteine, stroke, atrial fibrillation, apolipoprotein E (APOE), lipids, and diet. Inclusion criteria consisted of diagnoses of incident AD and longitudinal studies with cohorts of 500 or more. Results Individual clinically defined risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes were not significantly associated with increased risk for AD. The strength of the association for hypertension could be considerably strengthened by changing criteria such as midlife measurements or using higher cutoffs for systolic blood pressure. APOE ε4 was the most consistent risk factor. Interactions between risk factors modify risk particularly for hypertension and diabetes. Interactions modifying risk were also found for exercise and physical function, APOE ε4, diabetes, and cholesterol. Conclusions In this review, the evidence that single clinically defined cardiovascular risk factors are significantly associated with incident AD is inconsistent at best. The strength of the association of cardiovascular risk factors and AD can be influenced greatly by changing the parameters of measurement of risk factors and by identifying interactions between the factors.",

Six hundred forty-four elderly subjects participating in the Prevention Instrument Project completed a self-rated version of the ADL-PI, and informants for 632 subjects completed an informant version. Informants also completed a Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) ADL questionnaire to allow comparisons. Results Subjects performed well on all ADL scales at baseline. Completion of the ADL-PI questionnaires at home or in-clinic yielded comparable information. Scores from baseline to 3 months had good reliability. The ADL-PI, obtained from either self-report or informants, discriminated between subjects rated as CDR 0 and CDR 0.5. Subjects with worse baseline cognitive performance also had slightly worse ADL-PI scores. Preliminary analysis indicates that subjects who triggered cognitive evaluations had slightly lower baseline ADL-PI scores by both self and informant reports. Conclusions The ADL-PI can be completed at home or in clinic, and has adequate reliability. The utility of self-administered and informant versions and predictive value of reported deficits requires further follow-up.",

    "abstract": "The Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) is used widely to identify very mild dementia; 3 alternative scoring procedures have been proposed based on free recall, total recall, and cue efficiency. We compared the predictive validity of these scoring procedures for the identification of very mild prevalent dementia (CDR=0.5), of incident dementia, and for distinguishing Alzheimer Disease (AD) and nonAD dementias. We tested 244 elderly African American and White primary care patients at 18 month intervals using a screening neuropsychologic battery that included the FCSRT and a comprehensive diagnostic neuropsychologic battery. Median follow-up was 2.6 years. Dementia diagnoses were assigned using standard criteria without access to the results of the screening battery. There were 50 prevalent and 28 incident dementia cases. At scores selected to provide specificities of 90%, free recall was more sensitive to incident and prevalent dementia than the other 2 measures. Patients with impaired free recall were 15 times more likely to have a prevalent dementia and their risk of future dementia was 4 times higher than patients with intact free recall. Neither race nor education affected prediction although older patients were at increased risk of future dementia. Total recall was more impaired in AD dementia than in nonAD dementias. The results indicate that using the FCSRT, free recall is the best measure for detecting prevalent dementia and predicting future dementia. Total recall impairment supports the diagnosis of AD rather than nonAD dementia.",

Prospectively defined analyses failed to demonstrate a statistically significant benefit of memantine treatment compared with placebo on the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) at week 24 end point, although a significant advantage was observed for memantine at weeks 12 and 18.

Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-Plus) did not significantly favor memantine at week 24 despite a significant advantage for memantine at weeks 12 and 18. Other secondary outcomes showed no significant treatment differences. Post hoc analyses of potentially confounding covariates and alternative methods of imputing missing data did not substantially alter the results. Because of the violations of normality assumptions for the SIB and ADCS-ADL19, nonparametric analyses were performed; statistically significant benefit of memantine over placebo was demonstrated at week 24 for the SIB but not the ADCS-ADL19. The type and incidence of adverse events were similar in both groups.",

Insulin resistance induces chronic peripheral insulin elevations, reduces insulin activity, and reduces brain insulin levels. The insulin resistance syndrome and associated conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, are associated with age-related memory impairment and Alzheimer disease. Our work has focused on potential mechanisms through which this association is forged, including the effects of peripheral hyperinsulinemia on memory, inflammation, and regulation of the beta-amyloid peptide. We have shown that raising plasma insulin to levels that characterize patients with insulin resistance invokes synchronous increases in levels of beta-amyloid and inflammatory agents. These convergent effects may impair memory and induce AD pathology. Therapeutic strategies focused on preventing or correcting insulin abnormalities may thus benefit adults with age-related memory impairment and AD.",

    "abstract": "Recently the senior author and his associates developed a spatiotemporal wavelet-chaos methodology for the analysis of electroencephalograms (EEGs) and their subbands for discovering potential markers of abnormality in Alzheimer disease (AD). In this study, fractal dimension (FD) is used for the evaluation of the dynamical changes in the AD brain. The approach presented in this study is based on the research ideology that nonlinear features, such as FD, may not show significant differences between the AD and the control groups in the band-limited EEG, but may manifest in certain subbands. First, 2 different FD algorithms for computing the fractality of EEGs are investigated and their efficacy for yielding potential mathematical markers of AD is compared. They are Katz FD (KFD) and Higuchi FD. Significant features in different loci and different EEG subbands or band-limited EEG for discrimination of the AD and the control groups are determined by analysis of variation. The most discriminative FD and the corresponding loci and EEG subbands for discriminating between AD and healthy EEGs are discovered. As KFD of all loci in the β subband showed very high ability (P value <0.001) in discriminating between the groups, all KFDs are abstracted in 1 global KFD by averaging across loci in each of the 2 eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions. This leads to a more robust classification in terms of common variation of electrode positions than a classification based on separate KFDs of certain loci. Finally, based on the 2 global features separately and together, linear discriminant analysis is used to classify EEGs of AD and elderly normal patients. A high accuracy of 99.3% was obtained for the diagnosis of the AD based on the global KFD in the β-band of the eyes-closed condition with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 97.8%.",

However, little is known of the impact of the 3 main clinical variants of FTD— behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), semantic dementia (SemDem), and progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA)—or the role of disease severity in caregiver burden. The Zarit Burden Inventory was used to measure caregiver burden of bvFTD (n=17), SemDem (n=20), PNFA (n=20), and AD (n=19) patients. Symptom duration, caregiver age, and relationship type were matched across groups. Moreover, a number of caregiver (mood, social network) and patient variables (functional disability, behavioral changes, relationship with caregiver, and dementia stage) were addressed to investigate their impact on caregiver burden. Caregivers of bvFTD patients reported the highest burden, whereas SemDem and PNFA caregivers reported burden similar to AD. A regression analysis revealed that caregiver burden in FTD, regardless of subtype, was explained by a model combining disease staging, relationship changes, and caregiver depression. Burden increased with disease severity in FTD. This study is the first to show that caregivers of SemDem, PNFA, and AD patients show similar burden, while confirming that bvFTD caregivers show higher burden than AD caregivers. More importantly, this study demonstrates that burden worsens with disease progression in FTD.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) disrupts our most human social and emotional functions. Early in the disease, patients show focal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and orbital frontoinsula (FI) degeneration, accentuated in the right hemisphere. The ACC and FI, though sometimes considered ancient in phylogeny, feature a large bipolar projection neuron, the von Economo neuron (VEN), which is found only in humans, apes, and selected whales—all large-brained mammals with complex social structures. In contrast to bvFTD, Alzheimer disease (AD) often spares social functioning, and the ACC and FI, until late in its course, damaging instead a posterior hippocampal-cingulo-temporal-parietal network involved in episodic memory retrieval. These divergent patterns of functional and regional impairment remain mysterious despite extensive molecular-level characterization of bvFTD and AD. In this report, we further develop the hypothesis that VENs drive the regional vulnerability pattern seen in bvFTD, citing recent evidence from functional imaging in healthy humans, and also structural imaging and quantitative neuropathology data from bvFTD and AD. Our most recent findings suggest that bvFTD and AD target distinct, anticorrelated intrinsic connectivity networks and that bvFTD-related VEN injury occurs throughout the ACC-FI network. We suggest that the regional and neuronal vulnerability patterns seen in bvFTD and AD underlie the divergent impact of these disorders on recently evolved social-emotional functions.",

    "abstract": "Patients with dementia develop dysphagia some time during the clinical course of their disease. The aim of this study was to compare the swallowing functions of the 2 most common types of dementia: Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD). Videofluoroscopic swallowing studies of the 2 patient groups were analyzed according to various oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal variables of swallowing. The results indicate that there are some different patterns of swallowing disorders. The AD patients were significantly more impaired in \"oral transit delay over 5 seconds\" with liquids (χ2=7.065, df=1, P=0.008), whereas the VaD patients showed more deficits in \"bolus formation and mastication\" of semisolid food (χ2=4.64, df=1, P=0.039), \"hyolaryngeal excursion\" (χ2=4.102, df=1, P=0.043), \"epiglottic inversion\" (χ2=4.612, df=1, P=0.032), and \"silent aspiration\" (χ2=6.258, df=1, P=0.011). These results could indicate that the swallowing disorders of the AD group may result from sensory impairment in relation to dysfunctions in the temporoparietal areas, whereas the swallowing disorders of VaD group may primarily be caused by motor impairments due to disruptions in the corticobulbar tract. This study is noteworthy because it is one of the first attempts to differentiate between the swallowing symptoms of AD and VaD patients. A further study that includes patients with more severe degree of dementia (eg, patients over clinical dementia rating 3) might delineate additional discriminating swallowing patterns between the 2 dementia groups. In addition, a follow-up study exploring various kinematic characteristics of dysphagia would address physiologic issues of swallowing disorders as related to one of the most important clinical variables, laryngeal aspiration in the 2 dementia groups.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is defined by progressive impairments in memory and cognition and by the presence of extracellular neuritic plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. However, oxidative stress and impaired mitochondrial function always accompany AD. Mitochondria are a major site of production of free radicals [ie, reactive oxygen species (ROS)] and primary targets of ROS. ROS are cytotoxic, and evidence of ROS-induced damage to cell membranes, proteins, and DNA in AD is overwhelming. Nevertheless, therapies based on antioxidants have been disappointing. Thus, alternative strategies are necessary. ROS also act as signaling molecules including for transcription. Thus, chronic exposure to ROS in AD could activate cascades of genes. Although initially protective, prolonged activation may be damaging. Thus, therapeutic approaches based on modulation of these gene cascades may lead to effective therapies. Genes involved in several pathways including antioxidant defense, detoxification, inflammation, etc, are induced in response to oxidative stress and in AD. However, genes that are associated with energy metabolism, which is necessary for normal brain function, are mostly down-regulated. Redox-sensitive transcription factors such as activator protein-1, nuclear factor-κB, specificity protein-1, and hypoxia-inducible factor are important in redox-dependent gene regulation. Peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-γ coactivator (PGC-1α) is a coactivator of several transcription factors and is a potent stimulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration. Down-regulated expression of PGC-1α has been implicated in Huntington disease and in several Huntington disease animal models. PGC-1α role in regulation of ROS metabolism makes it a potential candidate player between ROS, mitochondria, and neurodegenerative diseases. This review summarizes the current progress on how oxidative stress regulates the expression of genes that might contribute to AD pathophysiology and the implications of the transcriptional modifications for AD. Finally, potential therapeutic strategies based on the updated understandings of redox state-dependent gene regulation in AD are proposed to overcome the lack of efficacy of antioxidant therapies.",

Safety measures included adverse events, laboratory tests, vital signs, and 12-lead electrocardiogram.Twenty-seven patients received PF-04494700 30/co mg (female: 63%; mean age: 74.6 y; mean MMSE: 21.1), 28 patients received PF-04494700 60/20 mg (female: 57%; mean age: 76.6 y; mean MMSE: 21.6), and 12 patients received placebo (female: 67%; mean age: 74.1 y; mean MMSE: 19.2). A higher proportion of patients completed 10 weeks of double-blind treatment on both the \"low-dose\" regimen of PF-04494700 (88.9%) and the \"high-dose\" regimen (85.7%) than patients who were on placebo (66.7%). Discontinuation owing to adverse events and incidence of severe adverse events, respectively, were lower in the \"low-dose\" regimen (7.4%, 11.1%) and the \"high-dose\" regimen (3.6%, 10.7%) compared with placebo (25.0%, 16.7%). There were no clinically meaningful differences in vital signs, laboratory test results, or mean electrocardiogram parameters in patients treated with PF-04494700. PF-04494700 had no consistent effect on plasma levels of β-amyloid, inflammatory biomarkers, or secondary cognitive outcomes.Ten weeks of treatment with PF-04494700 was safe and well tolerated in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease, indicating the feasibility of a larger long-term efficacy trial.",

Data (September 2005 to September 2007) were from the National Institute on Aging-funded National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set. The study analyzed the Uniform Data Set initial visits of 4518 community-dwelling subjects aged 65 years and above with and without dementia (2665 and 1853, respectively). PIRx was defined using a partial list of the 2003 Beers criteria. Generalized linear mixed models were applied to estimate the association between PIRx and polypharmacy. In both groups (with and without dementia), subjects who received PIRx on average took more medications than those taking no PIRx. As the total number of medications used increased, the odds of having PIRx also increased, controlling for dementia diagnosis and other subject characteristics. Our key findings were consistent after considering 2 definitions of PIRx (with or without oral estrogens) and accounting for missing data. In summary, the total number of medications used is associated with PIRx among Alzheimer's Disease Centers community-dwelling elderly patients with and without dementia, with polypharmacy increasing the risk of PIRx. Ensuring appropriate medication use in this population is clinically important because of the significant risks for institutionalization.",

The present work aimed to determine education-adjusted cut-off scores and correspondent sensitivity (S) and specificity (Sp) values of the category fluency (CF) test (animals/min) as a screening tool for Alzheimer disease (AD). Eighty-eight patients with mild AD and 117 normal matched controls were evaluated. Patients and controls were divided into 4 groups according to educational level (illiterates, 1 to 3, 4 to 7, and ≥8 y) and were administered the CF test. In each group, cut-off values were determined using Receiver Operator Characteristic analysis. The areas under Receiver Operator Characteristic curves were 0.922/0.914/0.963/0.954, for the identification of AD among the groups of illiterates, 1 to 3, 4 to 7, and ≥8 years of education, respectively. The cut-off points for each group were 9 (S=90.5% and Sp=80.6%) for illiterates; 12 (S=95.2%% and Sp=80.0%) for 1 to 3 years; 12 (S=91.3% and Sp=91.9%) for 4 to 7 years, and 13 for those with ≥8 years (S=82.6% and Sp=100.0%). These results suggest that the CF may be a useful screening test for mild AD in different educational levels, with the need of using specific cut-off scores adjusted for each range of schooling.",

    "abstract": "Background and Purpose Cardiovascular risk factors are associated with an increased risk of dementia. Treatment of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia is associated with a decrease in incident dementia. Whether interventions aimed at cardiovascular risk factors in late life also reduce dementia risk is unknown. Here, we report the outline of a pragmatic study that will attempt to answer this question and we describe the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in the target population. Methods We designed a large cluster-randomized trial with a 6-year follow-up in 3700 elderly subjects (70 to 78 y) to assess whether nurse-led intensive vascular care in primary care decreases the incidence of dementia and reduces disability. Secondary outcome parameters are mortality, incidence of vascular events, and cognitive functioning. Intensive vascular care comprises treatment of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes and reducing overweight, smoking cessation, and stimulating physical exercise. Results Baseline data of 1004 subjects show that 87% of the subjects have 1 or more cardiovascular risk factors and 44% have even 2 or more risk factors amenable to treatment. Seventy-nine percent of the subjects receiving antihypertensive medication still have a systolic pressure of >140 mm Hg. Conclusions In this older age group, the very high percentage of elderly subjects with cardiovascular risk factors illustrates the large window of opportunity for therapies directed to lower the cardiovascular risk and potentially also the risk for dementia.",

Longitudinal data comprising 2268 aMCI and 1506 AD participants in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's Uniform Data Set were used to examine nuances of clinical progression by BMI and WC, as well as potential variations in associations by age, sex, BMI (WC model), or apolipoprotein E genotype. In aMCI, high BMI (vs. moderate BMI) was associated with slower progression; weight loss (vs. no WC) was associated with faster progression. In AD, no significant differences were observed in clinical progression by BMI or WC. The association between BMI and clinical progression varied significantly by apolipoprotein E genotype in AD, and the association between WC and clinical progression varied significantly by sex and BMI in aMCI. Baseline BMI and 1-year WC in late life may serve as early prognostic indicators in aMCI and early-stage AD.

This study aimed to assess change in QoL in people living in 24-hour care homes using the Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD) scale and investigated which clinical factors predicted changes in QoL in dementia. We used the QOL-AD scale to rate individual and staff perceptions of residents' QoL, for 238 people with dementia, recruited from 24 care homes in the United Kingdom. A follow-up interview was undertaken at 20 weeks. One hundred ninety-two (80.7%) of the 238 residents interviewed at baseline were followed up. A reduction in residents' QoL was predicted by lower baseline depression and anxiety symptoms, higher baseline QoL ratings, and an increase in depressive symptoms and cognitive deterioration at follow-up. Although QoL does not necessarily diminish as dementia progresses, it is strongly influenced by the person with dementia's mood. Improvement in cognition and mood may lead to increased QoL.",

    "abstract": "Background Florbetapir F 18 (18F-AV-45) is a positron emission tomography imaging ligand for the detection of amyloid aggregation associated with Alzheimer disease. Earlier data showed that florbetapir F 18 binds with high affinity to β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques in human brain homogenates (Kd=3.7 nM) and has favorable imaging pharmacokinetic properties, including rapid brain penetration and washout. This study used human autopsy brain tissue to evaluate the correlation between in vitro florbetapir F 18 binding and Aβ density measured by established neuropathologic methods. Methods The localization and density of florbetapir F 18 binding in frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of postmortem brain tissue from 40 patients with a varying degree of neurodegenerative pathology was assessed by standard florbetapir F 18 autoradiography and correlated with the localization and density of Aβ identified by silver staining, thioflavin S staining, and immunohistochemistry. Results There were strong quantitative correlations between florbetapir F 18 tissue binding and both Aβ plaques identified by light microscopy (Silver staining and thioflavin S fluorescence) and by immunohistochemical measurements of Aβ using 3 antibodies recognizing different epitopes of the Aβ peptide. Florbetapir F 18 did not bind to neurofibrillary tangles. Conclusions Florbetapir F 18 selectively binds Aβ in human brain tissue. The binding intensity was quantitatively correlated with the density of Aβ plaques identified by standard neuropathologic techniques and correlated with the density of Aβ measured by immunohistochemistry. As Aβ plaques are a defining neuropathologic feature for Alzheimer disease, these results support the use of florbetapir F 18 as an amyloid positron emission tomography ligand to identify the presence of Alzheimer disease pathology in patients with signs and symptoms of progressive late-life cognitive impairment.",

In this study, we evaluated the feasibility, acceptance, efficacy, and usefulness of a CR intervention in a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial on 201 patients with mild dementia in Alzheimer disease and their carers. The intervention comprised 12 individual weekly sessions and combined 4 established strategies adopted from neurorehabilitation and psychotherapy.

However, no effect of the intervention was demonstrable on everyday functioning. There were improvements favoring the intervention on quality of life and treatment satisfaction and a significant antidepressant effect in female participants. The lack of impact on everyday activities may be due to methodological limitations including insufficient personalization, short treatment duration, poor transfer into the real-life setting, and low sensitivity of assessment instruments.

The aim of this study was to determine the impact of amyloid imaging on the diagnoses and management of patients undergoing evaluation for cognitive decline. Patients were recruited to participate at 19 clinical sites. The site physician provided a provisional diagnosis, an estimate of their diagnostic confidence, and their plan for diagnostic evaluation and management both before and after receiving the results from amyloid imaging with florbetapir F18.

    "abstract": "Background: Numerous cross-sectional studies have related exposure to neurotropic infectious agents with cognitive dysfunction in older adults, however, the temporal sequence is uncertain. Methods: In a representative, well-characterized, population-based aging cohort, we determined whether the temporal trajectories of multiple cognitive domains are associated with exposure to cytomegalovirus (CMV), Herpes Simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1), Herpes Simplex virus, type 2 (HSV-2), or Toxoplasma gondii (TOX). Complex attention, executive functions, memory, language, and visuospatial function were assessed annually for 5 years among consenting individuals. Study entry IgG antibody titers indexing exposure to each infectious agent were examined in relation to slopes of subsequent temporal cognitive decline using multiple linear regressions adjusted for potential confounders. Results: The IgG levels for HSV-2 were significantly associated with baseline cognitive domain scores (N=1022 participants). Further, the IgG levels for HSV-2, TOX, and CMV, but not HSV-1 were significantly associated with greater temporal cognitive decline that varied by type of infection. Conclusions: Exposure to CMV, HSV-2, or TOX is associated with cognitive deterioration in older individuals, independent of general age–related variables. An increased understanding of the role of infectious agents in cognitive decline may lead to new methods for its prevention and treatment.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of major neurocognitive disorders with a huge economical and medical burden. Several studies pointed out that AD is associated with a high risk for developing epileptic seizures. The aims of our review were to evaluate and to summarize the current literature (ending in September 2015) of animal and human studies in the relation of AD and epileptic seizures. It seems likely that epileptic hyperexcitation could be partially responsible for the progression of AD due to the increased rate of amyloid deposition. Pathologic changes in animal models of AD are similar to those seen in human temporal lobe epilepsy. Antiepileptic treatment had a positive effect on cognitive function in animal and human studies. Because the detection of seizures in patients with cognitive decline is extremely difficult because of methodological problems, the true prevalence of seizures has remained unclear. Nonconvulsive seizures with no overt clinical symptoms may be frequent seizure types in AD. These are difficult to detect by clinical observation and with standard scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) methods. We propose that long-term EEG recording and video-EEG monitoring is necessary to prove the presence of epileptiform activity in demented patients.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between dementia and cancer is complex. A wealth of observational data suggest (1) reduced risk of certain cancers in Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases; and (2) increased risk of other cancers in Parkinson disease. These relationships persist despite correcting for reporting artifacts and survival bias. Several potential mechanisms have been proposed and warrant further investigation. Aging is a risk factor for both. Common environmental exposures, such as smoking, may play roles. Common mechanisms such as chronic inflammation and immunosenescence, and common risk factors such as diabetes and obesity, have been implicated. Shared genetic pathways are a major focus, particularly those favoring apoptosis and cell proliferation at opposite ends of the spectrum. To complicate the picture further, certain cancer chemotherapy and adjuvant therapy agents have neurotoxic effects, whereas animal studies show other cancer drugs reducing neurodegeneration, raising the possibility of repurposing those agents for use in Alzheimer disease. These multiple potential lines of evidence must be disentangled to investigate underlying mechanisms, the end-game being to develop and to test potential prevention and treatment strategies.",

The aim of this present study was to test the hypothesis that a significant interaction exists between APOE genotype and gender on AD. Interactions of e4 by gender, although indicated in the literature, require further verification. A total of 195 past or current control or AD participants in an ongoing longitudinal study of aging and dementia were genotyped. All subjects were at least 60 years old; demented subjects met clinical or pathologic criteria for late-onset AD. Logistic regression analysis and proportional hazard models were used to evaluate joint effects of APOE and gender. A significant statistical interaction between APOE and gender was shown (p=0.04) in logistic regression analysis. Women carrying one or more APOEe4 allele were more likely to develop AD [odds ratio (OR)=7.8, 95% confidence interval (CI)=3.2-19.1]. For men, the presence of the APOE-e4 allele was not associated with a statistically significant increased risk (OR=1.6, 95% CI=0.5-5.3). The interaction term in the proportional hazards model neared (p=0.07) statistical significance, and a similar but reduced gender effect was shown. The analysis suggests that the presence of one or more APOE-e4 allele confers a substantially greater risk of AD to women than to men. These findings in part may account for reports of increased risk of AD faced by women.",

    "abstract": "There is evidence consistent with the hypothesis that inflammatory and immune mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). We have investigated whether the levels of inflammatory associated proteins in serum or lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reflect the progressive cognitive decline and brain atrophy of AD-patients. Levels of interleukin-1β (IL-Iβ, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-α), the soluble TNF receptors type I and II (sTNFR I and II), and the acute phase protein α1-antichymotrypsin (α1-ACT) were determined in paired serum and CSF samples taken yearly over a period of 2–5 years from pathologically confirmed AD patients (n = 8) and normal controls or non-AD subjects with other CNS pathology (n = 9). No significant differences were found between AD subjects and controls in the mean levels of the above mediators. There was also no correlation in either subject group between the levels of these inflammatory mediators in serum or CSF, and the change in cognitive status or the progression of the atrophy of the medial temporal lobe measured by X-ray computed tomography (CT). The concentrations of IL-Iβ, IL-6, and TNF-α were determined in brain tissue specimens of five to nine different brain regions in six of the AD patients and four of the non-AD subjects. The levels of IL-Iβ and IL-6 in the various brain regions were not significantly different in the AD and the non-AD group. However, in AD patients the level of TNF-α was significantly lower in the frontal cortex (32%, p = 0.024), the superior temporal gyrus (57%, p = 0.021), and the entorhinal cortex (49%, p = 0.009) compared with non-AD subjects. Low levels of TNF-α in the brain areas that showed neuropathology in AD may indicate a dysregulation of the inflammatory process in AD. Despite this finding, this study does not support the use of measurements of any of the inflammatory mediators investigated here as a diagnostic parameter for AD, due the large overlap in the levels of these factors between AD patients and other subjects, and the poor relation to clinical signs of AD.",

Several recent studies suggest that there is increased risk of developing Alzheimer disease when exposed to these same vascular risk factors.

In this review, we examine several vascular factors and peripheral vascular pathophysiology implicated in Alzheimer disease and suggest certain mechanisms that might promote the association of vascular factors and late-onset Alzheimer disease.

    "abstract": "Summary: Problems with diagnostic criteria for vascular dementia (VaD) stem from the inadequacy of the current dementia concept, a paradigm based on amnestic and other cortical deficits typical of Alzheimer disease (AD). However, most cases of VaD are due to subcortical lesions such as Binswanger-type periventricular white matter ischemia, or strokes causing decreased frontal activation and diaschisis-mediated cerebral hypoperfusion. We propose a new definition of dementia based on executive dysfunction and a formal assessment of executive control functions (ECF) for the diagnosis of VaD. The instruments proposed are the rapid screening executive clock-drawing task (CLOX; Royall et al. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 1998;64:588-94), and the more comprehensive Executive Interview Test (EXIT25; Royall et al. J Am Geriatr Soc 1992;40:1221-6). Extensive application of these tests in elderly subjects in retirement communities has shown that both are brief, simple to administer, and more sensitive case-finding tools for cognitively impaired individuals than the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). These three tests (CLOX, EXIT25, MMSE) accurately separate nondemented subjects from those with cortical or subcortical (frontal system) dementias. In addition, for controlled clinical trials of VaD, formal evaluation of motor and frontal sphincter functions—usually not considered part of the dementia syndrome—should also be included. Evaluation of gait and falls, timed-walk, manual dexterity, timed finger-tapping, and frontal bladder control (urge incontinence and nocturia) should improve determination of functional status and disability, and more accurately measure the effects of potential therapies.",

The concepts involved in global scales, the distinctions between change and severity scales, advantages and disadvantages of structured interviews, and anchoring of change scores are discussed, and selected existing clinical global scales are described. In addition, the committee assessed the utility of global scales in clinical trials for antidementia drugs. There was a consensus among the members of the working group on the following: (1) Clinical global scales are interview based; in most cases, they include information obtained from caregivers as well as directly from patients, but they can rely on information from the subject only. (2) Clinicians' global ratings are intended to assess clinically meaningful change based on multidimensional clinical assessment and take into account the clinical heterogeneity of dementia by assessing at least cognition, behavior, and functioning. (3) There are two distinct types of clinical global measures: (a) clinicians' interview-based global severity scales, which generally incorporate classification by stage or severity of illness and (b) clinicians' interview-based global change scales, which incorporate global assessment ratings of clinical change. The committee could not reach a consensus on whether global scales should be required in phase II and phase III clinical trials, or whether other specific assessments such as well-designed activities of daily living, cognition, and behavior measures could, when used in appropriate combinations, replace the global as assessments of clinical meaningfulness.",

As is the case for memory, attention is not a unitary process, and only certain components of attention are disrupted in mild AD, particularly sustained and spatial attention. In this article we review evidence from both human and nonhuman neuropsychopharmacology that leads us to suggest that (at least some of) the attentional impairments seen in AD can be related to damage to the basal forebrain cholinergic system (BFCS), in particular the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM), which undergoes significant neuronal loss in AD. The BFCS provides the major cholinergic innervation to the cortex and innervates brain regions such as the thalamus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobes known to be involved in attentional operations. In addition, studies conducted by our group suggest that drugs acting to stimulate the cholinergic system, in particular tacrine and nicotine, can significantly improve attentional function in patients with AD as measured by improved performance on objective computerised cognitive tasks. Furthermore, cholinergic drugs may also have some utility in other disorders with attentional pathology, such as Parkinson's disease.",

From an initial sample of 96 caregiver/care recipient pairs, 73 (N = 146) pairs remain at the 18-month data collection point. Changes in care recipient outcomes from baseline to the 18-month assessment include significant declines in mental status, productive behaviors, and functional ability, with a statistically significant improvement in depression. Controlling for 12-month mental ability, caregiver factors at 12 months predicting care recipient QoL outcomes at 18 months include psychologic well being predicted by the quality of the relationship with the caregiver and activity participation. Depression was predicted by activity participation as well. Care recipient functional ability was predicted by activity participation and caregiver role stress (disruption to routines and social functioning). Two of the three aspects of care recipient productive behaviors were predicted by caregiver factors, with quality of the relationship predicting problem solving and caregiver role stress (negative attitudes toward care recipient) and total social contacts predicting care recipient social behaviors in the expected direction. Lawton's QoL model was supported by this analysis, with a total explained variance of 32% for three (psychologic well being, productive behaviors, functional ability) of the five (physical impairment and perceived personal control not included) components of care recipient QoL outcomes.",

All subjects, including 20 normal elderly subject, were given an episodic memory test with controlled encoding and selective reminding. The subgroups of patients were homogeneous in terms of free recall and recognition, but differed in terms of responsiveness to cuing by semantic categories corresponding to the to-be-remembered items. The data confirmed that a severe amnesic syndrome occurs very early in AD, even in a subgroup of patients who did not meet the criteria for dementia. The data indicated that free recall performance, characterized in all subgroups by a floor effect, is not likely to be an appropriate index in pharmacological trials. By contrast, sensitivity to semantic cuing seemed relatively preserved in the early stages, and decreased with the progression of the disease. This index would be the most sensitive index of episodic memory in AD.",

Assessing the influence on HRQOL is an integral part of determining the efficacy and economic attractiveness of interventions for AD. Generic preference-weighted instruments such as the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI2) are recommended for measuring HRQOL for cost-effectiveness studies. However, these instruments focus on physical attributes and have not been tested in an AD caregiver population. We administered the HUI2 to a population of 679 caregivers to people with AD at 13 community and institutional sites in the United States. We also administered the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), a caregiver time questionnaire, and a caregiver burden instrument. The mean global HUI2 utility score for caregivers was 0.87 and varied little by the affected person's setting of care and AD stage (range, 0.86–0.89;p > 0.2). The caregiver burden scales all varied by the affected person's setting of care, and some also varied by disease severity. The mental health component summary score of the SF-36 for caregivers varied across both disease stage and setting. Caregiver time increased for caregivers of AD-affected persons with more severe cognitive impairment. Generic preference-weighted instruments may not adequately capture differences in the burden of caregivers of those with AD.

Average Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were 19.3, 18.0, and 16.4 at the three interviews; scores ranged from 0 to 30. Using the EuroQoL EQ-5D instrument, patient-rated health utilities were on average 0.833 with little variation across MMSE-based severity levels.

Proxy-rated utilities, as well as changes in utilities over time, were significantly related to MMSE scores and inversely related to scores on a brief version of the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) and institutionalization. Utilities were highly correlated with the disease-specific quality of life instrument QoL-AD.

The kinetic effects of the cholinesterase inhibitors donepezil, galantamine, metrifonate, physostigmine, rivastigmine, and tetrahydroaminoacridine were examined with respect to their action on the esterase and aryl acylamidase activities of human acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and human butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). Each of these drugs inhibited both AChE and BuChE, but to different degrees. Inhibition of BuChE by these compounds was approximately the same, or better, when acetylthiocholine, the analog of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, was used as the substrate, instead of butyrylthiocholine. In addition, for these drugs, the inhibition of aryl acylamidase activity paralleled that observed for inhibition of esterase activity of AChE and BuChE. Given that drugs that are currently in use for the treatment of Alzheimer disease inhibit both AChE and BuChE, the development of drugs targeted toward the exclusive inhibition of one or the other cholinesterase may be important for understanding the relative importance of inhibition of BuChE and AChE in the treatment of this disease.",

    "abstract": "To design optimal health services and education programs for Alzheimer disease (AD), it is important to understand cultural differences in perceptions of the disorder. In this study, we investigated differences between African Americans and whites in their beliefs, knowledge, and information sources regarding AD. We distributed a written questionnaire through lay and professional organizations and meetings in the southeastern United States, yielding a sample of 452 adults (61% white, 39% African American; 78% female; mean age 47 years; 33% with family history of AD). The questionnaire assessed the following: (1) illness beliefs, (2) factual knowledge, (3) sources of information, and (4) perceived subjective threat of AD. African Americans and whites were generally similar in their beliefs about common symptoms, prominent risk factors, and the effectiveness of treatments for AD (although whites expressed greater certainty in these beliefs than African Americans). In comparison to whites, African Americans showed less awareness of facts about AD, reported fewer sources of information, and indicated less perceived threat of the disorder. These preliminary findings suggest important distinctions between African Americans and whites in their knowledge about, and conceptualization of, AD. Follow-up studies with more representative samples and more fully validated measures will be necessary to confirm these differences. Health psychologic research suggests that such differences in illness perceptions could shape response to disease burden, assessment and diagnosis, and available health care options.",

Children and siblings (N = 203; age range, 30–92 years; 75% female) of people with AD completed a questionnaire (response rate, 90%) that assessed mental representations of AD, including knowledge, cause and treatment beliefs, distress, and perceived threat. In general, relatives were knowledgeable about AD, had an accurate sense of their disease risk, and endorsed etiologically significant factors as causes. Nonetheless, many participants held misconceptions about AD (e.g., most cases are hereditary) and what may be unrealistic expectations for future treatment developments. Levels of perceived distress and threat were generally high and associated with female gender and younger age. AD represented the foremost health concern of approximately one third of first-degree relatives. Health education efforts are needed to address misconceptions about AD genetics and to disseminate information about the availability of effective treatments. Further research on illness representations is needed to better understand coping and decision-making among those at risk for AD.",

Sixty-five subjects randomly assigned to treatment group were tested at baseline and end of treatment. Subjects' mean Mini-Mental State Examination score was 10.83; mean age was 87. Treatment was given for 30 minutes three times a week for 16 weeks. Subjects in the assisted walking group declined 20.9% in functional mobility; the conversation group declined 18.8%. The combined walking and conversation treatment group declined only 2.5%. These differences in outcome were significant and appear to have been affected by differences in treatment fidelity. Subjects in the conversation treatment group completed 90% of intended treatment compared with 75% in the combined group and only 57% in the assisted walking group. Failure to treat was due to subject refusal and physical illness. The conversation component of the combined walking and conversation treatment intervention appears to have improved compliance with the intervention, thereby improving treatment outcome. Results indicate that assisted walking with conversation can contribute to maintenance of functional mobility in institutionalized populations with Alzheimer disease. Staff assigned to this task should be prepared to use effective communication strategies to gain acceptance of the intervention.",

The test-retest reliability of the CMAI over 1 month was good (r = 0.74 to 0.92). Physically and verbally nonaggressive behaviors were most often reported, whereas physically aggressive behaviors were rare. Frequency of agitated behaviors increased with dementia severity, especially for patients with a Mini-Mental Status Exam score of 0–4. Agitation tended to increase in the evening with dementia severity for the more impaired patients. Amount of agitation did increase after 12 months in all but controls and mildly demented patients. The CMAI shows promise for evaluating a unique aspect of behavior and may be useful in assessing the effects of cognitive enhancers and other types of psychotropic drugs on behavior in dementia patients.",

Reliable and valid measurement of patient QOL is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment interventions and to gain a better understanding of the detrimental impact of dementia on patients' lives. In this study, the psychometric properties of a new scale developed to measure QOL, the Cornell-Brown Scale for Quality of Life, were examined. Data were collected from 50 dementia clinic outpatients with a range of cognitive impairment. Scale ratings were based on a brief, joint interview with caregivers and patients. Findings indicated that the scale demonstrated adequate interrater reliability (intraclass r = 0.90) and internal consistency reliability (Cronbach alpha = 0.81). Criterion validity was indicated by a positive correlation between QOL scores and visual analogue positive mood ratings (Spearman rho = 0.63) and a negative correlation between QOL and dementia severity as measured by Clinical Dementia Ratings (Spearman rho = −0.35). Reliability and validity were not adversely affected by patient cognitive impairment. Thus, preliminary data indicate that the Cornell-Brown Scale for Quality of Life is a brief, easily administered, reliable, and valid measure of QOL.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence for an empiric link between late-life depression and Alzheimer disease (AD). The neuropathology of AD, previously only confirmed at autopsy, may now be detectable in vivo using selective imaging ligands for β-amyloid. Positron emission tomography (PET) with [11C] 6-OH-BTA-1 [Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB)] has shown high tracer retention in cortical areas in patients with clinical diagnoses of probable AD and low retention in age-matched controls. We also previously reported variable PiB retention in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this study, we used PiB-PET to evaluate whether amyloid is present in elders with treated major depression, many of whom have persistent cognitive impairment. We evaluated 9 subjects with remitted major depression [3M: 6F, mean (SD) age=71.8(5.7) y]. Seven of the 9 depressed subjects also met criteria for the diagnosis of MCI. PiB-PET data from healthy elders [n=8; mean (SD) age=71.5(3.0) y] were used for comparison. PET was acquired with arterial sampling and PiB retention was quantified using magnetic resonance imaging-guided cortical regions and graphical analysis of time-activity data; arterial line failure led to exclusion of 1 depressed subject. The data demonstrated variably elevated PiB retention. PiB retention in the 2 depressed subjects with normal cognitive ability was in the range of nondepressed cognitively normal subjects. PiB retention in 3 of the 6 depressed subjects with MCI fell in the range of subjects with AD. PiB retention in the remaining 3 depressed subjects with cooccurring MCI was variable and generally was intermediate to the other subjects. Our findings are consistent with and supportive of the hypothesis that depression may herald the development of AD in some individuals.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitors of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) are presently used as long-term symptomatic treatments for patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), as they enhance central levels of synaptic acetylcholine. The accumulation of evidence implicating AChE in the pathogenesis of AD raises the question of whether, in addition to their palliative actions, inhibitors of this enzyme are able to act as disease-modifying agents. In addition to their catalytic effects, there is a suggestion that AChE inhibitors may influence expression of AChE isoforms and increase expression of nicotinic receptors, both of which correlate with cognitive improvements in AD patients. The neuroprotective effect of nicotine, presumably mediated via nicotinic receptors, against β-amyloid (Aβ) toxicity and its effect on amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Aβ production has previously been established. It has also been shown that AChE inhibitors influence APP processing and attenuate Aβ-induced toxicity via mechanisms including interruption of the production of Aβ, alteration of the levels of Aβ 1-50 and 1-52, and formation of the soluble form of APP. Some of these effects seem to occur independently of nicotinic receptors, however. If such experimental in vitro observations can be extrapolated into clinical neuroprotective properties, AChE inhibitors could positively modulate the disease course of AD.",

The TME was prepared by the titration method and characterized. Biodistribution of tacrine solution and formulations after intravenous and intranasal administrations were evaluated using 99mTc as marker. From the data, the pharmacokinetic parameters, drug targeting efficiency, and direct nose-to-brain drug transport were calculated. To confirm drug localization in brain gamma scintigraphy in rabbits was performed. Lower Tmax values (60 min) after intranasal compared with intravenous administration (120 min) suggested selective nose-to-brain transport. The brain bioavailability of tacrine after intranasal TMME compared with intranasal tacrine solution was found to be 2-fold higher indicating larger extent of distribution of the drug to brain with intranasal TMME. Rabbit brain scintigraphy also showed higher uptake of drug into the brain after intranasal administration. The results demonstrated rapid and larger extent of transport of tacrine into the mice brain and fastest regain of memory loss in scopolamine-induced amnesic mice after intranasal TMME. Hence, results are suggestive of possible role of intranasal tacrine delivery in treating Alzheimer's patients.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Enhanced behavioral responsiveness to central nervous system (CNS) norepinephrine (NE) in Alzheimer disease (AD) may contribute to the pathophysiology of disruptive behaviors such as aggression, uncooperativeness with necessary care, irritability, and pressured pacing. We evaluated the efficacy of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol for treatment-resistant disruptive behaviors and overall behavioral status in nursing home residents with probable or possible AD. Methods: Thirty-one subjects (age 85 ± 8 [SD]) with probable or possible AD and persistent disruptive behaviors that interfered with necessary care were randomized to propranolol (n = 17) or placebo (n = 14) in a double-blind study. Stable doses of previously prescribed psychotropics were maintained at pre-study dose during the study. Following a propranolol or placebo dose titration period of up to 9 days (per a dosing algorithm), subjects were maintained on maximum achieved dose for 6 weeks. Primary outcome measures were the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC). Results: Propranolol augmentation (mean achieved dose 106 ± 38 mg/d) was significantly more effective than placebo for improving overall behavioral status on the total NPI score and CGIC. Improvement in individual NPI items within propranolol subjects was significant only for \"agitation/aggression\" and \"anxiety,\" and reached borderline statistical significance favoring propranolol over placebo only for \"agitation/aggression.\" Pressured pacing and irritability did not appear responsive to propranolol. In propranolol subjects rated \"moderately improved\" or \"markedly improved\" on the CGIC at the end of the double-blind study phase, improvement of overall behavioral status had diminished substantially after 6 months of open-label propranolol treatment. Conclusion: Short-term propranolol augmentation treatment appeared modestly effective and well tolerated for overall behavioral status in nursing home residents with probable or possible AD complicated by disruptive behaviors. Propranolol may be helpful specifically for aggression and uncooperativeness (the behaviors assessed by the NPI \"agitation/aggressiveness\" item). However, the usefulness of propranolol in this very old and frail population was limited by the high frequency of relative contraindications to beta-adrenergic antagonist treatment and diminution of initial behavioral improvements over time.",

Nursing home admissions did not decrease during the study period, and the impact of dementia on the risk of nursing home admission did not decrease.

Variable declines were observed on the ADAS-cog, EXIT25, Frontal Behavior Inventory, NPI, TFLS, and UPDRS scores. The FTD and SD groups declined on most of the cognitive and behavioral outcome measures, but remained stable on the UPDRS, whereas the progressive nonfluent aphasia group remained relatively stable on the ADAS-cog, NPI, and TFLS, but declined on the UPDRS. Memantine was well-tolerated in these subjects. Future placebo-controlled trials of memantine in FTLD are warranted and may have greater power to detect behavioral and cognitive effects if focused on the FTD and SD clinical syndromes.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetic properties of R-flurbiprofen (Tarenflurbil) in normal elderly individuals and to determine the effect of the drug on amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42) levels, we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 48 healthy subjects aged 55 to 80. Three successive cohorts were randomized to doses of 400, 800, or 1600 mg/d, or placebo, given as 2 divided doses for 21 days. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid were collected for pharmacokinetic studies and measurement of Aβ levels at baseline and on day 21. R-flurbiprofen was well-tolerated at all 3 doses. The compound penetrated the blood-brain barrier in a dose-dependent manner. From baseline to 21 days, comparisons between study groups revealed no significant differences in changes of cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 levels and no significant differences in changes of plasma Aβ42 levels at the time of trough drug level at 21 days of treatment. Further analysis of drug concentration-response for plasma samples showed that at the time of peak plasma concentration, higher plasma drug concentration was related to lower Aβ42 plasma levels (P=0.016). R-flurbiprofen had an excellent safety profile and showed dose-dependent central nervous system penetration. Exploratory analyses of plasma Aβ and peak drug levels suggested a short-term effect in plasma that warrants independent verification. The safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of R-flurbiprofen in these older individuals support the ongoing studies of this compound in patients with Alzheimer disease.",

    "abstract": "Objectives To develop a self-administered cognitive assessment instrument to facilitate the screening of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early dementia and determine its association with gold standard clinical assessments including neuropsychologic evaluation. Methods Adults aged above 59 years with sufficient vision and English literacy were recruited from geriatric and memory disorder clinics, educational talks, independent living facilities, senior centers, and memory screens. After Self-administered Gerocognitive Examination (SAGE) screening, subjects were randomly selected to complete a clinical evaluation, neurologic examination, neuropsychologic battery, functional assessment, and mini-mental state examination (MMSE). Subjects were identified as dementia, MCI, or normal based on standard clinical criteria and neuropsychologic testing. Results Two hundred fifty-four participants took the SAGE screen and 63 subjects completed the extensive evaluation (21 normal, 21 MCI, and 21 dementia subjects). Spearman rank correlation between SAGE and neuropsychologic battery was 0.84 (0.76 for MMSE). SAGE receiver operating characteristics on the basis of clinical diagnosis showed 95% specificity (90% for MMSE) and 79% sensitivity (71% for MMSE) in detecting those with cognitive impairment from normal subjects. Conclusions This study suggests that SAGE is a reliable instrument for detecting cognitive impairment and compares favorably with the MMSE. The self-administered feature may promote cognitive testing by busy clinicians prompting earlier diagnosis and treatment.",

    "abstract": "Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were carried out to assess the relationship between dementia patient suffering, caregiver depression, and antidepressant medication use in 1222 dementia patients and their caregivers. We assessed the prevalence of 2 types of patient suffering, emotional and existential distress, and examined their independent associations with caregiver depression and antidepressant medication use when controlling for sociodemographic characteristics of caregivers and patients, cognitive and physical disability of the patient, the frequency of patient memory problems and disruptive behaviors, and the amount of time spent caring for the patient. Multiple linear regression models showed that both aspects of perceived patient suffering independently contribute to caregiver depression (emotional distress: β=1.24; P<0.001; existential distress: β=0.66; P<0.01) whereas only existential suffering contributes to antidepressant medication use: odds ratio=1.25 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.42; P<0.01. In longitudinal analyses, increases in both types of suffering were associated with increases in caregiver depression (emotional distress: β=1.02; P<0.01; existential distress: β=0.64; P<0.01). This is the first study to show in a large sample that perceived patient suffering independently contributes to family caregiver depression and medication use. Medical treatment of patients that maintain or improve memory but do not address suffering may have little impact on the caregiver. Alzheimer disease patient suffering should be systematically assessed and treated by clinicians.",

    "abstract": "What was once called Pick's disease has three major anatomic variants. With all three, frontotemporal brain is selectively injured whereas posterior cortical regions are spared. These three clinical patterns include a bifrontal, slightly asymmetric subtype with more involvement of the right frontotemporal region called frontotemporal dementia or the frontal variant of FTD (fvFTD), a temporal-predominant subtype called the temporal variant of FTD or semantic dementia (SD), and a left frontal-predominant subtype called progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA). The three anatomic groups help to classify distinctive clinical syndromes with unique features. Careful study of these subtypes of frontotemporal dementia, using combinations of new quantitative neuroimaging, behavioral and physiological measures are yielding important information about the functioning of the brain's frontal and temporal regions. As we come to better understand the biologic basis for the three FTD clinical syndromes, new classification schemas may emerge, but our current clinical criteria serve as a strong guide to the diagnosis and separation of FTD from Alzheimer disease and other dementias.",

Ten subjects with mild-moderate Alzheimer disease and ten matched control subjects underwent gait analysis using an electronic walkway. Participants were required to walk at self-selected slow, preferred, and fast speeds. Stride length and step width variability were determined using the coefficient of variation. Results showed that stride length variability was significantly greater in the Alzheimer disease group compared with the control group at all speeds. In both groups, increases in walking speed were significantly correlated with decreases in stride length variability. Step width variability was significantly reduced in the Alzheimer disease group compared with the control group at slow speed only. In conclusion, there is an increase in stride length variability in Alzheimer disease at all walking speeds that may contribute to the increased incidence of falls in Alzheimer disease.",

Corresponding estimates for the US general population were calculated from the 2004 National Nursing Home Survey and the 2003 life table estimates from the US Census Bureau. Deaths from all causes by age 80 years are expected in 61% of AD patients and in 30% of the general population. From the age of 70 to 80 years, a typical AD patient spends 4 years at Clinical Dementia Rating stage 3 (severe), 3 years at stage 2 (moderate), and 3 years at stage 1 (mild). Nursing home admission by the age of 80 years is expected for ∼75% of surviving AD patients, but for only 4% of the general population. Among persons aged ≥65 years, reported age-adjusted and sex-adjusted mortality rates for AD increased to 33% from 1999 to 2004.",

Data were derived from interviews with the health care proxies (SWC-EOLD) and primary care nurses (SM-EOLD, CAD-EOLD) for 189 nursing home residents with advanced dementia living in 15 Boston-area facilities. The scales demonstrated satisfactory to good reliability: SM-EOLD (α=0.68), SWC-EOLD (α=0.83), and CAD-EOLD (α=0.82). The convergent validity of these scales, as measured against other established instruments assessing similar constructs, was good (correlation coefficients ranged from 0.50 to 0.81). The results of this study demonstrate that the 3 EOLD scales demonstrate \"internal consistency\" reliability and demonstrate convergent validity, and further establish their utility in palliative care dementia research.",

The objective of this study was to determine the regional distribution of NAA and mI alterations in AD by using MR spectroscopic imaging. Fourteen patients with AD and 22 cognitively normal elderly were studied using structural MR imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. Changes of NAA, mI, and various metabolite ratios were measured in frontal and parietal lobe gray matter (GM) and white matter. This study found: (1) when compared with cognitively normal subjects, AD patients had increased mI and mI/creatine (Cr) ratios primarily in parietal lobe GM, whereas frontal lobe GM and white matter were spared; (2) in the same region where mI was increased, AD patients had also decreased NAA and NAA/Cr ratios, replicating previous findings; (3) however, increased mI or mI/Cr ratios did not correlate with decreased NAA or NAA/Cr ratios; and (4) using mI/Cr and NAA/Cr together improved sensitivity and specificity to AD from control as compared with NAA/Cr alone. In conclusion, decreased NAA and increased mI in AD are primarily localized in parietal lobe GM regions. However, the NAA and mI changes are not correlated with each other, suggesting that they represent different processes that might help staging of AD.",

Given that the perceptions of illness can influence response to treatment options and coping with disease burden, we examined differences between African Americans and whites with regard to their attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge about AD. A total of 301 participants (mean age = 57 y; 80% female; 47% African American) were surveyed by telephone, with overrepresentation of caregivers and first-degree relatives of people with AD (62% of sample). After controlling for potentially confounding covariates, the 2 groups differed in terms of the following: (1) their knowledge about the disease (eg, recognizing that AD is not a part of normal aging); (2) concern about AD (eg, worry about developing the disease); (3) beliefs about putative causes of AD (eg, stress); and 4) beliefs about the effectiveness of various options for reducing risk of and treating AD (eg, physical activity). Findings suggest that AD outreach and education efforts may do well to take into account divergent illness perceptions across racial and ethnic groups. Further research is needed to confirm these findings in more representative samples and to identify factors that explain these racial differences.",

On the basis of this literature, we propose the Arsenic Exposure Hypothesis for AD that is inclusive of and cooperative with the existing hypotheses. Arsenic toxicity induces hyperphosphorylation of protein tau and overtranscription of the amyloid precursor protein, which are involved in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and brain amyloid plaques, consistent with the amyloid hypothesis of AD. Arsenic exposure has been associated with cardiovascular diseases and associated risk factors, which is in agreement with the vascular hypothesis of AD. Arsenic exposure invokes brain inflammatory responses, which resonates with the inflammatory hypotheses of AD. Arsenic exposure has been linked to reduced memory and intellectual abilities in children and adolescents, which provides a biologic basis for the developmental origin of health and disease hypothesis for AD. Arsenic and its metabolites generate free radicals causing oxidative stress and neuronal death, which fits the existing oxidative stress hypothesis. Taken together, the arsenic exposure hypothesis for AD provides a parsimonious testable hypothesis for the development and progression of this devastating disease at least for some subsets of individuals.",

The Lewy Body Dementia Association (www.LBDA.org) conducted a web-based survey of 962 caregivers (mean age 56 y; 88% women). The most common initial symptoms were cognitive (48%), motor (39%), or both (13%). Caregivers expressed concerns about fear of future (77%), feeling stressed (54%), loss of social life (52%), and uncertainty about what to do next (50%). Caregivers reported moderate-to-severe burden; 80% felt the people around them did not understand their burden and 54% reported feelings of isolation with spousal caregivers reporting more burden than nonspousal caregivers. Only 29% hired in-home assistance, whereas less than 40% used respite or adult day care, geriatric case managers, or attended a support group meeting. Lack of service utilization occurred despite two-thirds of caregivers reporting medical crises requiring emergency services, psychiatric care, or law enforcement. Caregivers reported preferences for web-based information, directories of LBD expert providers, information on LBD research, and location of local support groups. These findings highlight significant unmet needs for LBD caregivers and provide targets for intervention to reduce caregiver burden. Community resources such as the Lewy Body Dementia Association may serve this end, while also providing practical information and support for caregivers.",

In addition, most studies that examined MTL atrophy in Alzheimer disease have focused only on the hippocampus. It is unknown the extent to which volumes of amygdala and temporal horn of the lateral ventricle predict subsequent clinical decline. This study examined whether measures of hippocampus, amygdala, and temporal horn volume predict clinical decline over the following 6-month period in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Fully automated volume measurements were performed in 269 MCI patients. Baseline volumes of the hippocampus, amygdala, and temporal horn were evaluated as predictors of change in Mini-mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes over a 6-month interval. Fully automated measurements of baseline hippocampus and amygdala volumes correlated with baseline delayed recall scores. Patients with smaller baseline volumes of the hippocampus and amygdala or larger baseline volumes of the temporal horn had more rapid subsequent clinical decline on Mini-mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes. Fully automated and rapid measurement of segmental MTL volumes may help clinicians predict clinical decline in MCI patients. Supplemental digital content is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Approximately 3.2 million hospital stays annually involve a person with dementia, leading to higher costs, longer lengths of stay, and poorer outcomes. Older adults with dementia are vulnerable when hospitals are unable to meet their special needs.We developed, implemented, and evaluated a training program for 540 individuals at 4 community hospitals. Pretest, posttest, and a 120-day delayed posttest were performed to assess knowledge, confidence, and practice parameters.The mean age of the sample was 46 years; 83% were White, 90% were female, and 60% were nurses. Upon completion, there were significant gains (P's <0.001) in knowledge and confidence in recognizing, assessing, and managing dementia. Attendees reported gains in communication skills and strategies to improve the hospital environment, patient safety, and behavioral management. At 120 days, 3 of 4 hospitals demonstrated maintenance of confidence. In the hospital that demonstrated lower knowledge and confidence scores, the sample was older and had more nurses and more years in practice.We demonstrate the feasibility of training hospital staff about dementia and its impact on patient outcomes. At baseline, there was low knowledge and confidence in the ability to care for dementia patients. Training had an immediate impact on knowledge, confidence, and attitudes with lasting impact in 3 of 4 hospitals. We identified targets for intervention and the need for ongoing training and administrative reinforcement to sustain behavioral change. Community resources, such as local chapters of the Alzheimer Association, may be key community partners in improving care outcomes for hospitalized persons with dementia.",

A global cognitive composite score was derived (mean Z-score) from performance on 9 neuropsychologic subtests. Height and weight were assessed at baseline and used to calculate BMI. Generalized estimating equations (linear and logistic) assessed the relationships of baseline BMI with cognitive outcomes, clinician judgment of \"clinically significant decline\" over 1-year, and diagnostic progression from MCI to Alzheimer disease.Lower baseline BMI was associated with significant declines in cognitive performance in individuals with MCI over 1 year (Mini-Mental State Examination, Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale, and a global cognitive composite; all P<0.05). We observed a significant protective effect of baseline BMI in reducing the risk of a clinically significant decline in Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale and mini-mental state examination (P<0.05). No association was found between BMI and changes in the clinical dementia rating sum of boxes or conversion to Alzheimer disease.Lower baseline BMI is associated with more rapid cognitive decline in MCI. This relationship suggests either body composition may influence the rate of cognitive decline in MCI or factors related to MCI influence body composition.",

After an initial, unsuccessful approach with satellite clinics in minority neighborhoods, the ADC shifted to an active community outreach approach. Multiple strategies were implemented to remove barriers to research participation such as providing transportation to clinical appointments and offering in-home cognitive screening. Considerable resources were directed toward hiring and training bicultural and bilingual individuals with knowledge of the target populations, both as recruiters and staff involved in clinical assessment. Implementation of these methods resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of ethnic minorities enrolled (and retained) in research protocols, including protocols that are complex and longitudinal. Diversity was achieved on other variables as well; years of education in the cohort range from 0 to 21, with 26% having 8 years or less. The community screen identified candidates for an in depth clinical evaluation and enrollment in longitudinal research, and we examined factors that predicted a positive response to invitation for the clinical evaluation. Individuals with a broader fund of knowledge were more likely to participate independent of other variables including ethnicity and education. When diversity is an important goal active outreach is far more efficacious than clinic-based and advertising-based approaches to recruitment.",

Our study examined barriers and facilitators of AD research participation among African Americans. Investigators conducted 11 focus groups with African American participants (n=70) who discussed barriers and facilitators to AD research participation including lumbar puncture studies. The moderator and comoderator independently reviewed the transcripts, identified themes, and coded transcripts for analysis. Participants were predominately female (73%) with a mean age of 52 years (range 21 to 86 y). Concerns and attitudes were consistent across education, socioeconomic status, and sex. Mistrust was a fundamental reason for nonparticipation. Additional barriers included insufficient information dissemination in the African American community, inconvenience, and reputation of the researcher and research institution. Barriers to participation in AD biomarker studies were fear of the unknown and adverse effects. Altruism and relevance of research projects to the individual, family members, or the African American community facilitate participation. Increased participation results from relationships with the community that extend beyond immediate research interests, dissemination of research findings, and emphasis on relevance of proposed studies. Pervasive barriers impede African American participation in AD research but can be overcome through a sustained presence in the community.",

Methods to improve recruitment exist, but require varying levels of staff effort and financial resources, and evidence of effectiveness is often lacking or inconsistent. In this review, we summarize some of the available methods to improve AD research recruitment, the available literature to support or refute these strategies, and some of the experiences at the authors’ AD Research Centers.

Method: Subjects included 383 normal control (NC) and 655 AD subjects with serial data from the CERAD registry database. Annualized CERAD Total Change Scores were derived and Reliable Change Indexes (RCIs) calculated to establish statistically reliable change values. CERAD Change Scores were compared with annualized change scores from the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) Sum of Boxes, and Blessed Dementia Rating Scale (BDRS). Results: For the CERAD Total Score, the AD sample showed significantly greater decline than the NC sample over the 4-year interval, with AD subjects declining an average of 22.2 points compared with the NCs' improving an average 2.8 points from baseline to last visit [Group × Time interaction [F(4,1031)=246.08, P<0.001)]. By Visit 3, the majority of AD subjects (65.2%) showed a degree of cognitive decline that fell outside the RCI. CERAD Change Scores significantly correlated (P<0.001) with MMSE (r=−0.66), CDR (r=−0.42), and BDRS (r=−0.38) change scores. Conclusion: Results support the utility of the CERAD Total Score as a measure of AD progression and provide comparative data for annualized change in CERAD Total Score and other summary measures.",

Genetic and molecular studies have confirmed that in the human brain, amyloid-β fibrils can induce, through the activation of NALP1 inflammosome, inflammatory and apoptotic responses involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Considering that AD pathogenesis is multifactorial, we hypothesized that NALP1/NLRP1 could be a susceptibility gene involved in the devolvement of the disease. The possible association between 9 selected polymorphisms in the NALP1/NLRP1 gene and AD was evaluated by comparing their frequency distribution in an Italian cohort of AD patients (AD, n = 276) and in a group of Italian sex-matched and age-matched healthy controls without dementia (HC, n = 266). Our study, evidences the association of 4 nonsynonymous polymorphisms in the NLRP1 gene (rs2137722, rs34733791, rs11657747, rs11651595) with AD. The major alleles of all 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms and the corresponding homozygote genotypes were more frequent in AD patients than in healthy controls, suggesting an association of these variants in the predisposition versus the development of the disease. These findings seem to support the previously reported role of NALP1 in neuronal damage, and provide evidence of an association between single nucleotide variations in the NLRP1 gene and AD.",

We investigated associations between chronic stress and diagnostic change in 62 individuals (mean age, 78.7 y) participating in an Alzheimer disease research center longitudinal study. The subjects, diagnosed at baseline as cognitively normal (CN) or with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), were followed for an average of 2.5 years. Senior neurologists, blind to detailed measures of stress and cognition, assigned diagnoses annually. Logistic regression analyses assessed the accuracy with which measures of stress (event-based ratings, cortisol levels) predicted the conversion to MCI and dementia. Eleven individuals with MCI at baseline received a dementia diagnosis during follow-up. Sixteen converted from cognitively normal to MCI. Prolonged, highly stressful experiences were associated with conversion from MCI to dementia. The cortisol awakening response, with age and education, was associated with a diagnostic change to MCI. Cortisol measures were not associated with the progression from MCI to dementia, and there was no association between stressful experiences and the change to MCI. Mechanisms associated with the transition from normal cognition to MCI may differ from those associated with a diagnostic change to dementia. These findings could facilitate the identification of interventional strategies to reduce the risk of decline at different stages of susceptibility.",

Aims: The aims of our systematic review were: (1) to systematically obtain and evaluate the relevant literature on HS and dementia; and (2) to summarize current research findings and draw conclusions for future research and clinical care in this area. Method: A systematic review of the literature on HS and dementia was conducted up till June 2013. Results: From the 478 retrieved articles, 48 were included in the review. Conceptually, the studies examined professional and nonprofessional sources of help; showed preference for seeking help from close relatives followed by primary health caregivers; and identified inadequate knowledge and stigmatic beliefs as the main barriers to HS. The majority of the studies did not rely on a theoretical framework. Conclusions: Although the body of literature in the area of HS and dementia is growing, several conceptual and methodological limitations still have to be resolved to advance knowledge in the area.",

Cross-sectional studies have shown that different dementia syndromes are associated with different patterns of regional brain tissue loss. Rates of atrophy over time may be useful for differential diagnosis, and could be used to monitor disease progression, serving as an outcome measure for clinical trials. We studied patients with AD (n=12), FTD (n=13), SD (n=20), and normal controls (n=23) longitudinally with structural magnetic resonance imaging, using BRAINS2 software to measure frontal, temporal, and parietal lobe volumes. In FTD the rate of frontal lobe atrophy over 1 year was greater than in any other group, whereas SD showed the highest rate in the temporal lobes. Atrophy in these regions progressed twice as quickly in FTD and SD compared with AD. Atrophy was not significantly faster for AD in any brain region compared with the other groups. Regional atrophy over time was significantly faster in FTD and SD compared with AD, and the regions of greatest atrophy were specific for each syndrome. Measuring specific regions of cerebral volume changes by serial neuroimaging may serve as a useful biomarker outcome measure for clinical trials in neurodegenerative diseases.",

In the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), participants complete direct memory assessments biennially until they are too impaired to complete the interview. Thereafter, proxy informants, typically spouses, assess the subject's memory and cognitive function using standardized instruments. Because there is no common scale for direct memory assessments and proxy assessments, proxy reports are often excluded from longitudinal analyses. The Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS) implemented full neuropsychological examinations on a subsample (n=856) of HRS participants, including respondents with direct or proxy cognitive assessments in the prior HRS core interview. Using data from the ADAMS, we developed an approach to estimating a dementia probability and a composite memory score on the basis of either proxy or direct assessments in HRS core interviews. The prediction model achieved a c-statistic of 94.3% for DSM diagnosed dementia in the ADAMS sample. We applied these scoring rules to HRS core sample respondents born 1923 or earlier (n=5483) for biennial assessments from 1995 to 2008. Compared with estimates excluding proxy respondents in the full cohort, incorporating information from proxy respondents increased estimated prevalence of dementia by 12 percentage points in 2008 (average age=89) and suggested accelerated rates of memory decline over time.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is important for declarative memory consolidation in healthy adults. Sleep disruptions are typical in Alzheimer disease, but whether they contribute to memory impairment is unknown. Sleep has not been formally examined in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), which is characterized by declarative-memory deficits without dementia and can signify prodromal Alzheimer disease. We studied 10 aMCI patients and 10 controls over 2 weeks using daily sleep surveys, wrist-worn activity sensors, and daily recognition tests. Recognition was impaired and more variable in aMCI patients, whereas sleep was similar across groups. However, lower recognition of items learned the previous day was associated with lower subjective sleep quality in aMCI patients. This correlation was not present for information learned the same day and thus did not reflect nonspecific effects of poor sleep on memory. These results indicate that inadequate memory consolidation in aMCI patients is related to declines in subjective sleep indices. Furthermore, participants with greater across-night sleep variability exhibited lower scores on a standardized recall test taken prior to the 2-week protocol, suggesting that consistent sleep across nights also contributes to successful memory. Physiological analyses are needed to further specify which aspects of sleep in neurological disorders impact memory function and consolidation.",

Compared with participants who remained cognitively normal, those progressing to later-stage dementia (CDR=1) declined in their mobility by a factor of 2.82 (P<0.001), followed by those who maintained a later-stage diagnosis (slope=−1.84, P<0.001), those progressing from early-stage to later-stage (CDR=0.5 to CDR=1) dementia (slope=−1.20, P<0.001), and those who progressed to early-stage dementia (slope=−0.39, P=0.038) suggesting a steeper physical decline with dementia progression, particularly in those with the fastest disease progression. Although all types of dementia experienced mobility decline, those progressing to non-Alzheimer disease (AD) dementias, especially vascular dementia declined faster than those who remained normal (slope=−2.70, P<0.001) or progressed to AD (slope=−2.18, P<0.001). These associations were better captured by the gait/balance component of physical functionality. Our findings suggest that rapidly progressing dementia patients particularly those with non-AD subtypes should be targeted for interventions to maintain or improve gait/balance and prevent functional decline and disability although AD patients may also benefit.",

In contrast, studies suggest that ToM is spared in Alzheimer disease (AD). However, there is controversy whether recognition of emotion in faces is impaired in AD. This study challenges the concepts that ToM is preserved in AD and that recognition of facial emotion is impaired in bvFTD. ToM, recognition of facial emotion, and identification of emotions associated with video vignettes were studied in bvFTD, AD, and normal controls. ToM was assessed using false-belief and visual perspective-taking tasks. Identification of facial emotion was tested using Ekman and Friesen's pictures of facial affect. After adjusting for relevant covariates, there were significant ToM deficits in bvFTD and AD compared with controls, whereas neither group was impaired in the identification of emotions associated with video vignettes. There was borderline impairment in recognizing angry faces in bvFTD. Patients with AD showed significant deficits on false belief and visual perspective taking, and bvFTD patients were impaired on second-order false belief. We report novel findings challenging the concepts that ToM is spared in AD and that recognition of facial emotion is impaired in bvFTD.",

Recent evidence suggests that sleep habits are differentially compromised in different subtypes of MCI, but the relationship between sleep disruption and MCI remains poorly understood. We gathered daily objective measures of sleep disturbance from 45 seniors, including 16 with MCI (mean age, 86.9±4.3 y), over a 6-month period. We also collected self-report measures of sleep disturbance. Although there were no differences between groups in any of our self-report measures, we found that amnestic MCI (aMCI) volunteers had less disturbed sleep than both nonamnestic MCI (naMCI) and cognitively intact volunteers, as measured objectively by movement in bed at night (F2,1078=4.30, P=0.05), wake after sleep onset (F2,1078=41.6, P<0.001), and number of times up at night (F2,1078=26.7, P<0.001). The groups did not differ in total sleep time. In addition, the aMCI group had less day-to-day variability in these measures than the intact and naMCI volunteers. In general, the naMCI volunteers showed a level of disturbed sleep that was intermediate to that of aMCI and intact volunteers. These differences in sleep disruption between aMCI and naMCI may be related to differences in the pathology underlying these MCI subtypes.",

However, no studies have investigated DMN connectivity at different stages of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The aim of this study was to investigate patterns of DMN connectivity and its breakdown among cognitively normal (CN), early MCI (EMCI), and late MCI (LMCI) subjects. Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging data and neuropsychological test scores from 130 subjects (CN=43, EMCI=47, LMCI=40) were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. DMN functional connectivity was extracted using independent components analysis and compared between groups. Results: Functional connectivity in the precuneus, bilateral medial frontal, parahippocampal, middle temporal, right superior temporal, and left angular gyri was decreased in EMCI subjects compared with CN subjects. When the 2 MCI groups were directly compared, LMCI subjects exhibited decreased functional connectivity in the precuneus, bilateral medial frontal gyri, and left angular gyrus. There was no significant difference in gray matter volume among the 3 groups. Amyloid-positive EMCI subjects revealed more widespread breakdown of DMN connectivity than amyloid-negative EMCI subjects. A quantitative index of DMN connectivity correlated well with measures of cognitive performance. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the breakdown of DMN connectivity may occur in the early stage of MCI.",

Whether these markers have biological influence on Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology is not known. We thus aimed to investigate the effect of cognitive reserve proxies on longitudinal change of AD biomarkers. A total of 819 participants with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and mild AD were enrolled in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and followed up with repeated measures of cerebrospinal fluid, positron emission tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers. Generalized estimating equations were used to assess whether biomarker rates of change were modified by reserve proxies. Cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 decline was slower in normal cognition participants with higher cognitive reserve indexed by education, occupation, and American National Adult Reading Test (ANART). The decline of [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography uptake was slower in AD participants with better performance on the ANART. Education, occupation, and ANART did not modify the rates of magnetic resonance imaging hippocampal atrophy in any group. These findings remained unchanged after accounting for APOE 4, longitudinal missing data, and baseline cognitive performance. Higher levels of reserve markers may slow the rate of amyloid deposition before cognitive impairment and preserve glucose metabolism at the dementia stage over the course of AD pathologic progression.",

We used generalized linear models with AD-GRS-by-age and AD-GRS-by-age interactions (age centered at 70) to predict memory decline. Average NHB decline was 26% faster than NHW decline (P<0.001). Among NHW, 10% higher AD-GRS predicted faster memory decline (linear β=-0.058 unit decrease over 10 y; 95% confidence interval,-0.074 to -0.043). AD-GRSexAPOE also predicted faster decline for NHW, although less strongly. Among NHB, AD-GRS predicted faster memory decline (linear β=-0.050; 95% confidence interval, -0.106 to 0.006), but AD-GRSexAPOE did not. Our nonsignificant estimate among NHB may reflect insufficient statistical power or a misspecified AD-GRS among NHB as an overwhelming majority of genome-wide association studies are conducted in NHW.

Studies report associations between CKD and cognitive impairment; although unclear, there seems to be a graded association between stage of CKD and affected cognitive domains, with executive function being affected earlier in the process than episodic memory and global ability. In CKD, dysexecutive mild cognitive impairment and vascular dementia are also more prominent than other subtypes. Explanations are directed toward traditional and nontraditional vascular factors, which may also explain or mediate the association between CKD and type of cognitive impairment. Future research is urged to focus on the longitudinal association between specific domains of cognitive function, including executive function and memory and CKD; to develop screening tools fit for every CKD stage in elderly individuals, and lastly, to use imaging methods that may help clarify the underlying mechanisms connecting the kidney and the brain.",

The aim of this study was to ascertain the prevalence of cognitive impairment without dementia and dementia in community-dwelling elderly in Brazil.This was a single-phase cross-sectional survey of the elderly (aged 60 years and above) living in the municipality of Tremembé, Brazil. Twenty percent of the households with elderly persons were randomly selected from urban and rural areas, to obtain a homogenous representation of all socioeconomic and cultural levels.We assessed 630 individuals [mean age, 71.3 y (±7.99); mean years of education, 4.9 (±4.54)] and found prevalence rates of 17.5% (95% confidence interval, 14.6-20.6) for dementia and 19.5% (95% confidence interval, 16.6-22.8) for cognitive impairment without dementia. These prevalence rates were influenced by age (P<0.001) and by educational level (P<0.001). There was no significant sex difference among diagnostic groups (P=0.166). The prevalence of dementia was higher in relatively younger individuals (below 70 y) when compared with other studies. Besides, dementia was associated with low socioeconomic status, stroke, previous psychiatric disorder, alcoholism, and epilepsy.The prevalence of dementia in this study was higher than in other studies, particularly among younger elderly.",

Because therapeutic regimens are limited, modification of lifestyle behaviors may offer the best means for disease control. To test the hypotheses that lifestyle factors are related to lower risk of dementia in the oldest-old, we analyzed data from The 90+ Study, a population-based longitudinal cohort study initiated in 2003. This analysis included 587 participants (mean age=93 y) seen in-person and determined not to have dementia at enrollment. Information on lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol, caffeine, vitamin supplements, exercise, and other activities) was obtained at enrollment and was available from data collected 20 years previously. After an average follow-up of 36 months, 268 participants were identified with incident dementia. No variable measured 20 years previously was associated with risk. Engagement in specific social/mental activities and intakes of antioxidant vitamin supplements and caffeine at time of enrollment were, associated with significantly reduced risks. When these variables were analyzed together, the HRs changed little and remained significant for reading (0.54, P=0.01) and going to church/synagogue (HR=0.66, P<0.05) but not for caffeine (HR=0.61, P=0.15) and vitamin C (HR=0.68, P=0.07).

The overall prevalence of dementia was 5.0%, with 75.3% of the cases attributed to Alzheimer disease. Dementia odds were 15.8% higher for every year of advancing age and 9.4% lower for every additional year of education.

Methods: A total of 9605 health care plan members who provided information regarding midlife stressors in 1972 to 1973 (ages, 40 to 55 y) were followed for dementia diagnosis between 1996 and 2017. Cox proportional hazard models evaluated associations between midlife stressors and dementia adjusting for demographics and lifecourse health indicators. Results: Reporting at least 1 midlife stressor was associated with 17% greater dementia risk [hazard ratio (HR), 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI),1.07-1.27] versus 0 midlife stressors and 26% increased risk among those with less than equal to high school education (HR, 1.26; 95% CI,1.09-1.44) adjusting for demographics.

When modeled together, the psychological characteristics and psychological health domain was the only independent predictor of living well [effect size, 3.55; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.93-4.17], and effect sizes were smaller for physical fitness and physical health (1.23, 95% CI: -0.10 to 2.58), social capitals, assets and resources (0.67; 95% CI: -0.04 to 1.38), managing everyday life with dementia (0.33; 95% CI: -0.06 to 0.71), and social location (0.08; 95% CI: -2.10 to 2.26).Psychological resources, and the social, environmental, and physical factors that underpin positive psychological states, are potentially important targets for interventions and initiatives that aim to improve the experience of living with dementia.",

Both white and African-American families participated in research to help their care recipients and future generations, receive support from the clinical and research staff, and obtain feedback about patient status and research results. Among white caregivers, primary barriers to participation in research included the potential for no direct benefit, problems with the procedures and tests involved, lack of time and resources, and difficulty accepting the diagnosis. Among African-American caregivers, primary barriers included general skepticism about the research process and firmly established attitudes about medical treatment and help seeking that serve as disincentives to research participation. To maximize the perceived benefits of research participation, potential participants should have access to regular personal contact with staff, information about health status changes in the care recipient, and the short-term and long-term results of the research studies in which they are participants. In addition, researchers should be sensitive to the concerns that may serve as barriers to participation, particularly among African Americans.",

The interview assessed the impact of cognition on functional abilities in daily life and a variety of psychiatric symptoms, including symptoms of psychosis, depression, and personality change. Participants were followed annually for 3 years to determine who had progressive functional decline and who progressed to meet clinical criteria for AD. Those diagnosed with AD on follow-up had more symptoms of personality change, such as agitation and passivity, at baseline than those who did not progress to meet clinical criteria for AD. Mild depressive symptoms were also more common among individuals at baseline who subsequently `converted' to AD. Symptoms of personality change were associated with a more rapid increase in functional difficulty over time, whereas depressive symptoms were not. Changes in personality are more common among subjects with memory changes who go on to develop AD. Particular types of personality change, such as agitation and passivity, are related to progression of functional difficulty over time.

The records of 64 consecutive demented patients were reviewed. Pathologic diagnoses were independently established [35 AD cases, 11 cases of pure dementia with Lewy bodies (pDLB), and 18 cases of combined AD plus Lewy bodies (AD+LB)], and several neurodegenerative lesions were quantified. Clinical and pathologic data were compared between groups with univariate and multivariate analyses. Compared with the other groups, pDLB cases had more frequent acute-subacute onset of dementia [45% vs. AD (3%) and AD+LB (16%)], early parkinsonism [45% vs. AD (0%) and AD+LB (0%)], early [27% vs. AD (0%) and AD+LB (0%)] and late [73% vs. AD (11%) and AD+LB (16%)] hallucinations, fluctuating course [46% vs. AD (9%) and AD+LB (22%)], delusions [45% vs. AD (11%) and AD+LB (6%)], spontaneous parkinsonism [63% vs. AD (8%) and AD+LB (16%)], less frequent ideomotor apraxia and loss of insight, earlier urinary incontinence [3.2 +/- 1.4 years after onset vs. AD (6.3 years) and AD+LB (5.8 years)], shorter duration of dementia [7.7 +/- 2.4 years vs. AD (9.6 years) and AD+LB (11 years)], milder atrophy in computed tomography scans, greater brain weight, more transcortical spongiosis, wider cortex and subcortex, and less amyloid angiopathy. All pDLB cases but no AD cases had abnormal CA2 neurites. The clinical features of AD+LB patients were similar to those of AD patients other than more frequent acute-subacute onset and fluctuating evolution. Discriminant analyses selected four clinical variables differentiating pDLB from the other two groups as a whole: acute-subacute onset, early parkinsonism, early hallucinations, and early onset of urinary incontinence. Two or more of these features identified pDLB with a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 95.9%. Differentiation between the three groups (pDLB, AD+LB, and AD) or between both groups with LB (DLB) from AD could be only attained in 70% of cases. We conclude that early symptomatology is the main clue for the diagnosis of pDLB. We identified by discriminant analysis a set of clinical diagnostic criteria similar to those proposed by the Consortium on Dementia With Lewy Bodies. Accuracy was excellent for the diagnosis of pDLB but only mediocre for separating AD+LB as well as the entire DLB group from AD.",

We invited presentations from key experts, selectively reviewed the literature, and developed a consensus statement. The efficacy of and benefits from unselective use of cognitive testing and informant questionnaires for detecting early dementia in older patients attending general practice are limited. Positive predictive values of cognitive screening for dementia are less than 50%, even for older patient populations. Higher values may be obtained by testing patients who have a relevant history of cognitive or functional decline. What ever procedures are adopted for screening older general practice attenders for cognitive impairment or early dementia, investigation is still required into the relative merits of different health professionals performing the screening, the positive and negative effects on patients and their families, and the cost-benefit ratio. The majority view of workshop participants was that cognitive testing should occur for older patients when there is a reason to suspect dementia. Testing may occur in an individual considered to be at risk because of an informant history of cognitive or functional decline, clinical observation, or, sometimes, very old age. No single instrument for cognitive screening is suitable for global use. Screening programs must be supported by training and supplemented by education for professionals and families in management of dementia.",

There was no significant correlation between driving status and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Only the attention subscore of the awareness questionnaire yielded a statistically significant difference between drivers and nondrivers. Follow-up of the patients who were still driving was conducted 12-18 months later. All but 4 patients had stopped driving. Caregivers responded to a questionnaire assessing the patient's driving behaviors since the onset of AD. There was no correlation between MMSE and driving status. In 7 of 10 cases, caregivers or patients made the decision that the patient should stop driving. However, caregivers reported long periods between the caregiver's perception that the patient should stop driving and actual cessation (0.5^8 months). Results suggest that AD patients do restrict several areas of their driving voluntarily and that a failure to do so may be associated with an awareness deficit. In particular, a deficit of awareness for attention was significantly associated with an absence of restricted driving behaviors such as avoiding unfamiliar routes. Awareness of a deficit that is related to driving performance may be critical to restricted driving behavior, and this change in behavior may enable the patient to prolong his or her status as a driver",

Specific Aims (1) To describe pathways to diagnosis from the perspective of family caregivers and (2) to compare help-seeking patterns and experiences across three ethnic groups. Methods Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 39 ethnically diverse family dementia caregivers. Interviews were coded for help-seeking events (initial help-seeking, referrals to secondary helpers, and site of final diagnosis), pathway types, and adverse experiences within the healthcare system along pathways to diagnosis. Results Help-seeking was most often initiated by family members or formal care providers (ie, healthcare providers or social workers), usually in outpatient primary care settings but also elsewhere (eg, social service agencies, hospitals). \"Secondary\" formal helpers were often involved, usually through self-referral by families rather than by healthcare providers. While most families reported receiving a \"final\" diagnosis, a small minority of predominantly Chinese-American families did not. Four distinct pathways to diagnosis were identified and found to vary significantly (p < 0.03) across the three ethnic groups, which we label as smooth pathways, crisis events pathways, fragmented pathways, and dead-end pathways. Adverse experiences in the healthcare system were common and included unsatisfactory diagnosis disclosure and explanation, inadequate workup, uncaring or insensitive attitude, language barriers, and discrimination. Conclusions Cross-ethnic differences were found in both pathway types and in adverse experiences.",

Inflation of test scores as a result of practice effects may yield false-negative results in test-retest and multidisciplinary settings, particularly among patients with mild cognitive deficits. To address this issue, animal naming was administered twice within a 1-week period to a group of individuals referred for suspected dementia who were ultimately diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; amnestic form), probable Alzheimer disease (AD), or no dementia. A 2 × 3 repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant interaction between administration time and group. Post hoc analyses indicated that nondemented controls were the only group to demonstrate a significant practice effect, producing an average of approximately three more animal names at time two. Like patients with a diagnosis of AD, subjects with amnestic MCI failed to benefit from repeated exposure to the animal naming test, and only controls showed an average improvement upon retest. This underscores the cognitive similarity between individuals diagnosed with amnestic MCI and AD and suggests that improvement upon retest may be a diagnostically useful finding.",

The authors' group has developed such an instrument (i.e., Severe Mini-Mental State Examination; SMMSE) to assess this population. Based on the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the SMMSE, which totals 30 points, was designed to briefly assess cognitive domains relatively preserved in moderate to severe Alzheimer disease. One hundred eighty-two patients with possible or probable Alzheimer disease were administered both the MMSE and SMMSE. Performances on the SMMSE and MMSE were found to correlate significantly only when MMSE fell below 9 points (p < 0.0001). However, as performance on the MMSE approached floor levels, patients continued to score at half maximal levels on the SMMSE. Functional staging with the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale and the Global Deterioration Scale also were found to significantly correlate with performance on the SMMSE (p < 0.001). Test–retest performance on both the SMMSE and MMSE was relatively stable over a period of 5 months. Inter-rater reliability of the SMMSE was excellent. These results suggest that the SMMSE has both construct and criterion validity for assessing severely impaired Alzheimer disease patients. Our results also suggest that the SMMSE may be a useful instrument for assessing severely impaired patients at the bedside and in the office.",

However, the discrepancy between the ratings was statistically significant only for Language Disorder, Higher Cognitive Deficits, Memory Disorder, Dementia, and Apraxia, and not for Agitation, Need for Routine, Depression, and Disorientation scales. Unawareness was not related to severity of memory impairment, as measured by the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (Wilson et al., 1985). The results of this small, preliminary study of relatively severely impaired AD patients suggest that awareness of psychiatric and behavioral problems may be relatively preserved compared to awareness of cognitive problems. These findings should be replicated with a larger sample with a broader range of severity.",

    "abstract": "A standardized neuropsychological test battery was administered to 167 patients with different forms of mild-to-moderate dementia: probable Alzheimer dementia (AD: n = 49), multi-infarct dementia (n = 43), idiopathic Parkinson disease with dementia (n = 35), depressive pseudodementia (n = 26), and progressive supranuclear palsy (n = 14). Results obtained were used (a) to analyze the profiles of cognitive impairment shown by the different dementia groups; (b) to assess the incidence of some neuropsychological patterns that we hypothesized to be more characteristic of AD, in the various groups; and hence (c) to evaluate the reliability of these patterns as diagnostic markers of AD. Four of the patterns investigated were derived from a verbal learning task (Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning test): (1) absence of the primacy effect; (2) tendency to produce intrusion errors during free recall of a word list; (3) absolute decay of memory trace; and (4) tendency to produce false alarms during delayed recognition of the same word list. Two additional patterns were derived from visual-spatial tasks (copying drawings and Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices): (5) occurrence of the closing-in phenomenon in copying drawings; and (6) tendency to choose globalistic or odd responses in Raven's matrices. Though all the six patterns were somewhat useful for identifying AD patients, no pattern met the criteria of being both highly sensitive and highly specific, which should characterize an ideal marker. In fact, intrusions and false alarms were observed in many AD patients, but also in patients affected by other forms of dementia. The absence of the primacy effect, the closing-in phenomenon, and the absolute decay of memory trace were more specific, but could be observed in only one-third of AD patients. We also computed the number of positive patterns shown by each patient and assumed the presence of two or more patterns as a global index suggestive of a dementia of the Alzheimer type. With this cumulative method, a higher level of sensitivity and specificity was achieved in the identification of AD patients.",

The objective was to clarify to what extent dissolution of language in vascular dementia is similar to that in Alzheimer disease. Both structured language tests (comprehension, repetition, reading, and naming tasks) and nonstructured language tests (object and picture description) were employed. The structured tasks evidenced impairment on complex auditory comprehension and on picture naming for both dementia groups, whereas oral reading and single word repetition did not differentiate the patients from matched control subjects. On the unstructured narrative tasks, both patient groups showed normal fluency, but content analysis revealed that the patients with dementia produced fewer semantic units (themes) than the control subjects. In summary, both patient groups showed impairment, specifically on semantically mediated language tasks. According to the present results, language impairment in vascular dementia resembles that observed in Alzheimer disease. Semantically mediated functions are among the most sensitive language measures in differentiating early stages of both vascular dementia and Alzheimer disease from normal aging.",

Autopsy confirmation of Alzheimer disease (AD) was based on the age-graded National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus conference pathologic criteria. Using the NINCDS-ADRDA clinical criteria and the NIH pathologic criteria, the diagnostic accuracy was 88%, the sensitivity was 98%, and the specificity was 69%. Additional strict clinical and pathologic criteria developed by the RADP were applied in the final review of these cases to exclude all confounding causes of dementia, including cerebral infarcts. After applying these additional criteria, a subset of 62 cases of \"pure\" AD and \"pure\" control subjects was identified for a more detailed examination of neuritic plaques (NP) and neurons containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). The NP and NFT were counted in three subfields of hippocampus and two areas of association neocortex. The density of diffuse plaques (plaques lacking dystrophic neurites) was estimated on a semiquantitative basis. Results show that the AD patients and control groups could be distinguished from each other easily on the basis of mean NP and NFT counts, but there was sufficient overlap in the counts to present difficulty in diagnosing any individual case. Abundant diffuse plaque involvement and NFT in the neocortex were, however, seen only in AD cases.",

This paper reports on the relationship between level of insight and severity of dementia in a large sample of patients with Alzheimer disease, largely with mild to moderately severe dementia. The study is based on data from 670 patients with a research diagnosis of probable Alzheimer disease who were enrolled in the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD). The degree of insight was rated by the examiner on the basis of the patient's answers to questions probing awareness of his or her memory deficits or other symptoms of cognitive impairment. Severity of dementia was assessed using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, Short Blessed Test, Blessed Dementia Rating Scale, and Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination. Two-year longitudinal follow-up data on insight level and dementia severity were available for 148 of the 670 patients. Decreased level of insight correlated significantly with severity of dementia as measured by all rating instruments. For the patients followed for 2 years, 33.1% declined in level of insight from the entry level. This decline was statistically associated with more severe dementia as measured by the Blessed Dementia Rating Scale. This study confirms the generally accepted belief that patients with Alzheimer disease experience a progressive loss of insight as the severity of dementia increases. Due to methodologic limitations, we are unable to draw conclusions about loss of insight in patients with very mild cognitive impairment.",

To determine the accuracy of a clinical diagnosis of AD as made by practicing physicians, we reviewed the clinicopathologic records of a dementia brain bank and summarized the literature. Of 650 demented patients diagnosed during life as having AD, at autopsy 505 (78%) had AD with or without other neuropathologic conditions; only 390 (60%) of these had AD as the only neuropathologic condition. Of the remaining 145 (22%) patients with no neuropathologic evidence of AD, 39 had the nigrostriatal changes of Parkinson disease (PD), 25 had nonspecific degenerations, 15 had Pick disease, 14 had multiple infarcts, and 11 lacked any neuropathologic abnormality. Although the overall clinical accuracy for AD was lower than that summarized from the literature, clinical accuracy improved significantly between 1986 and 1990. In our broad sample of practitioners, accuracy of clinical diagnosis of AD may be improving, but continues to be hampered by difficulty in distinguishing the dementia of AD from certain dementing conditions and from AD mixed with other neuropathologic conditions.",

Of particular importance to clinicians and researchers studying dementia is determining whether a patient has the capacity to provide informed consent to treatment and medical research. No widely accepted standardized instruments exist for competency assessment, nor has competency assessment training been available to physicians. As a result, physician competency assessment has been a subjective and even idiosyncratic process. Recent studies have suggested that physicians have difficulty assessing capacity to consent in older adults and frequently disagree in their competency judgments. Accordingly, one important goal for advancing ethical and legal research in AD will involve the development of standardized approaches to determining patient capacity to give consent. This article reports the findings of recent empirical studies of competency determination in AD, focusing on work in the areas of physician competency assessment, development of standardized assessment instruments, and neuropsychological modeling of competency loss. Future directions for research in these three areas are identified.",

A randomized control trial design was used. Subjects were residents with Alzheimer disease in three geriatric long-term care facilities in Metropolitan Toronto. Residents who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to one of three groups: walk-and-talk group (30 min, 5 times per week for 16 weeks, walking/talking in pairs), talk-only group (30 min, 5 times per week for 16 weeks, talk only in pairs), or no intervention. The outcome measures were the Functional Assessment of Communication Skills for Adults, the 2-min walk test, and London Psychogeriatric Rating Scale. Residents who received the walk-and-talk intervention did not demonstrate statistically significant differences in the outcome variables measured posttest when compared with residents who received the talk-only intervention or no intervention, even after controlling for individual differences. Variability in the outcomes measured posttest is explained by differences in the residents' level of cognitive impairment before the study rather than by study group membership.

    "abstract": "Summary Local metabolites have long been considered to play an important physiological role in regulating regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). However, the evidence reviewed here emphasizes that the regulation of (rCBF) by central cholinergic nerves is independent of regional metabolism. Activation of the intracranial cholinergic fibers originating in the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) and septal complex releases acetyl-choline in the cortex and hippocampus, which results in vasodilation and an increase in rCBF in the cortex and hippocampus. Such intracranial cholinergic vasodilative nerve fibers do not belong to the autonomie nervous system according to the traditional definition by Langley, but interestingly, these fibers behave in the brain similarly to the action of autonomie nerves in peripheral organs. The NBM could be transiently stimulated to increase rCBF by nonpharmacological methods. For example, cutaneous sensory stimulation activates the cholinergic nerves originating from the NBM to enhance rCBF. The increase in rCBF at the diffuse cortices during walking appears to include an excitation of this NBM-originating cholinergic vasodilation system. Other various inputs to the NBM may have a similar effect to enhance rCBF via activation of that cholinergic system, provided the stimulation is delivered properly. Thus the combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological techniques may provide a balance in our attempts to improve cholinergic replacement therapy.",

There were 68 patients with Alzheimer disease, 10 with vascular dementia, and the remaining 12 formed a miscellaneous group. The frequency of the following behaviors in relation to the severity of the dementia were assessed: aggression, physical violence, wandering, incontinence, disinhibition, binge-eating, hallucinations, delusions, and depression. The most common behavioral change was aggression (59%), followed by wandering (27%), delusions (22%), and incontinence (18%). Aggression caused the most distress to the caregiver. There was a higher incidence of wandering, incontinence (p = 0.009), and persecutory delusions (p = 0.02) in the moderate–severe group. A significantly higher proportion of the moderate–severe group required further care and intervention (p = 0.04). This study is probably one of the rare nonclinical surveys on this subject.",

Median survival time for patients with any form of dementia was 10.5 years from onset and 5.7 years from diagnosis. Similarly, median survival time for probable Alzheimer disease patients was 11.3 years from onset and 5.7 years from diagnosis. Significant trends of decreasing survival with increasing age group (<70; 70-79, > or = 80) were evident for all dementia patients and for patients with Alzheimer disease.

Methods We analyzed data from 536 AD outpatients randomized to the placebo group in two identical 26-week multicenter drug trials. Results Mean deterioration at week 26 on the ADAS-Cog total score for subjects with moderate dementia was 84% greater than that for those with milder severity (p < 0.001). After adjusting for this effect, age (p = 0.015) and educational level (p = 0.01) also predicted cognitive decline. In a model, absolute change for most individual ADAS items was less than 10% of the possible change, and it was generally smaller than one-third of the standard deviation of the measure. Measurement error variability was greatest for word recognition and the \"placebo\" effect was greatest for word recall. Variability increased with trial duration in a model. Conclusions There is a relationship between baseline severity and magnitude of cognitive decline. In 6-month trials, measurement error makes a substantial contribution to the variance in ADAS-Cog change scores. Sensitivity to intervention effects will therefore depend both on the variability and magnitude of change. Such data must be considered when designing future trials to minimize measurement error variability and increase sensitivity for specific populations.",

No significant differences were found between groups on neuropsychological testing. Patients with previous episodes of delirium had worse ADL scores and higher disease-course incidences of hallucinations and paranoid delusions, mostly occurring during the delirious episode. We conclude that delirium is common in AD, but it is an unusual initial symptom and it occurs in diverse clinical settings. Measures of behavioral symptoms and ADLs are more likely to reflect the impact of delirium on clinical status than measures of cognition or stage of dementia.",

    "abstract": "Objective To compare behavioral and cognitive testing in the clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Methods A clinically defined cohort of FTD (n = 52) is compared with 52 Alzheimer disease (AD) patients on a Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI) and cognitive tests (e.g., Mini-Mental State Examination, Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, Western Aphasia Battery, Wechsler Intelligence Scale, Wechsler Memory Scale). Fourteen patients with FTD had autopsy confirmation, and their tests are also compared with the rest of the FTD population. Results The FTD and AD groups were matched in sex, duration, and severity of dementia. The total scores on the FBI showed the largest difference. Mini-Mental State Examination and Mattis Dementia Rating Scale total scores did not discriminate between the two groups. Memory subscores were lower in the AD group, and conceptualization and language-related scores were worse in the FTD group. Milder and earlier affected patients, who could carry on a large battery of neuropsychological tests, were much better distinguished by the FBI scores on discriminant function analysis. In contrast to 78% by the cognitive tests, 98% of the FTD and AD patients were differentiated by the FBI. Conclusions Although memory scores were lower in AD and language scores in the FTD population, many of the cognitive tests do not distinguish between FTD and AD. On the other hand, a behavioral inventory is a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of FTD. Postmortem validation was carried out in a sizeable subset of the population, showing similar behavioral and cognitive data.",

    "abstract": "Apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) has been identified as a major risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD). Previously it has been reported that levels of apoE are reduced in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients. Because it is known that apoE4 affects plasma lipid metabolism, we examined whether the presence of apoE4 might correlate with an altered lipid metabolism in the CSF of control subjects and AD patients. ApoE and lipid concentrations were determined in postmortem ventricular CSF of 30 neuropathologically confirmed AD cases and 31 age-matched control patients. ApoE genotyping was performed on frozen brain tissue of the same patients. In line with other reports, we found an increased APOE*4 allele frequency in the AD group (0.461) when compared with the control group (0.225). ApoE levels in CSF of AD patients were not significantly reduced when compared with the controls (mean +/-SD: 63+/-55 and 82+/-62 microg/dL for AD and controls, respectively). However, in the CSF of AD patients levels of free and esterified cholesterol (0.13+/-0.09 and 0.25+/-0.19 mg/dL, and 0.25+/-0.19 and 0.42+/-0.34, respectively), phospholipids (0.2+/-0.1 and 3.5+/-5.0 mg/dL) and, suprisingly, also fatty acids (4.5+/-3.2 and 28.0+/-18.5 micromol/L) were found to be significantly reduced. After correction for age, sex, postmortem delay, and pH the levels of phospholipids, fatty acids, and free cholesterol were still significantly reduced (p = 0.021, p = 0.026, andp = 0.012, respectively). The apoE and lipid levels in CSF of AD-and control patients appeared not to be affected by the number of APOE*4 alleles. In conclusion, our results suggest an altered lipid homeostasis in the brain of AD patients that is not related to the presence of apoE4. It is, therefore, unlikely that an effect of apoE4 on brain lipid metabolism is the underlying mechanism behind the role of apoE4 in the development of AD.",

The objectives of this report are to present the methodology established in the CASCADE (Choices, Attitudes, and Strategies for Care of Advanced Dementia at the End-of-Life) study, and to describe how challenges specific to this research were met. The CASCADE study is an ongoing, federally funded, 5-year prospective cohort study of nursing [nursing home (NH)] residents with advanced dementia and their health care proxies (HCPs) initiated in February 2003. Subjects were recruited from 15 facilities around Boston. The recruitment and data collection protocols are described. The demographic features, ownership, staffing, and quality of care of participant facilities are presented and compared to NHs nationwide. To date, 189 resident/HCP dyads have been enrolled. Baseline data are presented, demonstrating the success of the protocol in recruiting and repeatedly assessing NH residents with advanced dementia and their HCPs. Factors challenging and enabling implementation of the protocol are described. The CASCADE experience establishes the feasibility of conducting rigorous, multisite dementia NH research, and the described methodology serves as a detailed reference for subsequent CASCADE publications as results from the study emerge.",

We had the opportunity to explore the progression of these regional features by using autopsy brain specimens from 15 cognitively normal and five AD subjects, all Catholic sisters enrolled in the Nun Study, a longitudinal study on aging and AD. Neuropathologic changes were assessed in the temporal cortex, striatum, and cerebellum without knowledge of clinical status. We found diffuse plaques in the striatum in six (40%) and cerebellar plaques in none of the brains from the non-demented subjects. Striatal plaques were present in all five and cerebellar plaques in four of the five AD cases. In the 20 cases overall, the presence of striatal plaques generally paralleled the occurrence of neuritic plaques in neocortex and correlated with lower scores on several neuropsychologic tests assessing memory. Our findings suggest that striatal diffuse plaques occur relatively early in the progression of AD pathology and coincide with neocortical pathology and cognitive changes. Thus, it is unlikely that temporal factors alone account for regional differences in progression of AD neuropathology.",

Examination of cellular changes shows that oxidative stress is an event that precedes the appearance of neurofibrillary tangles, one of the hallmark pathologies of the disease. Although it is still unclear what the initial source of the oxidative stress is in Alzheimer disease, it is likely that the process is highly dependent on the presence of redox-active transition metals, such as iron and copper.

More than 190,000 patients in the United States received tacrine during the first 2 years following marketing approval. The most common tacrine-associatcd adverse events were elevated liver transaminase levels [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and, to a lesser degree, aspartate aminotransferase] and peripheral cholinergic events involving primarily the digestive system (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, anorexia, and weight loss). Based on clinical trial experience, potentially clinically significant (>3 X upper limit of normal) ALT elevations occurred in 25% of patients, requiring routine monitoring early in treatment. The elevations were almost always asymptomatic, rarely accompanied by significant increases in bilirubin, and related to time on drug rather than to dose (90% occurred within the first 12 weeks of treatment). Gastrointestinal events were related to dose and generally of mild to moderate intensity. Tacrine-associated events, including ALT elevations, were reversible. Cholinergic events were manageable with dosage adjustment. Tacrine was not associated with permanent liver injury in clinical trials or a TIND setting.",

Using in situ hybridization with biotin-labeled RNA probes, we found distinctive patterns of APP gene expression in different regions of postmortem human brain. Strong hybridization signal for APP messenger RNA (mRNA) was detected in specific classes of neurons, fascicular oligodendroglia, satellite glia, and presumptive microglia. Weaker signal was seen in other neuronal classes, fascicular astrocytes, and vascular endothelial cells, but no signal was seen in protoplasmic astrocytes. Human thymus also shows a restricted pattern of hybridization with high signal in reticular epithelial cells, and much lower signal in lymphocytes. In AD patients, neuronal hybridization for APP mRNA was specifically increased in hippocampus, but not cerebellar and visual cortex when compared to hybridization for neuron-specific enolase mRNA. Most neurons with neurofibrillary tangles had strong APP mRNA signal. These results suggest that APP gene expression is highly regulated in normal tissue, that many different cell classes in brain express the APP gene, and that neuronal expression may increase specifically in brain regions where widespread injury occurs in AD. Amyloid deposits in brains of AD patients might be explained by local production of precursor protein in endothelial cells, neurons or glia.",

    "abstract": "Summary: The correct interpretation of clinical positron emission tomography (PET) data depends largely on the physical limits of the PET scanner. The partial volume effect (PVE) is related to the size of the studied object compared to the spatial resolution. It represents one of the most important limiting factors in quantitative data analysis. This effect is increased in the case of atrophy, as in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), and it influences measurement of the metabolic reduction generally seen in cerebral degeneration. In this case, interpretation can be biased, because cortical activity will be underestimated due to the atrophy. In general, anatomical images of AD patients have shown diffuse atrophy, while PET studies have found widespread hypometabolism affecting the parietal and temporal lobes. Although hypometabolic areas usually correspond to atrophic regions, they also occur without such changes. Thus, the aim is to differentiate authentic hypometabolism (decrease of glucose consumption per unit volume of gray matter) from that due to PVE from atrophy (cell loss). Consequently, we are using a method for three-dimensional (3D) correction of human PET data with 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We measured atrophy and metabolism by using both Tl-weighted MR images and high and medium resolution PET scans. We injected 12 patients and controls with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose for glucose consumption measurements. Atrophy was estimated in the following way. We isolated the cerebral structures, using a segmentation technique on the MRI scans, into gray matter (GM), white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. We superimposed the PET images onto the MR images to obtain anatomo-functional correlations. We degraded the segmented MR images to the resolution of the PET images by a convolution process to create a PET image correction map. We corrected the metabolic PET data for the PVE. We studied the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose in the GM where metabolic variation is the most relevant to AD. By dealing with problems relating to the sensitivity to the segmentation and to the PET-MRI coregistration, computation of MRI convolution processes provided the degree of PVE on a pixel-by-pixel basis, allowing correction of hypometabolisms contained in GM PET values. Global cortical metabolism increased after correction for PVE by, on average, 29 and 24% for tomographs acquired with medium (TTV03 LETI) and high (ECAT 953B CTI/Siemens) resolution, respectively, whereas the cortical metabolism increased by 75 and 65% for the respective tomographs in AD patients. The difference of metabolism between scans after correction for PVE was less than before correction, decreasing from 31 to 17%. This difference was most marked in the frontal and temporal lobes. Fusion imaging allowed correction for PVE in metabolic data using 3D MRI and determination of whether a change in the apparent radiotracer concentration in PET data reflected an alteration in GM volume, a change in radiotracer concentration per unit volume of GM, or both.",

The proportion of care provided by paid caregivers increased relative to the time spent by informal caregivers.

    "abstract": "Nervous system growth factors potently stimulate cell function and prevent neuronal death. These broad effects on survival and function arise from direct downstream activation of antiapoptotic pathways, inhibition of proapoptotic pathways, and stimulation of functionally important cellular mechanisms including ERK/MAP kinase and CREB. Thus, as a class, growth factors offer the potential to treat neurodegenerative disorders for the first time by preventing neuronal degeneration rather than compensating for cell loss after it has occurred. Different growth factors affect distinct and specific populations of neurons: the first nervous system growth factor identified, nerve growth factor, potentially stimulates the survival and function of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, suggesting that nerve growth factor could be a means for reducing the cholinergic component of cell degeneration in Alzheimer disease. This review will discuss the transition of growth factors from preclinical studies to human clinical trials in Alzheimer disease. The implementation of clinical testing of growth factor therapy for neurologic disease has been constrained by the dual need to achieve adequate concentrations of these proteins in specific brain regions containing degenerating neurons, and preventing growth factor spread to nontargeted regions to avoid adverse effects. Gene therapy is one of a limited number of potential methods for achieving these requirements.",

The most frequent form of MIS was Capgras delusions, often accompanied by reduplication of place, phantom boarder phenomenon, or both. Although MIS typically appears in later stages of the disease, it can also occur surprisingly early in patients with AD. None of the patients with FTD-bv, primary progressive aphasia, corticobasal degeneration/supranuclear palsy, or PD developed MIS.

    "abstract": "This article provides an overview of the theory, clinical application, and research data on behavioral treatment of depression in dementia patients. Behavioral theory of depression in nondemented adults indicates that decreased positive person-environment interactions initiate and maintain a cycle of depression that may be amenable to treatment. This same cycle is discussed as it appears in demented adults, and treatment is suggested. This treatment focuses on altering the aversive events and interactions that maintain patient depression, by increasing pleasant events and interactions, maximizing cognitive abilities, and teaching caregivers strategies for behavior change and effective problem solving. A 9-week clinical research protocol is provided with specific session-by-session content. Preliminary data are presented from a controlled clinical trial of this approach. Results thus far indicate that behavioral treatment is effective in reducing depression in patients with Alzheimer disease and in reducing the level of depression in their caregivers. The implications of these findings on future clinical care of patients and research directions are discussed.",

This study compared the QoL of people with dementia as assessed by the individuals and their care staff, and possible factors associated with the discrepancy between ratings. Seventy-six dyads of people with dementia and care staff in 9 residential homes were recruited. People with dementia were interviewed, using the \"quality of life-Alzheimer disease\" (QoL-AD) and assessed for severity of cognitive impairment. Staff completed the QoL-AD with respect to the person with dementia, and measures assessing their job satisfaction, level of hope, and person-centeredness. Results showed that people with dementia and care staff rated QoL differently. Some items on the QoL-AD (\"physical health,\" \"family,\" and \"friends\") were rated similarly between the 2 groups and others differently (\"ability to do chores,\" \"marriage/closest relationship,\" \"memory,\" and \"life as a whole\"). Neither staff factors (hope, person-centeredness, or job satisfaction) nor the severity of cognitive impairment in the people with dementia explained the discrepancy between ratings. However, when data were aggregated within residential settings, a correlation between increased hope in staff and better resident assessed QoL emerged. Care homes should be aware that low staff hope may be linked to lower resident QoL. Effective training and support for care staff may impact on residents' QoL.",

The objective of this study is to examine patterns of cerebral perfusion in anmestic (N=12) and nonamnestic (N=12) single-domain MCI patients from 4 a priori regions of interest: middle and superior frontal cortex, posterior cingulate, and precuneus, to compare them relative to healthy controls (N=12), and to correlate perfusion with neuropsychologic measures. Relative to controls, all MCI patients had hypoperfusion in the posterior cingulate, bilaterally. MCI patients with executive dysfunctions also showed hypoperfusion in bilateral middle frontal cortex and the left precuneus relative to controls and in the left middle frontal cortex, left posterior cingulate, and left precuneus relative to amnestic MCI patients. Perfusion in the posterior cingulate correlated positively with memory performance whereas perfusion in all 4 a priori regions of interest, predominately on the left side, correlated with executive function performance. The finding that single-domain MCI patients with prominent deficits in different cognitive domains exhibited different patterns of hypoperfusion relative to controls supports the existence of distinct subgroups of MCI. These data further suggest that cognitive impairment in MCI is related to cerebral hypoperfusion.",

In clinical trials, memantine has consistently demonstrated a reduced rate of deterioration on global, cognitive, functional, and behavioral measures, across a range of outcome measures compared with usual care. Notably, improvements versus placebo were seen in individual activities of daily living and behavior, particularly agitation. Efficacy was demonstrated in patients with newly diagnosed Alzheimer disease, patients previously or currently receiving acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and both institutionalized and community-dwelling Alzheimer disease patients. Memantine has a tolerability profile similar to placebo. This review presents the results of key clinical trials, and includes clinically relevant analyses, such as numbers-needed-to-treat and effect sizes. Increased dependency and institutionalization are significant cost drivers in Alzheimer disease. Memantine is able to reduce dependency, caregiver time required, and mean monthly caregiver and societal costs. Recent studies of the relationship between Alzheimer disease progression, caregiver burden, and healthcare costs emphasize the need for treatments such as memantine that can slow the rate of decline in Alzheimer disease.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosis of probable Alzheimer disease (AD) is made by a combination of characteristic clinical findings, when normal laboratory studies reveal no structural or metabolic cause of the dementia. Definite diagnosis of AD, however, can only be made with brain tissue examination. PET scanning reveals parietotemporal decreases in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and glucose metabolism that differentiate AD from normal elderly and from multi-infarct dementia. Preliminary studies suggest that similar defects in CBF are detectable in single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in AD. Utilizing the iodinated ligand [123I] HIPDM ([123I] hydroxyiodobenzylpropanediamine), we studied 19 patients with probable AD of varying severity, with emphasis on mild cases, to assess the utility of SPECT as a diagnostic test in AD. Parietotemporal perfusion on SPECT was decreased unilaterally or bilaterally in 16 of 19 AD patients, similar to the defects reported with PET. The degree and extent of decreased CBF on SPECT correlated with AD severity. Strong correlations were obtained between decreases in computer-generated ratios of parietal to cerebellar activity and the level of cognitive function. SPECT was read as normal (on the radiographic film) by the nuclear medicine physician in all cases with Mini-Mental State (MMS) score > 24, and showed bilateral parietal perfusion deficits in only 1 of 4 patients with MMS between 22 and 24. Ten of 12 patients with MMS ≤21 had bilateral parietal abnormalities; the other 2 had unilateral perfusion defects. All patients with MMS < 15 were bilaterally abnormal. SPECT is less expensive and more widely available than PET, and may have an adjunctive role in diagnosis of AD and other dementias if utilized under the proper circumstances.",

In a large, simple design, regular assessments must be very low cost, for example, handled by mail. The Mail-In Cognitive Function Screening Instrument (MCFSI) was developed for the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Prevention Instrument Project to evaluate whether a brief mail-in screening tool can be used as a specific and sensitive trigger for a diagnostic evaluation in the course of a prevention trial. The MCFSI consists of 2 similar sets of 14 questions mailed separately to the subject and the study partner, who are asked to complete them independently. The questions are derived from a standard clinical assessment of dementia; they ask about decline in function over the last year. We are currently evaluating the utility of the instrument in 640 subjects over the course of the “simulated” AD prevention trial. Analysis of baseline data showed significant differences in mean MCFSI scores between sex and ethnic groups (for subjects), age groups (for partners), and Clinical Dementia Rating global score groups (both subject and partner). In this nondemented population, both subject's and partner's MCFSI responses were related to cognitive performance. There was no significant association between MCFSI score for either subjects or partners and apolipoprotein E genotype. The MCFSI captures information related to cognitive and functional status in nondemented elderly individuals; the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Prevention Instrument Project will determine whether this brief, mail-in questionnaire is useful as a trigger for diagnostic evaluation in an AD primary prevention trial.",

We compared 88 na-MCI cases and 241 a-MCI cases with 1640 cognitively normal participants. MetS was not associated with either na-MCI or a-MCI. High C-reactive protein (CRP; highest tertile vs lowest tertile) was associated with na-MCI [odds ratio (OR)=1.85; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.05, 3.24] but not with a-MCI, after adjusting for sex, age, and years of education.

The Communication score was the least impaired next to Self-Care for FTD and AD, and the most impaired for PPA patients.

Measures included a brief nursing assessment and laboratory evaluations including complete blood count, blood chemistry (Chem 7), and thyroid function tests of serum samples and culture and sensitivity tests of urine samples. Undiagnosed illness was identified according to currently published criteria. Neuropsychiatric behaviors were assessed using 21 behaviors derived from standard measures. Thirty-six percent (N=96) of patients had clinical findings indicative of undetected illness. Conditions most prevalent were bacteriuria (15%), followed by hyperglycemia (6%) and anemia (5%). The behavior most often demonstrated among those with detected illness was resisting or refusing care (66% vs. 47% for those without detected illness). Individuals with detected illness had significantly lower functional status scores [3.8 vs. 4.4, t(275)=7.01, P=0.01], lower cognitive status scores [10.5 vs. 14.4, t(275)=12.1, P<0.01], and were more likely to be prescribed psychotropic medications for behavior (41% vs. 26%, χ2=3.67, P<0.05) than those without illness. Findings suggest that challenges of diagnosing acute illness with atypical presentation must be addressed to promote quality of care and the specialized needs for this vulnerable population.",

Memory for recent events is relatively preserved although memory scores obtained in verbally mediated tests may be abnormal.

This selective clinical pattern is most conspicuous in the initial stages of the disease. Progressive nonfluent aphasia and some types of semantic dementia can be considered subtypes of PPA.

    "abstract": "We performed semistructured interviews with 30 family members of patients with advanced dementia to identify the factors that facilitate or hinder advance planning by persons with dementia. All interviews were analyzed using qualitative data analysis techniques. The majority (77%) of family members reported that their relative had some form of written advance directive, and at least half reported previous discussions about health care preferences (57%), living situation or placement issues (50%), and finances or estate planning (60%) with the patient. Family members reported some themes that prompted planning and others that were barriers to planning. Events that most often triggered planning were medical, living situation, or financial issues associated with a friend or family member of the patient (57%). Barriers to planning included both passive and active avoidance. The most common form of passive avoidance was not realizing the importance of planning until it was too late to have the discussion (63%). The most common form of active avoidance was avoiding the discussion (53%). These data suggest potentially remediable strategies to address barriers to advance planning discussions.",

    "abstract": "There is an increasing racial and ethnic diversity within the elderly population of the United States. Although increased diversity offers unique opportunities to study novel influences on aging and dementia, some aspects of racial and ethnic research have been hampered by the lack of culturally and linguistically consistent testing protocols. Structural brain imaging is commonly used to study the biology of normal aging and cognitive impairment and may therefore serve to explore potential biologic differences of cognitive impairment among racially and ethnically diverse individuals. To test this hypothesis, we recruited a cohort of approximately 400 African American, white, and Hispanic subjects with various degrees of cognitive ability. Each subject was carefully evaluated using standardized diagnostic protocols that included clinical review of brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) to arrive at a clinical diagnosis of normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Each MRI was then independently quantified for measures of brain, white matter hyperintensities, and hippocampal volumes by a technician blind to subject age, sex, ethnicity, race, and diagnostic category. The appearance of infarction on MRI was also rated by examining neurologists. Regression analyses were used to assess associations with various MRI measures across clinical diagnostic categories in relation to racial and ethnic differences. Hispanic subjects were, on average, significantly younger and had less years of education than African Americans or whites. Whites with dementia were significantly older than both African American and Hispanic dementia patients. Highly significant differences in MRI measures were associated with clinical diagnoses for the group as a whole after adjusting for the effects of age, sex, education, race, and ethnicity. Subsequent independent analyses by racial and ethnic status revealed consistent relationships between diagnostic category and MRI measures. Clinical diagnoses were associated with consistent differences in brain structure among a group of racially and ethnically diverse individuals. We believe these results help to validate current diagnostic assessment of individuals across a broad range of racial, ethnic, linguistic, and educational backgrounds. Moreover, interesting and potentially biologically relevant differences were found that might stimulate further research related to the understanding of dementia etiology within an increasingly racially and ethnically diverse population.",

Eight hundred seventy-six older participants without dementia underwent baseline and annual motor testing for up to 10 years. In a generalized estimating equation controlling for age, sex, and education, motor function declined by about 0.03 U/y. The presence of ε4 allele was associated with a 2-fold increase in rate of motor decline [ε4 allele×time: estimate=−0.027 (SE 0.012, P=0.025)]. The association of ε4 allele with motor decline persisted even after controlling for cognitive status, race, body mass index, vascular risk factors, and diseases. Further analyses suggested that the association of ε4 with motor decline was for the most part explained by the association between ε4 allele and change in muscle strength. These results suggest that the presence of ε4 allele is a risk factor for more rapid motor decline in the elderly.",

Methodological quality and level of certainty were assessed.Ten studies were identified as relevant for the purpose of this review, describing a total of 39 predictive factors. Three factors (behavioral problems and impairments regarding daily functioning and cognition) were considered to be predictors of objective burden. Three factors were not related; 12 were potential predictors; and the results of the remaining 22 factors were inconclusive.Many factors were found to be (potential) predictors of objective burden, reflecting its complex nature. Objective and subjective burdens are 2 different relevant aspects of informal care. Interventions aimed at countering behavioral problems and impairments regarding daily functioning could reduce objective burden.",

    "abstract": "If smoking is a risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD) but a smoker dies of another cause before developing or manifesting AD, smoking-related mortality may mask the relationship between smoking and AD. This phenomenon, referred to as competing risk, complicates efforts to model the effect of smoking on AD. Typical survival regression models assume that censorship from analysis is unrelated to an individual's probability for developing AD (ie, censoring is noninformative). However, if individuals who die before developing AD are younger than those who survive long enough to develop AD, and if they include a higher percentage of smokers than nonsmokers, the incidence of AD will appear to be higher in older individuals and in nonsmokers. Further, age-specific mortality rates are higher in smokers because they die earlier than nonsmokers. Therefore, if we fail to take into account the competing risk of death when we estimate the effect of smoking on AD, we bias the results and are in fact only comparing the incidence of AD in nonsmokers with that in the healthiest smokers. In this study, we demonstrate that the effect of smoking on AD differs in models that are and are not adjusted for competing risks.",

To date, anticipatory grief has been examined in family caregivers to individuals who have had Alzheimer disease (AD) an average of 3 to 6 years. Whether such grief is manifested early in the disease trajectory (at diagnosis) is unknown. Using a cross-sectional design, we examined differences in the nature and extent of anticipatory grief between family caregivers of persons with a new diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n=43) or AD (n=30). We also determined whether anticipatory grief levels were associated with caregiver demographics, caregiving burden, depressive symptoms, and marital quality. The mean anticipatory grief levels were high in the total sample, with AD caregivers endorsing significantly more anticipatory grief than MCI caregivers. In general, AD caregivers endorsed difficulty in functioning, whereas MCI caregivers focused on themes of \"missing the person\" they once knew. Being a female caregiver, reporting higher levels of objective caregiving burden, and higher depression levels each had independent, statistically significant relationships with anticipatory grief. Given these findings, family caregivers of individuals with mild cognitive deficits or a new AD diagnosis may benefit from interventions specifically addressing anticipatory grief.",

Awareness was assessed in relation to memory, everyday activities, and socio-emotional functioning using discrepancies between PwD and carer ratings on parallel questionnaires. PwD completed neuropsychological tests and measures of mood and quality of life. Carers completed measures of mood and stress. At initial assessment, discrepancies were greatest for activities of daily living, moderate for memory, and least pronounced for socio-emotional functioning. Discrepancy scores did not change over time. PwD self-ratings indicated perceived poorer functioning in everyday activities over time, but no change for memory and socio-emotional functioning. Carer ratings indicated perceived decline in everyday activities and socio-emotional functioning, but no change for memory. PwD declined in neuropsychological functioning, but self-ratings of depression, anxiety, and quality of life remained stable over time. Carer mood and stress levels also remained stable.

In this study, we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate whether the presence of apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele and degree of memory impairment were associated with the dysfunction of these brain regions. Seventy-five elderly subjects ranging from cognitively normal to mild AD, divided into ε4 carriers and noncarriers, underwent fMRI during a memory-encoding task. Across all subjects, posteromedial and ventral anterior cingulate cortices (key components of the default network) as well as right middle and inferior prefrontal regions demonstrated reduced task-induced deactivation in the ε4 carriers relative to noncarriers. Even among cognitively normal subjects, ε4 carriers demonstrated reduced posteromedial deactivation compared with the noncarriers in the same regions which demonstrated failure of deactivation in AD patients. Greater failure of posteromedial deactivation was related to worse memory performance (delayed recall) across all subjects and within the range of cognitively normal subjects. In summary, the posteromedial cortical fMRI response pattern is modulated both by the presence of APOE ε4 and episodic memory capability. Altered fMRI activity of the posteromedial areas of the brain default network may be an early indicator of risk for AD.",

The difference was very important in the patients with moderated apathy. However, differences were not so important in the patients with severe apathy and there were no differences at all in the non-apathetic patients. No significant differences were found with the NPI-Q scale, although there was a clear improvement trend in the \"apathy\" question on this scale. This effect seems to extend beyond the therapeutic intervention period.A structured, nonpharmacological, short-term occupational therapy intervention is more useful than activities of the patients' own choice for improving apathy in patients with mild or moderate dementia.",

Methods Balance and gait impairments were assessed in 380 AD patients using the Tinetti test. Results A total of 120 (31.5%) patients had an abnormal Tinetti test, 96 (25.2%) had balance impairments, and 72 (18.9%) patients presented gait impairments. Global Tinetti score was associated with age [odds ratio (OR), 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.05-1.14], Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90-0.99), activities of daily living (ADL) score (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.47-0.83), and being man (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.25-0.78). Balance impairment was associated with age (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.05-1.17), ADL score (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43-0.84), and being female (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.08-0.49). Gait impairment was associated with age (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.15), MMSE score (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87-0.98), ADL score (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46-0.87), body mass index (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01-1.18), presence of comorbidities (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.14-3.96), and the Cornell score (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.12-7.89). Conclusions AD patients are frequently concerned with balance and gait impairments. These impairments were associated to factors related to the severity of the disease (low MMSE and low ADL); nonmodifiable factors such as age or sex; and modifiable factors such as depression, obesity, and presence of comorbidities.",

    "abstract": "Dementia is generally considered as rapidly progressive [rapidly progressive dementia (RPD)], in cases with overt cognitive impairment, established within months. Data about the relative frequency of underlying diseases in cases of RPD are few and extremely variable, depending on the clinical setting. We examined the relative frequency of the underlying causes of RPD, in a university tertiary referral center, in Athens. A series of consecutive patients presenting with RPD in a 3-year period was included. All patients received a comprehensive clinical, imaging, and laboratory evaluation. Of a total of 279 patients hospitalized for dementia diagnosis, 68 patients had RPD (37 males and 31 females). Mean age at onset ±SD was 65.5±10.0. The most common cause of RPD was secondary dementias, accounting for 18 cases (26.5%). Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal dementia were almost equally represented, accounting for 12 (17.6%) and 11 (16.2%) cases, respectively. Vascular dementia, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and various neurodegenerative diseases accounted for 9 cases each (13.2%). In a tertiary referral center, secondary dementias represented the most frequent cause of cases presenting with RPD. As a substantial number of these cases are potentially treatable, our finding reconfirms and underscores the importance of an exhaustive evaluation in any case presenting with RPD.",

We identified 4 different proteomic signatures, each using 5 to 14 analytes, that differentiate AD from control patients with sensitivity and specificity ranging from 74% to 85%. Five analytes were common to all 4 signatures: apolipoprotein A-II, apolipoprotein E, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, α-1-microglobulin, and brain natriuretic peptide. None of the signatures adequately predicted progression from MCI to AD over a 12- and 24-month period. A new panel of analytes, optimized to predict MCI to AD conversion, was able to provide 55% to 60% predictive accuracy. These data suggest that a simple panel of plasma analytes may provide an adjunctive tool to differentiate AD from controls, may provide mechanistic insights to the etiology of AD, but cannot adequately predict MCI to AD conversion.",

Twenty-two patient-caregiver dyads were enrolled: 13 bvFTD and 9 SD. Data were collected on behavior and movement. Patients and caregivers wore Actiwatches for 2 weeks to record activity. We predicted that bvFTD patients would show greater caregiver report of apathy and less daytime activity compared with patients diagnosed with SD. Patients with bvFTD spent 25% of their day immobile, whereas patients with SD spent 16% of their day inactive. BvFTD caregivers spent 11% of their day immobile and SD caregivers were immobile 9% of their day. Apathy was present in all of the patients with bvFTD and in all but one patient with SD; the severity of apathy was greater in bvFTD compared with SD. Apathy correlated with caregiver emotional distress in both groups. In conclusion, apathy has been defined as a condition of diminished motivation that is difficult to operationalize. Among patients with frontotemporal dementia, apathy was associated with lower levels of activity, greater number of bouts of immobility, and longer immobility bout duration. Apathy and diminished daytime activity appeared to have an impact on the caregiver. Objective measures of behavioral output may help in formulation of a more precise definition of apathy.",

We examined the factor structure of the battery across levels of cognition [normal, mild cognitive impairment, dementia] based on Clinical Dementia Rating scores to determine cognitive domains tapped by the battery. Using data pooled from 29 Alzheimer's Disease Centers funded by National Institute on Aging, exploratory factor analysis was used to derive a general model using half of the sample; 4 factors representing memory, attention, executive function, and language were identified. Confirmatory factor analysis was used on the second half of the sample to evaluate invariance between groups and within groups over 1 year. Factorial invariance testing included systematic addition of constraints and comparisons of nested models. The general confirmatory factor analysis model had a good fit. As constraints were added, model fit deteriorated slightly. Comparisons within groups showed stability over 1 year. In a range of cognition from normal to dementia, factor structures and factor loadings will vary little. Further work is needed to determine whether domains become more or less distinct in severely cognitively compromised individuals.",

Using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data set, properties of the 11-item ADAS-cog (ADAS.11), the 13-item ADAS-cog (ADAS.All) and novel composite scores were compared, using weighting schemes derived from the Random Forests (RF) tree-based multivariate model. Weighting subscores using the RF model of ADAS.All enhanced discrimination between elderly controls, MCI and AD patients. The ability of the RF-weighted ADAS-cog composite and individual scores, along with neuroimaging or biochemical biomarkers to predict MCI to AD conversion over 12 months was also assessed. Although originally optimized to discriminate across diagnostic categories, the ADAS. All, weighted according to the RF model, did nearly as well or better than individual or composite baseline neuroimaging or CSF biomarkers in prediction of 12-month conversion from MCI to AD. These suggest that a modified subscore weighting scheme applied to the 13-item ADAS-cog is comparable to imaging or CSF markers in prediction of conversion from MCI to AD at 12 months.",

Measures of affect, caregiver mood, stress, distress, and caregiver burden were assessed at baseline, end of sessions, and 1 month after completion. Twenty-four caregivers (12 intervention and 12 attention control) participated. At the end of the intervention, scores on positive affect, negative affect, burden, and stress all improved in the intervention compared with the control group. These scores continued to show improvement at the assessment done 1 month after intervention. Subjects were receptive to the skills and the delivery methods. The positive emotion skill-building intervention proved feasible especially in the internet videoconference delivery format.

Little is known about the optimal approach to measure SCCs. We used item response theory (IRT) to examine the characteristics of 24 SCC items in a sample of 3495 older adults pooled from 4 community-based studies. We investigated the potential advantages of IRT scoring over conventional scoring on the basis of participants' item response patterns. Items most likely endorsed by individuals low in SCC severity relate to word retrieval and general subjective memory decline. Items likely endorsed only by individuals high in SCC severity relate to nonepisodic memory changes, such as decline in comprehension, judgment and executive functions, praxis and procedural memory, and social behavior changes. Above and beyond conventional total score, IRT scoring of SCCs was associated with performance on objective cognitive tests, and was associated with cognitive test performance among participants endorsing only 1 SCC item. Thus, IRT scoring captures additional information beyond a simple sum of SCC symptoms. Modern psychometric approaches including IRT may be useful in developing: (1) brief community screening questionnaires; and (2) more sensitive measures of very subtle subjective decline for use in prodromal Alzheimer disease research.",

Eighty-one AD patients were enrolled in this prospective study. (99m)Tc-HMPAO single photon emission computed tomography was performed to evaluate regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). According to the Neuropsychiatric Inventory subscores of apathy and depression, 9 patients were classified as clinically significant (cs) depressed and non-cs-apathetic (D+) groups and 9 were classified as cs-apathetic and non-cs-depressed (A+) groups. In addition, 18 patients were classified as age-matched and Mini-Mental State Examination-matched disease control groups (D-, A-). The significance of rCBF differences between groups and the correlation between rCBF and subscores in 81 AD patients were estimated by SPM (uncorrected P < 0.005) analysis. D+ patients had significantly lower perfusion in the right orbitofrontal and inferior frontal gyri than D- patients, whereas A+ patients had this in the right amygdala, temporal, posterior cingulate, right superior frontal, postcentral, and left superior temporal gyri than A- patients. The negatively correlated areas with depression subscores included the left inferior frontal and the right middle frontal gyri and those with apathy subscores included the right temporal and right medial frontal gyri.

To test the effectiveness of the FN, 110 of 147 Latino CGs, who were randomly assigned to the Fotonovela Condition (FNC) or the Usual Information Condition (UIC), were included in the final analyses. Self-report measures were given at baseline and post intervention. Results showed that FNC CGs demonstrated significantly greater reductions in level of depressive symptoms than UIC CGs. A significant decrease in level of stress due to memory and behavioral problems exhibited by their loved ones was similar in both groups. The FNC CGs reported that the FN was more helpful and that they referred to it more often than the UIC CGs did with regard to the informational materials they were provided about dementia. In conclusion, a culturally tailored FN can be an effective tool for Latino CGs given their high unmet needs for assistance and various barriers in accessing resources.",

In this commentary, I first suggest that the decline in the incidence or prevalence of dementia is not explained completely by the factors considered so far, and that a broader historical perspective may be needed. Second, I suggest that the overall declining trend may conceal trends in opposite directions for the two major subtypes of dementia, the neurovascular and the neurodegenerative type. Third, I suggest some areas of future research to further elucidate the trends. The future of dementia remains somewhat unclear. Even if the incidence continues to decline, the prevalence may remain the same or increase if survival of persons affected by dementia increases. In addition, even if the prevalence declines, the total number of persons affected by dementia may remain the same or increase if the size of the elderly population expands. Finally, we cannot be sure that the decline in incidence will continue in the coming decades. With cautious optimism, we may conclude that the burden of dementia may be modified over time by human practices, including public health and medicine.",

    "abstract": "Most measures of cognitive function used in large-scale surveys of older adults have limited ability to detect subtle differences across cognitive domains, and standard clinical instruments are impractical to administer in general surveys. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) can address this need, but has limitations in a survey context. Therefore, we developed a survey adaptation of the MoCA, called the MoCA-SA, and describe its psychometric properties in a large national survey. Using a pretest sample of older adults (n=120), we reduced MoCA administration time by 26%, developed a model to accurately estimate full MoCA scores from the MoCA-SA, and tested the model in an independent clinical sample (n=93). The validated 18-item MoCA-SA was then administered to community-dwelling adults aged 62 to 91 as part of the National Social life Health and Aging Project Wave 2 sample (n=3196). In National Social life Health and Aging Project Wave 2, the MoCA-SA had good internal reliability (Cronbach α=0.76). Using item-response models, survey-adapted items captured a broad range of cognitive abilities and functioned similarly across sex, education, and ethnic groups. Results demonstrate that the MoCA-SA can be administered reliably in a survey setting while preserving sensitivity to a broad range of cognitive abilities and similar performance across demographic subgroups.",

    "abstract": "Background: Flortaucipir (tau) positron emission tomography (PET) binding distinguishes individuals with clinically well-established posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) due to Alzheimer disease (AD) from cognitively normal (CN) controls. However, it is not known whether tau-PET binding patterns differentiate individuals with PCA from those with amnestic AD, particularly early in the symptomatic stages of disease. Methods: Flortaucipir and florbetapir (β-amyloid) PET imaging were performed in individuals with early-stage PCA (N=5), amnestic AD dementia (N=22), and CN controls (N=47). Average tau and β-amyloid deposition were quantified using standard uptake value ratios and compared at a voxelwise level, controlling for age. Results: PCA patients [median age-at-onset, 59 (51 to 61) years] were younger at symptom onset than similarly staged individuals with amnestic AD [75 (60 to 85) years] or CN controls [73 (61 to 90) years; P =0.002]. Flortaucipir uptake was higher in individuals with early-stage symptomatic PCA versus those with early-stage amnestic AD or CN controls, and greatest in posterior regions. Regional elevations in florbetapir were observed in areas of greatest tau deposition in PCA patients. Conclusions and Relevance: Flortaucipir uptake distinguished individuals with PCA and amnestic AD dementia early in the symptomatic course. The posterior brain regions appear to be uniquely vulnerable to tau deposition in PCA, aligning with clinical deficits that define this disease subtype.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that these deficits are specifically linked to autonoetic consciousness impairment, whereas noetic consciousness remains preserved in AD. This study focused on the self-reference effect and examined emotional valence, as it has been shown that emotional content can enhance memory in AD. A task involving recognition of emotional versus neutral adjective traits after self-reference versus semantic encoding, and using the Remember/Know/Guess paradigm was administered to 22 AD patients and 18 normal controls. Results for AD patients show that self-reference increased autonoetic consciousness only for emotional and particularly negative trait adjectives. This interesting result indicates that neutral valence does not allow properties of the self to emerge in AD patients because of the progressive loss of the sense of self-linked to the disease, whereas emotional valence does.",

General linear, longitudinal mixed-effects, and Cox proportional hazards models were used. Greater homocysteine level and white matter hyperintensity volume were associated with processing speed impairment (homocysteine: P=0.02; white matter hyperintensity: P<0.0001); greater Vascular Index score was associated with memory impairment (P=0.007); and greater number of apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4) alleles was associated with global cognitive impairment (P=0.007) at baseline.

    "abstract": "Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and semantic dementia have been associated with striatal degeneration, but few studies have delineated striatal subregion volumes in vivo or related them to the clinical phenotype. We traced caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens on magnetic resonance images to quantify volumes of these structures in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, semantic dementia, Alzheimer disease, and healthy controls (n=12 per group). We further related these striatal volumes to clinical deficits and neuropathologic findings in a subset of patients. Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and semantic dementia showed significant overall striatal atrophy compared with controls. Moreover, behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia showed panstriatal degeneration, whereas semantic dementia featured a more focal pattern involving putamen and accumbens. Right-sided striatal atrophy, especially in the putamen, correlated with the overall behavioral symptom severity and with specific behavioral domains. At autopsy, patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and semantic dementia showed striking and severe tau or TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa pathology, especially in ventral parts of the striatum. These results demonstrate that ventral striatum degeneration is a prominent shared feature in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and semantic dementia and may contribute to the social-emotional deficits common to both disorders.",

Methods: This secondary analysis used a combined quantitative and qualitative approach. Regression analyses examined the contribution of patient and FCG characteristics to FCG anxiety. Interviews with FCGs explored the experiences and responses of FCGs during hospitalization of their family member with dementia. Results: Lower patient physical function and higher caregiver strain were associated with higher FCG anxiety. FCGs described the following themes related to the hospitalization: (1) added strain, (2) care-related worries, (3) keeping vigil, (4) need to be heard, and (5) enablers of FCGs. Conclusions: Routine evaluation of caregiver strain and baseline patient function is integral to informing the transitional planning for persons with dementia. The FCG responses suggest that a multifactorial approach (family-centered policies of partnership in care, staff education addressing the specialized needs of patients and family members, and attention to promoting functional recovery) may benefit both hospitalized patients with dementia as well as FCGs and warrants future research.",

    "abstract": "Stress is a potentially remediable risk factor for amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Our objective is to determine whether perceived stress predicts incident aMCI and to determine if the influence of stress on aMCI is independent of known aMCI risk factors, particularly demographic variables, depression, and apolipoprotein genotype. The Einstein Aging Study is a longitudinal community-based study of older adults. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was administered annually in the Einstein Aging Study to participants (N=507; 71 developed incident aMCI; mean follow-up time=3.6 y, SD=2.0) who were aged 70 years and older, free of aMCI and dementia at baseline PSS administration, and had at least 1 subsequent annual follow-up. Cox hazard models were used to examine time to aMCI onset adjusting for covariates. High levels of perceived stress are associated with a 30% greater risk of incident aMCI (per 5-point increase in PSS: hazard ratio=1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.58) independent of covariates. The consistency of results after covariate adjustment and the lack of evidence for reverse causation in longitudinal analyses suggest that these findings are robust. Understanding of the effect of perceived stress on cognition may lead to intervention strategies that prevent the onset of aMCI and Alzheimer dementia.",

Prior research on dementia among Asian Americans focused on Japanese Americans or Asian Americans overall, although marked differences in cardiometabolic conditions between subgroups have been documented.We compared dementia incidence among 4 Asian American subgroups (n=8384 Chinese; n=4478 Japanese; n=6210 Filipino; n=197 South Asian) and whites (n=206,490) who were Kaiser Permanente Northern California members aged 64 years and above with no dementia diagnoses as of January 1, 2000. Dementia diagnoses were collected from medical records January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2013. Baseline medical utilization and comorbidities (diabetes, depression, hypertension, stroke, cardiovascular disease) were abstracted from medical records January 1, 1996 to December 31, 1999. We calculated age-standardized dementia incidence rates and Cox models adjusted for age, sex, medical utilization, and comorbidities.Mean baseline age was 71.7 years; mean follow-up was 9.6 years. Age-standardized dementia incidence rates were higher among whites than \"All Asian-Americans\" or any subgroup. Compared with Chinese (13.7/1000 person-years), dementia incidence was slightly higher among Japanese [14.8/1000 person-years; covariate-adjusted hazard ratio (adjusted-HR)=1.08; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.99-1.18] and Filipinos (17.3/1000 person-years; adjusted-HR=1.20; 95% CI, 1.11-1.31), and lower among South Asians (12.1/1000 person-years; adjusted-HR=0.81; 95% CI, 0.53-1.25).Future studies are needed to understand how immigration history, social, environmental, and genetic factors contribute to dementia risk in the growing and diverse Asian American population.",

In summary, we found no relationship of diabetes or A1C with global or regional AD pathology, including in the mesial temporal lobe. Diabetes is associated with gross subcortical infarcts.

To characterize the BP status of each individual, mean, maximum and minimum values, SD, and coefficient of variation were obtained for both systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). Seventy AD patients and 140 controls were enrolled. No meaningful differences were found in prevalence or treatments of various vascular risk factors.

However, methods are needed to identify individuals expected to be amyloid positive for these studies to be feasible and cost-effective. The current study sought to determine whether short-term practice effects on cognitive tests can identify those with notable uptake on amyloid imaging. Twenty-five, nondemented older adults (15 cognitively intact, 10 with mild cognitive impairment) underwent amyloid imaging through F-flutemetamol and 2 cognitive testing sessions across 1 week to determine practice effects on a visual memory test. Results indicated that, whereas F-flutemetamol uptake showed little association with baseline performance on a visual memory test (r=-0.04, P=0.85), it was significantly correlated with practice effects across 1 week on that same memory measure (r=-0.45, P=0.02), with greater uptake being associated with lower practice effects. The odds ratio of notable F-flutemetamol uptake was 5 times higher in individuals with low practice effects compared with high practice effects. Although these preliminary results need to be replicated in larger samples, short-term practice effects on cognitive tests may provide an affordable screening method to identify individuals who are amyloid positive, which could enrich samples for preventative clinical trials in Alzheimer disease.",

Methods: Data from 2242 individuals, clinically diagnosed with MCI-AD [Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), 0 or 0.5] or with mild ADdem (CDR, 0.5 or 1), were available from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center’s (NACC) Uniform Data Set (UDS).

Results: Thirty-four percent of 944 MCI-AD and 72% of 1298 ADdem participants were ChEI users. Cognitive decline was greater after ChEI initiation in MCI-AD and ADdem groups (eg, MCI-AD, CDR-SB: 0.03 points/y before initiation; 0.61 points/y after initiation, P &lt;0.0001).

On the basis of emerging evidence and newer paradigms and methods, population neuroscience will minimize the bias typical of traditional clinical research, identify the relatively homogenous subgroups that comprise the general population, and investigate broader and denser phenotypes of dementia and cognitive impairment. Long-term follow-up of sufficiently large study cohorts will allow the identification of cohort effects and critical windows of exposure. Molecular epidemiology and omics will allow us to unravel the key distinctions within and among subgroups and better understand individuals’ risk profiles. Interventional epidemiology will allow us to identify the different subgroups that respond to different treatment/prevention strategies. These strategies will inform precision medicine. In addition, insights into interactions between disease biology, personal and environmental factors, and social determinants of health will allow us to measure and track disease in communities and improve population health. By placing neuroscience within a real-world context, population neuroscience can fulfill its potential to serve both precision medicine and population health.",

    "abstract": "Background: Relationships between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), aldosterone, and cognition in aging were evaluated in the population-based Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study (1993 to present). Methods: Beginning in 1998 to 2000, cognitive impairment was assessed by report of physician diagnoses and the Mini-Mental State Examination. In 2009 to 2010 and 2013 to 2016, information was collected on diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment/dementia. Decline in cognitive function was assessed by principal component analysis from additional tests administered during 2009 to 2010 and 2013 to 2016. BDNF, IGF-1, and aldosterone were measured in serum collected in 1998 to 2000. Results: There were 1970 participants (mean age=66.9 y; 59.1% female) without cognitive impairment at baseline. Among women, low BDNF was associated with 16-year incident cognitive impairment [hazard ratio=1.76; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.04, 2.98]. Among men, increasing IGF-1 was associated with decreased risk [per SD: relative risk (RR)=0.57; 95% CI=0.35, 0.92], whereas increasing aldosterone levels were associated with increased risk (per SD: RR=1.28; 95% CI=1.01, 1.62) for 5-year incident mild cognitive impairment/dementia. Overall, low BDNF was associated with increased risk (RR=1.52; 95% CI=1.02, 2.26) for 5-year cognitive decline. Conclusion: Low levels of serum BDNF and IGF-1 were associated with poorer cognition during aging. There may be differential biomarker effects by sex.",

We provide expanded norms for African Americans and whites. Methods: Data from 32 Alzheimer’s Disease Centers (ADCs) and ADC affiliated cohorts with global Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) Dementia Staging Instrument scores of 0 were included. Descriptive statistics for each test were calculated by age, sex, race, and education. Multiple linear regressions were conducted to estimate the effect of each demographic variable; squared semipartial correlation coefficients measured the relative importance of variables. Results: There were 8313 participants (16% African American) with complete demographic information, ranging from 6600 to 7885 depending on the test. Lower scores were found for older and less educated groups, and African Americans versus whites. Education was the strongest predictor for most tests, followed in order by age, race, and sex. Quadratic terms were significant for age and education, indicating some nonlinearity, but did not substantially increase R 2 . Conclusions: Although race-based norms represent incomplete proxies for other sociocultural variables, the appropriate application of these norms is important given the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and to reduce misclassification bias in cognitive disorders of aging such as Alzheimer disease.",

We aimed to address these issues. Methods: We analyzed data from 1283 caregivers of community-dwelling individuals with mild-to-moderate dementia in the Improving the experience of Dementia and Enhancing Active Life cohort study. We generated a “living well” latent factor from measures of quality of life, satisfaction with life, and well-being. We used structural equation modelling to derive latent variables for 7 domains reflecting caregivers’ perceptions of their personal resources and experiences, and to examine the associations with caregivers’ perceptions of their capability to “live well.” Results: The domain of psychological characteristics and psychological health was most strongly related to living well [2.53; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.08-2.97], followed by physical fitness and physical health (1.48; 95% CI, 1.04-1.91) and experiencing caregiving (1.34; 95% CI, 0.99-1.70). Social capitals, assets and resources (0.68; 95% CI, 0.35-1.00) and relationship with the person with dementia (−0.22; 95% CI, −0.41 to −0.03) had smaller, significant associations. Social location (0.28; 95% CI, −0.33 to 0.89) and managing everyday life with dementia (0.06; 95% CI, −0.15 to 0.28) were not significantly associated with living well. Discussion: These findings demonstrate the importance of supporting caregivers’ psychological and physical health and their ability to develop and maintain positive coping strategies, as well as enabling them to maintain vital social capitals, assets and resources.",

Because of the paucity of data on MCI epidemiology in Greece and the variability of worldwide published results, we investigated the prevalence and determinants of MCI in the elderly population in Greece. Methods: As part of the Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (HELIAD), we randomly selected 1960 individuals 65 years and older to undergo full neurological and neuropsychological assessment by a multidisciplinary team. MCI was diagnosed according to the Petersen criteria. Results: The age-standardized and gender-standardized prevalence of MCI in people aged 65 years and older in Greece is 13.11%. The amnestic and multidomain MCI subtypes are more common than their nonamnestic and single-domain counterparts, respectively. Almost two thirds of cases are because of suspected Alzheimer disease. Every additional year of age increases the odds of prevalent MCI by 7.4%, every additional year of education decreases the odds of MCI by 6.3%, and apolipoprotein E ( APOE-ε4 ) carriage increases the odds of MCI by 57.9%. Conclusions: MCI prevalence in the elderly population in Greece is on par with previously reported rates. Prospective studies with robust methodology will enhance our understanding of the dementia continuum.",

The revised version (ECog-II) includes 41 items.To ensure strong psychometric properties, and to facilitate harmonization of previously collected data, we preserved well over half of the items. Future work will validate the revised ECog by measuring associations with neuropsychological performance, external measures of disease, and other functional measures. Overall, the revised ECog will continue to be a useful tool for measuring cognitively relevant everyday abilities in clinical settings and intervention clinical trials.",

Studies that involved cognitively healthy individuals with AD biomarkers undergoing OCT or OCT angiography were included. The risk of bias was assessed using validated tools. A narrative synthesis and meta-analysis were performed with standardized mean differences and I 2 heterogeneity assessments. Results: Seventeen studies comprising 601 participants with positive﻿ AD biomarkers and 881 controls were included. The reviewed studies varied in design, with notable findings indicating a reduction in retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL) thickness, alongside an increase in inner plexiform layer (IPL) thickness. In addition, OCT angiography revealed reduced vascular density and an enlarged foveal avascular zone—however, variations and inconsistencies in results led to inconclusive outcomes for RNFL and GCL-IPL meta-analyses. Conclusion: In summary, cognitively healthy individuals with positive ﻿AD biomarkers demonstrated RNFL, GCL thinning, and IPL thickening trends. Future longitudinal studies using standardized methods are critical to validate these OCT changes as potential early indicators for AD.",

Functional assessment by caregivers consisted of a 25-item bipolar analog scale measuring activities of daily living and social behaviors divided into four functional domains: memory, attention/executive abilities, everyday skills, and self-care. Cognitive assessment consisted of standardized neuropsychological tests designed to evaluate five cognitive domains: episodic memory, attention/executive function, semantic memory, visuospatial function, and auditory–verbal short-term (working) memory. Functional assessment correlated well with overall severity as measured by Mini Mental State Examination (r = −0.733). Analysis of individual cognitive and functional domains revealed no significant correlation between episodic memory and functional performance. By contrast, functional ability correlated strongly with the cognitive domains of visuospatial function and semantic memory, being significantly greater than the correlation of functional ability with any other cognitive domain. These results were supported by multiple regression analyses that showed visuospatial function to be the sole cognitive predictor of functional abilities. These findings have implications for the evaluation of drug therapies in Alzheimer disease, in particular the effect of current cholinergic therapies on activities of daily living.",

Overall, depression (CES-D scores > or = 16) was more common among WH (45%) than among WNH (36%) caregivers (p < 0.05). Elevated CES-D scores among the entire caregiving sample were also linked with being a female spouse (p=0.002), increased level of patient cognitive impairment (p=0.002), and patient psychosis (p=0.002). Risk factors for caregiver depression were identified and compared when the sample was stratified by ethnicity (WH and WNH) and generation (spouses and children). Patient cognitive impairment was a predictor of caregiver depression only among WH spouses and children, whereas patient psychosis was a predictor only among WNH spouses. Female caregiver gender was the most robust risk factor for caregiver depression, being a predictor in all groups except WH children. Implications of this study include the need for increased clinical sensitivity to depression in ethnic minority caregivers, treatment of psychiatric morbidity in dementia caregivers, and respite care for caregivers with high risk for depression.",

    "abstract": "Summary: Several studies have reported that the bulk aluminum (Al) concentration is increased in the brain in Alzheimer disease (AD), while other studies have failed to demonstrate an increase. Most of these investigations have had one or more methodological deficiencies, including lack of adequate neuropathological assessment; failure to age-match the control samples; small sample sizes, lacking statistical power; and geographical heterogeneity in the AD and control populations. The present population-based study of 92 clinically and histopathologically diagnosed AD patients and normal elderly nursing home residents was designed to avoid these potential biases. When a subsample of AD cases with the most severe brain pathology was compared with controls having no or minimal pathology, no statistically significant differences were found in the bulk aluminum concentration measured by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry in frontal cortex (1.8 ± 0.7 vs. 1.7 ± 0.7 μg/g dry wt), temporal cortex (1.4 ± 0.3 vs. 1.5 ± 0.5 μg/g dry wt), liver (2.0 ± 1.3 vs. 2.0 ± 1.2 μg/g dry wt), or head of femur (2.4 ± 1.6 vs. 2.2 ± 1.0 μg/g ash wt). Within the whole series of 92 cases, there was no difference in the bulk aluminum concentration of the frontal cortex between individuals diagnosed as definite, probable, and possible cases of AD using the CERAD (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease) criteria. The density of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in frontal and temporal cortex showed no correlation with the bulk aluminum concentration. Logistic regression analyses, which controlled for age and sex, did not influence outcome for any of the comparisons. The data show conclusively that in AD, bulk aluminum concentration is not increased in two cortical brain regions that are selectively vulnerable to the neuropathological changes associated with this disorder.",

Treatment of hypercholesterolemia and other vascular risk factors may have great implications in the prevention of AD. Recent findings illustrate that the sterol metabolism in the brain is an active process, well controlled and regulated by 24-hydroxylase, an enzyme that is uniquely expressed in the brain. The use of statins in ischemic heart disease (IHD) has proven to be a phenomenal advance in pharmacological disease prevention and treatment. A growing body of evidence, suggest that statins exhibit additional benefits that are independent of their cholesterol-lowering actions. Statin treatment has also considerable effect in prevention of ischemic stroke. In animal models of ischemic stroke, statins have proven to reduce infarct size through up-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthases. Data from recent observational studies have revealed a potential role for statins in prevention of AD. The following review comments the processes leading to dementia including the involvement of cholesterol regulation, cerebral circulation and inflammation in development of dementia. The mechanisms by which statins may be beneficial in controlling these processes is discussed.",

Although this finding has been explained by a decline in patients' capacities to communicate about pain, self-report on pain of cognitively impaired elderly have been shown to be just as reliable as those of cognitively unimpaired elderly. However, previously published studies were aimed primarily at quantifying pain. Considering the various limbic areas affected in AD, a change also in the more qualitative, affective component of pain might be the cause of the low use of analgesics. Because affective disorders are highest in the early and middle stages of AD and decrease in the final stage, it was hypothesized in the present study that not only would the number of AD patients using analgesics would be lower than among a control group but, moreover, analgesic use would be lower in the early and middle stages of AD than in the final stage. The hypothesis was tested by comparing drug use (NSAIDs and analgesic non-NSAIDs) among 66 AD patients with that among 70 elderly people without dementia. The percentage of AD patients using analgesics was indeed significantly lower than among controls, but drug use was not dependent on the stage of AD. Consequently, our findings only partly support the hypothesis.",

Despite the finding that the 10 patients with non-AD neuropathology were ill for less time and were less cognitively impaired at study entry than those patients with definite AD, they had shorter survival times and showed equal behavioral disturbance at study entry (on a standardized measure). The clinical case reports included here suggest early and progressive prominent behavioral disturbance and other indexes of rapid illness progression in three of the four HS patients and two other non-AD patients. We conclude that the criteria of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders Association for possible or probable AD are highly accurate and that misdiagnosis is most likely to occur early in the course of illness and in patients with prominent behavioral disturbance or other atypical features",

    "abstract": "Adults with cognitive impairment are considered a vulnerable population. The conditions associated with cognitive impairment, such as dementia and delirium, cause great suffering to affected patients and their families. Improving clinical care for these conditions depends on research involving cognitively impaired participants. Cognitive impairment is at times associated with partial or full impairment of the capacity to consent to research. This both limits the ability of the individual to consent personally to research participation, and also increases pressure upon Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and investigators to place additional safeguards for the appropriate participation of cognitively impaired individuals in research. While the ethical and legal principles permitting and safeguarding the participation of cognitively impaired persons in research are generally agreed upon, there are no specific methods that operationalize these principles in a language that can be used by IRBs and researchers to guide their day-to-day work in this area. This document contains recommendations that IRBs and investigators can use to operationalize the informed consent process for individuals with cognitive impairment. In situations in which IRBs might not have specific policies in this area, this guideline may also serve as the foundation for such policies. The recommendations discuss when to consider that cognitively impaired participants might be involved in a research project, the use of screening for cognitive impairment, the conduct of assessments evaluating capacity to consent to research, situations in which proxies might consent for research participation in the place of cognitively impaired participants, how to go about identifying appropriate proxies, and how to deal with the loss of consent capacity in the course of a research project.",

We dosed metrifonate to achieve a 40-60% inhibition of red blood cell acetylcholinesterase activity. The Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale score (ADAS-C) served as the primary outcome measure. At the completion of 3 months of treatment, the metrifonate group ADAS-C score differed significantly from the placebo group score by 2.6 points (p < 0.01). A 0.75-point trend toward improvement occurred during treatment in the ADAS cognitive performance of the metrifonate group (p = 0.15), and a 1.10-point deterioration in cognitive performance was found in the placebo group (p < 0.02). On the Global Improvement Scale (GIS), the two groups differed significantly on their changes from baseline to treatment phase (p < 0.02). Significant deterioration occurred in GIS scores (p < 0.01) and in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (p < 0.03) in the placebo-treated group. Adverse effects were uncommon and did not require adjustment of the dose of metrifonate or discontinuation of treatment. We achieved a mean of 52.3% decrease in red blood cell acetylcholinesterase activity. During up to 18 months of subsequent open metrifonate treatment of patients, we found a deterioration of 1.68 points per year in MMSE performance. These findings support further study of the effects of metrifonate on deterioration rate in AD.",

    "abstract": "The distribution of high-affinity nicotine and alpha-bungarotoxin receptors has been compared in a number of human brain areas and related to the available data on receptor subtype mRNA expression. Nicotine binding is high in the thalamus, striatum, and substantia nigra pars compacta, and although not generally high in the hippocampal formation, it is concentrated in the entorhinal cortex, the subicular complex, and the stratum lacunosum moleculare. Nicotine binding is relatively low in the cerebral cortex, but it demonstrates varied patterns of distribution in different areas. Nicotine binding is also present in the cerebellar cortex and dentate nucleus. Nicotine binding in the thalamus corresponds to alpha 3 expression, but at variance to data from rodents, there is little evidence of beta 2 mRNA in this brain area. By contrast, there is beta 2 mRNA but not alpha 3 mRNA in the striatum. In the hippocampal formation both alpha 3 and beta 2 mRNAs are expressed, but the pattern of distribution does not resemble nicotine binding, only reaching moderate levels in the dentate granule cell layer and in the CA3 region. In the neocortex, alpha 4 expression is more widely distributed than alpha 3, but both are associated with pyramidal neurons. The distribution of nicotine binding, concentrated in brain areas gating multimodal inputs and often uncorrelated with cholinergic innervation, suggests a neuromodulatory role, possibly facilitating glutamatergic transmission. The distribution of alpha-bungarotoxin binding is different from that of nicotine in the hippocampal formation, being highest in the CA1 region and the dentate granule cell layer, but similar to nicotine binding in the substantia nigra pars compacta.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We used a variety of standardized instruments to assess mood changes in 33 patients with AD. The frequency of depression ranged from 6 to 30%, depending on the diagnostic criteria employed. No relationship was found between patient depression and dementia severity, self-awareness of cognitive deficits (as measured by a memory self-rating scale), or mood of the caregiver. Delusional patients had higher scores on mood rating scales than nondelusional patients. The results suggest that depression in AD is not severe and is unrelated to patient self-awareness of illness. We hypothesize that the cholinergic deficit of AD may ameliorate depressive symptoms.",

Prior surveys have examined attitudes toward genetic testing for AD in hypothetical scenarios, but it is unclear what reasons would motivate people to seek testing in real-life situations. This study presents data from the first randomized trial to evaluate genetic susceptibility testing for asymptomatic adult children of people with AD. We examined (1) reasons endorsed as motivations for seeking testing, (2) demographic characteristics associated with these reasons, and (3) how these reasons related to the eventual decision to pursue testing. Eligible participants were 206 adult children of people with AD (mean age 53 years; 72% female; 93% white), 77.7% of whom (n = 160) went on to seek testing. Participants endorsed numerous reasons for seeking susceptibility testing (mean 7.2), encompassing a range of motivations. The most commonly endorsed reasons were as follows: (1) to contribute to research (93.9%), (2) to arrange personal affairs (87.4%), and (3) the hope that effective treatment will be developed (86.8%). Women strongly endorsed more reasons for seeking testing than men (p < 0.05). The best predictor of actual pursuit of testing was strong endorsement of the need to prepare family members for AD (odds ratio = 3.3, p < 0.01). Findings suggest that genetic susceptibility testing is of interest to individuals at risk for AD for a variety of reasons, even in the relative absence of available treatments.",

Patients with AD with mild dementia exhibited only increased postural sway associated with a reduced mean value of rCBF in the cortex. At a moderate stage, the reduced mean values of rCBF in the cortex and in the frontal lobe were associated with increased postural sway and stride length variability and with decreased stride length. At a severe stage, reduced rCBF in the basal ganglia and in the frontal lobe additionally were associated with increased postural sway, double support time, and stride length variability, and with decreased walking speed and stride length. In multiple regression analysis, there was a high contribution by rCBF in the frontal lobe to account for postural and gait disturbance in AD. We propose that impaired frontal lobe circulation is an important factor causing postural and gait disturbance as AD progresses.",

The reliability of the center, which provides telemedicine, tele-education, and telecounseling services, was tested by comparing assessment via our system with in-person assessment, and the clinical outcome was assessed by rating the changes of behavioral symptoms. There have been 140 registered patients for 2 years. The general acceptance of our system by the patients and caregivers was good, and the consistency rates between the assessment via our telemedicine system and in-person assessment ranged from 76% to 89%. A considerable proportion of dementia patients in nursing homes (46%) showed relative clinical improvements through our service.

A possible relationship exists between the increased relative crash risk of older drivers and the prevalence of age-related diseases such as dementia. However, a clear-cut policy for evaluating driving competence in demented persons is still lacking. In recognition of this fact, the Swedish National Road Administration invited a group of researchers to formulate a consensus on the issue of driving and dementia. This consensus document is aimed at providing primary care physicians with practical advice concerning the assessment of cognitive status in relation to driving. Suggestions are based on a review of existing research and discuss the use of general and driving-specific sources of information available to the physician. Consensus was reached on the statement that a diagnosis of moderate to severe dementia precludes driving and that certain individuals with mild dementia should be considered for a specialized assessment of their driving competence.",

    "abstract": "Considerable clinical and experimental data have shown that cerebral perfusion is progressively decreased during increased aging and that this decrease in brain blood flow is significantly greater in Alzheimer disease (AD). The authors propose that advanced aging with a comorbid condition, such as a vascular risk factor, which further decreases cerebral perfusion, promotes a critically attained threshold of cerebral hypoperfusion (CATCH). With time, CATCH induces brain capillary degeneration and suboptimal delivery of energy substrates to neuronal tissue. Because glucose is the main fuel of brain cells, its impaired delivery, with the deficient delivery of oxygen, compromises neuronal stability because the supply for aerobic glycolysis fails to meet brain tissue demand. The outcome of CATCH is a metabolic cascade that involves, among other things, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, decreased adenosine triphosphate production, abnormal protein synthesis, cell ionic pump deficiency, signal transduction defects, and neurotransmission failure. These events contribute to the progressive cognitive decline characteristic of patients with AD, as well as regional anatomic pathology, consisting of synaptic loss, senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, tissue atrophy, and neurodegeneration. CATCH identifies the clinical heterogeneic pattern that characterizes AD because it provides compelling evidence that any of a multitude of different etiopathophysiologic vascular risk factors, in the presence of advanced aging, can lead to AD. The evidence in support of CATCH as the pathogenic trigger of AD is crystallized in this review.",

The purpose of this study was to (1) review the Alzheimer disease caregiving literature and identify communication strategies commonly recommended for family caregivers and (2) determine how often caregivers report using these strategies and how effective they feel each is in facilitating communication. A review of the literature identified 10 recurring communication strategies. A questionnaire was constructed that asked caregivers to report on the use and efficacy of these 10 strategies. Twenty family (spouse) caregivers of persons diagnosed with Alzheimer disease completed the questionnaire. The results show that caregivers perceived using the 10 strategies, although the strategies appearing most frequently in the literature were not necessarily the ones used most often by caregivers. A positive correlation was observed between caregivers' perceived use of strategies and their effectiveness. Use and efficacy of a strategy did not significantly vary as a function of dementia severity or the gender of the caregiver. The findings provide evidence that caregivers are aware of their communication behavior and modify it in ways that they think improve communication with their spouse.",

    "abstract": "Summary: We reviewed clinical case series published over a 10-year period addressing the cross-sectional frequency, incidence, and diagnostic and prognostic significance of extrapyramidal signs (EPS) in Alzheimer disease (AD). The review was prompted by recent reports of Lewy body (LB) pathology in the brains of many AD patients and the association of LB pathology with clinical parkinsonism in AD. In the clinical case series reviewed, we evaluated several possible determinants of prevalent EPS, including neuroleptic use, EPS assessment technique, and dementia severity. Neuroleptics were a well recognized cause of parkinsonism in these reports, though some failed to document the frequency of neuroleptic use. Assessment methods were also important: Studies using structured clinical research scales to rate EPS reported higher frequencies than studies employing routine neurological examination. The relationship between parkinsonism and dementia severity was complex. Some studies found bradykinesia, facial masking, and parkinsonian postural changes even in mildly demented, neuroleptic-naive AD patients. Rigidity, on the other hand, became increasingly common as dementia progressed. AD patients with EPS showed faster cognitive and functional decline and earlier death than those without EPS, even after consideration of differences in initial dementia severity. In the differential diagnosis of dementia with parkinsonism, LB disease in its various forms, including AD with LB, is the principal diagnostic consideration. Future studies of parkinsonism in AD should employ standardized clinical rating scales and should exclude patients on neuroleptics or analyze their results separately. Investigators should report frequencies for individual parkinsonian signs in addition to the overall prevalence of EPS to facilitate meaningful comparisons across studies.",

Compared with the control subjects, the AD patients had significantly lower interhemispheric coherence in the resting EEG for the delta, theta-2, alpha, and beta-1 frequency bands. EEG analysis during photic stimulation also showed that the patients had significantly lower coherence, irrespective of the stimulus frequency. In addition, when we examined the changes in coherence from the resting state to the stimulus condition (i.e., coherence reactivity), significant group differences were found at the brain region primarily involved in visual functioning; the patients had significantly smaller coherence reactivity to photic stimulation at 5 and 15 Hz over the posterior regions. These findings suggest that AD patients have an impairment of interhemispheric functional connectivity in both nonstimulus and stimulus conditions. The findings also suggest a failure of normal stimulation-related brain activation in AD.",

Using a cutoff value of 260 pg/mL the sensitivity of elevated tau was 0.89, the specificity was 0.97, and the proportion of correctly allocated cases was 95%. In the AD groups there were no significant associations between CSF tau level and age, age at onset, duration of illness, apolipoprotein E genotype, severity of cognitive impairment, or deficit in regional cerebral blood flow as measured using 99Tm-ethyl cystein dimer single photon emission computed tomography. The findings demonstrate that CSF tau is significantly increased at the earliest clinical stage of AD and shows only minimal overlap with age-matched cognitively healthy controls. This finding suggests that CSF tau could be a biological marker of AD even before dementia has developed.",

The most frequently perceived healthcare barriers reported in our study were related to (1) personal beliefs (38%), (2) language proficiency (33%), and (3) economic status (13%). The BHAS possesses the requisite psychometric properties to be an effective instrument for an initial survey of perceived barriers to access health care for low-education, cognitively impaired, elderly Hispanic patients. The findings suggest that perceptions regarding illness, health consequences of aging, and beliefs about the utility of medicine do, in fact, influence healthcare use by older Hispanic patients with dementia. Language proficiency and economic status remain common barriers among elderly Hispanic subgroups, but when these barriers are experienced by the cognitively impaired, serious healthcare implications ensue, especially delay in early diagnosis and treatment.",

It can be detected and measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and for this reason it has been proposed as a possible in vivo marker of Alzheimer disease (AD). To evaluate the usefulness of CSF tau in the diagnosis of AD we measured it in patients with AD, frontal lobe dementia (FLD), vascular dementia (VD), and in healthy controls by means of a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test. Individuals with AD had significantly higher tau levels than FLD, VD, and controls. Individuals with late onset AD had significantly higher levels than those with early onset disease. In AD, CSF tau level did not correlate with age, duration, or severity of the disease, whereas a correlation with age was found in FLD and controls. In the nine AD patients in whom CSF tau measurement was repeated after 2 years, mean levels did not differ from baseline, although a worsening of cognitive performances occurred. The overlap among the different groups and the absence of any modification over time suggest that CSF tau measurement, more than in confirming or staging overt AD, might be useful in revealing the disease at its preclinical phase.",

The long-term effect of cholinesterase inhibitors extending to a 2-year period was reported. Future applications of these drugs include treatment of other types of dementias such as Lewy bodies dementia, vascular dementia, and Down syndrome dementia. The combination of cholinesterase inhibitors with estrogens, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatories may represent a further improvement of the therapy.

The study was conducted in the day hospital of an Alzheimer Dementia Research and Care Unit (Brescia, Italy), a multidisciplinary care center providing diagnostic evaluation and treatment for elderly patients with cognitive impairment. The criteria for the inclusion of patients in the study were mild to moderate cognitive impairment [Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) between 11 and 24/30] and absence of major aphasia, blindness, and overt behavioral disturbances such as wandering or agitation. Sixteen patients constituted the experimental group and 12 the control group. The last cognitive, functional, and affective evaluation in the experimental and control group was performed 8.2 and 8.5 months after baseline assessment, respectively. The experimental group had repeated cycles of 1-month ROT classes, and 5–7 weeks was allowed between each cycle. Differential change for MMSE score between the two groups was significant. In the experimental group, there was mild improvement in MMSE score (0.68 point) at the last assessment, whereas the control group declined (-2.58 points). This treatment effect on MMSE score (3.27 points) was controlled for potential confounders in a multiple regression analysis. Adjusted treatment effect, including age, education, baseline MMSE, disease duration, disease severity, number of diseases other than Alzheimer, and time elapsing from baseline to last assessment, was very slightly lower: 3.12. In the experimental group, treatment effect was evaluated by comparing ROT cycle changes and resting period changes. A clearly significant treatment effect was found for MMSE and verbal fluency.",

Neurologists conducted semistructured interviews and examined all participants; they also interviewed family members in cases where dementia was suspected. The diagnosis was made by consensus according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd ed, revised (DSM-III-R). Among the 2,055 contacted individuals, 1,736 (84.5%) participated in the study and 44 ( 13 men and 31 women) were diagnosed as having dementia, including 35 (80%) with probable Alzheimer disease (AD) and 3 (7%) with vascular dementia (VsD). The rates of dementia were 0.5% for ages 65-74 years, 2.9% for ages 75-84 years, and 12.0% for ages 85-101 years. The overall rate was 2.5% for age > or =65 years. After controlling for age, neither a lack of formal education nor being a woman was a risk factor for dementia. At 2-year follow-up, 30 of the 44 demented participants had died, yielding a 2-year survival rate of 32%. The present results corroborated our previous findings of lower prevalence rates of dementia among the Chinese than among Western populations, and both genetic and sociocultural factors may have contributed to the low rates. The lack of neuroradiological imaging studies in the present study may have contributed to the finding of an unusually low rate of VsD.",

The study population comprised 105 demented elderly (83 ± 6 years), 37% with dementia of Alzheimer's type and 58% with vascular dementia. The patients were relocated by the municipal care planning team after clinical examination. An observational scale (the Organic Brain Syndrome scale) was used to assess confusional symptoms and disorientation. The physical environment was assessed by an architect using the Therapeutic Environment Screening Scale, which evaluates general design, space, lighting, noise, communication area, floor plan, and related factors. Less than 15% of the patients had no signs of dyspraxia, hallucinosis, dysphasia, or depression at admission, whereas 66% or more reported lack of vitality, aggressiveness, or restlessness. Fourteen out of 18 units had a corridor-like design (group A), one unit an L-shaped design (group B), and the others a square or H-shaped design (group C). Patients living in the B unit had less disorientation than the others at the 6-month follow-up. After 1 year, the patients in the A units had more dyspraxia, lack of vitality, and disorientation of identity. The communication areas in the units were negatively associated with \"disorientation for recent memory\" and \"lack of vitality,\" adjusted for type of dementia (r = −0.13 to −0.16). The size of the activity area, indoor public rooms in square meters, was not correlated to confusional reactions and disorientation. In conclusion, a GL unit design that facilitates perception without reducing the communication area is to be preferred.",

Ceruloplasmin (CP) and transferrin (TF) interact to limit concentrations of free ferrous iron (Fe2+), and thus play an important role in antioxidant defense in serum; both proteins are also produced in brain, where their significance as antioxidants is unknown. We quantified concentrations of CP and TF by immunoassay in AD (n = 17) and PD (n = 12) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to determine whether these proteins could serve as disease markers. CP was increased versus aged normal subjects (n = 11) in AD (p < 0.05) but not PD CSF, whereas TF concentrations did not differ between groups. CP levels have been reported to be elevated in some brain regions in AD, and increased CP in AD CSF may reflect this finding. Systemic inflammation and oxidative stress are major factors stimulating hepatic CP synthesis, and it remains to be determined whether increased CP concentrations in AD CSF and brain follow from similar mechanisms.",

Thirty-nine families completed the 12-month follow-up; the mean problem behavior score was significantly lower in the intervention than the control group (p < 0.03); the time needed for care of the patient increased by 0.5 ± 9.7 hours/day in the control group and decreased by 0.3 ± 4.1 in the intervention group (p = 0.4, Wilcoxon test).

In patients of the intervention group, there was a significant reduction in the frequency of delusions. This pilot study suggests that caregiver stress is relieved by a structured intervention. The number of families lost to follow-up, the relatively short duration of the study, and the ceiling effect due to the severity of the clinical characteristics of patients probably all partly dilute the observed findings.",

    "abstract": "This study describes the health problems and comorbid illnesses of nursing home (NH) residents with advanced dementia (n=123) and identifies correlates of staff-identified pain. Study participants were residents of 3 NHs in Maryland, their surrogate decision makers and their physicians. Residents' cognitive function was assessed at study enrollment, and their medical records were reviewed to identify all health problems/illnesses and use of pain medications during the 6 months before their enrollment. The most prevalent health problems were skin problems (95%), nutrition/hydration problems (85%), psychiatric/behavioral problems (85%), gastrointestinal problems (81%), and infections (80%). Sixty-three percent of residents had recognized pain, and 95% of those residents received pain medications. In a multivariate regression analysis, staff-identified pain was associated with aspiration (P=0.008), peripheral vascular disease (P=0.021), musculoskeletal disorders (P=0.032), higher cognitive function (P=0.013), and use of pain medications, including nonopiates (P=0.004) and the combination of opiates and nonopiates (P=0.001). NH residents with advanced dementia experience a complex mixture of multiple chronic and acute comorbidities. These results suggest the need for clinicians in long-term care facilities to be vigilant in assessing and treating pain, particularly as cognitive function declines in those with advanced dementia.",

Clinical studies suggest that compounds that act to stimulate nicotinic receptors may improve learning and memory in a variety of models of cognitive impairment in animals. Early clinical studies have suggested positive effects on cognition of nicotine in human beings with and without AD. Finally, nicotinic compounds might slow the progression of AD, as suggested by preclinical models of cell death as well as epidemiological evidence of a protective effect of smoking in AD and Parkinson's disease.",

Most patients and caregivers said they preferred full disclosure of the diagnosis. Patients expressed satisfaction with the physician providing the diagnosis and with their caregivers being present at the disclosure meeting, however, wanted more information about their condition. Caregivers provided further insight regarding the patient response, and suggested the need to emphasize hope in the face of a difficult diagnosis, the use of progressive disclosure to allow the person (and caregivers) to prepare, and the provision of detail about the disease and its progression.",

    "abstract": "Memory impairment, characterized by a pattern of rapid forgetting, is the hallmark deficit in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Memory deficits have also been reported in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and are thought to reflect diminished organizational and attentional abilities leading to a pattern of decreased acquisition of new information. The present study compared patients with AD, the behavioral variant of FTD, and cognitively intact elderly control subjects on two types of memory tests: story memory and word list recall. The percent of information recalled immediately (encoded), after a delay, and the percent retention between these conditions was calculated for both tests. The results showed that FTD patients encoded and recalled more information from the story than AD patients. No difference was found between FTD and AD patients for encoding of the word list. However, FTD patients recalled more words after a delay than AD patients. Percent retention on both tasks was also greater for the FTD group. The results suggest that patterns of performance on different tests of memory, and, in particular, measures of retention, can be useful in differentiating memory impairment in AD from that of FTD on cognitive testing.",

Validity of informant-reported memory was indicated by the correlation between the reports and patients' performance on a neuropsychological memory test. Results indicated that informants who lived with patients provided more accurate reports of the patients' memory than informants who did not live with the patient. Spouses were more accurate than other relationship types, although relationship type was confounded with living status. Patient education and neuropsychiatric symptoms were not significantly associated with informant accuracy. Results of this study will aid in selecting informants who can provide the most accurate data about memory disorder patients and will aid in the development of protocols for clinical trials for dementia prevention and treatment.",

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) have been successful in reducing symptoms in patients with mild-to-moderate AD and led to the US Food and Drug Administration's approval of four AChEIs for the treatment of AD. Although these agents are approved for only mild-to-moderate AD, and the available data for most of them are from trials of only 6 months' duration, long-term studies suggest that the benefits of AChEI treatment can endure for up to 4 years. A common pattern of response to treatment is initial improvement in cognition, followed by maintenance of cognitive gains above baseline for up to 1 year. Generally there is a decline in cognition to below baseline levels after approximately 1 year of treatment, but the level of cognition remains above that predicted for those not receiving pharmacologic treatment. Furthermore, long-term studies suggest that early diagnosis and treatment with AChEIs yield better long-term outcomes. Patients who received continuous pharmacologic treatment from the outset generally had better long-term outcomes than those who received placebo in the double-blind phase of these trials.",

To visualize and interpret these changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), knowledge of MR relaxation times associated with this histopathology is important. The proton MR relaxation times T1 and T2 were determined in vitro for 3 groups of specimens. Fifty specimens of normal and incompletely infarcted white matter from 21 patients with senile dementia and 38 normal and pathologic white matter specimens from 19 elderly cases with infarcts were analyzed. The specimens were evaluated for infarct type, grade of incomplete infarction, and the proportion of old complete or incomplete infarction versus normal tissue in each sample. The incomplete infarct had longer relaxation times than normal white matter, with prolongation of Tl and T2 being proportional to the severity of the tissue changes. Old complete infarcts had longer relaxation times than both normal white matter and incomplete infarctions. These differences in relaxation times, reflecting various degrees of tissue damage, are important for the interpretation of MR images in vivo. Visualization of incomplete infarctions is essential for an in vivo diagnosis of these frequent and sometimes extensive changes.",

Capillary walls were thickened with irregular lumpy, nodulated contours which appeared due, in part, to infiltration of the vascular wall with rounded cell-like bodies. In some cases, these resembled the perikarya of pericytes or monocytes, or their protoplasmic extensions, which were often filled with lipids. In each case, there was no trace of the perivascular neural plexus which regularly invests the microvasculature of the brain parenchyma. The loss of this neural plexus, believed to originate largely from locus ceruleus and the basal forebrain, may be related to the changes in capillary wall structure, and these, in turn, may lead to profound alterations in blood-brain barrier function. We suggest that this subcortically induced denervation microangiopathy may serve as a pathogenic factor in the development of SDAT.",

Total cortisol for the day after adjusting for antidepressant use revealed a group effect [F(2,39)=12.49, P<0.0001], with mild AD patients and caregivers having higher cortisol values. Unlike the noncaregivers (t=−1.15, df=14, P>0.27), both cortisol values of the AD caregivers (t=−2.96, df=16, P<0.03) and the AD patients' (t=−2.5, df=14, P<0.01) increased between awakening and 30 minutes afterward.

The authors followed 160 AD patients from a multicenter cohort with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0.5, corresponding to very mild AD but with impairment insufficient to be classified as dementia. Patients with disease progression were defined as those with CDR> or =1 at 1 year; those with no progression (stable) remained at CDR 0.5. The baseline characteristics of these 2 groups of patients were compared in search of predictors of progression. After a 1-year follow-up, 84 (52.5%) of the patients remained stable, CDR 0.5; 76 (47.5%) progressed to a CDR score > or =1. A baseline lower nutritional status assessed by the Mini Nutritional Assessment [odds ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval (0.68-0.94), P=0.007] and a lower cognitive performance on the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale [odds ratio 1.22, 95% confidence interval (1.07-1.39), P=0.003] were found as predictors of progression. The results suggest that clinical assessment of nutritional status, along with cognitive data, may help detect patients at risk of progression in very early AD. Nutritional assessment should therefore form part of clinical evaluation of patients with AD at an early stage of the disease.",

In a recent prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, memantine treatment lessened the overall functional decline in AD patients already on stable donepezil therapy. In this trial, patients (n=404) with Mini-Mental State Examination scores of 5 to 14 receiving stable donepezil treatment were randomized to double-blind treatment with memantine (10 mg b.i.d.; n=203) or placebo (n=201). A primary outcome measure was the 19-item Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL19). To further evaluate the treatment effects of memantine on function, we performed post hoc analyses of ADCS-ADL19 data from this trial, including ADL items and new subscales derived from factor analysis. Using mixed model analyses, patients receiving memantine had statistically significant less decline in total ADCS-ADL19 scores compared with placebo. An item analysis revealed statistically significant benefits of memantine on grooming, toileting, conversing, watching television, and being left alone. Statistically significant improvements were noted in subscales evaluating higher-level functions and connectedness/autonomy with memantine compared with placebo. These post hoc analyses in moderate-to-severe AD patients receiving stable donepezil treatment suggest that memantine may impact overall functional levels, and some of the cognitive processing underlying ADL performance.",

Psychologic reactions, perceptions of illness, and coping responses of 46 individuals recently diagnosed with MCI and 29 care partners were assessed with questionnaires assessing psychologic well-being, illness perceptions, coping, and perceived needs for services. Care partners and PWMCI report normal levels of psychologic well-being, showing less distress than is commonly found in Alzheimer disease (AD) caregivers. Problem-focused (eg, active coping) and emotion-focused coping strategies (eg, acceptance) were used more often than dysfunctional coping strategies (eg, self-distraction) by PWMCI and care partners. Both groups tended to minimize the likelihood of conversion to AD, and endorsed mental and physical exercise, optimism, dietary changes, and stress reduction as strategies to prevent conversion. Although PWMCI minimized their impairment, care partners reported providing an average of 24 hours per week of caregiving and reported that the PWMCI did need significant help with complex activities. Respondents reported using few formal services but they anticipate substantial future need for services. Results suggest that PWMCI and care partners are likely to minimize the threat of AD and to perceive that conversion is controllable and preventable with health promotion activities. Study implications for the development of intervention programs for PWMCI and their care partners are discussed.",

    "abstract": "One objective of the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) is to develop new or improved instruments and assessment methods for evaluating treatment efficacy in Alzheimer disease (AD) clinical trials. The ADCS Instrument Committee has previously helped to define the state of the art in assessment for AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment clinical trials. We are now entering an exciting era of primary prevention trials to evaluate promising treatments that may delay disease onset and there is a need to develop appropriate instruments for these trials. The ADCS instrument committee has undertaken a project to develop instruments for prevention studies that assess domains known to be important in AD. Prevention trials are long and require large numbers of subjects, making them costly and requiring a high burden of participation for subjects. The current study focused on developing instruments that can be completed at home and in the clinic. The instruments are being evaluated in a cohort of nondemented elderly participating in a 4-year longitudinal study that simulates the design of a primary prevention trial. This report describes the design, baseline characteristics, and some longitudinal outcomes of the study cohort through the completion of the first 2 years of follow-up. We also describe the assessment domains to be measured with our new experimental instruments. This study recruited 644 subjects, 75 years of age and older. Participation in a \"book club\" that provided free books of interest to elders was offered as a recruitment incentive. Approximately 23% had some mild cognitive symptoms consistent with a Clinical Dementia Rating of 0.5. All subjects received a standardized in-clinic evaluation at baseline, which is repeated annually for 4 years to identify cases suspected of developing dementia and to measure longitudinal change on established clinical assessments. Subjects completed a set of self-administered experimental instruments at home or in the clinic designed to assess cognitive function and behavior, global change, activities of daily living, quality of life, and resource use. An additional \"mail-in cognitive function questionnaire\" was obtained separately by mail, 1 month before the other assessments. To evaluate the feasibility, efficiency, and validity of the home-based instruments in comparison with acquiring the same information during a clinic visit, subjects were randomized to 1 of 2 conditions in which the baseline and annual follow-up assessments are completed either at home (\"home group\") or at the study site during their clinic visits (\"clinic group\"). This initial report describes the ongoing 4-year longitudinal study and provides baseline results, which confirm the feasibility of obtaining home-based clinical information via mail or telephone. Initial results for the experimental instruments and for the book club are reported in separate accompanying articles.",

Experimental evidence indicates that some statins can cross the blood-brain barrier, alter brain cholesterol metabolism, and may ultimately decrease the production of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide. Despite these promising leads, clinical trials have yielded inconsistent results regarding the benefits of statin treatment in AD. Seeking to detect a biological signal of statins effect on AD, we conducted a 12-week open-label trial with simvastatin 40 mg/d and then 80 mg/d in 12 patients with AD or amnestic mild cognitive impairment and hypercholesterolemia. We quantified cholesterol precursors and metabolites and AD biomarkers of Abeta and tau in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid at baseline and after the 12-week treatment period. We found a modest but significant inhibition of brain cholesterol biosynthesis after simvastatin treatment, as indexed by a decrease of cerebrospinal fluid lathosterol and plasma 24S-hydroxycholesterol. Despite this effect, there were no changes in AD biomarkers. Our findings indicate that simvastatin treatment can affect brain cholesterol metabolism within 12 weeks, but did not alter molecular indices of AD pathology during this short-term treatment.",

Reliable, valid, and user-friendly scales are a first step in expanding this body of knowledge. The aim of this study was to develop and examine the validity of the Family Stigma in Alzheimer's disease Scale. Interviews were conducted with 185 children of persons with AD. A pool of 100 items was identified from the literature and an earlier qualitative study including 3 dimensions (caregivers' stigma, lay persons' stigma, and structural stigma). Exploratory factor analyses, theoretical relevance, and internal reliability analyses allowed us to reduce the pull to 62 items. Regarding construct validity, statistically significant associations were found between family stigma and caregivers' burden and behavioral problems, in most of the scales. Although further testing is warranted, these findings indicate that the Family Stigma in Alzheimer's disease Scale is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing stigma in the context of AD.",

    "abstract": "There is an increasing interest in exercise and fitness in Alzheimer disease (AD) given evidence suggesting a role in the maintenance of cognitive health. There is, however, little data on the objective measure of cardiorespiratory fitness in individuals with AD. Thus, we assessed cardiorespiratory fitness in early AD and its relationship with physical activity levels, health markers, and cognitive performance in nondemented (Clinical Dementia Rating 0, n=31) and early-stage AD (Clinical Dementia Rating 0.5 and 1, n=31) participants. Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed with maximal exercise testing to determine peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak). Additionally, dual emission x-ray absorptiometry scanning for body composition and glucose tolerance tests were conducted. Despite reductions in physical performance and habitual physical activity levels in early AD, cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak) was comparable in the 2 groups (19.8 in early AD vs. 21.2 mL/kg/min in nondemented, P=0.26). AD participants performed well on treadmill tests with similar levels of perceived exertion, maximal heart rate, and respiratory exchange ratio compared with nondemented individuals. After controlling for age and sex, VO2peak was associated with a beneficial glucoregulatory profile and inversely associated with percent body fat, body mass index, and triglycerides. A relationship between cognitive performance measures and VO2peak was not apparent. These results suggest that individuals in the early stages of AD have the capacity for maximal exercise testing and have comparable levels of cardiorespiratory fitness as nondemented individuals. Reduced physical activity associated with early AD underscores the need for further defining the role of exercise as a potential therapeutic intervention in the early stages of AD.",

The authors assessed 97 spouses in a cross-sectional study with the Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life (SEIQoL), Self-Rated Burden scale (SRB), self-perceived stress scale (EDIZ; Ervaren Druk door Informele Zorg/Self-Perceived Pressure from Informal Care), and Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). Patient cognition was rated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Factors best predicting QoL were analyzed with multiple regression analysis. Eighty-seven (53% male, mean 72 y) fulfilled the SEIQoL internal reliability criteria, and had a mean SEIQoL score of 68.6±14.8. Most important QoL domains were condition of patient (31%) and marriage (26%). Caregiver burden scores on SRB, Ervaren Druk door Informele, Zorg, and ZBI were 44.1±23.5 (n=67), 4.9±2.2 (n=53), and 13.1±6.2 (n=53), respectively. Mean patient MMSE score (0 to 30) was 20.3±4.2. Spouses experienced lower QoL than Alzheimer disease patients and healthy elderly (historical controls), and perceived moderate levels of burden. Patient cognition is a significant predictor of caregiver QoL. Burden, measured by ZBI, is significantly negatively correlated with SEIQoL. The results underline the importance of implementing health services known to improve QoL and alleviate burden, and to explore new effective interventions.",

Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) values were calculated. MCI patients exhibited intermediary LZC scores between AD patients and controls. A combination of age and posterior LZC scores allowed ADs-MCIs discrimination with 94.4% sensitivity and specificity, whereas no LZC score allowed MCIs---controls discrimination. AD patients and controls showed a parallel tendency to diminished LZC scores as a function of age, but MCI patients did not exhibit such \"normal\" tendency. Accordingly, anterior LZC scores allowed MCIs-controls discrimination for subjects below 75 years. MCIs exhibited a qualitatively distinct relationship between aging and complexity reduction, with scores higher than controls in older individuals. This fact might be considered a new example of compensatory mechanism in MCI before fully established dementia.",

Recent advances in our understanding of the neuropathologic, biochemical, and genetic basis of these conditions provides evidence for a common underlying pathogenesis. The neuropathology in most cases of FTD with ALS is a subtype of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, characterized by neuronal inclusions that are immunoreactive for ubiquitin but not tau (frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitinated inclusions). These cases show significant pathologic overlap with clinically pure FTD and those with classic ALS. Moreover, the ubiquitinated pathologic protein in all these conditions has recently been identified as TDP-43. A number of families have been reported with autosomal dominant FTD-ALS linked to chromosome 9p and these also have TDP-43–positive frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitinated inclusions pathology. Together, these findings suggest that FTD-ALS is part of a clinicopathologic spectrum of disease, now identified as TDP-43 proteinopathies.",

Seventy-four AD patients underwent objective measurement of blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels, and they received a detailed neuropsychologic evaluation examining attention, memory, language, visuomotor/visuospatial skills, and executive functioning. Multiple regression analyses controlling for demographic variables, overall cognitive status, and the presence of diabetes/cardiac disease indicated that an increase in the number of VCs, but not their severity, was associated with poorer verbal and visual recall, visuoconstructive and spatial analysis, verbal reasoning, and set shifting. The findings demonstrate that VCs are associated with specific aspects of cognitive functioning in AD patients. The mechanisms likely involve the effects of VCs on cerebrovascular disease including white matter disruption. The results highlight the importance of controlling these risk factors in patients who carry the diagnosis of AD.",

In this study, the level of support service need for caregivers of individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer disease (AD; N=55) and MCI (N=25) was compared with normal controls (N=44). Study partners (ie, caregivers) completed questionnaires about their service needs and participants' neurobehavioral symptoms, functional abilities, and frailty. Total, social, and mental health service needs were significantly different among the 3 groups (P<0.0001), with MCI and AD caregivers reporting more need for services as compared with the normal control group. There was no significant difference between MCI and AD groups for total and social service need. In the MCI group, caregiver's service need was related to neurobehavioral symptoms and frailty, whereas service need among the AD caregivers was related to functional disability and frailty. Caregivers of individuals with MCI are already experiencing a need for increased services comparable to that of individuals caring for AD patients, though the pattern of patient-related factors is different between the 2 patient groups.

Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene polymorphism is known to be associated with Alzheimer disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and Pick disease (PiD). We tested the hypothesis that BDNF Val and ApoE ε4 alleles confer susceptibility to AD, DLB, and PiD. The study included 160 AD, 34 DLB patients, 38 autopsy-confirmed PiD, and 164 age-matched healthy control (HC) probands. The frequency of the BDNF Val allele was significantly higher in AD, but there were no statistical differences in the allele distribution in PiD or in DLB as compared with HC. The Val/Met genotype occurred with statistically significantly higher frequency in PiD than in HC. The ApoE ε4 allele was significantly overrepresented in all dementias as compared with HC. Genotypes containing both ApoE ε4 and BDNF Val alleles occurred more frequently in all investigated dementias than in HC. We suggest that the presence of the BDNF Val allele in itself and in combination with the ApoE ε4 allele can be risk factors for AD, and the results indicate a synergistic effect of the 2 polymorphisms on DLB and PiD risk.",

We sought to identify what neuropathologic vascular findings—likely to be evident on brain MRI during life—would predict the presence of microinfarcts. We sought associations between such findings and microinfarcts in neuropathology databases from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study. Considering only subjects 65 years or older at death, microinfarcts were evaluated in 6189 from NACC and 219 from ACT. Despite different definitions being used, microinfarcts were common in both studies (19.7% in NACC and 16.0% in ACT), and their frequency increased significantly with age. In NACC specimens, after controlling for age and sex in multivariable models, microinfarcts were strongly associated with macroinfarcts [odds ratio (OR): 4.4, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.8, 5.0], leukoencephalopathy (OR: 2.6, 95% CI: 2.1, 3.3), and hemorrhages (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.6, 2.6). Similarly in the ACT specimens, microinfarcts were strongly associated with macroinfarcts (OR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.4, 6.3). These neuropathologic associations suggest that people whose cranial MRI shows macroinfarcts, hemorrhages, or leukoencephalopathy are more likely also to have microinfarcts.",

Sixty-seven participants (37 AD patients matched with 30 control participants) were screened using the MSET. Simultaneously, a close relative of each patient was given the Apathy Inventory, which assesses 3 distinct dimensions of apathy (lack of initiative, lack of interest, and emotional blunting). AD patients presented significantly more multitasking deficits than control participants. In addition, regression analyses revealed that the number of rule breaks on the MSET (inability to perform several tasks in a predefined time observing a number of rules) was the best predictor of apathy, and especially of lack of initiative. These results suggest that the relation between lack of initiative and multitasking has a specific character and that mechanisms underlying multitasking constitute a key component of goal-directed behaviors.",

One hundred seven family caregivers completed measures assessing patient illness characteristics, general coping styles of caregivers, specific dementia management strategies, religion and spirituality, and caregiver adjustment outcomes of burden and gain. Multiple regressions revealed that behavioral problems in the PWD, dementia severity, and the use of behavioral disengagement and criticism as coping strategies were significant predictors of burden accounting for 48% of the explained variance [F(4,99)=23.12, P<0.001]. The only significant predictor of gain was the use of encouragement as a specific dementia management strategy, explaining 18% of variance [F(3,102)=7.39, P<0.001]. Religion and spirituality predicted gain indirectly through the use of encouragement. Coping strategies had an independent effect on caregiver outcomes above and beyond PWD illness characteristics and caregiver characteristics. Hence, caregiver interventions should target coping strategies to improve outcomes of caregiving for dementia. Findings also support the need to examine religion and spirituality in future studies of caregiver adjustment outcomes and to explore the factors not measured in this study that might explain gain.",

However, it is not clear that assessment of DR adds benefit for measuring change over time after a diagnosis is made or in clinical trials. The ADAS-cog is the most commonly used tool to assess treatment efficacy in AD clinical trials. In an attempt to improve sensitivity to change, assessment of DR after the 3-trial, 10-word list was added to the standard 11-item ADAS-cog. We examined the added value of the DR in participants with MCI and AD followed for at least 1 year.Data from 111 subjects with AD and 259 subjects with MCI who were randomly assigned to the placebo arm of 2 clinical trials were included. Participants with AD had Mini-Mental State Examination scores of 13 to 27 and those with MCI had 24 to 30. We calculated the ADAS-cog11 score based on the original 11 items (range: best to worse, 0 to 70), the DR item score (range: 0 to 10 words not recalled), and the ADAS-cog12 (range: 0 to 80). We assessed the rate of missing items for DR over time, the change scores, the association between scores and baseline performance, and used longitudinal mixed effects regression models to examine the rate of change.At baseline AD subjects were near floor on DR (8.93 ± 1.6 SD) and showed little change over 1 year (0.12 ± 1.34); the MCI subjects baseline DR was 6.2 ± 2.2 with 1-year change of 0.20±1.7. We compared standardized change (change/SD) for ADAS-cog11, and 12 in MCI and found a 10% improvement with ADAS-cog12; there was no improvement in the AD group. In a subset of MCI and AD cases with matching Mini-Mental State Examination (23 to 27), the ADAS-cog12 provided an 18% improvement in standardized change in MCI subjects, with no benefit in the AD cohort, primarily owing to increased variance.The addition of DR to the ADAS-cog score increased the ability to detect change in subjects with MCI over 1 year compared with the ADAS-cog11 but increased the variance in subjects with AD, even in those with mild impairment These findings speak to the need to tailor outcome measures to the specific study population and diagnosis for maximal efficiency and economy when conducting clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "The Alzheimer Disease-related Quality of Life (ADRQL) instrument was developed to assess health-related quality of life in people with AD using assessments from family caregivers or professional staff. Validity and reliability of the ADRQL in its original form and a revised version are assessed in a sample consisting of persons in 3 residential settings (community, assisted living, nursing home). The ADRQL exhibits good item-internal consistency (67.5% of items met 0.40 standard); high correlation of items to hypothesized scales (85% of items met criteria for 4 of 5 subscales and the overall instrument); a good range of scores (21.6 to 100 for total sample revised instrument); very low missing data; and internal-consistency reliability coefficients exceeding the minimum reliability standard for group comparisons (0.86 for total scores; range of 0.56 to 0.83 for subscales). In a community sample, the ADRQL discriminates between groups and is responsive over time in hypothesized directions. Characteristics of caregiver raters (community sample) including demographics and self-rated health were largely unrelated to scores. The results support the use of the ADRQL to evaluate health-related quality of life in persons with AD across various care settings and various stages of the disease. Modest correlations with cognitive and functional disability levels suggest that the ADRQL provides insight into other important dimensions of life experience in persons with dementia. The revised version has improved measurement properties and is recommended for use over the original.",

    "abstract": "Studying end of life in dementia patients is challenging because of ill-defined prognoses and frequent inability to self-report. We aim to quantify and compare (1) feasibility and (2) sampling issues between prospective and retrospective data collection specific to end-of-life research in long-term care settings. The observational Dutch End of Life in Dementia study (DEOLD; 2007 to 2011) used both prospective data collection (28 facilities; 17 nursing home organizations/physician teams; questionnaires between January 2007 and July 2010, survival until July 2011) and retrospective data collection (exclusively after death; 6 facilities; 2 teams, questionnaires between November 2007 and March 2010). Prospective collection extended from the time of admission to the time after death or conclusion of the study. Prospectively, we recruited 372 families: 218 residents died (59%) and 184 (49%) had complete physician and family after-death assessments. Retrospectively, 119 decedents were enrolled, with 64 (54%) complete assessments. Cumulative data collection over all homes lasted 80 and 8 years, respectively. Per complete after-death assessments in a year, the prospective data collection involved 37.9 beds, whereas this was 7.9 for the retrospective data collection. Although age at death, sex, and survival curves were similar, prospectively, decedents' length of stay was shorter (10.3 vs. 31.4 mo), and fewer residents had advanced dementia (39% vs. 54%). Regarding feasibility, we conclude that prospective data collection is many fold more intensive and complex per complete after-death assessment. Regarding sampling, if not all are followed until death, it results in right censoring and in different, nonrepresentative samples of decedents compared with retrospective data collection. Future work may adjust or stratify for dementia severity and length of stay as key issues to promote comparability between studies.",

The present study aimed to establish a panel of plasma proteins that accurately distinguishes early AD from physiological aging and to compare the findings with previous reports. Fifty-eight healthy controls (CON) and 109 patients with AD dementia were randomly split into a training (40%) and a test (60%) sample. Significant proteins to differentiate between the CON and AD dementia groups were identified in a comprehensive panel of 107 plasma analytes in the training sample; the accuracy in differentiating these 2 groups was explored in the test sample. A set of 5 plasma proteins was identified, which differentiated between the CON group and the AD dementia group with a sensitivity of 89.36% and a specificity of 79.17%. A biological pathway analysis showed that 4 of 5 proteins belonged to a common network with amyloid precursor protein and tau. Apolipoprotein E was the only protein that was both significant in the present report and in a previous proteomic study. The study provides a piece of evidence in support of the feasibility of a blood-based biomarker approach in AD diagnostics; however, further research is required because of issues with replicability.",

Therefore, male sex hormones have been postulated as risk modifiers in AD, possibly through immunomodulatory effects on known inflammatory AD risk factors, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). We conducted a cross-sectional study of sex hormones and TNF-α levels in 94 community-dwelling men with AD. Comparisons were made with normal values derived from the literature. Men with AD had lower free testosterone levels than non-AD men (1-sample t test: age <80, P=0.0002; age ≥80, P<0.0001), and higher luteinizing hormone (LH) levels (Wilcoxon signed rank test: age <80, P=0.001; age ≥80, P<0.0001). Within the cohort of men with AD, there was a positive correlation between LH and TNF-α (Spearman r=0.25, P=0.019), and this remained significant after correcting for age (partial r=0.21, P=0.05). These data support the hypothesis that sex hormones and the immune system influence each other in AD. Furthermore, modulatory effects between LH and TNF-α may provide a mechanism for an effect of male sex hormones on AD risk.",

    "abstract": "Background: Dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are underrecognized in community settings. This may be due in part to the lack of brief dementia screening tools available to clinicians. We compared 2 brief, informant-based screening tests: the AD8 and the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) in a community-based neurology practice in the midwestern United States. Methods: We examined 186 consecutive patients (44 controls, 13 with MCI, and 129 with dementia). Receiver operator characteristic curves were used to examine the ability of AD8 and IQCODE to discriminate between controls and MCI or dementia. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios were reported. Results: AD8 differentiated healthy controls from MCI (P<0.001) or dementia (P<0.001), and MCI from dementia (P=0.008). The IQCODE differentiated controls and MCI from dementia (both P<0.001), and between controls and MCI (P=0.002). Both AD8 (AUC=0.953; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-0.99) and IQCODE (AUC=0.930, 95% confidence interval, 0.88-0.97) provided discrimination between controls and patients with dementia; however, the AD8 had superior sensitivity detecting dementia (99.2%) and MCI (100%) compared with the IQCODE (79.1% for dementia, 46.1% for MCI) with nonoverlapping confidence intervals. Using published cut-offs (AD8≥2, IQCODE≥3.4), only 1 case of dementia was missed with the AD8, whereas the IQCODE failed to detect dementia in 27 individuals. The AD8 detected MCI in all 13 individuals, whereas the IQCODE misclassified 7 individuals. Conclusions: Both the AD8 and IQCODE were able to detect dementia in a community setting. The AD8, however, was more successful than IQCODE in detecting MCI. If simple and efficient screening for early cognitive impairment is the goal, particularly in the early stages (eg, for prevention trials or public screening), the combination of an informant interview (the AD8) and a brief performance measure could be considered as they meet the basic requirements of the Personalized Prevention Plan for Medicare beneficiaries.",

    "abstract": "This study was set out to describe caregiver-perceived burden and coping in early-stage Alzheimer disease (AD). A total of 163 consecutive pairs of patients with AD and their principal caregivers were initially recruited. The caregivers completed the Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI) and the Coping Orientations to Problems Experienced scale, and also provided sociodemographic information; the patients with AD were assessed by means of the Mini Mental State Examination and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Data from 126 patient-caregiver pairs were analyzed. The caregivers (mean age 56.11±12.37 y) were mainly women (76%); 64% were the patient's offspring; 39% lived with the patient. From the CBI data, it emerged that caregivers perceived loss of personal time (objective burden, 33%) and the feeling of missing out on opportunities (developmental burden, 25%) as their main stressors. Total CBI score was negatively correlated with Mini Mental State Examination (P=0.005). As regards coping strategies, the caregivers predominantly used problem-oriented strategies associated with a positive attitude. The use of dysfunctional strategies was predictive of caregiver burden. It is important to be aware that avoidance and dysfunctional coping strategies predispose caregivers of patients with AD to higher level of distress, whereas successful caregiving seems to be based on the use of problem-oriented strategies early in the disease when solutions are still available.",

The participants were assessed 3 times during 1 year. Awareness was assessed using the Guidelines for the Rating of Awareness Deficits, and affective symptoms were assessed using the anxiety and depression items of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Population-averaged logistic regressions were used to analyze awareness and its association with affective symptoms.The odds for impaired awareness in LO-AD were more than double the odds in YO-AD. Intact awareness was associated with depressive symptoms but not with anxiety. This effect was more pronounced in YO-AD compared with LO-AD at baseline. High awareness at baseline did not predict incident affective symptoms.Caregivers and clinicians should be prepared for affective symptoms in YO-AD patients with high awareness. The higher awareness in the YO-AD group also has potential positive implications for this group.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to understand whether patients with mild Alzheimer disease (AD) could use general or self-referential mental imagery to improve their recognition of visually presented words. Experiment 1 showed that, unlike healthy controls, patients generally did not benefit from either type of imagery. To help determine whether the patients' inability to benefit from mental imagery at encoding was due to poor memory or due to an impairment in mental imagery, participants performed 4 imagery tasks with varying imagery and cognitive demands. Experiment 2 showed that patients successfully performed basic visual imagery, but degraded semantic memory, coupled with visuospatial and executive functioning deficits, impaired their ability to perform more complex types of imagery. Given that patients with AD can perform basic mental imagery, our results suggest that episodic memory deficits likely prevent AD patients from storing or retrieving general mental images generated during encoding. Overall, the results of both experiments suggest that neurocognitive deficits do not allow patients with AD to perform complex mental imagery, which may be most beneficial to improving memory. However, our data also suggest that intact basic mental imagery and rehearsal could possibly be helpful if used in a rehabilitation multisession intervention approach.",

We searched for neuropsychological and demographical predictors of RL impairment. Methods: RL was investigated in a clinical study including subjects classified as early AD (n=37), MCI (n=34), and aged normal controls (n=46). An ecological assessment procedure of RL was employed and landmarks learning and navigational abilities were evaluated. The consortium to establish a registry of Alzheimer's disease test battery was used for neuropsychological assessment. Results: Almost all AD patients, and most subjects with MCI misidentified landmarks and made navigational errors when following the route without assistance. Moreover, a small subgroup of normal controls also had problems with RL. Poor RL performance was best predicted by impairments in memory and executive functions. Conclusions: RL impairment is common in early AD and MCI, and is occasionally also found in normal elderly subjects. Its characteristic appearance is a combination of poor landmark recognition and defective directional guidance. Poor RL can be predicted by neuropsychological testing. In MCI and in a subset of normal aged persons, RL impairment may herald incipient dementia.",

Cause-specific mortality (contributing cause of death, including underlying cause cases) rates in 2000 for United States-born African Americans and whites aged 65 to 89 years were calculated by linking national mortality records with population data based on race, sex, age, and birth state or state of residence in 2000. Birth in a SB state (NC, SC, GA, TN, AR, MS, or AL) was cross-classified against SB residence at the 2000 Census. Compared with those who were not born in the SB, odds of all-cause dementia mortality were significantly elevated by 29% for African Americans and 19% for whites born in the SB. These patterns prevailed among individuals who no longer lived in the SB at death. Patterns were similar for Alzheimer Disease-related mortality. Some non-SB states were also associated with significant elevations in dementia-related mortality. Dementia mortality rates follow geographic patterns similar to stroke mortality, with elevated rates among those born in the SB. This suggests important roles for geographically patterned childhood exposures in establishing cognitive reserve.",

Four randomized controlled trials of cognitive intervention, for patients diagnosed with AD that incorporated cognitive intervention and mock intervention control conditions, were included in the analysis. Only the domain of global cognitive functioning, as measured by Mini-Mental State Examination, showed significant intervention effects. No effects were observed in the remaining domains. Concerning feasibility, high rates of completion and adherence were found. A single randomized controlled trial, with unspecified dementia, suggested cognitive intervention to be cost-effective. Given the currently available dearth of well-controlled and focused trials in AD, these results should be carefully interpreted and remain to be confirmed in the future. There is a clear need for more high-quality research.",

Twelve patients with AD and 13 healthy controls were enrolled. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of total brain tissue volumes with SIENAX. Localized gray matter atrophy was identified with optimized voxel-wise morphometry (FSL-VBM), and subcortical atrophy was evaluated by active shape model implemented in FMRIB's Integrated Registration Segmentation Toolkit. SIENAX analysis demonstrated total brain atrophy in AD patients; voxel-based morphometry analysis showed atrophy in the bilateral mediotemporal regions and in the posterior brain regions. In addition, regarding the diminished volumes of thalami and hippocampi in AD patients, subsequent vertex analysis of the segmented structures indicated shrinkage of the bilateral anterior thalami and the left medial hippocampus. Interestingly, the volume of the thalami and hippocampi were highly correlated with the volume of the thalami and amygdalae on both sides in AD patients, but not in healthy controls. This complex structural information proved useful in the detailed interpretation of AD-related neurodegenerative process, as the multilevel approach showed both global and local atrophy on cortical and subcortical levels. Most importantly, our results raise the possibility that subcortical structure atrophy is not independent in AD patients.",

All participants who reported taking BZDs had poorer cognitive performance at all visits than nonusers. However, cognitive decline was statistically similar among all participants. We found no evidence of an association between BZD use and cognitive decline. The poor cognitive performance in BZD users may be due to prodromal symptoms caused by preclinical dementia processes.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the factors that mediate changes in Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) ratings by community-dwelling people with Alzheimer disease (AD) and carers over a period of 18 months. We completed an 18-month longitudinal study of 80 community-dwelling older adults diagnosed with probable AD of mild or moderate severity (NINCDS-ADRD criteria) and their family carers. The primary outcome of interest was the 18-month change in HRQoL ratings as measured with the Quality of Life-AD (QoL-AD) (by carer and by self). Explanatory variables included demographics, lifestyle, cognition, awareness, psychopathology, burden-of-care, use of medication, and functionality in daily life. We found a significant decline (8.7%, P=0.003) in QoL-AD carer-ratings, but not in self-ratings. The final parsimonious model of predictors of changes in QoL-AD self-ratings explained 22.6% of the variance; only changes on Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Anxiety retained significance. The final model of predictors of changes in carer-ratings explained 55.0% of the variance: that is, changes on Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, changes on Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Depression, practicing hobbies at 18 months, and number of visit(s) or admission(s) to hospital. HRQoL self-ratings and carer-ratings of community-dwelling people with AD do not decline at same rate over 18 months and changes are associated with different factors. Interventions designed to optimize quality of life of people with AD should consider carefully whose HRQoL ratings they wish to change.",

Understanding how T2D and blood glucose relate to memory decline is crucial to elucidating the mechanisms linking T2D and dementia.For 8888 Health and Retirement Study participants aged 50+, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured in either 2006 or 2008 and physician's diagnosis of diabetes was self-reported in the same year. Composite memory (z scored) was assessed biennially through 2012 using immediate and delayed word list recall or the Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline. Marginal mean regression models for repeated outcomes were specified to predict memory decline as a function of diabetes or HbA1c, using age as the timescale and adjusting for health and social confounders.Diabetes was associated with a 10% faster rate of memory decline [β=-0.04 per decade; 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.06 to -0.01). A 1 U increase in HbA1c corresponded with a 0.05 SD decrease in memory score per decade (95% CI, -0.08 to -0.03). Even among individuals with HbA1c<6.5% (threshold for diabetes), higher HbA1c was associated with memory decline (β=-0.05 per decade; 95% CI, -0.08 to -0.03).Diabetes accelerated memory loss and higher HbA1c predicted memory decline even in nondiabetics.",

In an age-stratified random sample (N=1982) aged 65+ years, we assessed at baseline the cognitive domains of attention, executive function, memory, language, and visuospatial function, and also vascular, inflammatory, and metabolic indices. Random effects models generated slopes of cognitive decline over the next 4 years; linear models identified vascular factors associated with these slopes, adjusting for demographics, baseline cognition, and potential interactions. Several vascular risk factors (history of stroke, diabetes, central obesity, C-reactive protein), although associated with lower baseline cognitive performance, did not predict rate of subsequent decline. APOE*4 genotype was associated with accelerated decline in language, memory, and executive functions. Homocysteine elevation was associated with faster decline in executive function. Hypertension (history or systolic blood pressure >140 mm Hg) was associated with slower decline in memory. Baseline alcohol consumption was associated with slower decline in attention, language, and memory. Different indices of vascular risk are associated with low performance and with rates of decline in different cognitive domains. Cardiovascular mechanisms explain at least some of the variance in cognitive decline. Selective survival may also play a role.",

Measures of the temporal horn (TH), which is situated adjacent to the hippocampus, may also indicate early changes in AD. Previous studies suggest that these metrics can predict conversion from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD with conversion and volume change measured concurrently. However, the ability of these metrics to predict future conversion has not been investigated. We compared the abilities of hippocampal, TH, and global measures to predict future conversion from MCI to AD. TH, hippocampi, whole brain, and ventricles were measured using baseline and 12-month scans. Boundary shift integral was used to measure the rate of change. We investigated the prediction of conversion between 12 and 24 months in subjects classified as MCI from baseline to 12 months. All measures were predictive of future conversion. Local and global rates of change were similarly predictive of conversion. There was evidence that the TH expansion rate is more predictive than the hippocampal atrophy rate (P=0.023) and that the TH expansion rate is more predictive than the TH volume (P=0.036). Prodromal atrophy rates may be useful predictors of future conversion to sporadic AD from amnestic MCI.",

    "abstract": "Population aging has been accompanied by worldwide growth in dementia. However, little is known about the prevalence of dementia and cognitive impairment not dementia in ethnically diverse populations, such as indigenous populations conceptualized as groups of persons who self-identify as indigenous and who are recognized as distinctive communities reproducing ancestral, historical, and territorial culture. This is particularly relevant in view of increasing life expectancy in indigenous populations and, consequently, in the number of elderly people, as well as the changes in their multimorbidity profile. In this study, a systematic review of the literature on the subject \"cognitive impairment in indigenous elderly population\" in the databases MEDLINE via PubMed, Lilacs, and Scopus showed that the prevalence of dementia in indigenous populations between 45 and 94 years old, originally from different countries, varied between 0.5% and 26.8% for age 60 and older, whereas the prevalence of cognitive impairment not dementia varied between 4.4% and 17.7%. Early onset of the disease, older age, low education level, and several poor health conditions were associated with prevalence rates and conversion from normal to any cognitive impairment. Cultural inadequacy of neuropsychological tests was the main factor reported in the selected studies, which makes the investigation of dementia a challenge in indigenous populations. These data reveal that the prevalence rates of dementia ranged from low to very high for those aged 60 years and older, with early onset of the disease and elevated mortality rate after initial diagnosis compared with the current global prevalence studies, suggesting that these individuals may be more vulnerable to cognitive disorders. Cognitive reserve and exposure to poor health status throughout life span may be considered in the interpretation of results.",

Early findings have suggested an association between latent toxoplasmosis and Alzheimer disease (AD). On the basis of these factors, we sought to determine whether there is an association between latent toxoplasmosis and AD using a large, well-characterized sample of subjects with AD and age-matched and sex-matched controls without dementia. Methods: Using ELISA, we determined anti- T. gondii IgG antibody titers in 114 control subjects and in 105 subjects diagnosed with AD through an Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. Results: There were no group differences between groups in age, ethnicity, or sex. Education and socioeconomic status was slightly higher in the control group. Neither the prevalence of anti- T. gondii IgG antibodies (33% in the nondemented control group compared with 41% in the AD group, P =0.25) nor log-transformed antibody concentration (106.6 IU/mL in the control group compared with 140.9 IU/mL in the AD group, P =0.85) differed between the control and AD groups. Discussion: In this sample, we found neither a higher prevalence of latent toxoplasmosis in the AD group compared with the control group nor differences in serum anti- T. gondii IgG titers between groups.",

Learning and memory were examined using the Morris Water Maze at 21 and 22 months of age. After the behavioral testing, hippocampal and cortical brain volumes were calculated with magnetic resonance imaging and motor function was evaluated using the rotorod. The amyloid burden and tau neurofibrillary tangles in the hippocampus were determined using immunohistochemistry. We found that dantrolene significantly decreased the intraneuronal amyloid accumulation by as much as 76% compared with its corresponding vehicle control, together with a trend to reduce phosphorylated tau in the hippocampus. No significant differences could be detected in hippocampal or cortical brain volume, motor function or cognition among all experimental groups, indicating that the mice were still presymptomatic for Alzheimer disease. Thus, presymptomatic and long-term dantrolene treatment significantly decreased the intraneuronal amyloid burden in aged 3xTg-AD mice before significant changes in brain volume, or cognition.",

Subgroup analyses showed that: a single session of tDCS was significantly effective (P<0.05) whereas repeated sessions of tDCS was not lower current density (0.06 mA/cm) (P>0.05) but not higher current density (0.08 mA/cm) significantly improved cognitive performance; stimulating the temporal cortex (P<0.05) but not the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex significantly improved cognitive function of AD patients; and improved cognitive function occurred in the group with higher education (P<0.05) but not in the group with lower education.Current evidence suggests that tDCS has a beneficial effect in mild to moderate AD patients. We must be cautious about the results of subgroup analysis given small sample sizes, and further well-designed studies with larger sample size are required to verify these results.",

    "abstract": "Female sex is a major risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD), and sex hormones have been implicated as a possible protective factor. Neuroimaging studies that evaluated the effects of sex hormones on brain integrity have primarily emphasized neurodegenerative measures rather than amyloid and tau burden.We compared cortical amyloid and regional tau positron emission tomography (PET) deposition between cognitively normal males and females. We also compared preclinical AD pathology between females who have and have not used hormone therapy (HT). Finally, we compared the effects of amyloid and tau pathology on cognition, testing for both sex and HT effects.We analyzed amyloid, tau, and cognition in a cognitively normal cross-sectional cohort of older individuals (n=148) followed at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center. Amyloid and tau PET, medication history, and neuropsychological testing were obtained for each participant.Within cognitively normal individuals, there was no difference in amyloid burden by sex. Whether or not we controlled for amyloid burden, female participants had significantly higher tau PET levels than males in multiple regions, including the rostral middle frontal and superior and middle temporal regions. HT accounted for a small reduction in tau PET; however, males still had substantially lower tau PET compared with females. Amyloid PET and tau PET burden were negatively associated with cognitive performance, although increasing amyloid PET did not have a deleterious effect on cognitive performance for women with a history of HT.Regional sex-related differences in tau PET burden may contribute to the disparities in AD prevalence between males and females. The observed decreases tau PET burden in HT users has important implications for clinical practice and trials and deserves future consideration in longitudinal studies.",

The findings extend earlier work in other groups of older patients and indicate that VaD patients’ performance in cognitive functioning and financial capacity is severely impaired, while there is a statistically significant difference between depressed and nondepressed VaD patients.

This prospective 4-month study identified 118 patients with DAT, most of whom were referred to the two emergency departments of the Toulouse University Hospital. The two main reasons for admission were behavioral problems (26.3%) and falls (18.6%). Patients were generally at an advanced stage of the disease process and had substantial evidence of poor nutritional status and loss of activities of daily living ability. About one third of patients had already been admitted to the hospital for the same reasons in the preceding months. Psychotropic drugs predominated (71%) among the current medications taken by the patients and were mainly anxiolytics and neuroleptics. Finally, the discharge report indicated that medications were a contributing factor in the disorders of 25% of patients. We believe that improved information for caregivers and early management and treatment are essential to respond adequately to the problems raised by this population.",

All three patients had a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 24/30 and carried at least one apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4 allele. Tacrine was given in doses between 80 and to 160 mg daily for 13–31 months. A lower tacrine concentration was observed generally in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compared with plasma. The acetylcholinesterase activity in CSF tended to be increased following longer periods of tacrine treatment, whereas the butyrylcholinesterase activity was decreased. The three patients repeatedly underwent positron emission tomography investigation of cerebral blood flow, nicotinic receptors, cerebral glucose metabolism, and electroencephalogram (EEG) and cognitive tests. Positive influences on these parameters were observed following both short-term and long-term treatment with tacrine. Improvement of nicotinic receptors (measured as 11C-nicotine binding), cerebral blood flow, EEG. and some cognitive tests (trail making test, block design test) occurred earlier after initiation of tacrine treatment compared with the glucose metabolism, which was increased after several months of tacrine treatment. An improvement in attention (trail making test) was observed following tacrine as sign for frontal lobe activation (EEG). The functional effects of tacrine in Alzheimer patients appeared to be related to both dose and length of cholinesterase inhibitor treatment.",

The qEEG was performed at initial examination and global cognitive function, activities of daily living, and behavior were assessed at initial evaluation and after a period of 6 months. Using multiple linear regression analysis, higher frontocentral and parieto-occipital theta values, lower parieto-occipital beta values, and lower peak frequency were significantly associated with more decline in global cognitive function over the follow-up period. In addition, lower parieto-occipital beta values were significantly related to more decline in activities of daily living. These associations were independent of demographic (age, sex, and education) and disease characteristics [initial Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of the Elderly Cognitive test (CAMCOG) or Mini-Mental State Examination scores, estimated duration of symptoms, estimated prior rate of decline, and dementia severity]. In a separate multiple logistic regression analysis, prediction of rapidly progressive decline, defined as 8 or more points decline in CAMCOG scores (n = 21). could be made with parieto-occipital and frontocentral beta values. The results suggest that slowing on qEEG is a marker for subsequent rate of cognitive and functional decline in mildly demented AD patients, independent of demographic or disease characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Summary: The current criteria for vascular dementia use a paradigm that first diagnoses dementia on the basis of Alzheimer-type criteria and then superimposes upon this vascular events and risk factors to convert a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease to one of vascular dementia. There are two fundamental flaws with this approach. First, the neuropsychological features of Alzheimer disease are not the same as those for vascular dementia and so use of the current criteria will fail to diagnose many cases, particularly those in whom memory loss is not prominent. Second, progression of vascular dementia should be modifiable by adjustment of risk factors and, possibly, by the use of neuroprotective agents. Given this, it is absurd to wait until patients are frankly demented. It is far more appropriate to detect patients at risk of developing cognitive loss as soon as possible. This could be in the earliest symptomatic stage (vascular cognitive impairment) or even prior to this (brain-at-risk) stage. New criteria, based on evidence rather than on supposition, that focus on early disease are urgently needed.",

To determine whether AAMI represents a variant of normal aging, we longitudinally studied individuals meeting AAMI criteria for development of dementia. Two hundred two community-living individuals (mean age, 77 years) with or without mild memory impairment were assessed annually for an average of 3 years at the Washington University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. At baseline, no individual was unequivocally demented, as defined by a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 1 or greater. Modified National Institute of Mental Health criteria were used to identify individuals with AAMI who otherwise met a criterion for cognitive normality. The Short Blessed Test (SBT) was used as a measure of general cognitive function; conservative (SBT = 5) and permissive (SBT = 10) cutoff scores were used as indicators of cognitive normality. With the more permissive measure of cognitive normality, 59 (29%) of the 202 individuals met AAMI criteria. Progression to dementia by 3 years occurred in 42% of AAMI individuals versus 16% of the individuals who did not meet AAMI criteria. With the more restrictive SBT cutoff of 5, 22% of individuals met AAMI criteria; progression to dementia occurred in 31% of these individuals versus 9% of the individuals without AAMI. Survival times to dementia differed significantly between AAMI and non-AAMI groups defined by either cutoff score. Our findings indicate that individuals with AAMI have a three-fold greater risk for development of dementia than individuals who do not meet AAMI criteria. Hence, AAMI may represent a dementia prodrome rather than a benign variant of aging.",

It was found that the formation of the amyloid-microglia complex seems to be a relatively early pathogenic event that precedes the process of severe destruction of the neuropil. The idea that inflammation is implicated in Alzheimer pathology has received support from the epidemiologic studies indicating that the use of anti-inflammatory drugs can prevent or retard the Alzheimer disease process.

    "abstract": "We studied the utility of a \"vignette method\" to assess mental competency for decision making on medical treatment and research participation. A vignette is a description of an imaginary situation in which the subject is asked to decide on a proposed treatment or on participation in research. His or her understanding of the situation and the quality of the reasoning underlying that choice are tested by a short series of questions. Subjects were participants in the Amsterdam Study of the Elderly (AMSTEL), a population-based study on cognitive decline and dementia. The sample consisted of elderly people (70–90 years), who were cognitively intact (n = 176) or had a dementia syndrome (n = 64; mostly Alzheimer disease). Dementia was diagnosed using the Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of the Elderly (CAMDEX) schedule. Two vignettes were used as competency assessment instruments. The answers to the vignette questions were summed to form a competency score. The reliability (internal consistency) of this score was 0.82 for both vignettes combined. After dichotomization into competent/incompetent (cutoff at the fifth centile of the control group), the agreement between the vignette method and a physician's judgment of competency was poor (k = 0.36) in the demented group. There was no agreement whatsoever when subjects with \"minimal dementia\" (n = 14) were left out of this analysis (k = 0.04). As expected, mean competency scores declined with increasing dementia severity. A multiple regression analysis showed that mental competency as measured by the vignette method was determined mainly by recent memory, expressive language, and abstract thinking. In the control group the competency score was only slightly related to education (r = 0.12) and verbal intelligence (r = 0.27). We conclude that the vignette method is a reliable and valid method for the assessment of mental competency in elderly people with cognitive decline. The vignette method is preferred over a physician's judgment, especially in patients with early dementia.",

However, although dementia effects cognitive functions essential for safe driving, the evaluation of driving competence in demented persons is problematic. A clear-cut policy, intended chiefly for primary care physicians, is still lacking. In recognition of this fact, the Swedish National Road Administration invited a group of researchers to review existing research and to formulate a consensus on the issue of driving and dementia. The consensus group suggested that physicians should routinely make a cursory evaluation of the mental condition of their older driving patients. When signs of cognitive impairment are detected, possible influence on visuospatial skills, attention, judgment, and memory functions should be carefully considered. Information from caregivers on past and current driving performance as well as functions relating to activities of daily living (ADL) should be taken into account. Consensus was reached that a diagnosis of moderate to severe dementia indicates sufficient cognitive impairment to preclude driving. In addition, diagnosed mildly demented individuals or nondiagnosed cognitively impaired individuals with functional deterioration should be considered for specialized assessment of driving competence.",

The outreach worker was from the community, aware of the health care needs of the elderly, and had a relationship with existing elderly community groups. Several methods were used to recruit patients. These included one-on-one discussions, posters, existing relationships with elderly groups, and direct phone calls.

    "abstract": "A variety of proteins known to be involved in inflammatory processes are associated with lesions in chronic neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This is particularly true of AD, in which inflammatory reactions are believed to be important contributors to the neuronal loss. Inflammatory proteins associated with AD include complement proteins, complement inhibitors, acute-phase reactants, inflammatory cytokines, proteases, and protease inhibitors. Studies of cultured human astro-cytes and microglia obtained from postmortem brain have established that almost all of these proteins are produced by one or the other of these two cell types. Human neurons also produce many inflammatory proteins and their inhibitors, creating complex interactions. Accumulations of amyloid, extracellular tangles, or Lewy bodies apparently act as irritants, causing the activation of complement, the initiation of reactive changes in microglia, and the release of potentially neurotoxic products such as the membrane attack complex, oxygen free radicals, and excess glutamate. A number of epidemiologic studies indicate that populations taking anti-inflammatory drugs have a sharply reduced prevalence of AD. One small clinical trial with indo-methacin showed arrest of the disease over a 6-month period. Therapeutic intervention in key inflammatory processes holds great promise for the amelioration of AD and possibly other neurodegenerative disorders.",

Although the term mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is popular, its prevalence and neuropsychological features have not been fully investigated.

For normal aging, the effects of age and educational level on cognitive performance were examined. We examined 1501 older residents (46.8%) in Tajiri 65 years of age and older. They performed the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI). Depressive scores and subjective memory complaints were also evaluated. There was no age effect but an educational effect on cognitive performance in healthy adults. We found the overall prevalence of CDR 0.5 to be 30.2%, whereas that of MCI was only 4.9%. All CASI domains were deteriorated except for long-term memory and visual construction in the CDR 0.5 participants compared with healthy adults, suggesting that CDR 0.5 is similar to very mild Alzheimer disease. Memory complaints' data suggested that it would be better to exclude memory complaints from the MCI criteria. We considered that the concept of CDR 0.5 would be more applicable to community residents rather than that of the MCI.",

    "abstract": "Impaired cholinergic function in the central nervous system is an early feature of Alzheimer disease (AD). Currently, cholinergic deficit is usually corrected by increasing the amount of acetylcholine in the synapse by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE). One of the most consistent cholinergic deficits in AD is the reduced expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) in the brain. Since these receptors are essential for learning and memory, restoring nicotinic cholinergic function is a promising approach to treating AD. Allosteric modulation of nAChR is a novel approach, which circumvents development of tolerance through long-term use of conventional nicotinic agonists. Allosteric modulators interact with receptor-binding sites distinct from those capable of recognizing the natural agonist. Positive allosteric modulation of nAChR activity has no effect on conductance of single channels; instead, by facilitating channel opening, it potentiates responses evoked by the interaction of the natural agonist with presynaptic and postsynaptic nAChR. Allosteric modulation of nAChR activity could therefore potentially produce a significant benefit in AD. One such allosteric modulator is galantamine. In addition to increasing nAChR activity, galantamine also inhibits AChE. This novel, dual mechanism of action distinguishes galantamine from many other AChE inhibitors. Galantamine has been shown to improve cognitive and daily function for at least 6 months in placebo-controlled trials, and to maintain these functions at baseline levels for at least 12 months in a 6-month open-label extension study. Galantamine has positive effects on nAChR expression, which are likely to contribute to its sustained efficacy in the treatment of AD patients.",

    "abstract": "Summary: EEG brain mapping has been proven to be a valuable method in diagnostic and therapeutic assessment in dementia trials, because it is a readily available, inexpensive, high time-resolution method for objective and quantitative evaluation of the neurophysiological aspects of dementias. In 111 mildly to moderately demented patients diagnosed according to DSM-III as both degenerative [senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT)] and vascular [multi-infarct dementia (MID) type], we were interested in showing not only differences between SDAT and MID patients and normal controls but also the relationship between CT scans, EEG maps, clinical ratings and psychometric tests. CT measures included 10 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space variables as well as 17 cortical density measures (1.7 mm3 cubes. Hounsfield units). Clinical investigations consisted of the SCAG score/factors, the digit symbol substitution test, the trailmaking test and the digit span forward test. In brain maps, SDAT patients showed slightly to moderately more slow and less α and β activity as well as a slowing of the dominant frequency (DF) and the centroid (C) than did normal controls. These findings were most prominent in parietal and temporal regions. MID patients exhibited markedly augmented δ /θ and attenuated α and β activity and a slowing of the DF and C. These neurophysiological findings suggest a deterioration of vigilance. Differences between SDAT and MID patients were found mostly in measures concerning differences in the maps. Brain maps of correlation coefficients between CT and EEG variables demonstrated: the greater the anterior horn distance, lateral ventricle distance, and Evan's index, as well as the less cortical density, the more δ/θ and the less α and β activity in the EEG. Moreover, the higher the δ/θ, the less α and β activity, the higher the SCAG scores, and the worse the psychometric performance. From the pharmacological point of view, we observed a significant improvement in vigilance after administration of several nootropic drugs both in normal and pathologically aging subjects, which was associated also with improvement of psychopathometric scores. Based on multi-variante analysis of variance (MANOVA)/Hotlelling T2we observed a drug's effect in different brain regions of MID and SDAT patients. Thus, pharmaco-EEG map- ping mediates valuable information regarding if, how, when, in which dosage, and where a nootropic drug acts on its target organ—the aging human brain",

The pilot project used a single subject design and activity monitoring as the primary outcome measures. The protocol consisted of a 5-day baseline monitoring period, followed by 10 consecutive days of phototherapy (2,000 lux of full spectrum bright light) delivered by light visors for 2 hours each morning; this was followed by an additional 14 days of activity monitoring. Cosinor analyses found no consistent changes in acrophase, mesor, or amplitude. Observed changes in acrophase were consistent with phase advancement of the rest-activity cycle and consistent with the biological intervention. Changes in the number of nighttime awakenings were not found. One subject had a significant increase in total sleep time, whereas another had a significant decrease in total sleep time. Failure to find a consistent biological effect of light on AD subjects may be secondary to: (1) insufficient duration of light exposure; (2) timing of light administration (given at a time when circadian rhythm is refractory to the effects of light); (3) advanced stages of AD making the Y circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus insensitive to the biological effects of light; and (4) inadequacy of light visors as a means of providing light.",

In addition to describing the models, this article also reports on the target group for which these models were developed, the degree to which they have been operationalized for psychogeriatrics, and the degree to which they have been subjected to empirical testing. This study shows that all psychosocial models described may be called emotion-oriented, although they also contain, in varying degrees, elements from the consequences model. It was found that the models are used not only as a theoretical framework for research, but also in the provision of care. Despite the fact that most models have been used in the psychogeriatric field, therefore proving their practicability for psychogeriatric practice, only one of the models described has been tested empirically so far. The theoretical validity of the models in question is, therefore, not yet clear.",

Fifty-three consecutive outpatients were assessed with an ezxtensive workup and followed up for 6 months in a specialized clinic for the diagnosis and management of dementia. Thirty eight (71%) were finally diagnosed as demented. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) had a slightly greater diagnostic power than did the S-IQCODE and the SS-IQCODE (sensitivity 89% vs. 84% and 79%; specificity 80% vs. 73% for both; positive predictive value 92% vs. 89% and 88%; negative predictive value 75% vs. 65% and 58%), but without statistical significance. Both the S-IQCODE and SS-IQCODE were independent of previous education of the patients. The best diagnostic results were obtained when the cognitive scores of the patient in the MMSE and the report of the relative in the S-IQCODE were simultaneously considered. We conclude that the IQCODE, in a complete as well as in a shortened form, is a good diagnostic instrument in the clinical setting that can enhance the validity of other cognitive tests.",

    "abstract": "Neuropsychological testing is important for the diagnosis and follow-up of dementia; it can also help provide consultation on patient care. However, lengthy testing is costly and can be stressful to the subjects. Tests developed for members of the majority culture often are inappropriate for ethnic minorities, especially those who speak a different language, have little or no formal education, and grew up in vastly different circumstances. Variables that directly affect test performance, such as education and acculturation instead of race or ethnicity, should be considered as explanatory variables for test performance. Reading level may be a better index for educational attainment than the number of years in school. Neuropsychological testing can be improved in several directions: (1) Use tests that are appropriate for the subject's background. (2) Use detailed scoring of a smaller number of test items to reduce test time, and establish discontinuation rules to limit the subject's experience of failure. (3) Develop parallel test forms for repeated assessment of the same individuals. (4) Strive for large and representative standardization samples. (5) Use computerized test norms based on findings of statistical analysis to better adjust for confounding variables.",

Eight measures of discourse were used: total words, information units, conciseness, circumlocutions, frustrations, aborted phrases, revisions, and ideational repetitions. Information units, which decreased with increased dementia severity, proved to be the best measure for evaluating the effects of AD on oral descriptive discourse. The conciseness index also decreased with increased dementia severity, and a significantly greater proportion of AD discourse samples contained ideational repetitions. Circumlocutions and frustrations rarely occurred, and although the discourse of AD subjects was more likely to contain an aborted phrase, the frequency of aborted phrases did not vary by stage of dementia. Revisions were commonly observed in the discourse of both normal controls and AD subjects and did not differentiate the two groups",

We applied magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) criteria based on research criteria for SIVD in a large cohort of patients with ischemic stroke. We compared clinical features of patients with SIVD and patients with other stroke type. Subject and Methods The study group comprised 337 of 486 consecutive patients aged 55 to 85 years who 3 months after ischemic stroke completed a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery and MRI, including structured medical, neurologic, and laboratory evaluations; clinical mental status examination; interview of a knowledgeable informant; detailed history of risk factors; and evaluation of stroke type, localization, and syndrome. Results Patients with SIVD (n = 86) more often had a history of progressive cognitive decline (22.8% vs. 6.9%, P = 0.0002), walking disorder before stroke (27.9% vs. 2.0%, P = 0.02), and urinary difficulties (12.8% vs. 5.6%, P = 0.028) in comparison with patients with other stroke type (n = 251). Of the study population, 107 (31.8%) had DSM-III dementia. The patients with SIVD more often had DSM-III dementia (40.7% vs. 28.7%, P = 0.04), had less severe stroke as measured by Scandinavian Stroke Scale (56.6 vs. 55.1, P = 0.03), were more dependent in activities of daily living (ADL) functions as measured by FAQ scale (8.9 vs. 5.4, P = 0.001), were more dependent in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) functions as measured by the Lawton scale (5.5 vs. 6.3, P = 0.01), and were more depressed as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (11.8 vs. 8.4, P = 0.0003) poststroke than the patients without SIVD. The main cognitive domain that differentiated the patients with SIVD from those without was executive dysfunction (51.2% vs. 38.7%, P = 0.04). According to multiple regression model, apractic-atactic gait disorder (odds ratio 2.82, 95% confidence interval 1.21–6.53), ADL functions (odds ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 1.01–1.08), and the Beck Depression Inventory (odds ratio 1.05, 95% confidence interval 1.02–1.09) related to SIVD. Conclusions The most significant clinical features of MRI-defined SIVD were found to be apractic-atactic gait, impaired ADL functions, and depression.",

The quality of the haptic reproductions differed significantly between CO and MCI, as well as between CO and MDE. The statistical comparison between EEG theta-power under rest condition and theta-power during haptic tasks revealed a significant decrease in theta-power during haptic tasks in all three groups over parieto-occipital regions. During haptic tasks, the theta-power was significantly different between CO and MDE over occipital regions and over parieto-temporal regions. A significant difference between CO and MCI was only revealed over right occipital regions (O2). Spectral theta-power during haptic tasks is a suitable measure to distinguish healthy subjects (CO) from patients with MCI respectively MDE.

A VAD diagnosis was chosen when the patients showed dementia in combination with transitory ischemic attacks (TIA), stroke episodes, or other pronounced vascular diseases judged to be causally related to the dementia. Computed tomography (CT) white matter lesions were shown to occur frequently (85%); a pronounced decrease in myelin lipids was common in subcortical white matter; a frontosubcortical symptom complex was the prevailing clinical pattern; and an overall increased albumin ratio without relation to TIA/stroke was noted, indicating blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. When infarcts were present, they appeared to be endpoint manifestations of the vascular pathology rather than the cause of the disease. Today, thromboembolism with multiple cerebral infarcts is considered more or less the only pathogenetic substrate of VAD, with multi-infarct dementia (MID) as its clinical counterpart. Our findings suggest that subcortical white matter changes are another important VAD substrate.",

    "abstract": "Summary: The potential usefulness of cholinergic replacement therapy for Alzheimer disease (AD) is dependent upon retention of postsynaptic muscarinic receptors and their transduction mechanisms long after the degeneration of cholinergic nerves. The receptors most clearly associated with cholinergic cerebral excitation are ml muscarinic receptors, which work via a G protein to activate phospholipase C. The ability of these receptors to couple to their associated G protein was assessed in the middle temporal gyrus of postmortem brains from persons with and without AD. A low concentration of [3H]- pirenzepine (1 nM) was used to label ml receptors preferentially. The affinity of the agonist, oxotremorine-M, for labeled receptors and the ability of these receptors to couple with G protein were assessed by competition between the agonist and 1 nM [3H]-pirenzepine in the presence and absence of guanine nucleotide. Brain tissue from 7 patients with AD and five age-matched controls showed very similar levels of labeled receptors, agonist affinities for the highand low-affinity states of ml receptors, and guanine nucleotide-sensitive high-affinity binding. It is concluded that the coupling of ml receptors to G protein is adequate to permit responses to exogenous muscarinic drugs in AD.",

MMSE scores were entered as covariates in a general linear model that predicted the gray matter density at each cortical surface point. The results were corrected for multiple comparisons by permutation testing. The global permutation-corrected significance for the maps linking gray matter loss and cognitive decline was P=0.005 for the left and P=0.012 for the right hemisphere. Strongest correlations between MMSE score and gray matter integrity were seen in the entorhinal, parahippocampal, precuneus, superior parietal, and subgenual cingulate/orbitofrontal cortices. Significant correlations were also seen bilaterally in the temporal, the middle frontal and the left angular and supramarginal gyri. As a global cognitive measure, MMSE depends on the integrity of widely distributed cortical areas in both brain hemispheres with left-sided predominance.",

We studied the properties of a Chinese version of FAB (CFAB) in evaluating executive dysfunction among Chinese stroke patients with small subcortical infarct. Methods: Concurrent validity was evaluated using Wisconsin Card Sorting Tst (WCST) and Mattis Dementia Rating Scale–Initiation/Perseveration Subset (MDRS I/P) among 41 controls and 30 stroke patients with small subcortical infarct. Discriminant validities of CFAB and its subitems were compared with those of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Internal consistency, test-retest, and interrater reliability of CFAB were evaluated. Results: The CFAB had low to good correlation with various executive measures: MDRS I/P (r = 0.63, p < 0.001), number of category completed (r = 0.45, p < 0.001), and number of perseverative errors (r = −0.37, p < 0.01) of WCST. Among the executive measures, only number of category completed had significant but small contribution (6.5%, p = 0.001) to the variance of CFAB. A short version of CFAB using three items yielded higher overall classification accuracy (86.6%) than that of CFAB full version (80.6%) and MMSE (77.6%). Internal consistency (alpha = 0.77), test-retest reliability (rho = 0.89, p < 0.001), and interrater reliability (rho = 0.85, p < 0.001) of CFAB were good. Conclusion: Although CFAB is reliable, it is only moderately valid in evaluating executive dysfunction among Chinese stroke patients with small subcortical infarct. The clinical use of CFAB in the evaluation of executive dysfunction among this group of patients cannot be recommended at this stage.",

Happiness and sadness, fundamental emotions that are easily recognized across cultures, were evaluated. Results were further analyzed in relation to demographic, clinical, and neuropsychologic characteristics.A test exploring recognition of facial emotions using chimeric faces based on Jaynes' happy and sad faces was administered to 71 patients with probable AD.The ability to identify positive and negative facial emotions was largely preserved in AD subjects. Impaired recognition of facial emotions was found in 27%. Poor test performance was associated with low scores on constructional praxis and nonverbal memory tasks.Decoding of emotional facial expressions seems to be differently affected in relation to patients' neuropsychologic profile, as poor test performance closely correlated with nonverbal cognitive impairment. This emotion-discrimination disorder likely characterizes the behavior of a subset of AD patients with predominant right-hemisphere dysfunction. A preserved ability to process the emotional features of faces may have an important role in the management of demented patients, and suggests the use of nonverbal communication as an integrative/alternative system.

Decline in activities of daily living may be mediated by executive and frontal lobe dysfunction. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between activities of daily living and pathologic burden in Alzheimer disease. Twenty two subjects with definite Alzheimer disease were selected from the UCLA ADRC neuropathology database. A total activities of daily living score was derived from the Retrospective Collateral Dementia Interview-Revised (RCDI-R) questionnaire, which was administered to caregivers of autopsied subjects included in the study. Neuritic plaque (NP) and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) counts were performed for 8 brain regions.

Total activities of daily living score did not correlate with age at death, age at symptom onset, dementia duration, gender, or education. Deteriorating activities of daily living in Alzheimer Disease subjects correlate with greater overall pathologic burden and possibly selectively with involvement of the medial temporal, occipital, and orbital frontal regions.",

    "abstract": "Background Amnestic mild cognitive impairment represents, in many cases, the earliest clinical phases of Alzheimer disease. Anti-inflammatory agents have epidemiologic support as drugs potentially beneficial in Alzheimer disease. In vivo studies have shown that Triflusal and its active metabolite 2-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethyl-benzoic acid have potent anti-inflammatory actions in the central nervous system. Methods We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of Triflusal in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive 900 mg of Triflusal or placebo for 18 months. The primary outcome was a change in Cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale; conversion to dementia was a secondary outcome. Results A slow rate of recruitment forced a premature cessation of the study. Two hundred and fifty-seven subjects were enrolled and followed-up for an average of 13 months. The significance level was not reached for the primary outcome even though a trend in favor of Triflusal was observed. However, there was a significant difference in the probability of progression to dementia of Alzheimer's type with a lower risk in the Triflusal compared with the placebo group (hazard ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-4.01; P=0.024). Conclusions In this study, Triflusal therapy was associated with a significant lower rate of conversion to dementia that is likely to be clinically relevant. Because the trial was prematurely halted, these results should be interpreted with caution and require further confirmation.",

The current study evaluated social/cognitive explanations for perceived AD threat beyond genetic relatedness, including personal experience with AD, belief in negative aging stereotypes, and performance on delayed memory tasks. Participants were 97 healthy older adults aged 50 to 85, self-referred for a free community memory screen. Results showed that, as expected, personal AD experience was related to perceived AD threat. Furthermore, consistent with expectations, AD experience moderated the relationship between perceived AD threat and other explanatory variables, including age, belief in negative aging stereotypes, and cognitive performance. In those with AD experience, whether genetic or not, younger age was associated with more perceived AD threat, but an inverse relationship was seen in those without AD experience. Those with genetic AD experience seem particularly vulnerable to the effects of negative age stereotype beliefs on perceived AD threat, and show an inverse relationship between their actual cognitive performance and their perception of personal AD threat. Results highlight the importance of considering personal experience with AD when assessing a person's self-reported concerns about AD or his/her own memory changes.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary dysphasic disinhibition dementia (HDDD) describes a familial disorder characterized by personality changes, and language and memory deficits. The neuropathology includes frontotemporal lobar atrophy, neuronal loss and gliosis and, in most cases, abundant Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). A Pick/Alzheimer's spectrum was proposed for the original family (HDDD1). Here we report the clinicopathologic case of an HDDD1 individual using modern immunohistochemical methods, contemporary neuropathologic diagnostic criteria to distinguish different frontotemporal lobar degenerations (FTLDs), and progranulin (PRGN) mutation analysis. Clinical onset was at age 62 years with personality changes and disinhibition, followed by nonfluent dysphasia, and memory loss that progressed to muteness and total dependence with death at age 84 years. There was severe generalized brain atrophy (weight=570 g). Histopathology showed superficial microvacuolation, marked neuronal loss, gliosis, and ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative cytoplasmic and intranuclear neuronal inclusions in frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices. There were also frequent neuritic plaques and NFTs in parietal and occipital cortices. The case met neuropathologic criteria for both FTLD with ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclusions (FTLD-U), and Alzheimer disease (Braak NFT stage V). We discovered a novel pathogenic PGRN mutation c.5913 A>G (IVS6-2 A>G) segregating with FTLD-U in this kindred. In conclusion, HDDD1 is an FTLD-U caused by a PGRN mutation and is neuropathologically heterogeneous with Alzheimer disease as a common comorbidity.",

Methods We assessed levels of total tau protein (τT), tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (τP-181), and β-amyloid1-42 (Aβ42) in 34 patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), 76 Alzheimer disease (AD) cases, and 93 controls (CTRL). Double sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Innogenetics) were used for measurements. Results Total τ was significantly increased and Aβ42 decreased in FTLD and AD patients as compared with CTRL. CSF τP-181 levels were significantly increased only in AD. The τT/Aβ42 ratio successfully discriminated FTLD from CTRL with a 86.7% specificity and 80.6% sensitivity, whereas the τT alone was more specific (95.7%) but less sensitive (64.75%). For the discrimination of FTLD from AD, τT/Aβ42 ratio was better (90.3% sensitivity and 64.5% specificity) compared with the other biomarkers alone or in combination, whereas τP-181 was less sensitive but more specific (68.4% and 85.7%, respectively).

The presence of LB was associated with significantly lower numbers of neurofibrillary tangles as compared with cases of AD without LB, whereas the mean density of neuritic plaques remained unchanged. Two possibilities are discussed to explain these findings. First, the high frequency of LB in AD may reflect a predisposition of AD patients to develop idiopathic Parkinson disease. Second, the LB may represent a nonspecific cytoskeletal change in selected vulnerable neuronal populations in some subjects with AD, rather than the presence of a second pathological process.",

    "abstract": "The protection of neurons from damage and death in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer disease (AD), is a major challenge for neuroscientists in the 21st century. The amyloid β-protein plays an important role in the degenerative process of the disease and increases the vulnerability of cultured cortical neurons to glutamate neurotoxicity. Glutamate may, therefore, play an important role in amyloid β-protein-induced cytotoxicity in the cerebral cortex. Results show that cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil protect cortical neurons against glutamate neurotoxicity via α4β2 and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at least partly by inhibiting the process of apoptosis. Donepezil also protects against ischemic insults such as those seen in vascular dementia; however, this does not seem to be mediated by nicotinic receptors. This review summarizes data that suggest donepezil possesses neuroprotective actions in addition to amelioration of cognitive deficits by inhibition of acetylcholinesterase.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, affecting 1 in 100 individuals over the age of 60. Dementia in the setting of PD (PDD) may be among the most debilitating symptoms associated with disease progression. Estimates of cognitive decline and dementia in PD suggest that up to 14% per year of patients over age 65 with PD will develop some cognitive impairment. Unfortunately, PDD is not well characterized and the relationship of PDD to Alzheimer disease remains unclear. PDD has been proposed as part of a spectrum with dementia with Lewy bodies, and PDD and dementia with Lewy bodies frequently coexist with Alzheimer disease. It is uncertain, however, whether there is a meaningful distinction between the different disorders. It has also been difficult to gain understanding of the interaction of motor and nonmotor symptoms that affect quality of life in PD and confound cognitive and psychomotor performance. This review will examine the clinical, cognitive, neuropsychiatric features of cognitive deficits associated with PD, discuss their pathologic basis and propose avenues for future research.",

Two types of primary prevention trials have been conducted in AD to date: trials in independent cohorts specifically recruited for an AD primary prevention trial and cohorts in other studies randomized to a drug of interest where appropriate cognitive measures can be added. There have been numerous difficulties in conducting primary prevention trials in AD because of the need for a large sample size, long length of poor follow up, and adverse event profile or toxicity of the agents being studied. Many primary prevention trials are ongoing. However, to date, no primary prevention trial has successfully delayed the development of AD. Future primary prevention trials for AD will need to carefully consider issues of safety, tolerability, ability to follow subjects over long periods of time, methods of collecting data, and strategies to enhance recruitment to carry out such trials.",

    "abstract": "A core component of social functioning is the capacity to attribute mental states to others and to understand intention as psychologic cause. The hypothesis of this study was that dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) patients show an impaired understanding of psychologic cause although they remain able to understand physical causality.To test this hypothesis, 20 elderly adults with DAT, 20 healthy age-matched controls, and 20 healthy young adults were presented a cartoon task requiring them to process physical or psychologic cause of events.Patients with DAT at onset scored significantly lower than controls when they had to reason about psychologic causation, while they did not differ for reasoning about physical causation. Consistent with these results, patients with DAT showed significantly lower scores in psychologic reasoning as compared with their scores for physical causality. Instead young and elderly healthy adults scored similarly for the 2 types of causality and the 2 groups did not differ in their scores. These results suggest that impaired understanding of intention in others may be considered as an early socio-cognitive index of onset of DAT. A post hoc division of the group of patients with DAT into 2 subgroups according to Mini Mental State (MMS) scores showed that the group with the more severe MMS scores not only had lower scores for psychologic causality but also showed impairment in reasoning about physical causality involving persons. Physical causality involving objects remained relatively preserved.The remarkable deficit in attribution of intention in our patients with DAT at onset and the following deterioration of their performance in reasoning about physical causality with persons may reflect progressive dysfunction of the superior temporal sulcus in Alzheimer disease.",

The aim of this study was to establish the validity, reliability, and discriminative properties of the Korean version of the AD8 (K-AD8). Evaluation was made on 155 patient-informant dyads. The K-AD8 scores with the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and performance on neuropsychologic tests were compared. Internal consistency of the K-AD8 was significant (Cronbach α=0.88). The K-AD8 had strong correlation with CDR (Spearman ρ=0.76). Concurrent validity was strong with the K-AD8 scores correlating with CDR domains and performance on neuropsychologic tests. The K-AD8 was found to have excellent test-retest reliability (weighted κ=0.81) and good interrater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.89). The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.88, suggesting good discrimination between nondemented individuals and those with cognitive impairment. To distinguish CDR 0.5 from CDR 0, in particular, the K-AD8 (cutoff score of 2) had a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 90%. In conclusion, the K-AD8 is a sensitive screening tool in detecting very early dementia, indicating that the AD8 could work very well in a variety of cultural entities.",

Epidemiologic studies of CIND, however, are limited in China. The goal of our study was to determine the prevalence and distribution of CIND in the aged population and analyze socio-demographic factors. To accomplish this, we performed cluster random sampling of 6192 people aged over 65 years in Taiyuan, a metropolitan city located in northern China. Socio-demographic factors were surveyed by self-administered questionnaires. Neuropsychologic testing consisting of the Mini-Mental State Examination, Boston Naming Test, Trail Making Tests A and B, Block Design, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Visual Reproduction, Logical Memory, letter and category fluency, the National Adult Reading Test, the Geriatric Depression Scale, and the \"state\" section of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was also obtained. Pearson χ2 statistics and odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals were used to identify the relationship between CIND and socio-demographic factors. Logistic regression modeling was undertaken to identify potential risk factors. Results showed that an overall prevalence of CIND was 9.70% (95% confidence intervals: 9.62%-9.77%). Univariate analyses showed that the prevalence of CIND differed significantly according to age, sex, education level, monthly household income, and marital status (P<0.01), but not by occupational achievement (P>0.05). In a multiple logistic regression analysis, age, sex, marital status, educational level, and occupation were significantly associated with increased risk for CIND (P<0.01). This study confirms the high prevalence of CIND among the elderly population of China, similar to previous epidemiologic studies in other countries. Nearly all socio-demographic characteristics are associated with CIND. The putative risk factors identified merit further study.",

Age-standardized rates were calculated by year, age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, marital status, and geography. AD mortality increased 31% from 1999 to 2004. AD rates were higher in the northwest and the southeast. Stroke mortality shows a similar pattern; the correlation in state rates between stroke and AD is 0.79.

Both less education and single marital status were associated with higher rates. The correlation between state rates for stroke and AD mortality could be due to artifacts of coding, or a true relationship, given that stroke is a risk factor for subsequent AD. Although AD mortality in the United States has been increasing over time it is not known whether incidence is increasing, due to lack of recent incidence data. AD reporting on death certificates is known to be poor. This is the first analysis of recent trends in AD mortality since the advent of ICD-10.",

Design and Methods The objective of the present study was to carry out a metric analysis of a Chinese version of ZBI using a cross-sectional study. Patients and their caregivers completed a variety of questionnaires, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). Cronbach α coefficient was used to assess inter-item consistency, and a split half correlation coefficient was used to determine the internal consistency of the ZBI. Correlations between the ZBI and GDS, and the ZBI and HAMA were assessed for convergent validity. Correlations of the ZBI and MMSE, the ZBI and NPI were also calculated to evaluate the possible correlation of caregiver burden with the severity of cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Results There were 42 patients with dementia in the study. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.89 and the split half correlation coefficient was 0.87. The mean ZBI score was 24.40±14.68. Item-total (corrected) correlation showed significant coefficients (rs>0.33, P<0.05) for most items. There was a significant correlation between the ZBI and GDS (rs=0.57, P<0.001), and between the ZBI and HAMA (rs=0.44, P=0.003). Furthermore, there was a significant positive correlation between the ZBI and NPI, the ZBI and the agitation score, the ZBI and the apathy score, and the ZBI and MMSE. Conclusions The Chinese version of ZBI meets some of the basic reliability and validity standards required for health status measures. Further studies could lead to a better understanding of the difficulties experienced by caregivers of patients suffering from dementia in China.",

These symptoms occur as the result of cell loss in discrete areas of the brain, the frontal and/or anterior temporal lobes. Little is known about effective management of the behavioral symptoms that result from this disease. The purpose of this paper is to describe a model that could be used in the assessment and potential management of frontotemporal lobar degeneration behavioral symptoms.

The present study was undertaken to determine the roles of Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular pathology in mediating the effect of apolipoprotein E (APOE)-ε4 alleles on dementia. Clinicopathologic correlations were studied in 267 Catholic sisters participating in the Nun Study. The extent to which AD and vascular pathologies mediated the effect of APOE-ε4 on dementia was investigated using multiple logistic regression. Adjusted for age at death and education, possession of 1 or more ε4 alleles was an important risk factor for dementia (odds ratio=2.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.62-5.48). This association was lost (odds ratio=1.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-2.80) when an index of the severity of AD-related neuropathology was added to the model, but changed little when measures of the severity of vascular pathology were added. The findings suggest that the effect of ε4 on dementia is mediated by the severity of AD pathology. Although infarcts and atherosclerosis contribute to the occurrence of dementia, this contribution seems unrelated to APOE genotype.",

In an open, 3-year, nonrandomized, prospective, multicenter study in a routine clinical setting, 790 patients were treated with either donepezil, rivastigmine, or galantamine. At baseline and every 6 months, they were assessed with several rating scales including Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), Physical Self-Maintenance Scale (PSMS), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). A faster functional decline was associated with lower cognitive ability at baseline, older age, and the interaction of higher education and longer time in the study. The patients residing with a spouse or relative showed slower deterioration in IADL score. A higher mean dose of ChEI, regardless of drug agent, was also related to slower instrumental ADL decline. Prediction models for longitudinal functional outcome were provided. AD severity at baseline is a key factor in obtaining reliable clinical prognoses of the long-term ADL ability. The dosage of ChEI treatment could possibly lead to a different functional outcome.",

Our study objective was to examine the reliability and validity of the 2 common nutritional assessments (plasma nutrient biomarkers and Food Frequency Questionnaire) in the people at risk for dementia. Methods Thirty-eight elders, half with amnestic—mild cognitive impairment were recruited. Nutritional assessments were collected together at the baseline and again at 1 month. Intraclass and Pearson correlation coefficients quantified reliability and validity. Results Twenty-six nutrients were examined. The reliability was very good or better for 77% (20/26, intraclass correlation coefficients or ICC ≥0.75) of the plasma nutrient biomarkers and for 88% of the food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) estimates. Twelve of the nutrient biomarkers were as reliable as the commonly measured plasma cholesterol (ICC≥0.92). FFQ and plasma long-chain fatty acids (docosahexaenoic acid, r=0.39, eicosapentaenoic acid, r=0.39) and carotenoids (α-carotene, r=0.49; lutein + zeaxanthin, r=0.48; β-carotene, r=0.43; β-cryptoxanthin, r=0.41) were correlated, but these significant correlations were present only in non-impaired elders. Conclusion The reliability and validity of the FFQ and nutrient biomarkers vary according to the nutrient of interest. Memory deficit attenuates validity and inflates reliability of FFQ reports. Many plasma nutrient biomarkers have very good reliability over 1-month, regardless of memory state. This objective method can circumvent sources of error seen in other less direct and subjective methods of nutritional assessment.",

We therefore conducted a study with both a longitudinal and a co-twin control design in 2214 Swedish twins with clinical dementia evaluation and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotyping. The analyses were then replicated in a register-based cohort of 18,405 individuals. Results show that CVD increases the risk of AD in carriers (but not noncarriers) of the ApoE4 allele (hazard ratio 2.39, 95% confidence interval 1.15-4.96). CVD was also associated with an almost 2-fold increased risk of developing late-life dementia (hazard ratio 1.83, 95% confidence interval 1.23-2.72).

In conclusion, this study shows that (1) nonstroke CVD increases the risk of late-life dementia but that it is only a risk factor for AD in carriers of the ApoE4 allele and (2) the association between CVD and dementia is not explained by genetic or early life environmental factors in common to both disorders.",

Although prion diseases, in particular Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), are often suspected, many other nonprion diseases may present as RPD. Our aim was to review the causes of RPD in our center to better understand the underlying conditions. We reviewed clinical, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid data from patients with RPD admitted to our hospital from 1994 to 2009. Forty-nine patients (mean age at onset 72.4 y) with RPD were admitted to our center during the study period. The mean interval between the onset of symptoms and admission was 4.6 months. The final clinical diagnoses were as follows: nonprion neurodegenerative diseases (36.8%), CJD (30.6%), vascular dementia (8.2%), toxic-metabolic conditions (8.2%), and other disorders (16.2%). Among cases with informed death (n = 19), the average survival time was 8.6 ± 9.5 months. Survival was shorter among patients with prion disease (n = 10) than in those with other diagnoses (n = 9, P = 0.004). In conclusion, nonprion neurodegenerative diseases are the most common cause of RPD in our center. Our results suggest that although CJD is often suspected as a cause of RPD, its frequency depends on the referral differences across specialized centers.",

N-acetylaspartate (NAA) concentration of white matter was similar in all groups, whereas NAA concentration of gray matter showed a trend toward lower values in the right parietal lobe in AD compared with MCI and HC. A mIn increase in white matter in absence of significant NAA reduction suggests that mIn is a more robust and sensitive marker of white matter pathology in AD and MCI than NAA.

    "abstract": "We examined the improvement in statistical power that could be obtained in therapeutic trials for early (predementia) Alzheimer disease by constraining enrollment to individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and an atrophy pattern on a screening magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan previously found to be predictive of clinical decline, or to individuals with MCI and the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease. Treatable effects were defined as absolute change versus change relative to healthy controls (HCs). Data from 168 HC and 299 MCI participants were analyzed to determine sample sizes required to detect 25% slowing in mean rate of decline using global function, cognitive function, and structural measures as outcome variables. Reductions in estimated sample sizes of 10% to 43% were observed using the genetic enrichment strategy; reductions of 43% to 60% were observed with the neuroimaging enrichment strategy. Sample sizes needed to detect slowing in rate of atrophy in MCI relative to HC were dramatically larger than those needed to detect absolute change in atrophy rates. Constraining enrollment to MCI subjects with predictive atrophy on a screening MRI scan could improve the efficiency of clinical trials. Failure to take into account normal age-related changes risks under-powering trials designed to test disease-modifying properties of potential treatments.",

    "abstract": "Objective To investigate the frequency and causes of early-onset dementia (EOD) in consecutive patients in a highly specialized dementia referral center, focusing on unusual cases, particularly with early and/or rapid onset, in Athens, Greece. Methods Patients referred for dementia diagnosis according to specific referral criteria during a 3 years period. We examined the distribution of patients diagnosis and differences in sex, education, dementia severity, cognitive function, and the duration of disease (from onset to referral) between the EOD (<65 y) and the late-onset dementia (LOD) groups. Results From a total of 260 consecutive demented patients, there were 114 EOD patients or 44% of all demented patients. No significant differences were observed between the EOD and LOD groups in cognitive or behavioral measures. However, the duration from onset to consultation was significantly longer in the EOD group. Also, in the EOD group, the rates of patients with Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease dementia were relatively low and the rate of patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration was relatively high and the proportion of secondary dementias was high. Conclusions We conclude that EOD patients are more likely to be seen in specialized settings. The underlying diseases are considerably different in EOD compared with LOD. Secondary causes are often found in patients with EOD. Patients with EOD had an unexpectedly longer time-to-diagnosis than patients with LOD. This argues for a need of better education about the clinical presentation of dementia in the young and middle aged.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that persons with early dementia can give reliable and valid assessments about their own quality of life (QOL), thereby improving accuracy, and reducing the need for proxy informants. The objective of this study was to examine QOL in persons diagnosed with dementia (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder-IV) using a battery of subjective assessments including the new World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF). Persons with mild-to-moderate dementia (n=104) were recruited and interviewed at 6 Spanish centers to obtain sociodemographic information, health perceptions, depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale 15-item version), functional ability (Barthel Index), generic QOL (WHOQOL-BREF), and specific QOL (DEMQOL-28). Analysis was performed using classical psychometric methods. Internal consistency reliability for the WHOQOL-BREF domains ranged from moderate (0.54 for social) to good (0.79 for psychological). Test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation) ranged from moderate (0.51 for psychological) to good (0.70 for physical). Associations were confirmed between WHOQOL-BREF domains with DEMQOL-28, Geriatric Depression Scale 15-item version, and Barthel dimensions. With regard to contrasting groups' differences, WHOQOL-BREF scores significantly differentiated between healthy and unhealthy and depressed and nondepressed participants. This study is the first to report on the use of the WHOQOL-BREF in persons with mild-to-moderate dementia. These results indicate that it is a useful tool in assessing these groups, as it includes important dimensions commonly omitted from other dementia measures.",

Decision analytic models to support allocation of resources are often developed making use of cost-of-illness (COI) studies.

We aim to explore variables explaining the variation of (formal and informal) health care costs of cognitive disorders, using a broad spectrum of variables, including patient, caregiver, and social context variables.A bottom-up COI study design was used in which a societal viewpoint and a validated method to measure and value informal care was applied. Data were analyzed using univariate, multivariate, and forward regression analyses.The average 1-year health care sector costs were &OV0556;26,140 ($34,505 or £17,775) and &OV0556;11,931 ($15,749 or £8113) for patient and family. The analyses indicated that cognitive functioning, caregiver burden, patient sex, and instrumental activities of daily living were significantly associated with care costs independently.Cognitive functioning and instrumental activities of daily living are important variables to include in health care decision models. We recommend also including caregiver burden and patient sex in decision models for health policy decision makers to fully reflect the heterogeneity of the disease progression of cognitive disorders.",

These data suggest that the neuroinflammatory response to lumbar catheter placement differs between AD and control subjects.",

To examine this issue, we administered 3 sociocultural scales, the AD Knowledge Scale, and a Risk Perception questionnaire to 271 older African Americans who were recruited from a large community senior center and local churches. Higher Present Time Orientation was significantly related to perceptions of having little control over risks to health (P=0.004), God's Will in determining AD (P=0.001), and lower AD knowledge (P<0.0001) and marginally related to having little control over developing AD (P=0.052).

Post hoc intergroup comparisons found significant differences in the highest versus lowest scoring Religiosity groups. There were no significant differences by Future Time Orientation. Most subjects (57.6%) were unaware that African Americans were at higher risk for AD than whites. These data indicate that cultural diversity within older African Americans may shape health perceptions and knowledge of AD. This diversity may contribute to disparities in the detection and treatment of AD in this high-risk population.",

Apolipoprotein E genotyping was obtained from 149 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PPA, 330 cognitively healthy individuals (NC), and 179 patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease (PrAD). Allele frequencies were compared among the groups. Analyses were also completed by sex and in 2 subsets of PPA patients: 1 in which the patients were classified by subtype (logopenic, agrammatic, and semantic) and another in which pathologic data were available. The allele frequencies for the PPA group (ε2:5%, ε3:79.5%, and ε4:15.4%) showed a distribution similar to the NC group, but significantly different from the PrAD group. The presence of an ε4 allele did not influence the age of symptom onset or aid in the prediction of AD pathology in PPA. These data show that ε4 polymorphism, which is a well-known risk factor for AD pathology in typical amnestic dementias, has no similar relationship to the clinical syndrome of PPA or its association with AD pathology.",

    "abstract": "The red cell distribution width (RDW), a measure of anisocytosis, independently predicts cardiovascular disease outcomes and chronic disease mortality. Little is known about the RDW, or the interplay between RDW and anemia, in relation to dementia risk. We evaluated the association between the RDW and prevalent dementia, overall and by anemia status, among 2556 community-dwelling older adults participating in the Chicago Health and Aging Project. RDW measurements came from complete blood counts, and participants underwent diagnosis for dementia according to standard clinical criteria. Five hundred twenty-five participants were diagnosed with dementia. Elevated RDW was associated with increased odds of having dementia: after adjusting for age, sex, race, and education, the odds of prevalent dementia increased progressively over increasing quartile of RDW (Ptrend=0.02), and persons in the highest RDW quartile (≥14.8%) had 42% greater odds of having dementia than those in the lowest quartile [odds ratio (OR), 1.42; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.05-1.92)]. Per unit (%) increment in RDW, the odds of dementia were higher by 6% (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.00-1.13). Findings were similar upon further adjustment for health behaviors and diabetes. In analyses adjusted for hemoglobin concentration, the RDW-dementia association was attenuated, whereas the inverse association between hemoglobin and dementia remained significant. However, RDW was associated with dementia more strongly among participants without anemia (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.00-1.43) than among those with anemia (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.86-1.18), although this difference was not statistically significant. The RDW, a readily available and inexpensive hematologic measure, may offer novel information about dementia risk, particularly among persons without anemia. Future studies should establish the RDW's ability to predict risk prospectively.",

Hypertension was associated with cortical thinning in the frontal and perisylvian regions, and cortical thinning related to diabetes mellitus (DM) occurred in the frontal region. In path analyses, hypertension accounted for 0.04 of the frontal thinning with the mediation of WMH and 0.16 without the mediation of WMH. In case of DM, it accounted for 0.02 of the frontal thinning with the mediation of WMH and 0.13 without the mediation of WMH. Hypertension and DM predominantly affected frontal thinning both with and without the mediation of WMH, where the effects without the mediation of WMH were greater than those with the mediation of WMH.",

We tested whether actigraphy could be used to examine the relationship between total daily physical activity and motor function in community-dwelling older persons both with (n = 70) and without (n = 624) clinical dementia. Total daily activity was measured using actigraphy for a median of 9 (range: 2-16) days. All participants also underwent a structured examination, including 9 muscle strength and 9 motor performance measures summarized as a composite measure. In linear regression models controlling for age, sex, and education, total daily activity was associated with global motor scores (β = 0.13, SD = 0.01, P < 0.001). This association remained significant after adjusting for body composition, cognition, depressive symptoms, disability, vascular risk factors, and diseases (β = 0.07, SD = 0.01, P < 0.001). The association did not vary by dementia status (interaction P = 0.53). In persons without dementia, the association was independent of self-reported physical activity. Total daily activity was associated with both muscle strength (β = 0.10, SD = 0.02, P < 0.001) and motor performance (β = 0.16, SD = 0.02, P < 0.001). Actigraphy can be used in the community setting to provide objective measures of total daily activity that are associated with a broad range of motor performances. These associations did not vary by dementia status. Actigraphy may provide a means to more fully explicate the nature and course of motor impairment in old age.",

A previous study from the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA) validated a scheme for assessing the contribution of subcortical small vessel disease (SVD) toward dementia in the elderly by showing a significant inverse relationship between the severity of SVD and cognition in subjects without any other dementia pathology using this method. In the present paper, the method has been used to assess severity of SVD in 161 cases of neuropathologically confirmed Alzheimer disease. The results showed there was no relationship between the SVD score and cognitive scores acquired in the last 2 years of life. SVD scores were significantly related to age (P<0.0017) and were slightly but significantly higher in females than males (P<0.049). SVD scores were not related to blood pressure at entry to OPTIMA and were significantly lower when compared with the cohort of OPTIMA cases with only CVD (mean 5.06 ± 1.85 vs. 5.9 ± 2.67; P<0.0065). We conclude that when Alzheimer disease pathology is present in elderly subjects, it overwhelms the modest contribution that SVD makes to cognitive impairment.",

Regression analyses investigated associations between baseline pulse pressure (systolic−diastolic pressure) and cognition, total cerebral volume and temporal horn ventricular volume (as an index of smaller hippocampal volume) at follow-up, and longitudinal change in these measures. Interactions with APOE-ε4 and hypertension were assessed. Covariates included age, sex, education, assessment interval, and interim stroke. In the total sample, baseline pulse pressure was associated with worse executive ability, lower total cerebral volume, and greater temporal horn ventricular volume 5 to 7 years later, and longitudinal decline in executive ability and increase in temporal horn ventricular volume. Among APOE-ε4 carriers only, baseline pulse pressure was associated with longitudinal decline in visuospatial organization. Findings indicate arterial stiffening, indexed by pulse pressure, may play a role in early cognitive decline and brain atrophy in mid to late life, particularly among APOE-ε4 carriers.",

In joint longitudinal-survival models, those with baseline diabetes experienced faster cognitive decline (P=0.003) and higher mortality (hazards ratio=1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.48-2.38) than those without diabetes. Cognitive decline and mortality were similar for those with new-onset diabetes and those without diabetes. For a typical person, 3MSE scores declined by 2.3 points among those without diabetes and 4.3 points among those with baseline diabetes, during the last 6 years of study. Ignoring the impact of death yielded a 17.0% smaller estimate of the effect of baseline diabetes on cognitive decline. Analyses that overlook the association between cognitive decline and mortality may underestimate the effect of diabetes on cognitive aging.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence shows that subjective cognitive decline (SCD) without impairment on conventional neuropsychological tests may indicate increased risk for Alzheimer disease. Previous studies of mild cognitive impairment have demonstrated the potential role of prospective memory (PM) in the early detection of cognitive decline. We thus aimed to investigate the performance of people with SCD on PM tasks relative to their healthy controls (HCs). Forty-one participants with SCD and demographically matched HCs received regular cognitive testing as well as 2 single-trial naturalistic time-based and event-based PM tasks. Statistical analyses showed that the individuals with SCD performed worse on the time-based PM task, especially on the prospective component, when compared with their HCs. Our findings suggest that PM, especially the time-based one on the prospective component, may be an early cognitive marker of dementia. This implies an underlying difficulty among subjects with SCD in self-initiation that exacerbates their memory difficulties. Further investigation on a large scale is needed.",

Patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) were also analyzed as an intermediate stage between normal controls and AD. We found that the total functional connectivity of both the right and left hippocampus was maintained during aMCI and the early stages of AD and that it decreased in the later stages of AD. However, when total functional connectivity was broken down into specific regions of the brain, we observed increased or decreased connectivity to specific regions beginning with aMCI. Direct correlation analysis in seeding the left hippocampus revealed a significant decrease in the functional connectivity with the posterior cingulate cortex region and lateral parietal areas, and an increase in functional connectivity in and the anterior cingulate cortex beginning with aMCI. In this study, we were able to quantify the deterioration of resting-state hippocampal connectivity with disease severity and formation of compensatory recruitment in the early stages of AD.",

    "abstract": "Background/Aims: Early changes in cognitively demanding daily activities occur between normal cognition and the development of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). These real-world functional changes as early signals of cognitive change form a prime target for meaningful early detection of dementia. We examined whether passive aspects of responding to a remotely monitored weekly online questionnaire discriminated between older adults with and without MCI. Methods: Participants were 83 independent, community-dwelling older adults enrolled in a longitudinal study of in-home monitoring technologies, which included completion of a short weekly online questionnaire of health and life events. Results: In longitudinal analyses, time to complete the online questionnaire decreased over 1 year in both MCI and cognitively intact participants ( P &lt;0.01). MCI and intact participants did not differ in the time of day they submitted their questionnaires initially; however, over the course of 1 year MCI participants began to submit their questionnaires progressively later in the day and they needed greater assistance from staff as compared with intact participants ( P &lt;0.05). The online questionnaire performance measures were significantly correlated to conventional cognitive test scores ( P &lt;0.05) across the spectrum of normal cognition to MCI. Conclusions: Ambiently assessed, passive performance measures embedded within an online questionnaire are able to discriminate between normal cognition and MCI. Remote monitoring of cognitively demanding routine daily activities is a promising approach for ecologically valid real-world cognitive assessment.",

    "abstract": "Increased physical activity may protect against cognitive decline, the primary symptom of Alzheimer disease. In this study, we examined the relationship between physical activity and trajectories of cognitive functioning over serial assessments. Cognitively normal (Clinical Dementia Rating 0) middle-aged and older adults (N=173; mean age, 60.7 ± 7.8 y) completed a self-report measure of physical activity and a battery of standard neuropsychological tests assessing processing speed, attention, executive functioning, and verbal memory. At baseline, individuals with higher physical activity levels performed better on tests of episodic memory and visuospatial functioning. Over subsequent follow-up visits, higher physical activity was associated with small performance gains on executive functioning and working memory tasks in participants with one or more copies of the apolipoprotein ε4 allele (APOE4). In APOE4 noncarriers, slopes of cognitive performance over time were not related to baseline physical activity. Our results suggest that cognitively normal older adults who report higher levels of physical activity may have slightly better cognitive performance, but the potential cognitive benefits of higher levels of physical activity over time may be most evident in individuals at genetic risk for Alzheimer disease.",

All eligible patients aged 65 years and older, seen consecutively over 2 months by 1 family practice of 13 primary care physicians, were invited to participate. Patients with a diagnosis or previous work-up for dementia were excluded. Primary care physicians indicated whether they, the patient, or family had concerns about each patient's cognition.

However, accurately identifying those who are destined to develop MCI is difficult. Collecting biomarkers is often expensive.We used only noninvasive clinical variables collected in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Sets version 2.0 and applied machine learning techniques to build a low-cost and accurate Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) conversion prediction calculator. Cross-validation and bootstrap were used to select as few variables as possible accurately predicting MCI conversion within 4 years.A total of 31,872 unique subjects, 748 clinical variables, and additional 128 derived variables in NACC data sets were used. About 15 noninvasive clinical variables are identified for predicting MCI/aMCI/naMCI converters, respectively. Over 75% Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curves (ROC AUC) was achieved. By bootstrap we created a simple spreadsheet calculator which estimates the probability of developing MCI within 4 years with a 95% confidence interval.We achieved reasonably high prediction accuracy using only clinical variables. The approach used here could be useful for study enrichment in preclinical trials where enrolling participants at risk of cognitive decline is critical for proving study efficacy, and also for developing a shorter assessment battery.",

With respect to other MRI markers, adjusted for the presence of lacunar infarcts, the associations of ICS with both composite and domain-specific Z-scores, and significant cognitive impairment became nonsignificant; however, adjustment for other MRI markers did not alter these associations.

Titles and abstracts were screened and potentially relevant articles were reviewed in full. References of included studies and relevant reviews were searched. The database search returned 2166 results, 46 of which were finally included in the systematic review. These studies showed a general increase in inflammatory markers in the peripheral blood, most notably interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, and IL-10. Studies examining cerebrospinal fluid found IL-1β, IL-6, and transforming growth factor-β1 to be particularly increased, and interferon-γ decreased. C-reactive protein levels were increased, particularly in Parkinson disease dementia. These results provide evidence that LBD is associated with an increased inflammatory response. Furthermore, there may be a stronger general inflammatory response in LBD than in Parkinson disease, while complex changes occur in the individual cytokines.",

    "abstract": "Background: Rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) is usually associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a fatal condition. Current advances in the understanding of immune-mediated diseases allow the diagnosis of previously unrecognized treatable RPDs. Objective of the Study: The objective of the study was to describe the prevalence and causes of RPD in a neurology service, identifying potentially reversible causes. Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional evaluation of all patients admitted to the neurology unit of a tertiary hospital in Brazil between March 2012 and February 2015. We included patients who had progressed to moderate or severe dementia within a few months or up to 2 years at the time of hospitalization, and used multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with a favorable outcome. Results: We identified 61 RPD (3.7%) cases among 1648 inpatients. Mean RPD patients’ age was 48 years, and median time to progression was 6.4 months. Immune-mediated diseases represented the most commonly observed disease group in this series (45.9% of cases). Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (11.5%) and nonprion neurodegenerative diseases (8.2%) were less common in this series. Outcome was favorable in 36/61 (59.0%) RPD cases and in 28/31 (89.3%) of immune-mediated cases. Favorable outcome was associated with shorter time from symptom onset to diagnosis and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid findings. Conclusions: Immune-mediated diseases were the most common cause of RPD in this series. Timely evaluation and diagnosis along with institution of appropriate therapy are required in RPD, especially in view of potentially reversible causes.",

We investigated whether interactional and linguistic features in the communication behavior of patients with memory problems could help distinguish between those with problems secondary to neurological disorders (ND) and those with functional memory disorder (FMD). Methods: In part 1 of this study, a diagnostic scoring aid (DSA) was developed encouraging linguists to provide quantitative ratings for 14 interactional features. An optimal cut-off differentiating ND and FMD was established by applying the DSA to 30 initial patient-doctor memory clinic encounters. In part 2, the DSA was tested prospectively in 10 additional cases analyzed independently by 2 conversation analysts blinded to medical information. Results: In part 1, the median score of the DSA was +5 in ND and −5 in FMD ( P &lt;0.001). The optimal numeric DSA cut-off (+1) identified patients with ND with a sensitivity of 86.7% and a specificity of 100%. In part 2, DSA scores of rater 1 correctly predicted 10/10 and those of rater 2 predicted 9/10 diagnoses. Conclusions: This study indicates that interactional and linguistic features can help distinguish between patients developing dementia and those with FMD and could aid the stratification of patients with memory problems.",

Methods: A scoping systematic review was performed using 5 search engines. Studies were included if they utilized virtual support groups for informal caregivers of persons with dementia. Study details, support group characteristics, outcomes, barriers, facilitators, and recommended approaches were extracted and summarized. Results: Of 1052 identified articles, 87 were retrieved; 62 were excluded largely because they described other virtual interventions. Groups typically used teleconferences or internet-based videoconferences, included 4 to 6 participants, lasted 60 minutes, and occurred weekly or monthly. Moderators were professionals; moderator training was common. Content focused on support, education, or both. Covered topics included dementia knowledge, caregiving skills, coping, and resources. Costs related to technology, programming, and staffing. Although most studies identified no statistical differences, caregivers described many participation benefits. Common barriers were technology and access. Facilitators included training, technology support, small groups, and skilled leaders. Conclusions: Clinics desiring to start virtual support groups should consider videoconferencing or telephone approaches with pretraining, technology support, and professional moderators. Clinics need adequate resources, particularly for technology, and identification of locally relevant goals and approach.",

Current real-world management is largely pharmacologic, despite poor risk/benefit. The WeCareAdvisor was designed to enable family caregivers to assess, manage, and track BPSD using nonpharmacologic strategies. Design: In-depth qualitative data were collected from family caregivers of people with dementia to inform: (1) style of approach and “look and feel” of the tool, and (2) the types of psychoeducation most needed by caregivers. Results: We conducted 4 focus groups and a technology survey (n=26) as well as additional individual semistructured interviews (n=12) with family caregivers. Main themes of the qualitative work included: (1) need to minimize difficulty and training time; (2) importance of “one-stop shopping” for information; and (3) necessity for information to be tailored to the caregiver and person with dementia. This information was then combined with effective existing evidence-based behavioral strategies to create a web-based tailored caregiver-support tool. Conclusions: The WeCareAdvisor was designed with input on functionality and content by end-users, family caregivers. The randomized controlled trial of WeCareAdvisor will test whether the tool improves outcomes including caregiver upset and burden and frequency and severity of BPSD.",

Methods: We surveyed representative investigators from NIH-funded Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRC), querying their use of retention tactics across 12 strategies. We compared survey results to data from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center for each center. We used a generalized estimating equation with independent working covariance model and empirical standard errors to assess relationships between survey results and rates of retention, controlling for participant characteristics. Results: Twenty-five (83%) responding ADRCs employed an average 42 (SD=7) retention tactics. In a multivariable model that accounted for participant characteristics, the number of retention tactics used by a center was associated with participant retention (odds ratio=1.68, 95% confidence interval: 1.42, 1.98; P &lt;0.001 for the middle compared with the lowest tertile survey scores; odds ratio=1.59, 95% confidence interval: 1.30, 1.94; P &lt;0.001 for the highest compared with the lowest tertile survey scores) at the first follow-up visit. Participant characteristics such as normal cognition diagnosis, older age, higher education, and Caucasian race were also associated with higher retention. Conclusions: Retention in clinical research is more likely to be achieved by employing a variety of tactics.",

The possibility of late-life emergence of ASD has been poorly explored.To more fully characterize the possibility of late-life emergence of behaviors characteristic of ASD in mild cognitive impairment and AD, we surveyed caregivers of 142 older persons with cognitive impairment from the University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Center Longitudinal Cohort using the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale-2.Participants with high autism index ratings (autism \"possible/very likely,\" n=23) reported significantly (statistically and clinically) younger age at the onset of cognitive impairment than those who scored in the autism \"unlikely\" range (n=119): 71.14±10.9 vs. 76.65±8.25 (P=0.034). In addition, those in the autism \"possible/very likely\" group demonstrated advanced severity of cognitive impairment, indicated by the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes scores.Data demonstrate that ASD behaviors may seem de novo of degenerative dementia and such behaviors are more prevalent in those with early onset dementia. Further work elucidating a connection between ASD and dementia could shed light on subclinical forms of ASD, identify areas of shared neuroanatomic involvement between ASD and dementias, and provide valuable insights that might hasten the development of therapeutic strategies.",

Methods: The study cohort comprises an age-stratified population-based random sample of individuals aged 65+ years from a small-town region of the United States. We identified as cases those participants who, during annual assessments, self-reported having undergone surgery under general anesthesia during the preceding year. We identified as controls those who reported no surgery for at least 6 consecutive years.

Results: A total of 436 participants had the required cognitive data; 179 participants (cases) had undergone surgery, while 257 participants (controls) had not undergone surgery. After adjusting for age, years of education, gender, race, heart failure, irregular heartbeat, and stroke, participants who underwent surgery had a greater decline in executive function, memory, and attention over a 2-year period.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study with participants selected from the electronic records of patients seen at Yale New Haven Hospital's Memory Clinic, CT. A total of 61 patients, 28 with FTD (mean age=64.1) and 33 with AD (mean age=66.8), with available CSF results and cognitive test scores in their chart were included in analyses. T-tau levels negatively and significantly correlated with total MoCA scores as well as the different MoCA index scores in patients with FTD (r=-0.47, P=0.04). There were no significant associations between MoCA scores and p-tau181 levels in patients with FTD (r=-0.22, P=0.25). Patients with AD exhibited significant correlations between MoCA scores and both t-tau (r=-0.54, P<0.01) and p-tau (r=-0.55, P<0.01) levels. Also, Aβ1-42 levels were not significantly correlated with MoCA scores in either of the FTD and AD groups. CSF concentrations of t-tau are inversely correlated to cognitive performance in patients with FTD and both t-tau and p-tau181 in AD. This study provides valuable insights into the relationship between clinical cognitive performance and tau-related pathology in FTD in comparison with AD.",

Objective: To conduct a phase II/III randomized clinical of extended-release metformin versus placebo in participants with aMCI without diabetes. Methods: Ratio of 1:1 randomized placebo-controlled trial of extended-release metformin in 326 persons with aMCI without diabetes, aged 55 to 90 years, lasting 18 months, with 4 visits every 6 months including baseline. The primary outcome is changes in total recall in the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test. Secondary outcomes include (1) changes in global cognitive performance, measured with the Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (ADCS-PACC); (2) changes in neurodegeneration, ascertained as cortical thickness in areas affected by AD on brain MRI; (3) changes in cerebrovascular disease, ascertained as white matter hyperintensities (WMH) volume on brain MRI; (4) changes in whole brain amyloid ß (Aß) SUVR and in incident amyloid positivity; (5) changes in tau SUVR in a composite brain region comprising medial and inferolateral temporal cortex; (6) changes in plasma AD biomarkers.

    "abstract": "The challenge of describing subgroups is particularly important in vascular dementia, which, in contrast to more stereotypic processes affecting cognitive function, is better thought of as several syndromes rather than as a disease. Many current diagnostic descriptions lack a strong empiric basis. Some of the categories now in use suffer from a priori assumptions about causality and pattern associations, which themselves have not been validated. The so-called mixed dementia syndrome may have been underrepresented in our estimation of dementia subtypes, in comparison with so-called pure vascular causes. Within the vascular syndrome, whether seen in isolation or in combination with other causes of dementia, the relative contributions of white matter changes as compared with multiple cortical strokes needs to be clarified. It remains a matter of controversy as to whether prolonged or chronic intermittent cerebral ischemia is a statistically important part of the dementia. The variable relation between clinical presentation and neuroimaging localization has important consequences for understanding the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment arising from vascular causes. Recent data also suggest that we should focus away from both the Alzheimer disease model of dementia and the multi-infarct model of vascular dementia. There are important opportunities available to clinicians from many disciplines to collaborate in precise clinical descriptions of large numbers of patients to advance our understanding of the spectrum of vascular cognitive impairment.",

However, in some circumstances, only an informant history is possible. The aim of this study was to assess the validity of the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) when the rating is based solely on informant data. The CDR was used in a study of 360 persons aged 78 or older who were participants in a community survey, the Sydney Older Persons Study. The CDR was completed in two ways: (1) a social scientist made the ratings based on an informant interview; and (2) a physician made the ratings after an examination of the subject. All CDRs were scored in the conventional way, as well as by the revised method proposed by Gelb and St. Laurent [Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord 1993;4:202-l 1). The informant CDR showed moderate agreement with the clinician CDR, showing that it would be a valid substitute in situations in which the subject could not be examined. The revised scoring method was slightly easier to implement than the conventional method.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the influence of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) 4 allele on the age at which Alzheimer-like lesions appear in the brain, we analyzed the degree of cerebral β-amyloidosis and neurofibrillary tangle formation in the hippocampal formation and adjacent cortical areas 28, 27, and 36 of persons who had died between the ages of 50 and 93 years and who had shown no signs of clinical dementia. The occurrence of the three common polymorphisms of the ApoE gene in this sample of 147 routine autopsy cases from eastern Germany was comparable to previously reported values in European and North American populations: ApoE2/2, 0.7%; ApoE±2/3, 14.3%; ApoE±2/4, 4.1%; ApoE±3/3, 56.5%; ApoE±3/4, 22.4%; and ApoE±4/4, 2.0%. Nondemented persons carrying the ApoE±4 allele were significantly more likely to have senile plaques, diffuse amyloid deposits, cerebrovascular amyloid, and neurofibrillary tangles than were those lacking ±4. Comparing the two largest ApoE subgroups, ApoE±3/3 and ApoE±3/4, the relative increase in the occurrence of β-amyloid in the ±3/4 group was evident by the mid-60s, with the relative increase in neurofibrillary tangles in this group emerging slightly earlier. The ApoE±2 allele appears to delay the appearance of the lesions somewhat. We conclude that ApoE±4 promotes the early appearance of β-amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles in the elderly and that the increased frequency of these lesions is related to the higher risk of Alzheimer disease in persons bearing the ApoE±4 allele.",

These influences affect the manifestation of dementia in terms of cognitive, behavioral, self-maintenance, and affective functioning.

In this study, by demonstrating that high molecular weight kininogen may be massively cleaved in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with AD, we provide evidence of the potential involvement of the contact system in the inflammatory processes taking place in this disease. In the CSF of patients with neuroimmune inflammatory disease (multiple sclerosis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy), there was no evidence of increased cleavage of high molecular weight kininogen, suggesting that this finding may be characteristic of the Alzheimer brain. The data obtained from in vitro experiments seem to indicate that the cleavage of high molecular weight kininogen in vivo may be the result of the interaction of beta-amyloid with factor XII and of kallikrein generation. The actual relevance of such a phenomenon remains to be established in vivo. However, the demonstration that the contact system may be activated in the brains of Alzheimer patients points to the potential involvement of the kallikrein-kinin system in the inflammatory process of this disease.",

At other times these patients did not wander or become disoriented. The inability to recall any information during these episodes, and the marked difference of the episodic amnesia exacerbations from the progressive amnesia characteristic of Alzheimer disease seen in these patients led to their evaluation. These clinical episodes and the bilateral interictal epileptiform electroencephalographic changes found in both patients led to the diagnosis of transient epileptic amnesia, a syndrome that can be diagnostically elusive. These transient amnestic wandering events subsided after treatment with antiepileptic drugs in both patients. The authors suggest that transient wandering of this type may be caused by ictal events or postictal confusional states. This report emphasizes the importance of recognizing transient epileptic amnesia as an easily treatable cause of episodic behavioral abnormalities responsive to antiepileptic therapy, especially in those patients who have a markedly inconsistent pattern of wandering, disorientation in familiar settings, and amnesia exacerbation manifested by no recall of the emotional stress of getting lost or of any information during these episodes. Recognition of this type of behavioral disruption and its proper treatment can lead to improved quality of life for these patients, maintain these patients in their homes and out of chronic care institutions longer, and facilitate the community's and caretaker's interactive roles with the patient.",

Advance directives have been widely promoted as a means to maintain some control over one's life in the event of decisional incompetence. This study used data from a recent postal survey conducted in Quebec, Canada to: 1) estimate the prevalence of formal and informal advance directives for health care and research among community-dwelling older adults presumed free of cognitive deficits; and 2) characterize those who have communicated their preferences regarding health care and research participation. Prevalence rates vary from 7.4% (formal advance directives for research) to 42.3% (informal advance directives for health care). Following multivariate logistic regressions, individuals who have communicated their wishes regarding future health care were found to be older, predominantly women, and to more often know someone with cognitive impairment. Those who have expressed their wishes regarding future research involvement were more inclined to participate in research. They were also more likely to have discussed or written advance directives for health care. The finding that only a small proportion of older adults have discussed future research participation with their families points to the need to find effective ways to promote advance directives for research in this population.",

A retrospective, cross-sectional, matched control group design was used. AD cases 50 years of age and older were identified by using International Classification of Diseases (9th edition, Clinical Modification) diagnosis codes from 1994 Georgia Medicaid administrative claims files. For every case, three age-and gender-matched non-AD controls were selected. Differences in average recipient Medicaid expenditures between cases and controls were estimated using weighted least squares regression analysis, adjusting for age, gender, race, Charlson comorbidity index, Medicare eligibility, and months of Medicaid eligibility. A total of 8,671 AD cases were identified (prevalence, 4.4%). The average adjusted annual Medicaid expenditure per AD recipient was $14,492 (U.S.). The net (i.e., excess) average annual Medicaid cost per AD recipient (i.e., the difference in adjusted mean expenditures between cases and controls) was estimated to be approximately $8,200. Excessive nursing home expenditures accounted for most of the additional cost of treating dementia (> 85%), although inpatient hospital, physician, outpatient, and prescription drug expenditures also were higher among patients with AD. Based on these estimates, Georgia Medicaid is projected to spend almost $70 million annually for AD and related dementia. The excessive cost attributable to AD poses a significant burden to the Georgia Medicaid program.",

This study was developed by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS), a consortium of clinical research centers actively involved in AD research. The major goal of the consortium is to design and conduct clinical investigations leading to the development of treatments for AD. This study uses a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2×2 factorial, parallel group design to test two drugs for the treatment of AD. The primary outcome of the study is the time to reach any one of the following four endpoints: death, institutionalization, loss of two of three basic activities of daily living, and progression of Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) stage from 2 to 3. Patients with moderately severe disease (CDR=2) were enrolled and evaluated 10 times over a period of 2 years to determine if these agents reduce the time to reach any endpoint. A database from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease indicated adequate power analyses to observe a treatment effect on this clinically meaningful outcome measure. Recruitment and baseline characteristics of the population are provided. The rationale for the choice of a factorial design, the use of a novel, clinically meaningful endpoint, and the selection of a cohort of patients with AD of moderate severity are discussed.",

This procedure, which ensures semantic processing and coordinates encoding and retrieval, has been shown to be very sensitive to an early diagnosis of AD. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM 99) was used to establish clinicometabolic correlations between performance at free and cued verbal recall and resting brain metabolism in 31 patients with AD. Results showed that patient's score on free recall correlated with metabolic activity in right frontal regions (BA 10 and BA 45), suggesting that performance reflected a strategic retrieval attempt. Poor retrieval performance was tentatively attributed to a loss of functional correlation between frontal and medial temporal regions in patients with AD compared with elderly controls. Performance on cued recall was correlated to residual metabolic activity in bilateral parahippocampal regions (BA 36), suggesting that performance reflected retrieval of semantic associations, without recollection in AD. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the diagnostic sensitivity for Alzheimer's disease of the cued recall performance in the Grober and Buschke procedure (1987) depends on the activity of parahippocampal regions, one of the earliest targets of the disease. Moreover, the results suggest that the poor performance of patients with AD during free and cued recall is related to a decreased connectivity between parahippocampal regions and frontal areas.",

    "abstract": "Because of the huge healthcare burden associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) and the increased lifespan in many industrialized countries, the costs associated with AD are expected to reach astronomical proportions in the next 50 years. Diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of AD patients from the earliest stage possible will reduce healthcare costs and increase quality of life. Indeed, progress in our clinical knowledge of AD has led to more reliable diagnostic criteria and diagnostic accuracy, and research efforts are expanding to uncover the earliest manifestations and even the presymptomatic phases of the disease. The initiating and propagating pathologic processes and the anatomic location of the earliest changes will become new targets of research and therapeutic development. The proposed precursor to AD, mild cognitive impairment, is currently under investigation as a possible therapeutic starting point. This paper reviews our current understanding of the early pathology and clinical manifestations associated with mild cognitive impairment and early AD. A discussion of the latest diagnostic techniques as well as promising therapeutic targets for early intervention also will be included.",

Putative psychiatric risk factors were evaluated for a registry-based sample of 65 twin pairs discordant for AD. Risk ratios were calculated for psychiatric illness at any time and for episodes more than 10 years before dementia onset. Prior psychiatric illness was significantly associated with elevated risk. Most of these cases represented depressive episodes. When analyses were restricted to individuals whose mental illness commenced more than 10 years before dementia onset, the magnitude of the odds ratio decreased markedly. These findings suggest that a history of psychiatric illness, especially depression, may be associated with an elevated risk for AD. In particular, these results are consistent with an interpretation that symptoms of depression and similar complaints represent prodromal phases of dementia.",

    "abstract": "Summary: Vascular dementia (VaD) relates to different vascular mechanisms and changes in the brain and has different causes and clinical manifestations, reflecting complex interactions between vascular etiologies, changes in the brain, host factors, and cognition. Critical elements to the concept and diagnosis of VaD are defining the vascular causes, the vascular etiologies, and changes in the brain. Verifying the relation between brain lesions and cognition (i.e., the extent to which brain changes cause, compound, or coexist with cognitive impairment) and establishing the types, extent, side, site, and tempo of brain lesions that relate to incident cognitive impairment are major diagnostic challenges. Previous work on interactions between brain lesion and cognition in to cerebrovascular disease (CVD) have shown variation in the definitions and measures of cognitive impairment, in the techniques and methods used to reveal different brain changes, and in the selection of patient populations. Furthermore, small sample sizes and the absence of multivariate statistics have been design limitations. Accordingly, the different sets of criteria used and methods applied identify different numbers and clusters of subjects and different distribution of brain changes. Furthermore, this heterogeneity is reflected in variation in natural history such as the rate of progression of decline in different cognitive domains over time. All these factors have hampered optimal designs of clinical drug trials. A summary of generalizations regarding lesion and cognition interaction in VaD can be made. (1) Not a single feature, but a combination of infarct features—extent and type of white matter lesions (WMLs), degree and site of atrophy, and host factor characteristics—constitues correlates of VaD. (2) Infarct features favoring VaD include bilaterality, multiplicity (>1), location in the dominant hemisphere, and location in the limbic structures (fronto-and mediolimbic). (3) WML features favoring VaD are extensive WMLs (extensive periventricular WMLs and confluent to extensive WMLs in the deep WM). (4) It is doubtful that only a single small lesion could provide imaging evidence for a diagnosis of VaD. (5) Absence of CVD lesions on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is strong evidence against a diagnosis of VaD. In forthcoming protocols on CVD-associated cognitive impairment, the following brain imaging features should be specified: detailed characterization of brain changes; use of possible predefined subtypes based on brain imaging; use of rating of vascular burden; defining the type and extent of WMLs favoring a diagnosis of VaD; defining the extent of medial temporal lobe atrophy disfavoring a diagnosis of VaD; and technical harmonization of methods of scanning and analysis.",

Neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and senile plaques (SP) were found in controls, but they were more frequent in AD, especially in the younger cases.

    "abstract": "There is a diversity of opinions concerning the function of the blood-brain barrier and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCB) in Alzheimer disease and other neuropsychiatric disorders. In this paper we investigate and review the evidence for BCB dysfunction in Alzheimer disease and major depression. The hypothetical roles of immunologically mediated mechanisms in the central nervous system (CNS) are discussed. Special consideration is given to methodological factors influencing BCB function and analysis. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 29 patients with major depression (MD) and 51 patients with \"probable Alzheimer disease\" (AD) were investigated. The AD patients were subdivided in two groups of 21 early-onset (EO) and 30 late-onset (LO) cases and assayed for concentrations of albumin and IgG. The results were compared with those for 11 age-matched healthy controls. The severity of dementia was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). AD and MD patients showed significantly lower serum albumin [AD: p < 0.05 (LO: p < 0.038); MD:P < 0.01] and IgG (AD: P < 0.01; MD: p < 0.013) concentrations compared with controls. MD (p < 0.001) and LO-AD (p < 0.07) patients displayed significantly lower absolute serum albumin levels than did EO-AD patients. The CSF/serum ratio for albumin and IgG was used to evaluate BCB function. There were no significant group differences; however, subsets of MD (29%) and AD (16%) patients showed a higher frequency of a pathological albumin ratio than did control subjects. Furthermore, a subset of 24% of MD and 18% of AD patients and none of the controls showed an elevated IgG ratio. Different mechanisms of alteration of IgG distribution are presented. The degree of cognitive impairment in AD did not correlate positively with protein and ratio parameters. The BCB is critical to the maintenance of homeostasis within nervous system tissue. We suggest that the altered function can result from immune-mediated events such as altered levels of circulating inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, we assume that in the AD and MD subgroups, the BCB dysfunction for high molecular weight proteins permits access of components of the immune system to the CNS, which may contribute to disease pathology.",

    "abstract": "Summary The Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) was administered to 61 Alzheimer patients, 52 elderly controls, and 80 controls between age 7 and 54 years. The Alzheimer group was categorized into different severity levels of dementia based on MMSE scores: very mild (≥ 24), mild (≥20), moderate (10–19), and severe (0–9). All 11 ADAS Cognitive subtest scores for the mild, moderate, and severe dementia groups were statistically worse than the elderly control group. This was also the case for the very mild group, except for Naming, Commands, Constructional Praxis, and Ideational Praxis. In terms of magnitude of effect, memory and spontaneous language items were the earliest indicators on the ADAS, while praxis, commands, and naming items were only sensitive later in the course of the disorder. The best single indicators of progression throughout the severity continuum of dementia (i.e., from normal to severe) were the Orientation subtest, the ADAS Cognitive score, and the ADAS Total score. The ADAS Noncognitive subtests generally did not show the progression with increasing dementia that was evident on the ADAS Cognitive subtests. Differences in educational level had no statistically significant effects on any of the ADAS subtest scores, and age differences were few and small in magnitude. The differential rate of decline of the various ADAS subtests appears to reflect both the changing pattern of cognitive impairments as a function of severity of DAT and also to some extent the psychometric limitations of some of the subtests.",

There were 376 problems identified at both sites, 422 identified only by the home visit, and 478 identified only in the clinic. Problems related to patient safety and caregiver issues were the two most common general categories. Eighty-four percent of the problems identified only at the home visit were potentially serious and 24% of problems identified at both sites were rated as more serious at the home visit. A clinic-based home assessment is not comparable to a home visit for assessing the home environment of demented elderly patients.",

The study was part of a two-stage population-based study of mental functioning among noninstitutionalized 65− to 85-year-olds living in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Participants (n = 51) were randomly selected within strata of cognitive function to obtain a sample of AD patients (n = 10) and clinically normal subjects (n = 41), of whom 22 displayed some cognitive impairment and fulfilled criteria for “minimal dementia” according to the Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of the Elderly. Coronal T1-weighted MRI was used to visualize the medial temporal lobe. Medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) was assessed qualitatively on a 0–4 scale. Regional cerebral blood flow on SPECT was assessed with the use of technetium 99m-HMPAO in three manually drawn regions of interest (frontal, parietal, and temporoparietal). Ratios were calculated by using the cerebellum as the reference area. MTA differed significantly between AD patients and clinically normal subjects (p = 0.0009), with a sensitivity for AD of 70% and a specificity of 76%. None of the three SPECT ratios differed between normal and AD subjects. The temporoparietal/cerebellar ratio had a sensitivity of 30% and a specificity of 71% at a cutoff of 0.76. When both tests were positive the combined sensitivity was low (20%), but the falsepositive rate was also very low (5%). A negative result on MRI or any SPECT ratio yielded a high specificity (93–98%) but also a high false-negative rate (60–80%). Adding SPECT to MRI seems useful only if a diagnosis of AD is suspected clinically and confirmation is needed. When the clinical probability that AD is absent is high, normal results on either MPI or SPECT may confirm this notion. Given the fact that structural imaging should be performed in a clinical workup for dementia, using MRI only would be the most cost-effective approach.",

Simultaneously, it is understood that some older adults will experience behavioral and/or physical changes that may preclude driving at some point in their lives. Because most older adults rely on the automobile to maintain their mobility and independence, there is sometimes reluctance to stop driving when impairments develop. Recent research has been aimed at finding ways to distinguish those drivers who may pose a threat to their own safety, as well as the safety of other road users, from the vast majority of competent drivers. These studies have indicated that measures of visual attention and cognitive function have been successful in distinguishing between these two groups. Finally, because visual attention skills can be improved with training, these findings have important implications for further evaluation of interventions to enhance the skills that underlie safe driving.",

    "abstract": "Summary: Although vascular dementia (VaD) is the second most frequent cause of dementia after Alzheimer disease (AD), the concept remains controversial in terms of delineation. The objective of this review is to investigate, from available literature, the role of cerebral infarcts in the pathogenesis of VaD and to identify areas of interest that need further evaluation and research. The incidence of new onset dementia is increased after stroke. Stroke subtypes, total volume of cerebral infarction and functional tissue loss, and location of the lesions are probably the major determinants of VaD. Any cause of stroke can lead to VaD. In some circumstances the causal relation between stroke and dementia is clear: (1) in young patients who are unlikely to have associated Alzheimer pathology; (2) when the cognitive functioning was normal before stroke, impaired immediately after, and does not worsen over time; (3) when the lesions are located in strategic areas; and (4) when a well-defined vasculopathy known to cause dementia is proven. However, several issues remain unsolved in VaD: lack of specificity of the diagnostic criteria; influence of white matter changes and associated Alzheimer pathology; influence of preexisting cognitive status; possibility of having VaD without stroke and the clinical relevance of silent infarcts to VaD; and best therapeutic strategy to be used to prevent VaD and to prevent stroke in patients with VaD. These questions form the basis for proposals for future research.",

Ninety-nine demented patients (81 females and 18 males aged 55-100 years) in two nursing homes were assessed with the BANS-s, established cognitive and functional scales [Mini Mental State Examination, the extended version of the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), Katz's basic activities of daily living, Tinetti balance and gait, and Crichton scales], a behavioral scale (UCLA Neuropsychiatric Inventory), and indicators of malnutrition (Prognostic Nutritional Index). A relevant proportion (40%) of patients scored close to the floor of all scales except BANS-s and CDR, which showed a more uniform distribution of scores throughout the possible range. Convergent validity of BANS-s with the other cognitive and functional scales was good, with Pearson's r ranging from 0.62 to 0.79. Discriminant validity analysis of BANS-s versus the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Inventory showed that the two scales measure different domains (Pearson's r = 0.36). To test known-group validity, all patients were divided into two groups of different severity as defined by the Prognostic Nutritional Index. BANS-s and CDR were the scales with the best ability to discriminate malnourished from nonmalnourished patients. As a further validity test, the 37 patients reaching the floor on other cognitive and functional scales were divided into two subgroups of different dementia severity as defined by the Tinetti scale. BANS-s but not CDR was able to differentiate the two groups.",

The natural course of AD can be viewed as a gradual loss of independence divided into several stages (mild, moderate, and severe) that ultimately leaves the patient under the supervision of a caregiver. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are the most widely accepted and proven approach to the treatment of mild to moderate AD. However, management of patients with severe AD poses challenges to physicians because there are only limited treatment options for these patients. This article provides overviews of the natural history, current therapy, and diagnostic scales of AD, focusing on management of patients with severe AD. In addition, a brief summary of the existing clinical trials conducted in severe AD is presented.",

Previous studies on the CSF IgG content in Alzheimer disease (AD) have been controversial about the relationship of OCB and elevated IgG indices. To explore this problem, we combined qualitative (isoelectric focusing) and quantitative methods (IgG index) to detect intrathecal IgG production and related these findings to the presence of blood-cerebrospinal-fluid barrier (BCB) dysfunction. Fifty-one AD patients were compared with patients with vascular dementia (VD), major depression (MD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and age-matched control subjects. CSF-OCB could be traced in 20% of AD patients. An elevated IgG index was found in 6% and a BCB dysfunction in 16% of all AD patients. Either intrathecal IgG synthesis or BCB dysfunction were detected in a subgroup of 36% of all AD cases and in 40% of patients with late-onset AD. Intrathecal IgG synthesis and BCB dysfunction may suggest underlying immunological or inflammatory changes in an as-yet undefined subgroup of AD patients and support the notion of a heterogeneous nature of AD.",

Three hundred forty-three patients were randomly assigned to receive 25, 50, or 75 mg xanomeline tartrate or placebo three times daily (t.i.d.) for 24 weeks, followed by placebo for 4 weeks in a single-blind washout phase. Cognitive function was assessed at randomization and after 4, 8, 12, 24, and 28 weeks. Three hundred nineteen patients were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis; 209 completers had evaluable data at week 24. ITT analysis showed a significant (p ≤ 0.05) dose–response trend and a significant (p ≤ 0.05) between-group comparison favoring 75 mg t.i.d. over placebo for the CNTB summary score but not for the ADAS-cog. In the completer analysis, however, the ADAS-cog showed a significant (p ≤ 0.05) dose–response trend and between-group comparison, whereas the CNTB Summary Score did not. The ADAS-cog was less sensitive to treatment effects in mildly impaired patients (ADAS-cog < 21) than in moderately impaired patients (ADAS-cog ≥ 21), whereas the CNTB was sensitive in the entire study population (mean ADAS-cog = 22.5 ± 9.6). Significant (p ≤ 0.05) beneficial treatment effects were seen in measures of simple reaction time and delayed verbal recall, which are included in the CNTB but not in the ADAS-cog. During the single-blind placebo washout period, the ADAS-cog score of the placebo group worsened dramatically (change of 2.63 points; p ≤ 0.001), whereas the CNTB score remained stable (change of 1.04 points; p = 0.694).

There were three groups of patients, as follows: (a) developed a fever and received aggressive care (FAC, n = 30), (b) developed a fever and received palliative care (FPC, n = 19), and (c) did not develop a fever (NF, n = 46). The presence of a fever episode did not have an effect of its own on DAT progression. Over a 3-month period, DAT severity increased in most patients, but more so in FAC patients. Thus aggressive medical treatment of infections did not affect the underlying disease process and was associated with an acceleration of the progression of severity of DAT. Providing palliative care is recommended because it prevents patients from undergoing invasive diagnostic workups and treatments, does not accelerate the progression of DAT, and conserves scarce health care resources.",

    "abstract": "Memory is an intellectual function that is initially and consistently impaired in patients with vascular dementia. Experimental approaches to vascular dementia have so far been confined to investigations of memory impairments in rodent ischemic models. Unilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion, multiple small embolization or transient four-vessel occlusion in rats produced acute single or multiple infarctions. In such rats, significant memory impairments occurred during the subacute or chronic phases, but were partially reversible. Permanent stenosis of both common carotid arteries in gerbils caused no ischemic changes at 1 day after stenosis but induced multiple infarctions after 1 week of stenosis, probably due either to chronic recurrent ischemia resulting from transient repetitive obstruction of the carotid arteries or to chronic low perfusion. The memory impairments in this model were persistent. Permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion in rats produced multiple infarctions plus white matter changes after 1 week of occlusion. Marked memory impairment was also observed in this model. The results of the above studies suggest that memory impairments due to ischemic causes may be partially reversible provided that the infarctions occur only once and are followed by flow recovery. Memory impairments, however, appear to persist if the brain is exposed to chronic recurrent ischemia or chronic moderately low perfusion. A repetitive or persistent low-flow state appears to be an important factor in determining the irreversibility of cognitive impairments.",

The central dilemma is how to obtain valid informed consent from a population of potential subjects who are losing their decision-making capacity while still providing adequate protection for this vulnerable group of people. One model for informed consent for dementia research would be to obtain consent in advance of the loss of decision-making capacity, perhaps using written advance directives similar to those used for clinical decisions on life-sustaining treatments. This article examines the advance consent model, contrasts the life-sustaining treatment arena with dementia research issues, and suggests that written advance consent should not be required to conduct dementia research. Instead, an argument is presented in favor of a more informal advance consent process that builds upon the existing practice of using subject assent plus proxy consent.",

Respondents delayed the diagnostic assessment for an average of 22.4 months after noticing symptoms. Perceived benefits involved confirmation of a medical condition, access to treatment, and help preparing for the caregiving role. Barriers were both emotional and pragmatic in nature. Respondents who were younger, visited the rural assessment clinic, and had less education experienced more barriers. All groups reported receiving the same number of benefits from the assessment.

Consistent with earlier cases reported in the literature, both displayed the following high-risk phenotype predisposing to suicidal risk: male gender, highly educated professional, preserved insight, dysthymic symptoms that did not meet criteria for major depression and post-dated the onset of cognitive decline, and suicidal ideation. Neuropathological examination confirmed histologic Alzheimer disease in both cases.

    "abstract": "Autosomal dominant proximal limb girdle or inclusion body myopathy, associated with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) is a recently described disorder that maps to chromosome 9p21.1-p12. We refined the critical locus and identified the gene as the Valosin Containing Protein (VCP) gene, a member of the AAA-ATPase superfamily using a candidate gene approach. Six missense mutations were found to co-segregate with affected individuals only, two of these representing mutation hot spots. We report the clinical and molecular findings in 99 individuals in 13 families. VCP is associated with a variety of cellular activities, including the control of cell cycle, membrane fusion, and the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway. Previous studies have associated VCP mutants in cell lines with vacuole formation and aggregate formation. Identification of VCP as the gene causing IBMPFD has important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "The Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) was administered to 61 patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and 52 elderly controls. The DAT group was subdivided into different severity levels of dementia based on scores from the Mini-Mental State Exam: very mild (≥24), mild (20 to 23), moderate (10 to 19), and severe (0 to 9). The mean scores on the ADAS Cognitive subscale for the four levels of dementia (very mild = 23.1 ± 7.7, mild = 22.9 ± 8.9, moderate = 38.6 ± 9.8, severe = 54.8 ± 7.6) were statistically different from one another (p < 0.0001, except very mild vs. mild) and were significantly worse than the scores of the elderly control group (5.5 ± 2.7, p < 0.0001, ANOVA). Furthermore, the ADAS Cognitive subscale was highly effective in discriminating individual Alzheimer patients from elderly controls. The ADAS Cognitive score correctly classified 100% of the very mild group, 91% of the entire mild group, and 100% of the moderate and severe groups when a cutoff score of 2 SDs above the control group mean was used. Age and education had only minimal effects on the ADAS Cognitive score. The ADAS is a valuable screening test that only takes 30 min to administer and has utility in both early detection and staging of DAT.",

Other recent findings support the importance of early-life risk factors, such as socioeconomic conditions, early-life development, and exposure to infection, in explaining individual differences in dementia risk. Life-style variables have been conceptualized as delaying factors, postponing onset of dementia and thereby reducing total population burden of dementia. Using a sample of Swedish twins from the HARMONY study, we found that education significantly affects dementia onset, that is, occurrence and timing of dementia symptoms. In the HARMONY data, we also showed that differences in education are reflected in differences in leisure activities and occupation, suggesting that differences in cognitive engagement begin early and persist over the life course. Such findings point to the importance of taking a life-course perspective to designing interventions to delay or to prevent dementia.",

Throughout the process of caring for patients with AD, caregivers frequently experience social, emotional, physical, and financial losses, which become more significant as the disease progresses. Minimizing these losses is a goal in the overall management of AD. Successful treatment of the patient has been shown to positively impact quality of life for the caregiver. Randomized, controlled studies of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) have demonstrated the effectiveness of these agents in stabilizing cognitive function and delaying behavioral symptoms. Moreover, a decrease in the incidence of nursing home placement has been associated with this therapy. The growing burden of AD on families and society as a whole warrants the investigation of ways to minimize the impact of AD. AChEIs play an important role in this effort. Further studies are needed to more closely examine the impact of specific AChEIs on caregiver burden.",

Methods: In this randomized, 8-week, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, pilot comparison of galantamine and donepezil, safety and efficacy data were collected. Objective and subjective changes in sleep of patients (N = 63) and their caregivers were measured. Clinicians assessed changes in patient global function. As this was a pilot study, only descriptive statistics are presented. Results: In general, neither galantamine nor donepezil, at stable doses, were associated with decrements in actigraphy sleep measurements. However, mean scores in all measures of sleep showed a tendency for minimal improvements in galantamine-treated patients and minimal decrements in the donepezil-treated patients. The same tendencies were present in caregiver sleep measures. Global function either improved or remained stable in a higher percentage of patients treated with galantamine than with donepezil. Galantamine and donepezil were both well tolerated and safe. Conclusions: This pilot study was the first to compare the effects of these drugs on sleep in patients or caregivers. Both drugs were safe and well tolerated. Neither galantamine nor donepezil negatively affected sleep; however, on every measure, there were suggestions of slightly more benefit associated with galantamine treatment. Although these results are suggestive of a differential effect of the drugs on sleep, further research is needed to confirm the clinical significance.",

An accurate screening test would greatly aid the ability of physicians to evaluate dementia and memory problems in clinical practice. We sought to determine whether simple and brief psychometric tests perform similarly to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in screening for dementia. Using a retrospective analysis, a series of standard, brief, psychometric tests were compared with each other and to the MMSE as screening tests for very mild dementia, using DSM-III-R criterion as the gold standard. Two independent cohorts from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and the Washington University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center were evaluated. We found that two brief and simple-to-administer tests appear to offer similar degrees of sensitivity and specificity to the MMSE. These are the recall of a five-item name and address, \"John Brown 42 Market Street Chicago\" and the one-minute verbal fluency for animals. Combining these two tests further improves sensitivity and specificity, surpassing the MMSE, to detect dementia in individuals with memory complaints.",

In AD, reductions in serotonin, glutamate, and somatostatin receptors also occur in cortex, and an increase in corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptors has been reported.

The control group was comprised of AD subjects who voluntarily declined to participate in the program for practical reasons. Patients were divided in groups of 4 subjects: treatment was delivered for 6 weeks. Multidimensional efficacy assessment of functional, behavioral, and neuropsychologic aspects was performed. When comparing baseline with posttraining condition, patients displayed a substantial reduction in disruptive behavior, and a tendency to a general reduction of behavioral symptoms compared with controls (Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist—RMBPC—symptoms frequency-total P=0.07; frequency of disruptive behavior P=0.008). This reduction was mirrored by a significant reduction of caregiver reaction to behavioral disturbances (RMBPC caregiver reaction-total P=0.035; reaction to disruptive behavior, P=0.011). At 3 months follow-up, the reduction of caregiver reaction to behavioral symptoms results was confirmed (RMBPC caregiver reaction-total P=0.014, caregiver reaction to disruptive behavior P=0.028). No other significant difference was detected. These results partially confirm findings of previous studies, showing that AD patients treated with similar techniques demonstrated an improvement in behavioral disturbances.",

Multiple infarcts and white matter rarefaction are commonly seen as a component of Alzheimer disease, in keeping with the development of congophilic angiopathy and possibly other vascular changes in the latter disease.

Rats were 23 and 28 months old upon termination of the experiment. Twelve brain regions were analyzed for silicon and aluminum. Regional variations in silicon, which were independent of dietary silicon supplementation, suggest that silicon may be an essential element in brain. Aluminum supplementation decreased the silicon content in selected brain regions, including those thought to be involved in Alzheimer disease. A relationship has been established between silicon, aluminum and age. In 23-month rats, aluminum supplementation did not increase brain aluminum content. By contrast, in 28-month rats, aluminum supplementation of the low silicon diet increased brain aluminum content in most regions. No increase occurred in silicon supplemented groups of the same age. Dietary silicon supplementation thus appeared to be protective against aluminum accumulation in aging brain.",

The Clinical Dementia Rating showed convergent validity when compared against clinical features, mental status, and psychometric test scores, and DSM III-R measures of dementia severity, thus underscoring the trans-cultural feasibility of the Clinical Dementia Rating instrument. The Clinical Dementia Rating is also congruent with the DSM-IV approach of identifying dementia, and demonstrates better discriminatory ability in the milder dementia stages compared with DSM III-R. Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of the Clinical Dementia Rating in other social settings, advanced cases, as well as detecting clinically significant change.",

A cross-sectional design was used. Partners of patients with slight to moderately severe dementia who live in the community (n = 85) were interviewed. In a subgroup (n = 58) potential predictors of emotional impact of psychiatric symptoms on caregivers were studied. Agitation, irritability, apathy, and disinhibition produced the highest mean emotional impact scores in caregivers. Besides the neuropsychiatric symptoms themselves, the emotional impact of these symptoms on caregivers was predicted by sense of competence, degree of care needed by the patient, and financial expenditure due to the caregiving situation. The emotional impact of psychiatric symptoms on caregivers is predicted by several patient, caregiver, and situation factors. Interventions aimed at decreasing the experienced burden of caregivers should therefore not only focus on the psychiatric symptoms of the patient, but also on the sense of competence of the caregiver and the financial burden due to the caregiving situation.",

On a subsequent word association test, the AD patients were less likely than normals to give items from the recall list as their word associations. The results suggest that implicit verbal memory, as well as explicit memory, is impaired in AD. While the magnitude of the activation effect was significantly reduced in AD patients, it was uncorrelated with recall performance or a measure of global cognitive functioning.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine associations for work-related stress, reactivity to stress, and subsequent risk of dementia. The sample consisted of members of the population-based Swedish Twin Registry who were participants in the HARMONY study (n=2049). We used case control and cotwin control designs, with information on work-related stress and reactivity to stress collected as part of a questionnaire completed in 1967. Dementia was diagnosed approximately 30 years later using a 2-stage procedure—screening for cognitive impairment followed by full clinical evaluation. We found that measures of work-related stress (job dissatisfaction and high job demands) were not associated with dementia risk. Greater reactivity to stress predicted higher risk of dementia controlling for age, education, sex, occupational status, alcohol use, and smoking status (odds ratio=1.57, 95% confidence interval 1.08-2.31). Cotwin control analyses also showed that dementia probands were more likely to report high reactivity to stress than their nondemented cotwins. We did not find evidence of an interaction between work stress and reactivity in predicting dementia. Overall, indicators of stress due to environment (ie, work) were not associated with dementia, whereas the individual characteristic of reactivity to stress predicted dementia risk.",

    "abstract": "We conducted a systematic review of the use of quality of life (QoL) measures as outcome in pharmacological and nonpharmacologic intervention trials in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment or dementia, and their proxies. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group in April 2006. We also checked references and systematic reviews. Primary and secondary end points were screened for QoL-scales, and it was registered whether information on responsiveness was provided. We found 117 pharmacologic and 108 nonpharmacologic RCTs. One of the pharmacologic and 4 of the nonpharmacologic studies used QoL as primary outcome, and 2 and 3, respectively, as secondary end point. Altogether QoL was assessed in only 10 (4.4%) of these RCTs, of which 2 reported on responsiveness of QoL. This review provides evidence that QoL-instruments are seldom used as outcome measures in RCTs in dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment, and that information on responsiveness is scarce. QoL-measures should be applied more often in clinical trials, as currently no disease modifying drugs are available, although there are valid and reliable QoL-measures for dementia that reflect the aims of palliative care and provide transparent information about patient's and caregiver's treatment benefits. We recommend further research efforts aimed at the determination of the minimal important difference in QoL-scales and the responsiveness of QoL-scales. Subsequently, QoL should be measured as relevant end point, both in patients and their proxies, in all clinical trials in dementia.",

Of the dementias affecting patients with PD, PD with dementia (PDD) is not well understood, although brain imaging studies to date have observed characteristic patterns of brain atrophy. Metabolic differences have been observed in magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies comparing patients with PDD to nondemented PD patients, although it is unclear whether PDD patients have abnormally low MRS ratios compared with healthy age-matched adults. In this study, 12 patients with PDD, 12 patients with PD and no dementia, and 12 age-matched healthy older adults underwent MRS of the posterior cingulate gyrus. Patients with PDD showed lower N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) compared with controls (P=0.004) and compared with nondemented PD patients (P=0.003). No abnormalities were observed in choline/Cr or myo-Inositol/Cr. NAA/Cr was correlated with mental status in patients with PD and in patients with PDD (r=0.56; P=0.029). The findings suggest that reduced NAA/Cr of the posterior cingulate could be used as a marker for dementia in patients with PD. Future studies investigating the utility of brain MRS as a predictor of dementia in PD and comparing brain metabolism in PDD with other dementias seem warranted.",

Patients entering the extension were switched directly to 9.5 mg/24 h rivastigmine patch and increased to 17.4 mg/24 h patch, irrespective of their double-blind study treatment. Primary measures included safety and tolerability assessments, including adverse events and serious adverse events. Of 1195 patients randomized to treatment, 870 (72.8%) completed the double-blind study and entered the open-label extension. During weeks 1 to 4 of the extension, 9.5 mg/24 h rivastigmine patch was well tolerated overall by patients formerly randomized to rivastigmine capsule or patch groups: ≤2.5% reported nausea and ≤1.9% reported vomiting. No unexpected safety issues arose, and skin tolerability was good; similar to the double-blind study. During the 28-week, open-label extension phase, the patch seemed to be well tolerated with a favorable safety profile.",

The relationship between low plasma Aβ42 in depression and the major risk factor of AD, apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), is unknown. With the goal of clarifying this relationship, we analyzed 1060 homebound elders with ApoE characterization and depression status in a cross-sectional study. Plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42 were measured, and cognition were evaluated. In the absence of the ApoE4 allele, depressed subjects had lower plasma Aβ42 [median (Q1, Q3): 17.1 (11.6, 27.8) vs. 20.2 (12.9, 32.9) pg/mL, P=0.006], a higher Aβ40/Aβ42 ratio [median (Q1, Q3): 7.1 (4.6, 11.3) vs. 6.9 (3.4, 9.7), P=0.03], and lower cognitive function (mean±SD of Mini-Mental State Examination: 24.5±3.1 vs. 25.5±3.3, P<0.0001) than those without depression. In contrast, these relationships were not observed in the presence of ApoE4. Instead, regardless the depression status ApoE4 carriers had lower plasma Aβ42 and a higher Aβ40/Aβ42 ratio than non-ApoE4 carriers. Using multivariate logistic regression, it was found that depression was not associated with ApoE4 allele, but with the interaction between plasma Aβ42 and ApoE4 (odds ratio=3.94, 95% confidence interval=1.50, 10.33, P=0.005), denoting low plasma Aβ42 in the absence of ApoE4. Both ApoE4 carriers and non-ApoE4 carriers with depression had lower Aβ42 and a higher Aβ40/Aβ42 ratio in plasma compared with non-ApoE4 carriers without depression in the homebound elderly. As a combination of low plasma Aβ42 and high plasma Aβ40 has been shown to increase the risk of AD in 2 large cohort studies, amyloid-associated depression shown in this study may suggest a risk factor of AD in the absence of ApoE4.",

Thirty-two patients with mild Alzheimer disease (AD), 25 patients with moderate AD, and 51 elderly without dementia were examined with Mini Mental State Examination, Geriatric Depression Scale, and Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). The ASHA FACS was answered by their relative/caregiver. The scale's internal consistency, its inter-examiner and intra-examiner's reproducibility, and scale's criterion validity were researched by correlation with ADAS-cog. The sensitivity and specificity were also researched. Statistical analyses indicated that the ASHA FACS has excellent internal consistency (Cronbach [alpha]=0.955), test-retest reliability (interclass correlation coefficient=0.995; P<0.001), and inter-examiners (interclass correlation coefficient=0.998; P<0.001). It showed excellent criterion validity when correlated with ADAS-cog. The ASHA FACS scale showed good sensitivity (75.0%) and specificity (82.4%) values once it is an ecologic and broad evaluation. The ASHA FACS Portuguese version is a valid and reliable instrument to verify communication alterations in AD patients and fills an important gap of efficiency indicators for speech language therapy in our country.",

Eighteen behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia patients were assessed on 2 ADL measures, the Disability Assessment for Dementia, a caregiver-based interview, and the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills, a performance-based instrument. Behavior change, global cognition, executive function, and magnetic resonance imaging brain atrophy were also evaluated. There was no association between the 2 ADL measures. A model combining the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Revised (global cognition) and Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (frontal dysfunction) explained the variance on ADL performance. A qualitative rating distinguished between pathologic and phenocopy patients better than the performance-based assessment. Degree of frontal dysfunction and overall dementia determined the level of ADL impairment. The phenocopy patients were clearly distinguishable when evaluated using a performance-based, and even better with a qualitative rating assessment.",

Subjects with AGs represented 21.7% of the entire autopsy sample from 1999 to 2005 (80 out of 367). Of Alzheimer disease (AD) subjects, 43 out of 233 had AGs (18.4% of AD subjects); 11 out of 42 Parkinson disease with dementia subjects had AGs (26.1% of Parkinson disease with dementia subjects); 2 out of 9 dementia with Lewy bodies subjects had AGs (22.2% of dementia with Lewy bodies subjects); 4 out of 15 mild cognitive impairment subjects had AGs (26.7% of mild cognitive impairment subjects); and 20 out of 68 cognitively normal subjects had AGs (29.4% of cognitively normal). Subjects with AGs tended to be older but only significantly so in AD. Many comorbid non-neurologic health conditions were seen in cases of AGs without any single predilection emerging. AGs occur in approximately 22% of the entire autopsy cohort and are likely associated with advanced age. No distinctive antemortem clinical features were over represented in the AG cases. AGs can occur with or without neurodegenerative conditions and can occur in the absence of significant cognitive decline. AGs are not clearly associated with any single comorbid health condition.",

Items address executive function, praxis, gnosis, recent memory, and category fluency. It can be directly translated to other languages, without the need to change the structure or the format of any item. The RUDAS was administered to 151 consecutive, consenting, culturally diverse community-dwelling subjects of mean age 77 years, 72% of whom had an informant. Subjects were recruited from various clinics and healthcare programs. All were evaluated for cognitive impairment in a blinded manner by experienced clinicians in geriatric medicine. According to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder-IV criteria, 40% of the subjects were normal, 22% had cognitive impairment (not otherwise specified), and 38% had dementia; 84% of whom had questionable or mild dementia. In the primary analysis (normal subjects vs. those with definite dementia), the RUDAS accurately identified dementia, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.94 (95% confidence interval, 0.88-0.97); at the published cut point of less than 23/30, the positive likelihood ratio (LR) for dementia diagnosis was 8.77, and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.14. Additional analyses showed that the RUDAS performed less well when subjects with cognitive impairment (not dementia) were included. In all logistic regression models, the RUDAS was an independent predictor of dementia (odds ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.79, primary analysis model), after adjusting for age, sex, years of education, and cultural diversity, none of which were independent predictors. Further studies are needed across the full spectrum of early dementia syndromes, and in additional ethnic minority groups.",

The relationship between Informant and Self-ratings of cognitive status and neuropsychological test scores was examined in a cohort of 384 nondemented, community-dwelling women, aged 60 years and older, participating in a single-site Women's Health Initiative ancillary study. Each participant and her respective informant separately completed the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). Participants also underwent neuropsychological testing and responded to questionnaires on depression and functioning in complex activities of daily living. All neuropsychological test scores were significantly correlated (P values <0.05 to <0.01) with IQCODE ratings whereas Self-ratings overestimated cognitive functioning in some domains. Furthermore, the Self and Informant ratings were both positively correlated with depression and negatively correlated with participants' activity level. Therefore, informant judgments of functional abilities are robust predictors of cognitive status in high functioning nondemented women. These results suggest that informants may be sensitive to changes that are not clinically significant but that may represent an incipient trend for decline.",

Participants' characteristics were assessed at baseline, at 6 and 12 months [fall in the earlier 6 mo, anthropometric data, comorbidities, Mini-Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating, Basic Activities of Daily Living (BADL), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire, Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview and Mini-Nutritional Assessment]. Multivariate logistic regression models and generalized linear models were used to explore risk factors for falls and changes in health and function. Two hundred twenty-three participants fell during the 12 months follow-up (35.62%). Risk factors identified for falls were age (odds ratio (OR)=1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.00-1.05), BADL (OR=1.18, 95% CI, 1.05-1.32), and earlier fall (OR=2.30, 95% CI, 1.57-3.35). Fallers had worse health than nonfallers, and their dependence increased significantly more in BADL during the study, compared with nonfallers. Dependence in BADL is a risk factor and a consequence of falls; interventions aimed at preventing falls in dementia patients could promote autonomy in BADL and slow its decline.",

All the patients, who matched the prescribing recommendations for donepezil and were able to participate in the study, received donepezil (5 to 10 mg/d) for 6 months. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of adverse events. Secondary outcome measures were neuropsychiatric function measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), the Mini-Mental State Evaluation, and caregiver burden measured by the Zarit scale. Five hundred and twenty-nine patients were included of which 455 completed the study. The mean baseline NPI score was 19.1. Sixty-five patients (12.3%) experienced an adverse event. The most frequent adverse events were diarrhea and agitation (<2%). Seventeen patients (3%) presented with a neuropsychiatric adverse event and 11 (2%) patients presented with a neurologic adverse event over the course of the study. NPI scores improved by 34.4% over the course of the study, with all items showing a statistically significant improvement. Mini-Mental State Evaluation scores and Zarit caregiver burden scores also improved by 1.27 points and 5.9 points, respectively. This study showed a low incidence of adverse events accompanied by an improvement in the neuropsychiatric and cognitive functions in patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer disease treated with donepezil in a community setting in Spain. Donepezil also reduced caregiver burden.",

The typical explanation for failure to respond to research participation options is a widespread mistrust of research and the biomedical community. Mistrust is a reasonable response; given the historic reality of malfeasance, victimization, and mistreatment over the course of the research participation history of African Americans. The challenges are real but there are opportunities for successful recruitment and retention of African Americans for research including research on Alzheimer disease. Participation, however, comes with specific terms and considerations. Two of the most prominent criteria for research recruitment and retention are the transparency and accountability of the investigator, which may determine how he or she proceeds from the start of the process throughout the steps of recruitment, retention, and subsequent follow-up with the community.",

    "abstract": "CHF5074 has been shown to inhibit brain β-amyloid deposition and attenuate memory deficits in different transgenic mice models of Alzheimer disease. We evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of 3 ascending dose regimens of CHF5074 (200, 400, and 600 mg/d for 14 d) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study involving 48 healthy subjects. Plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected for measuring drug and main metabolite concentrations and potential biomarkers of pharmacodynamic activity (β-amyloid1-40, β-amyloid1-42, soluble CD40 ligand, and tumor necrosis factor-α). All subjects completed the study, and no serious or severe adverse events were reported. The maximum tolerated dose was close to 600 mg/d with mild diarrhea being the most frequent adverse event at this dose. CHF5074 reached peak plasma levels 2 to 3 hours after drug administration and then was slowly eliminated (t(1/2z)=30 h) in the urine as glucoronide. Systemic exposure to the drug appeared to be dose-proportional with a 2-fold accumulation ratio at steady state. Metabolite plasma levels peaked at 4 to 5 hours and accounted for about 25% of the parent compound. Drug levels in the CSF were dose-proportional. The drug dose-dependently lowered the levels of the soluble CD40 ligand, a marker of microglia activation, in both plasma and CSF samples.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that has been predicted to affect 106.2 million people worldwide by 2050. Currently, definitive diagnosis for this disease is given post mortem, and there is a need for biomarker identification to enable earlier diagnosis of this disease. Biomarkers of AD would ideally represent early disease process and will be present in peripheral tissue before cognitive decline develops in this population. Proteomic technologies offer a strategy to undertake such work. In recent times, research in this field has moved away from classical 2-dimensional gel-based proteomics toward more sensitive, non-gel-based proteomic methodologies. In the study presented here, isobaric labeling for relative and absolute quantification was used to assess plasma protein expression in a small group of AD and control samples. Several proteins were identified as being differentially expressed between these 2 populations. Complement 4a plasma protein was identified as increased in AD by isobaric labeling for relative and absolute quantification, and this finding was further validated by Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These data suggest that inflammatory processes, which have been shown to be involved in AD pathology in the brain, are also present in plasma.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic encephalopathy is clinically characterized by acquired behavior and cognitive dysfunction but its pathogenesis is not clear. This study aimed to explore the pathogenesis of diabetic encephalopathy and the mechanisms of ghrelin to ameliorate cognitive dysfunction in diabetic rats. Thirty-six streptozotocin diabetic rat models were established; 12 weeks later, all the rats were randomly divided into 3 groups [diabetic model group (D), ghrelin treatment group (T1), and ghrelin and D-lys-3-GHRP-6 treatment group (T2)] of 12 each. Twelve normoglycemic rats were classified in the normal group (N). Learning and memory behaviors were measured using a spatial version of the Morris water maze test. The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB), phosphorylated CREB (p-CREB), phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2), caspase-3, and Bcl-xl protein expressions in the hippocampi of all the rats were detected using immunohistochemistry. The mRNA expressions of BDNF, CREB, and caspase-3 were examined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The hippocampus neuronal apoptosis was measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling method. We found that learning and memory level in the ghrelin treatment group improved significantly, expression of Bcl-xl, BDNF, CREB, p-CREB, and p-ERK1/2 in the hippocampus was increased in the ghrelin treatment group, and the number of apoptotic neurons in the hippocampus decreased remarkably. Our results showed that the changes of BDNF, CREB, and hippocampus neuronal apoptosis might be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic encephalopathy. We suggested that ghrelin improved cognitive ability in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats by improving the expressions of BDNF and CREB and by attenuating hippocampus neuronal apoptosis. The effects of ghrelin depend on the receptor of ghrelin, GHSR-1a, and ERK1/2 pathway.",

Many with SMI are cognitively healthy and require only reassurance. In the absence of reliable and easily available biomarkers of dementia, clinical signs may be the most effective way of differentiating cognitively healthy SMI individuals from those with underlying brain disease. Collateral history is important in the assessment of memory complaints, so patients are routinely instructed to bring a relative, friend, or a carer to clinic with them. Attending the clinic alone despite these instructions, the \"attended alone\" sign, is shown in this study to be not only a robust marker of absence of dementia but also of cognitively healthy individuals with SMI.",

The Clinician Partners Program (CPP) was initiated to enhance rural health providers' ability in the diagnosis of dementia and care, and to increase research recruitment into dementia research studies of participants from rural communities. The CPP is a 3-day \"miniresidency\" of didactic, observational, and skill-based teaching techniques. Participants completed pretests and posttests evaluating dementia knowledge, confidence in providing care, and practice behaviors. Between 2000 and 2009, 146 health care professionals with a mean age of 45.7±10.8 years attended the CPP; 79.2% were white, 58.2% were women, and 58% of participants had been in practice for more than 10 years. Posttests showed an improvement in knowledge and confidence for diagnosis and treatment and increased the use of dementia screening tools. Rural research participation in an urban Alzheimer Disease Research Center increased 52% over the pre-CPP period. The following primary goals were accomplished: increased knowledge and confidence, changed practice habits, and enhanced research recruitment. Educational programs such as the CPP may be beneficial for increasing access to accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment for Alzheimer disease while also enhancing research participation.",

    "abstract": "Background: Several reports suggest that the reelin protein could play a role in Alzheimer pathophysiology. This led us to ask whether genetic variability in the reelin pathway may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: This was a case-control study in which neuropsychological tests were administered and peripheral blood samples taken. The study included 121 patients with AD, 94 with MCI, and 198 controls. Forty biallelic variants single nucleotide polimorphisms were genotyped in 8 genes related to reelin signaling pathway using a SNPlex genotyping system, and allele frequencies were compared between patients and controls using χ2 tests and obtaining odds ratios (OR). Results: A total of 413 subjects with complete neuropsychological data were analyzed. A significant association between the genotypes RELN (rs528528 and rs2299356), PLK2 (rs15009 and rs702723), and CAMK2A (rs3756577 and rs3822606) and AD or MCI was found. A significant association also was found between the GG genotype at the RELN-rs2299356 and the risk of AD (OR=2.68, P=0.003) and between the AG genotype at the CAMK2A-rs3822606 (OR=2.13, P=0.004). We found a protective effect of the RELN-rs528528 CT genotype and MCI (OR=0.36, P=0.002), and the PLK2-rs15009 CC and GG genotypes and CC genotype at PLK2-rs702723 with OR ranging from 0.40 to 0.57 on AD. These data suggest that TT or CT genotypes at CAMK2A-rs3756577 is associated with risk reduction for AD and MCI ranging from 2 to nearly 8 times. Conclusions: Our data suggest a possible relation between certain reelin signaling pathway genotypes and cognitive impairment related to AD.",

Fewer studies have examined the relationship between both Alzheimer and cerebrovascular pathology, and antemortem brain imaging. The aim of this study was to correlate antemortem brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes with postmortem brain pathology (both Alzheimer-related and cerebrovascular) in a community-derived cohort from the Framingham Heart Study. Participants (n=59) from the Framingham Heart Study were included if they were enrolled in the brain autopsy program and underwent antemortem clinical evaluation, neuropsychological testing, and brain MRI. Cortical neurofibrillary tangle pathology correlated with lower total cerebral brain (β±SE=-0.04±0.01, P=0.004) and hippocampal volumes (β±SE=-0.03±0.02, P=0.044) and larger temporal horns (log-transformed, β±SE=0.05±0.01, P=0.001). Similar findings were seen between total/cortical neuritic plaques and total cerebral brain and temporal horn volume. White matter hyperintensities (also log-transformed) were best predicted by the presence of deep nuclei microinfarcts (β±SE=0.53±0.21, P=0.016), whereas hippocampal volume was significantly decreased in the presence of hippocampal sclerosis (β±SE=-1.23±0.30, P<0.001). This study showed that volumetric MRI measures correlated with postmortem Alzheimer-related and cerebrovascular neuropathology in this community-derived cohort, confirming that these MRI measures are important antemortem surrogates for these dementia-related pathologies.",

Each of the 401 participants were randomly assigned to either the eMoCA (N=182) or MoCA (N=219). Scores were adjusted by self-reported demographic and health information using regression analysis. The difference in average scores (26.21±3.11 for the MoCA group and 24.84±4.21 for the eMoCA group) was found to be statistically significant. Controlling for the effect of potential covariate factors with regression analyses, the adjusted difference is -0.90 (95% confidence interval, -1.45 to -0.35). This difference may be due to factors related to use of the electronic device or software usability. However, the standardized, self-administered eMoCA may offer an opportunity for health systems to screen for early changes in cognitive function in primary care settings and offer greater access to assessment for rural or remote communities. Population-level research may be required to identify whether the score difference between test versions requires a downward adjustment to the eMoCA score taken as indicative of cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome of language decline caused by neurodegenerative pathology. Although language impairments in PPA are typically localized via the morphometric assessment of atrophy, functional changes may accompany or even precede detectable structural alterations, in which case resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) could provide an alternative approach. The goal of this study was to determine whether language network RSFC is reduced in early-stage PPA when atrophy is not prominent. We identified 10 individuals with early-stage agrammatic variant of PPA with no prominent cortical thinning compared with nonaphasic controls. RSFC between 2 nodes of the language network and 2 nodes of the default mode network were compared between agrammatic variant of PPA and healthy control participants. Language network connectivity was comparable with controls among patients with milder agrammatism, but was significantly reduced in patients with more pronounced agrammatism. No group differences were observed in default mode network connectivity, demonstrating specificity of findings. In early stages of PPA when cortical atrophy is not prominent, RSFC provides an alternative method for probing the neuroanatomic substrates of language impairment. RSFC may be of particular utility in studies on early interventions for neurodegenerative disease, either to identify anatomic targets for intervention or as an outcome measure of therapeutic efficacy.",

Cox regression was used to examine associations with age, sex, years of education, and apolipoprotein (APOE)-ε4. Among 173 incident cases of dementia, the overall rate was 14.4/1000/y, with rates being slightly higher among women (15.9/1000) than men (12.5/1000). Rates roughly doubled every 5 years for dementia and AD; the age trend for VaD and other dementias was less consistent. Sex was not significantly related to incidence of dementia or its subtypes in adjusted models. There was a trend for an inverse association with increasing years of education. APOE-ε4 was a strong risk factor for all dementias [hazard ratio (HR)=2.89; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.88-4.46], AD (HR=3.27; 95% CI, 2.03-5.28), and VaD (HR=3.33; 95% CI, 1.34-8.27).

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to compare the demographic and vascular characteristics and APOE genotypes of a dysexecutive subgroup of Alzheimer disease (AD) with an amnestic subgroup of AD early in the disease course. A total of 2224 participants from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database who carried a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (n=1188) or mild AD (clinical dementia rating ≤1) (n=1036) were included in this study. A subset of the mild cognitive impairment (n=61) and mild AD (n=79) participants underwent an autopsy. A dysexecutive subgroup (n=587) was defined as having executive performance >1 SD worse than memory performance, and an amnestic subgroup (n=549) was defined conversely. Among the autopsy subset, the odds of an AD pathologic diagnosis were compared in the 2 subgroups. The demographics, APOE[Latin Small Letter Open E]4 status, and vascular risk factors were compared in the 2 subgroups. Among the autopsy subset, the odds of having an AD pathologic diagnosis did not differ between the dysexecutive and amnestic subgroups. Under an additive model, participants in the dysexecutive subgroup possessed the APOE[Latin Small Letter Open E]4 allele less frequently compared with those in the amnestic subgroup. The dysexecutive subgroup had a history of hypertension less frequently compared with the amnestic subgroup. These distinct characteristics add to accumulating evidence that a dysexecutive subgroup of AD may have a unique underlying pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Sustained treatment with effective doses of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine is crucial to transfer treatment effects in dementia. Numerous studies, with often small samples sizes, describe low adherence rates. The purpose of current study was to examine the medical adherence of antidementia therapy in Austria. We analyzed the data of 10 Austrian Health Insurance Funds, including treatment-naive dementia patients. Study outcome measures were discontinuation, switching, number of days on therapy, Medication-Possession-Ratio, and compliance. A total of 15,809 patients (mean age: 79.9 y, female: 67.3%) met the study's inclusion criteria. After stratification by index medication there were 40.3% on donepezil (n=6371); 26.6% on rivastigmine (n=4206); 15.3% on galantamine (n=2424); and 17.8% on memantine (n=2808). After 6 and 12 months on therapy, 5376 (34.0%) and 9243 (58.5%) patients stopped the initially prescribed antidementia therapy; after 12 months the highest discontinuation rate was seen for patients taking rivastigmine (67.3%), whereas patients on memantine (45.0%) had the lowest. After 12 months, a total of 1874 (11.9%) patients switched from their index medication to another cholinesterase inhibitor or memantine. A total of 6163 patients (39.0%) were compliant (Medication-Possession-Ratio >80%) during the first 6 months and 5366 patients (33.9%) during 12 months of the study. Our study shows that memantine-treated patients adhere significantly better to treatment. Specifically, after 12 months, 45.0% discontinued medication, 7.9% switched, and 50.8% of patients on therapy were compliant.",

    "abstract": "Background: Amyloid-β positron emission tomography (PET) allows for in vivo detection of fibrillar amyloid plaques, a pathologic hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, amyloid-β PET interpretation is limited by the imperfect correlation between PET and autopsy, and the fact that it is positive in about 20% to 30% of cognitively normal individuals and non-AD dementias, especially when older or carrying the ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE4). When facing a positive amyloid PET, clinicians have to evaluate the probability of a pathologic false positive as well as the probability of amyloid positivity being age-related, comorbid to a primary non-AD dementia (clinicopathologic false positive). These probabilities can be calculated to reach an evidence-based interpretation of amyloid-β. As literature review and calculations cannot be easily performed in the day-to-day clinic, we propose a clinician friendly, evidence-based Bayesian approach to the interpretation of amyloid-β PET results in the differential diagnosis of patients with cognitive impairment. Methods: We defined AD as a clinicopathologic entity in which amyloid-β is the primary cause of cognitive impairment. We systematically reviewed the literature to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of amyloid-β PET against neuropathologic examination. We inferred rates of clinicopathologic false positivity (non-AD dementia with comorbid amyloid) based on age-dependent and ApoE-dependent prevalence of amyloid positivity in normal individuals and AD patients provided in large meta-analyses published by the Amyloid Biomarker Study Group. We calculated positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of amyloid-β PET, which are presented in a clinician-friendly table. Results: PPV of PET is highest in young ApoE4− patients with high pre-PET probability of AD. In older ApoE4+ patients with low pre-PET probability of AD, positive amyloid-β PET scans must be interpreted with caution. A negative amyloid-β PET makes a diagnosis of AD unlikely except in old patients with high pre-PET probability of AD. Conclusion: This evidence-based approach might provide guidance to clinicians and nuclear medicine physicians to interpret amyloid-β PET results for early and differential diagnosis of patients with progressive cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Little is known on how risk factors for Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia affect disease progression, much less for populations with low mean schooling, whereas the transcription of APOE may be regulated by nongenetic factors. In this 44-month cohort study, 214 consecutive outpatients with late-onset AD were assessed for rates of cognitive and functional decline by way of Clinical Dementia Rating and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, keeping blinded assessment of APOE haplotypes. Subjects were evaluated for sex, schooling, age of dementia onset, and cerebrovascular risk factors (including Framingham risk scores). Of the 214 patients, there were 146 (68.2%) women and 113 (52.8%) APOE4+ carriers. The mean age of AD onset was 73.4±6.5 years-old, negatively correlated with time to Clinical Dementia Rating >1.0 (β=-0.132; ρ<0.001), MMSE=20 (β=-0.105; ρ<0.001), and MMSE=15 (β=-0.124; ρ=0.003), more significantly for women and APOE4+ carriers. Mean schooling was 4.18±3.7 years, correlated with time to MMSE=20 and MMSE=15 for women and APOE4+ carriers. Body mass index was correlated with time to MMSE=20 only for men (ρ=0.006). The 10-year coronary heart disease risk was correlated with time to MMSE=20 only for APOE4+ carriers (ρ=0.015). These outcomes suggest interactions among genomic effects of cognitive reserve, cerebral perfusion, and hormonal changes over mechanisms of neurodegeneration.",

The inconsistencies may be attributed to the different tasks drawing on different memory processes. Few studies have examined episodic memory impairment in the above groups using memory tests that facilitate encoding, to distinguish memory deficits due to impairment of specific processes.We examined the memory performance of 106 AD patients, 51 FTD patients, 26 DLB/PDD patients, and 37 controls using the Five-Words Test, a 5-item memory test that facilitates encoding.The patient groups did not differ in modified Mini Mental State Examination scores. AD patients scored lowest on the Five-Words Test overall, and showed the greatest reduction from immediate total recall to delayed free recall relative to the other 2 groups, consistent with a predominantly consolidation deficit. DLB/PDD patients showed the largest improvement from delayed free to delayed total recall relative to the other 2 groups, consistent with a predominantly retrieval deficit.Deficits in both consolidation and retrieval underlie the memory impairment of the patients, to different extents, and contribute to the theoretical understanding of the nature of the memory impairment of the patient groups.",

    "abstract": "Characterize the onset and timing of cognitive decline in Parkinson disease (PD) from the first recognizable stage of cognitively symptomatic PD-mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) to PD dementia (PDD). Thirty-nine participants progressed from PD to PDD and 25 remained cognitively normal.Bayesian-estimated disease-state models described the onset of an individual's cognitive decline across 12 subtests with a change point.Subtests measuring working memory, visuospatial processing ability, and crystalized memory changed significantly 3 to 5 years before their first nonzero Clinical Dementia Rating and progressively worsened from PD to PD-MCI to PDD. Crystalized memory deficits were the hallmark feature of imminent conversion of cognitive status. Episodic memory tasks were not sensitive to onset of PD-MCI. For cognitively intact PD, all 12 subtests showed modest linear decline without evidence of a change point.Longitudinal disease-state models support a prodromal dementia stage (PD-MCI) marked by early declines in working memory and visuospatial processing beginning 5 years before clinical diagnosis of PDD. Cognitive declines in PD affect motor ability (bradykinesia), working memory, and processing speed (bradyphrenia) resulting in PD-MCI where visuospatial imagery and memory retrieval deficits manifest before eventual development of overt dementia. Tests of episodic memory may not be sufficient to detect and quantify cognitive decline in PD.",

Cognition was evaluated at baseline (2005 to 2009) and at the follow-up visit (2011 to 2013). We used a test battery that tapped into domains of executive function, information processing speed, motor speed, and memory. The volumetric measures assessed were total brain volume, lobar (gray matter and white matter) volumes, and hippocampal volumes. We also studied the association of WML volumes and lacunes with cognitive decline using linear regression models.Total brain volume was associated with decline in global cognition, information processing, and motor speed (P<0.001) in analyses controlled for demographic and vascular factors. Specifically, smaller frontal and parietal lobes were associated with decline in information processing and motor speed, and smaller temporal and parietal lobes were associated with decline in general cognition and motor speed (P<0.001 for all tests). Total WML volume was associated with decline in executive function. Lobar WML volume, hippocampal volume, and lacunes were not associated with cognitive decline.Lower brain volume is associated with subsequent cognitive decline. Although lower total brain volume was significantly associated with decline in global cognition, specific lobar volumes were associated with decline in certain cognitive domains.",

Methods: The Honolulu Heart Program is a prospective study that began in 1965 with 8006 Japanese-American men aged 45 to 68 years. Mid-life proteinuria was detected by urine dipstick in 1971 to 1974. The Honolulu-Asia Aging Study began 20 years later, with cognitive assessment by the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) in 3734 men. Standard criteria were used to classify 8-year incident dementia and subtypes. Results: The age-adjusted incidence of dementia increased significantly from 13.8, to 22.8, to 39.7 per 1000 person years follow-up, among those with no, trace, and positive mid-life proteinuria (P=0.004). Using linear regression adjusting for age, education, APOEε4, stroke, hypertension, systolic blood pressure, diabetes, fasting blood glucose, physical activity, and baseline CASI, those with positive proteinuria had significantly higher annual change in CASI over 8 years follow-up (−1.24, P=0.02) (reference=no proteinuria). Multivariate Cox regression found that positive proteinuria had a significant association with incident all-cause dementia (RR=2.66; 95%CI, 1.09-6.53; P=0.03), but no significant associations with incident Alzheimer disease or vascular dementia. Conclusion: Mid-life proteinuria was an independent predictor for late-life incident all-cause dementia and cognitive decline over 8 years.",

    "abstract": "Understanding whether the cognitive profile of a patient indicates mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or performance levels within normality is often a clinical challenge. The use of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) and machine learning may represent valid aids in clinical settings for the identification of MCI patients.Machine-learning models were computed to test the classificatory accuracy of cognitive, volumetric [structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI)] and blood oxygen level dependent-connectivity (extracted from RS-fMRI) features, in single-modality and mixed classifiers.The best and most significant classifier was the RS-fMRI+Cognitive mixed classifier (94% accuracy), whereas the worst performing was the sMRI classifier (∼80%). The mixed global (sMRI+RS-fMRI+Cognitive) had a slightly lower accuracy (∼90%), although not statistically different from the mixed RS-fMRI+Cognitive classifier. The most important cognitive features were indices of declarative memory and semantic processing. The crucial volumetric feature was the hippocampus. The RS-fMRI features selected by the algorithms were heavily based on the connectivity of mediotemporal, left temporal, and other neocortical regions.Feature selection was profoundly driven by statistical independence. Some features showed no between-group differences, or showed a trend in either direction. This indicates that clinically relevant brain alterations typical of MCI might be subtle and not inferable from group analysis.",

Recently selective tau tracers for positron emission tomography (PET) have been developed to determine the presence of cerebral tau deposits in vivo. Here, we investigated the topographical distribution of THK5351 in svPPA patients. Materials and Methods: Five svPPA patients, 14 Alzheimer’s disease patients, and 15 age-matched normal controls underwent [ 18 F]-THK5351 PET scans, magnetic resonance imaging, and detailed neuropsychological tests. [ 18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET was obtained in 3 svPPA patients, whereas the remaining 2 underwent amyloid PET using [ 18 F]-flutemetamol. Tau distribution among the 3 groups was compared using regions of interest–based and voxel-based statistical analyses. Results: In svPPA patients, [ 18 F]-THK5351 retention was elevated in the anteroinferior and lateral temporal cortices compared with the normal controls group (left&gt;right), and in the left inferior and temporal polar region compared with Alzheimer’s disease patients. [ 18 F]-THK5351 retention inversely correlated with glucose metabolism, whereas regional THK retention correlated with clinical severity. [ 18 F]-flutemetamol scans were negative for β-amyloid. Conclusions: These findings show that [ 18 F]-THK5351 retention may be detected in cortical regions correlating with svPPA pathology.",

Therefore, an assessment strategy has recently been developed for the prediction of fitness to drive in patients with the Alzheimer disease (AD). The aim of this study was to investigate whether this strategy is also predictive of fitness to drive in patients with non-AD dementia, that is, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies. Predictors were derived from 3 types of assessment: clinical interviews, neuropsychological tests, and driving simulator rides. The criterion was the pass-fail outcome of an official on-road driving assessment. About half of the patients with non-AD dementia (n=34) failed the on-road driving assessment. Neuropsychological assessment [area under the curve (AUC)=0.786] was significantly predictive of fitness to drive in patients with non-AD dementia, however, clinical interviews (AUC=0.559) and driving simulator rides (AUC=0.404) were not. The fitness-to-drive assessment strategy with the 3 types of assessment combined (AUC=0.635) was not found to significantly predict fitness to drive in non-AD dementia. Different types of dementia require different measures and assessment strategies.",

However, the association between diabetic retinopathy (DR) and risk of dementia in type 1 diabetes is unknown. We investigated the association between DR and incident dementia in a large, elderly population with type 1 diabetes. Methods: A cohort of 3742 patients with type 1 diabetes aged 50 years and above was followed from January 1, 1996 to September 30, 2015 for incident dementia. DR diagnoses were identified from electronic medical records. Age as timescale Cox proportional hazard models evaluated associations between time-updated DR and dementia risk. Models were adjusted for demographics, severe glycemic events, glycosylated hemoglobin, and vascular comorbidities. Results: Among 3742 patients with type 1 diabetes (47% female, 21% nonwhite), 182 (5%) were diagnosed with dementia during a mean follow-up of 6.2 years. No significant association was found between DR and incident dementia in the main analyses [adjusted Hazard Ratio=1.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.82-1.54), nor among subgroup restricted to those aged 60 years and above or 70 years and above.

    "abstract": "Background: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has not been administered to a representative national sample, precluding comparison of patient scores to the general population and for risk factor identification. Methods: A validated survey-based adaptation of the MoCA (MoCA-SA) was administered to a probability sample of home-dwelling US adults aged 62 to 90, using the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (n=3129), yielding estimates of prevalence in the United States. The association between MoCA-SA scores and sociodemographic and health-related risk factors were determined. Results: MoCA-SA scores decreased with age, and there were substantial differences among sex, education, and race/ethnicity groups. Poor physical health, functional status, and depression were also associated with lower cognitive performance; current health behaviors were not. Using the recommended MoCA cut-point score for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MoCA score &lt;26; MoCA-SA score &lt;17), 72% (95% confidence interval, 69% to 74%) of older US adults would be classified as having some degree of cognitive impairment. Conclusions: Our results provide an important national estimate for interpreting MoCA scores from individual patients, and establish wide variability in cognition among older home-dwelling US adults. Care should be taken in applying previously-established MoCA cut-points to the general population, especially when evaluating individuals from educationally and ethnically diverse groups.",

Memory tests including Logical Memory and Visual Reproductions were administered from 2005 to 2008. Linear and logistic regression examined the association between FSRP and memory measures. Interaction between the presence of the ApoE4 allele and each FSRP component on the memory measures was also assessed.FSRP and the individual components of age, sex, and smoking were related to lower standard scores of memory. The new error response analyses reinforced the standard analyses and also identified new relationships. Participants with diabetes were found to make more errors on Logical Memory, and those with a history of smoking were found to make more errors on Visual Reproductions. Lastly, ApoE4 smokers experienced significant verbal memory loss, whereas ApoE4 smokers did not.Middle-aged healthy adults with cardiovascular risk factors including diabetes, history of smoking, and ApoE4 positivity were found to have greater later-life memory impairments.",

A bootstrapping mediation analysis investigated the directionality of the mobility-cognition association.LE (Est.=-2.95±0.77, P=0.001) but not UE impairment (Est.=-1.43±1.05, P=0.175) was associated with a poorer global cognitive performance/impairment. The presence of mobility limitation had the strongest effect on cognition (Est.=-3.78±1.09, P<0.001) adjusting for sociodemographic factors, body composition, comorbidities, and mood. Mediation analysis indicated that the relationship between cognition and mobility likely operates in both directions.The association between cognitive function and mobility follows a dose-response pattern in which the likelihood of poor global cognition increases with the progression of mobility dysfunction, with evidence that LE impairments may be better indicators of an impaired cognitive status than UE impairments. Using brief, valid tools to screen older patients for early signs of mobility dysfunction, especially when the LE is affected, is feasible, and may provide the first detectable stage of future cognitive impairment and provide actionable steps for interventions to improve performance, reduce burden, and prevent the development of physical disability and loss of independence.",

Frontotemporal dementia patients had a relatively higher prevalence of PI and more often due to criminal behavior. The recurrence of PIs differed among the groups; frontotemporal dementia patients exhibited a higher PI recurrence compared with the other groups.The patterns of PIs differ between the frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer disease patients. Knowledge about such differences may be of value for the police, the judiciary system, and the society in general.",

One model was run for each AD risk factor, including: objectively-defined subtle cognitive decline (Obj-SCD), and genetic susceptibility [apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) as well as cerebrospinal fluid β-amyloid (Aβ), total tau (tau), and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau).The 3-way diabetes×AD risk factor×time interaction predicted increased rates of functional decline in models that examined Obj-SCD, APOE ε4, tau, and p-tau positivity, but not Aβ positivity.Participants with both diabetes and at least 1 AD risk factor (ie, Obj-SCD, APOE ε4, tau, and p-tau positivity) demonstrated faster functional decline compared with those without both risk factors (diabetes or AD). These findings have implications for early identification of, and perhaps earlier intervention for, diabetic individuals at risk for future functional difficulty.",

Age of MCI and AD diagnoses and time to convert were recorded and compared across language groups. Patients: Patients were consecutive patients diagnosed with MCI at a hospital memory clinic. Results: Bilingual patients were diagnosed with MCI at a later age than monolingual patients (77.8 and 75.5 y, respectively), a difference that was significant in some analyses. However, bilingual patients converted faster from MCI to AD than monolingual patients (1.8 and 2.8 y, respectively) resulting in no language group difference in age of AD diagnosis. This relationship held after accounting for education, cognitive level, immigration status, and sex. Discussion: The findings suggest that greater cognitive reserve as measured by language status leads to faster conversion between MCI and AD, all else being equal.",

Definitions and criteria for known conditions are being periodically revised and refined, and new findings are being made about neuropathologic features associated with dementia status. The database maintained by the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) offer researchers a robust, rapid, and statistically well-powered method to evaluate the implications of newly identified neuropathologic conditions with regards to comorbidities, demographic associations, cognitive status, neuropsychologic tests, radiographic findings, and genetics. NACC data derive from dozens of excellent US Alzheimer disease research centers, which collectively follow thousands of research volunteers longitudinally. Many of the research participants are autopsied using state-of-the-art methods. In this article, we describe the NACC database and give examples of its use in evaluating recently revised neuropathologic diagnoses, including primary age-related tauopathy (PART), limbic predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE), and the preclinical stage of Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change, based on the National Institute on Aging—Alzheimer’s Association consensus guidelines. The dementia research community is encouraged to make use of this readily available database as new neuropathologic changes are recognized and defined in this rapidly evolving field.",

Materials and Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched until March 2020. The cognitive outcomes were extracted and the standardized mean difference with 95% confidence interval was calculated. Results: Twenty-eight studies were included. The result of NIBS showed significant effect on global cognition ( P &lt;0.05). Low-frequency rTMS over right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), high-frequency rTMS (HF-rTMS) over left DLPFC, and the tDCS over left DLPFC and temporal lobe can significantly improve the memory function ( P &lt;0.05). HF-rTMS over left, right, or bilateral DLPFC can significantly improve the language function ( P &lt;0.05). Both HF-rTMS and tDCS over left DLPFC can obviously improve the executive function ( P &lt;0.05). Multiple sessions of rTMS with 80% to 100% intensity and anode tDCS with 2 mA current density are more suitable for all these functions. Conclusions: NIBS has a beneficial effect on cognitive performance in both mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease patients. Distinct optimal stimulation parameters were observed for different cognitive functions.",

People with LBD were interested in pathophysiology and more bothered by motor symptoms; caregivers were interested in risk factors and symptomatic therapies and more bothered by neuropsychiatric symptoms. Few available LBD treatments and resources were rated as helpful, and many valuable services were never received. Previous participation in LBD research was infrequent, but interest was high. Discussion: People with LBD and caregivers highlighted the need for research across all aspects of LBD, from pathophysiology and disease modification to prognosis, education, symptomatic treatments, and caregiver support.

Among caregiver wives and the younger caregiver husbands (64 years old and under) the volume of patient problem behavior was significantly negatively associated with total scores on a summary well being measure. The association was not found within the older husband caregiver group. Considering five subdimensions of the summary well being scale (Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms, Positive Well Being, Vitality and General Health), correlational analyses showed that the total patient problems measure appeared to have impact primarily among wife caregivers, particularly those 64 years old and under. Multiple regression analyses showed that one patient problem behavior category, Emotional Lability, was the single strongest predictor of impaired well being of the caregiver among all five subdimensions of the caregiver well being measure. Although Destructive Behavior of the patient was not significant by itself, an Age by Destructive Behavior interaction showed that high levels of patient Destructive Behavior predicted high levels of Depression, Anxiety, and low levels of Positive Well Being more among younger caregivers. Husband caregivers had significantly higher Anxiety scores than wife caregivers. These findings document how particular patient problem behaviors can affect caregivers. They point up as well how both gender and age may help target which caregivers are most vulnerable to the stress of specific Alzheimer patient behavior problems. They also suggest the utility of examining specific dimensions of well being rather than a total score alone for purposes of understanding the relationship of particular patient behavior problems to caregiver emotional and physical health.",

Prevalence, persistence, and emergence of depressive symptoms at baseline were 51%, 55%, and 20%, respectively. Remission of depressive symptoms at 12 months leads to a decreased frequency of other noncognitive disorders and to a slight improvement in the assessment of global function. The presence of depressive symptoms does not affect the course of cognitive impairment at 12 months, and a psychiatric history of the patient and the number of depressive symptoms at baseline are risk factors for the emergence and persistence of depressive symptoms at 12 months.",

Vascular dementia (VD) may occur as strokes superimposed on presymptomatic DAT, in which case APOE-epsilon 4 frequency should also be increased in VD. We have examined the distribution of APOE-epsilon 4 in patients with DAT (n = 176) or VD (n = 74) and controls (n = 133), and evaluated the risk of dementia associated with APOE-epsilon 4. APOE-epsilon 4 allele frequency was 27% in DAT patients, 21% in VD patients, and 11% in controls. The difference in the distribution of the epsilon 4 allele between DAT or VD patients and controls was statistically significant (chi(2) test, p < 0.05), with a 3.6- and 2.1-fold risk of dementia in DAT and VD patients carrying an epsilon 4 allele. The result that the APOE-epsilon 4 allele is more frequent in DAT patients than in controls, with VD patients falling in between, is consistent with the assumption that VD is a heterogeneous condition, with some patients having an underlying preclinical brain degeneration, in whom the dementia was precipitated by strokes.",

Instruments are described in terms of the population on which they were developed, the symptoms assessed, informant, by whom administered, time to administer, time interval covered, number of items, measurement of frequency and severity, assessment of impact on caregiver, reliability, validity, and scoring. Recommendations are made concerning the best use of each scale. We summarize in table form the sources of information for instruments, characteristics of the instruments by domain, and potential use of instruments for quantification or management of symptoms and for estimation of caregiver burden. There are a number of reliable and valid scales for the assessment of psychiatric symptoms in AD, each with specific assets and liabilities. Knowledge of the specifics of these scales will enable clinicians and researchers to select the best instruments for their particular needs and to design more effective instruments.",

Many articles have described strategies to enhance participation including establishing enduring ties to the community and tailoring the site to be more culturally welcoming or user-friendly to the community. Yet, most of these reports are not data driven. To get a better indication of the knowledge base, this review summarizes research across a broad range of domains (e.g., cancer, kidney disease, AD) that used systematic approaches to identify methods and factors that reduce barriers to recruitment, participation, and retention of a more racially and ethnically diverse population. Overall, 121 reports were found with 8 of these in AD. As a relatively new area of investigation, the literature was primarily descriptive; outcome data were seldom provided. While these studies help to identify areas of potential importance in racial/ethnic participation, hypothesis-driven research remains necessary to tease apart the key techniques that engender racial/ethnic participation in AD studies. This article suggests several recommendations, including the need for prospective research of specific recruitment methods. Fundamentally, researchers should consider that these strategies apply to all potential research participants, and not simply to traditionally underserved racial/ethnic populations.",

However, the role of these abnormalities in the etiology of noncognitive problem behaviors remains poorly understood. Such abnormalities in brain noradrenergic and serotonergic systems are of particular interest because of their apparent involvement in normal regulation of mood, arousal, and aggressive behavior. The nature of the noradrenergic abnormalities in Alzheimer disease is particularly complex, with evidence suggesting both structural damage and compensatory increased norepinephrine release from remaining noradrenergic neurons. Currently available drugs that alter brain noradrenergic or serotonergic activity should be evaluated for efficacy in the management of noncognitive behavioral disorders complicating Alzheimer disease.",

To minimize these side effects, we treated and followed-up a series of 12 demented patients, whose caregivers sought medical help for their disruptive, aggressive behavior, with low-dose propranolol monotherapy (10-80 mg/day). Assessment measures obtained at baseline and during treatment by caregiver interview included ordinal ratings of aggression severity, the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), and the California Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ). The aggression ratings showed that low-dose propranolol effectively reduced aggression in eight of 12 patients (67%) within 2 weeks of treatment and remained effective for the duration of follow-up (1 to 14 months). Subscales of the CMAI showed responders to have significant reductions in physical and verbal aggression/agitation and in pacing/wandering.

Subjects included 85 persons with possible and probable Alzheimer disease (AD), 21 with vascular dementia (VaD), 30 with cognitive symptoms classified as mild/ambiguous (M/A), a heterogenous group of 39 non-AD or VaD subjects but diagnosed with some form of neuropsychiatric disorder (\"Mixed Neuropsychiatric\" group), and 20 normal control subjects aged 65 years or older. Controlling for age, sex, and length of disease, the authors found that AD and VaD subjects differed significantly from control subjects on WMLs, but only the VaD subjects significantly differed from M/A subjects. The two dementia groups also displayed, as expected, significant cerebral atrophy. The WMLs generally increased with age and severity of dementia. PV WMLs were significantly but only modestly associated with white matter volume loss and greater impairment on the MMSE. Modest correlations were also present between the quantitative measures of cerebral structure and MMSE performance. However, when degree of cerebral atrophy was controlled by using the VBR measure, WML effects on MMSE performance became nonsignificant, with the only significant relationship remaining being that between hippocampal volume and MMSE performance. There were no significant qualitative or quantitative findings related to presence of the ε4 allele and MMSE performance. The role of WMLs in aging and dementia is discussed.",

This has led to an intense search for successful treatment strategies. One area of interest is neurotrophic factors. Brain development and neuronal maintenance, as well as protective efforts, are mediated by a large number of different neurotrophic factors acting on specific receptors. In neurodegenerative disorders, there may be a possibility of rescuing degenerating neurons and stimulating terminal outgrowth with use of neurotrophic factors. The first neurotrophic factor discovered was nerve growth factor (NGF). A wealth of animal studies have shown that cholinergic neurons are NGF sensitive and NGF dependent, which is especially interesting in cognitive disorders, in which central cholinergic projections are important for cognitive function. In Alzheimer disease, cholinergic neurons have been shown to degenerate. This suggests that NGF may be used to pharmacologically counteract cholinergic degeneration and/or induce terminal sprouting in Alzheimer disease. Data from animal studies, as well as from the author's recent clinical trial, in which NGF was infused to the lateral ventricle in patients with Alzheimer disease, will be presented. Effects of NGF on cognition, as well as issues regarding dosage, side effects, and alternative ways of administering NGF, will be discussed.",

Circadian integrity returned together with clinical improvement when the patient was subsequently treated with clozapine.

Subjects were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests to determine if severity of dementia in AD correlates with driving performance. On the DPT, the AD patients scored in the average range in two of five skill areas (predicting the effects of a hazard, deciding how to avoid it); below average in two areas (searching for a hazard, executing evasive actions); and poorly in one area (identifying hazards). The elderly controls scored at an average level in all five skill areas. On the DAS, AD patients were significantly slower than the elderly controls on simple, two-choice, and conditional reaction time tests and were much slower than drivers in general. The AD patients' performances on two cognitive tests, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Category Fluency Test, correlated significantly with aspects of performance on the DPT and the DAS. Although these are preliminary results from a pilot investigation, they suggest that AD patients' driving-related abilities are adversely affected by the disease and that driving-related performance tests and neuropsychological tests may be useful in assessing the impact of AD on driving.",

Astrocytes are the principal source of extracellular purines in brain after injury, ischemia, or trauma. In vitro and in vivo extracellular purines have both immediate and long-term trophic effects, including stimulation of astrocyte and neuronal differentiation, mitosis, morphogenesis, apoptosis, and stimulation of growth and trophic factor synthesis. The effects of the nucleoside adenosine and the nucleotide adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are mediated principally via specific receptors on the cell surface coupled to a series of signaling cascades. Unlike adenosine and ATP, guanosine and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) do not act at classical purine receptors. However, they exert similar effects on astrocytes, apparently by causing the astrocytes to release large amounts of adenosine and ATP over prolonged periods. The release of adenosine and ATP may be related to the effects of guanosine on the purine nucleoside transporters in the cell membrane, whereas the release of ATP may be due to the effects of GTP on the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins. Physiologically, the effects of guanosine are important because this nucleoside, unlike adenosine, remains elevated for prolonged periods after brain injury.",

    "abstract": "Summary: We studied a possible correlation between autonomic cardiac activity and the level of the red blood cell acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in patients with probable Alzheimer disease (AD). The influence of cholinesterase inhibitor treatment on this autonomic activity was evaluated. Twelve patients satisfying the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria of probable AD and 10 healthy controls were studied. Autonomic cardiac activity was evaluated by means of power spectral analysis (PSA) of heart rate variability (HRV) using an autoregressive algorithm on 250 consecutive electrocardiographic R–R intervals. All patients received oral eptastigmine, a new cholinesterase inhibitor, for 1 month. Before treatment, a simultaneous recording of the electrocardiographic and respiratory activities was performed at rest and subsequently during head-up tilt test at 70°. Recording was repeated on the last day of treatment. The level of AChE activity during each recording was also evaluated. Spectrum power was calculated in three main frequency bands: high frequency (HF), 0.15–0.4 Hz; low frequency (LF), 0.04–0.15 Hz; very low frequency (VLF), <0.04 Hz. In addition, we calculated the total spectrum power (TSP) and the LF/HF ratio. The TSP and the absolute value of each spectral component were significantly lower in AD patients than in controls. In contrast with controls, AD patients did not show any significant change before treatment in either the LF and HF components or in the LF/HF ratio during the tilt test. However, the modification in the LF component, induced by tilting, showed a significant correlation with the level of AChE activity (p < 0.03). During the tilt test, the treatment caused changes in LF and HF components and in the LF/HF ratio similar to those observed in controls. These results suggest that the presence of autonomic cardiac dysfunction in AD patients might be due to a cholinergic deficit in the peripheral autonomic nervous system. Some aspects of this autonomic dysfunction can be normalized by cholinesterase inhibitor treatment.",

The proper method to measure ADL depends on the purposes to which the scale is to be put. Existing ADL scales differ as to the type of behaviors assessed, the nature of the observations made, and the manner in which the observations are quantified. These scales were not specifically designed to evaluate changes in the nature and extent of the broad spectrum of functional difficulties seen in individuals with AD. We describe the Cleveland Scale for Activities of Daily Living (CSADL), an informant-based instrument designed to expand upon the capacity of existing physical and instrumental ADL scales by assessing both premorbid and current component acts (e.g., initiation versus implementation) of daily living functions.",

The incidence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) was two times higher in the patients who received (74%) than in those who did not receive (36%) treatment with neuroleptics. The development of NFTs started earlier in the treated group. Further studies comparing brains of nine schizophrenics (average age, 86 years) who did not receive treatment with neuroleptics and seven age-matched cases who received neuroleptics, both with neurofibrillary pathology and neuritic plaques, showed characteristic differences. The numerical density of NFTs was slightly greater in the cornu Ammonis (CA1 and CA2) and subiculum of treated patients. Significantly lower numerical density and lower percentage of pretangles (stage 0) and early and mature tangles (stages 1 and 2) and increased number of end-stage tangles (stage 3) were found in the CA, subicular complex, and cerebral cortex of the treated group. These changes suggest accelerated neurofibrillary degeneration in neurons. A significant increase in the numerical density of tau-1-positive plaques was observed in sector CA1 of the CA (from 0.15/mm2 to 17.36/mm2), subiculum (from 0/mm2 to 16.62/mm2), temporal cortex (from 0.14/mm2 to 9.46/mm2), and occipital cortex (from 0.08/mm2 to 0.39/mm2). The higher numerical density of tau-1-positive plaques, but not of 4G8-positive plaques, indicates acceleration of neurofibrillary changes in the plaques of patients treated with neuroleptics. The significant decrease (20-25%) in the numerical density of neurons in the pyramidal layer of sectors 2-4 in the CA appears to be associated with accelerated neurofibrillary changes in neurons and plaques in the treated group. This study demonstrates that chronic treatment with neuroleptics--not schizophrenia itself--significantly increases the risk of more frequent, earlier, and accelerated development of neurofibrillary pathology in the brains of elderly schizophrenics.",

Four areas of patient cognitive ability were examined: memory of recent events, ability to remember a short list of items after a delay, language/naming abilities, and working memory. Primary care practitioners recruited 248 community-dwelling patients aged 75 years or more or aged 50–74 years with suspected memory complaints; 248 friends or relatives acted as informants. More than half of the informants (60%) gave responses consistent with psychometric testing. Informants who underreported patient difficulties tended to report on patients who were diagnosed as having subclinical dementia, were less educated, and had poorer remote memory. Informants who overreported difficulties were more likely to report on those diagnosed with dementia. While informant accounts are critical for the assessment of dementia, we found that in 40% of cases these reports may be inaccurate, particularly when the patient has low education and poor remote memory or when overall cognitive difficulties are mild.",

To minimize these side effects, we treated and followed-up a series of 12 demented patients, whose caregivers sought medical help for their disruptive, aggressive behavior, with low-dose propranolol monotherapy (10–80 mg/day). Assessment measures obtained at baseline and during treatment by caregiver interview included ordinal ratings of aggression severity, the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), and the California Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ). The aggression ratings showed that low-dose propranolol effectively reduced aggression in eight of 12 patients (67%) within 2 weeks of treatment and remained effective for the duration of follow-up (1 to 14 months). Subscales of the CMAI showed responders to have significant reductions in physical and verbal aggression/agitation and in pacing/wandering. These results suggest that low-dose propranolol should be further studied for treating aggression or agitation in demented patients.",

None of the chemical measures showed significant correlation with age, sex, or postmortem delay. As expected, ChAT and AChE activities were closely correlated with one another overall and within the AD and control groups, and the mean values for the AD group were significantly less than those in the controls in each of the cortical regions examined. Specific binding site densities were very variable from brain to brain and did not correlate with ChAT in any group or overall. By analysis of variance, however, binding site densities in the AD group were significantly higher than those in the controls. This difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.05) in Broca's area and the precentral and postcentral gyri, but not in the temporal gyri which generally have greater neuronal loss in AD. Of the 15 miscellaneous neurological cases, the Parkinson patients (n = 3) showed significantly higher binding densities than the controls but the multiinfarct dementia group (n = 5) did not. Single cases of Shy-Drager syndrome and sleep apnea showed a majority of values more than 2 standard deviations above the control means.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Using the 1994 National Long-Term Care Survey merged with Medicare claims and death data, the authors assessed the relative cost to Medicare of covering beneficiaries over 1994–1995 with diagnosed AD relative to other elderly population. They focused on hospitalizations during 1994–1995 for hip fracture, stroke, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, and pneumonia. The authors determined whether differences in Medicare payments by AD status mainly reflected differences in rates of occurrence of hospitalizations for the five primary diagnoses, other primary diagnoses, or death during 1994–1995 or in spending given the adverse events. During 1994–1995, an average of $15,700 was spent by Medicare, per person, for those with diagnosed AD, nearly twice the amount spent on others. The difference in Medicare payments was attributable to more adverse events occurring to AD group. Such persons had higher death rates than other elderly population (odds ratio [OR], 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07–1.62), higher hospitalization rates for hip fracture (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.34–2.87), stroke (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.10–2.68), pneumonia (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.07–1.99), and for other reasons than the five conditions (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.38–1.98), but they also had lower hospitalization rates for the cardiac diseases. There were no differences in Medicare payments according to AD diagnosis, controlling for frequency of deaths, hospitalizations, and other factors. Persons with diagnosed AD cost Medicare more because of more adverse health events rather than in intensity of care, given event occurrence.",

A potential approach to prevention is the use of agents that interfere with the pathogenic cascade initiated by the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ). Tramiprosate (3-amino-1-propanesulfonic acid) is a candidate molecule shown in preclinical studies to reduce CAA in a transgenic mouse model. Methods We performed a 5-center phase 2 double-blinded trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of tramiprosate in subjects with lobar intracerebral hemorrhage. Twenty-four subjects age ≥55 years with possible or probable CAA were randomized to receive 12 weeks of tramiprosate at 1 of 3 oral doses (50, 100, or 150 mg twice daily). Subjects were followed for clinical adverse effects, laboratory, vital sign, electrocardiogram, cognitive, or functional changes, appearance of new symptomatic or asymptomatic hemorrhages, and pharmacokinetic parameters. Results Enrolled subjects were younger (mean age 70.8±5.4, range 61 to 78) and had more advanced baseline disease (measured by number of previous hemorrhages) than consecutive subjects in a CAA natural history cohort. No concerning safety issues were encountered with treatment. Nausea and vomiting were the most common adverse events and were more frequent at high doses. Nine subjects had new symptomatic or asymptomatic hemorrhages during treatment; all occurred in subjects with advanced baseline disease, with no apparent effect of drug dosing assignment. Conclusions These data suggest that tramiprosate can be given safely to subjects with suspected CAA and support future efficacy trials.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiologic studies on dementia generally have 2 major interacting objectives: descriptive, where rates of dementia and Alzheimer Disease (AD) are calculated for communities and selected populations, and analytic, which attempt to explain the observed phenotypic variations in communities and populations by identifying disease risk factors. The public health benefits derived from descriptive studies are exemplified by the recent published review of the global prevalence of dementia under the auspices of Alzheimer Disease International. This review emphasized the enormous and growing burden associated with dementia particularly for countries in the developing world and outlined strategies to influence policy making, planning, and healthcare allocation. One interesting feature of descriptive studies on dementia is that although the few epidemiologic studies conducted in Africa suggest that rates of dementia and AD are relatively low, rates of AD and dementia have been reported to be relatively high for African Americans. The Indianapolis-Ibadan Dementia Project has reported that the incidence rates for AD and dementia in Yoruba are less than half the incidence rates for AD and dementia in African Americans. Analytic studies are now underway to identify risk factors that may account for these rate differences. The risk factor model being applied, attempts to identify not only putative genetic and environmental factors but also their interactions. So far the major findings have included: apolipoprotein E e4, a major risk factor for AD in most populations, is also a risk factor for AD in African Americans but not for Yoruba; African Americans are at higher risk not only for AD, but also for diseases associated with increased cardiovascular risk such as hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome; African Americans have higher rates of hypercholesterolemia than Yoruba: there is an interaction between apolipoprotein E e4, cholesterol, and AD risk in both Yoruba and African Americans. We eventually hope to create a risk factor model that will not only account for the dementia rate differences between Yoruba and African Americans, but also help explain dementia rates in other developing and developed countries.",

    "abstract": "The progression of Alzheimer disease (AD) corresponds to a prolonged course of neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex. Strategies aimed at reducing the rates of neuronal loss are therefore particularly important. The clinical measures to evaluate the disease-modifying effect of an intervention are readily confounded by any symptomatic benefit of the intervention. Thus, when testing putative neuroprotective agents that are known to have symptomatic effects, it can be difficult to separate the 2 effects. The hypothesis that cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) only treat symptoms caused by cholinergic imbalances in AD is overly simplistic. Evidence has now accumulated that ChEIs have a neuroprotective, disease-modifying property. In this paper, to answer the question of what constitutes clinical evidence for neuroprotection in AD, we have reviewed clinical studies with specific designs, including \"delaying end point,\" \"withdrawal,\" and \"randomized start\" designs. We have also reviewed data on surrogate biomarkers of disease progression that may indicate a disease-modifying action. In addition, we have reviewed evidence indicating that ChEIs may protect cells in the brain of patients with AD. Among the clinical data suggesting a possible neuroprotective effect of ChEIs, the most rigorous published evidence comes from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) hippocampal volumetric studies with donepezil.",

The N-terminal amino acid sequences of hamster PrPC and PrPSc are identical; both correspond to that predicted by the translated prion protein (PrP) gene sequence. While the chemical difference between PrPc and PrPSc remains unknown, the organization of the PrP gene argues that it results from a posttranslational event. Six posttranslational modifications of both PrP isoforms have been identified: (1) cleavage of an N-terminal signal peptide, (2) an intramolecular disulfide bond, (3) an N-linked oligosaccharide attached to Asn 181, (4) a second oligosaccharide attached to Asn 197, (5) cleavage of a C-terminal hydrophobic peptide, and (6) a phosphatidylinositol glycolipid attached to the C-terminus. The mouse PrP gene is on chromosome 2 and is linked to a gene controlling the scrapie incubation time (Prn-i). PrP genes from inbred mice with short and long incubation times differ by two amino acids, a finding consistent with but not proving that PrP modulates susceptibility to scrapie. PrPSc stimulation of a posttranslational process which converts PrPc or its precursor into PrPSc is one possible mechanism for prion replication. This is consistent with observations showing that human prion diseases are manifest as infectious, sporadic and genetic disorders.",

We investigated the association between ET and AD in postmenopausal women using a population-based case-control design. Women who developed AD from 1985 through 1989 in Rochester, MN (cases, n=264) were individually matched by age (±1 y) to control women free of dementia from the same population (controls, n=264). ET exposure (≥6 mo after menopause) was ascertained by abstracting the complete medical records archived in the records-linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project. The frequency of ET use was similar in cases (11.4%) and controls [10.6%; odds ratio=1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.63-1.93]. However, cases who used ET had a suggestive trend for an earlier age at start of ET compared with controls (median, 49.0 vs. 50.5 y; P=0.06). Although smoking (ever vs. never) was not associated with AD overall, we observed an interaction between smoking and ET. The odds ratio of AD in ET users was 4.55 (95% CI=1.33-15.53) among smokers, but was 0.68 (95% CI=0.35-1.32) among never-smokers (P for interaction=0.01). Our findings do not confirm a significant association between ET and AD overall; however, the possible interaction with smoking deserves further study.",

Wandering behavior was defined using the Neuro-Psychiatric Inventory. The Mini-Nutritional Assessment and Katz Activity of Daily Living (ADL) scale were administered every 6 months during the 2 years of the study. Dementia severity was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination. Behavioral disturbances, comorbidities, medication, health care support, and burden status of the caregiver were assessed at the baseline visit. Outcomes of the 83 (12.2%) wanderers were compared with those of the nonwanderers. In the whole sample 30.1%/year subjects lost weight, 27.8%/year worsened their nutritional status, 55.1%/year decreased their ADL score, 11%/year reduced their ability to walk, 13.5%/year were institutionalized, and 6.2%/year died. Wanderers differed from nonwanderers by a higher frequency of decline of the ADL score (P<0.001), and institutionalization (P<0.001). Adjusted for baseline characteristics, risk of worsening the nutritional status, weight loss, decreased ADL score, and death were not statistically different between wanderers and nonwanderers. Risk for undernutrition and death are not increased in wanderers. Their higher risk of ADL disabilities and institutionalization are partly explained by their baseline characteristics.",

We investigated the avidity and levels of anti-Aβ antibodies in 20 AD patients and 40 healthy controls by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with thiocyanate elution. Our data revealed that both the levels and the avidity of anti-Aβ antibodies were statistically lower in AD patients than in healthy controls. However, there was no correlation between both of them, suggesting that the levels and the avidity of anti-Aβ antibodies might be regulated by different mechanisms. We hypothesize that incomplete B cell immune tolerance may be the major reason for low antibody avidity in AD patients. Avidity declination in AD patients should have immunopathologic implications as antigen-antibody complexes containing low avidity antibodies are not readily cleared by the immune system.",

There is considerable phenotypic variability in EOFAD, including some patients with spastic paraparesis. The objective is to describe clinical and neuropathologic features of a family with a PSEN1 mutation that has been reported previously, without autopsy confirmation, in a single Greek family whose affected members presented with memory loss in their 30s, as well as variable limb spasticity and seizures. Methods We prospectively evaluated 2 children (son and daughter) with EOFAD and reviewed medical records on their mother. Archival material from the autopsy of the mother was reviewed and postmortem studies were performed on the brain of the daughter. Results All 3 individuals in this family had disease onset in their 30s, with cognitive deficits in multiple domains, including memory, language, and attention, as well as less common features such as spastic dysarthria, limb spasticity, and seizures. At autopsy both the mother and her daughter had pathologic findings of Alzheimer disease, and histologic evidence of corticospinal tract degeneration. Genetic studies revealed a mutation in PSEN1 leading to an asparagine to serine substitution at amino acid residue 135 (N135S) in presenilin 1. Conclusions This is the first description of neuropathologic findings in EOFAD owing to N135S PSEN1 mutation. The clinical phenotype was remarkable for spastic dysarthria, limb spasticity, and seizures, in addition to more typical features of EOFAD.",

    "abstract": "Background Because primary prevention trials will require large samples and modest treatment effects are expected, the use of standard clinician-administered, clinic-based measures are unlikely to be feasible. There is a need for proxy-administered outcome measures. The goal of the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) Prevention Instrument Project was to conduct a simulated Alzheimer disease prevention trial in 650 nondemented elderly (Ferris et al, 2006). This involved comparison of data acquisition from both home and clinic and the use of both informant-ratings and self-ratings. Important outcomes included clinical global impressions of change (CGIC) as indicators of clinically meaningful change. Such ratings provide verification that the effects of a medication as measured on rating scales are readily observable and clinically meaningful. One objective was to develop self-rated and study partner-rated CGICs optimized for nondemented elderly or people with very early Alzheimer disease. An important consideration was whether global assessments are specific and sensitive measures of change during a prevention trial. Methods A self-administered CGIC and a study partner-rated CGIC were developed to be used either in the clinic or at home. Using 3-month follow-up data, we determined its reliability and validity with 317 subject-partner pairs. We compared subject-ratings with partner-ratings, clinic-based with home-based ratings, and ratings based on severity as determined by the Clinical Dementia Rating scale. Results There were no differences between clinic and home ratings. Overall, 24% of subjects rated themselves, and 10% of study partners rated the subjects, as minimally to markedly improved. Subjects and partners agreed to within 1 point of their ratings 83% of the time on the 7-point scale. There were weak correlations, generally <0.20, with change scores of selected clinical rating scales. Discussion The CGICs behaved as expected, showing no overall change over 3 months, no difference between administrations at home compared with clinics, and concurrent validity. Some subjects tended to rate themselves better than their partners rated them. These analyses show the potential for using home-based CGICs which can be completed with minimal supervision and allow assessments of potential preventative interventions.",

Utilization data were converted into estimated direct costs and totaled based on the costs paid for by 5 payers in the US healthcare system. Path models were used to quantify and compare the relationships between need variables and direct costs. From Medicare's perspective, comorbid medical conditions were the most important predictor of Medicare costs. From Medicaid's perspective, neuropsychiatric symptoms and signs of parkinsonism were additional significant predictors. From the perspective of patients, their families and society, all 5 need variables were significant predictors of direct costs (ie, those above, plus cognitive impairment, and dependency). The relationship between evaluated need variables and direct costs depends on the perspective of the payer and provide insights into which need variables could be targeted with interventions to control costs and improve patient outcomes.",

This was completed by 22 \"worried well\" (WW), 85 aMCI, and 40 semantic dementia (SD) patients at first presentation to a memory clinic. All patients were followed up for 2 years. A principal component factor analysis revealed 5 principal factors pertaining to working, episodic, topographical, and semantic memory. All factors, except topographical memory, reliably differentiated SD patients from other groups, with aMCI and WW patients complaining significantly more about working and episodic memory, and SD patients complaining significantly more about semantic memory. WW and aMCI patients, however, could not be differentiated, even those aMCI patients who progressed to dementia. Memory complaints are strikingly similar to the description of typical core deficits in SD patients. The sole reliance on memory complaints for insight into memory functioning and diagnosing aMCI is problematic.",

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review about the way in which dementia patients and their medical care are described in films.

The author describes the demographics of the characters suffering from dementia, the clinical picture including neuropsychiatric manifestations, diagnostic procedures, medical follow-up, pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment and the attitude of the caregivers. Most characters are played by actors in their seventh or eighth decade. There is an overrepresentation of highly educated people. Although the clinical picture is often accurate, some films suggest that even in the late stages of the disease patients have sudden moments of full insight in their disease. Among the neuropsychiatric signs, activity disturbances and aggressiveness are most often described. Few patients seek medical help, only 2 patients take acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and follow-up is absent for 5 of the 11 relevant patients. Only in 10 of 23 films, the term \"Alzheimer\" is used. Although there is a growing cinematographic interest in Alzheimer patients, even recent films tend to reinforce therapeutic and even diagnostic nihilism.",

The aim of this study was to characterize the longitudinal metabolic changes measured by 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy in correlation to neuropsychologic indices of episodic memory, attention and mental processing speed, language facility, and executive function in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Quantitative 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the posterior cingulate gyrus was performed and repeated at 11.56±4.3 months. N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), total choline (Cho), total creatine (Cr), myo-inositol (mI), and glutamate/glutamine (Glx) metabolite levels were measured, corrected for cerebrospinal fluid dilution, and ratios calculated in MCI and cognitively normal subjects. In the first study, MCI subjects showed lower NAA levels, NAA/Cho, and NAA/mI ratios and increased Cho/Cr and mI/Cr compared with controls. In the follow-up study, 36% of the MCI subjects [atypical MCI (atMCI)] showed interval increases in NAA, Cr, and Glx levels compared with 64% of MCI subjects (typical MCI) who showed an interval decrease in NAA, Cr, and Glx. Both MCI subgroups had higher Clinical Dementia Rating scores and lower scores on episodic memory, phonemic, and semantic word fluency tasks, compared with controls. The annualized rate of change in metabolic and cognitive status did not differ between normal aging and MCI subjects. atMCI subjects showed significant negative correlations between metabolite levels and executive function task scores, with NAA/mI showing a significant positive correlation with phonemic and semantic word fluency. There were no significant correlations between metabolite levels and cognitive performance in tMCI subjects; however, NAA/mI and mI/Cr were negatively correlated with executive function tasks. These results indicate 2 distinct evolving metabolite profiles that correlate with changes in executive function and can be used to differentiate MCI from normal aging.",

The objective of this study was to develop and validate a short version of the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale assessing changes on 4 different dimensions of impulsivity, namely urgency, (lack of) premeditation, (lack of) perseverance, and sensation seeking, arising in the course of a neurodegenerative disease. To this end, caregivers of 83 probable AD patients completed a short questionnaire adapted from the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of the data were performed and revealed that a model with 4 distinct but related latent variables corresponding to 4 different dimensions of impulsivity fit the data best. Furthermore, the results showed that lack of perseverance, followed by lack of premeditation and urgency, increased after the onset of the disease, whereas sensation seeking decreased. Overall, the multifaceted nature of impulsivity was confirmed in a sample of AD patients, whose caregivers reported significant changes regarding each facet of impulsivity. Consequently, the short version of the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale opens up interesting prospects for a better comprehension of behavioral symptoms of dementia.",

Methods DSRS and Mini Mental State scores were prospectively collected on 702 patients with AD from first evaluation until they became too impaired to return to clinic. Results DSRS score increased an average of 4.48 points/y [95% confidence intervel (CI): 4.14-4.82] throughout the entire range of severity. In contrast, the Mini Mental State declined an average of 2.15 points/y (95% CI: 1.85-2.46) during the first 2 years, accelerated to 3.83 points/y (95% CI: 3.28-4.38) during the subsequent 3 years, and then slowed to an annual decline of 1.63 points during the last 2 years (95% CI: 0.21-3.05).

In older adults participating in a population-based cohort study (n=1711, aged 65 to 97 y), we investigated the relationships of total and HDL cholesterol levels, statin use, and carotid intima-media thickness with the prevalence of cognitive impairment. In adjusted models, participants in the highest quartile of non-HDL (total−HDL) cholesterol had an increased odds of cognitive impairment compared with those in the lowest quartile [odds ratio (OR): 2.06, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07-3.98].

In this analysis of older adults, increased atherogenic lipoproteins were associated with impaired cognition. Statin use was related to many factors that both negatively and positively affect cognition, but was not associated with better cognitive function. These results suggest that confounding by indication may explain the contradictory findings in studies assessing the association of statins with cognition.

    "abstract": "Late-onset Alzheimer Disease (LOAD) is a common neurodegenerative disease, and one of its major pathologic characteristics is senile plaques. Proteins encoded by SORL1 and ACE have been shown to be related to the processing, trafficking, and degradation of Amyloid-β, the principal component of senile plaques. In this paper, we investigated whether SORL1 and ACE are associated with LOAD. We recruited 144 LOAD patients and 476 controls from Shanghai, China and conducted a case-control study on 9 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): 6 in SORL1 (rs2070045, rs661057, rs668387, rs689021, rs3824968, rs2282649) and 3 in ACE (rs1800764, rs4343, rs1799752). Despite the small case sample size (144), we observed that rs1800764, rs4343, rs1799752 in ACE, and rs2070045, rs3824968, rs2282649 in SORL1 showed significantly different allele frequencies between patients and controls (P=4.57×10, 5.24×10, 1.95×10, 1.77×10, 6.44×10, and 3.11×10, respectively). Moreover, haplotypes on ACE and on SORL1 were significantly associated with LOAD (all P-value<0.009 in ACE and all P-value <0.003 in SORL1). In ACE, we found the most significant protective haplotype encompasses SNPs rs2070045, rs3824968, and rs2282649 (C-G-D: OR=0.20, P=8.96×10). In SORL1, we detected a \"complementary\" haplotype (G-A-T: OR=1.54, P=2.67×10; T-T-C: OR=0.63, P=2.36×10) composed of SNPs rs2070045, rs3824968, and rs2282649. In addition, we carried out meta-analysis with 3 other Asian populations on 3 SNPs in SORL1 (rs2070045, rs3824968, and rs2282649). Results supported our initial finding that these 3 SNPs were associated with LOAD. Our data suggested that SORL1 and ACE might play a role in LOAD susceptibility among Han Chinese.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional state between normal cognitive functioning and dementia. A proposed MCI typology classifies individuals by the type and extent of cognitive impairment, yet few studies have characterized or compared these subtypes. Four hundred forty-seven women 65 years of age and older from the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study were classified into the 4 MCI subgroups and a \"no impairment\" group and compared on clinical, sociodemographic, and health variables. A cognitive deficit in at least 1 domain was present in 82.1% of participants, with most (74.3%) having deficits in multiple cognitive domains. Only 4.3% had an isolated memory deficit, whereas 21.3% had an isolated nonmemory deficit. Of the 112 women who met all MCI criteria examined, the most common subtype was amnestic multidomain MCI (42.8%), followed by nonamnestic multiple domain MCI (26.7%), nonamnestic single domain (24.1%), and amnestic single domain MCI (6.3%). Subtypes were similar with respect to education, health status, smoking, depression, and prestudy and onstudy use of hormone therapy. Despite the attention it receives in the literature, amnestic MCI is the least common type highlighting the importance of identifying and characterizing other nonamnestic and multidomain subtypes. Further research is needed on the epidemiology of MCI subtypes, clinical and biologic differences between them, and rates for conversion to dementia.",

    "abstract": "Introduction The prevalence of dementia according to DSM-IV criteria tends to be very low in less developed settings. The 10/66 Dementia Research Group's cross-culturally validated diagnosis returns a considerably higher prevalence. Assessing the predictive validity of the 10/66 dementia diagnosis will assist in establishing the best criterion for estimating the population burden of dementia. Methods In a population-based study in Chennai, India, we aimed to follow-up after 3 years 75 people with 10/66 dementia and 193 with cognitive impairment but no dementia (CIND), reassessing diagnostic status, clinical severity, cognitive function, disability, and needs for care. Results We traced 54 people with dementia of whom 25 (46.3%) had died, double the mortality rate among those with CIND. Twenty-two of the 24 people with 10/66 dementia that were reexamined still met 10/66 dementia criteria. There was clear evidence of clinical progression and increased needs for care. Only one \"case\" had unambiguously improved. Cognitive function had deteriorated and disability increased to a much greater extent than among those with CIND. Conclusion The strong predictive validity of the 10/66 dementia diagnosis is consistent with a lack of sensitivity of the DSM-IV criteria to mild-to-moderate cases, which may underestimate prevalence in less developed regions.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 35% of individuals with dementia exhibit depression and/or anxiety symptoms, often manifested by symptoms of negative affect. Exercise has been associated with improved affect but has not been demonstrated to improve affect in residents of secured dementia units in long-term care facilities. This pilot study determined whether moderate-intensity, chair-based exercise was associated with changes in negative affect in residents in secured units. The sample included 36 patients from 2 nursing homes who participated in a 12-week, 30-minute moderate-intensity group exercise program thrice weekly. Affect, measured by the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Apparent Affect Rating Scale, was assessed at weeks 3 and 12, before and after each exercise session. Paired t tests assessed the immediate effect of exercise (before/after a session) and the long-term effect of exercise (study initiation/12 wk) on patients' affect ratings. The mean age was 85 years (SD=5.5), with 86% female, and 97% white. At week 3, anxiety was significantly lower immediately after the exercise session when adjusted for level of participation (P=0.02) compared with immediately before the exercise session, indicating immediate changes in affect. Anxiety and depression were significantly reduced at week 12, when compared with week 3, after adjusting for level of participation (P=0.01; P=0.03), indicating long-term effects of the exercise intervention. The study revealed the feasibility of conducting a moderate-intensity exercise program and the potential for exercise as a nonpharmacologic intervention for reducing symptoms of negative affect and depression in this vulnerable population.",

    "abstract": "This study examined factors associated with brain donation program participation among African American and White elders. By postal mail, participants were recruited from an Alzheimer's research registry (all of whom had been invited to participate in the Center's brain donation program) and asked to complete surveys assessing brain donation knowledge, trust in healthcare systems, and religiousness. African American respondents completed a cultural mistrust inventory. Demographic, brain donation status, and literacy data (as assessed by the Wide Range Achievement Test-3 Reading subtest) were compiled from the respondents' most recent registry visit. The survey response rate was 60% (n=184 White and n=49 Black respondents). Logistic regression, comparing religiousness, trust in healthcare institutions, and educational attainment, identified a single predictor (ie, religiousness) in the prediction of donation status among White respondents (P=0.008), whereas no predictors were observed for donation status among the Black respondents. Using all African American donors and nondonors from the registry (n=68), comparisons revealed Wide Range Achievement Test-3 Reading score differences for African American donors (46.8±5.9) and nondonors (42.8±8.4, P=0.02). Results suggest that increased religiousness is related to White elders' decisions not to donate, whereas lower reading ability might be related to African American participants' decisions not to donate.",

Despite widespread recognition of this problem, limited empirical data demonstrating the effectiveness of specific recruitment strategies are available to guide recruitment endeavors. This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of recruitment efforts targeting either the primary care health professionals (PCPs) or patients and families with a community grass-roots outreach event. The primary outcome measure was actual study recruitment and participation in the 4 months postintervention. No research subjects were recruited from the PCP intervention, whereas 69 subjects were recruited into clinical studies from the community grass-roots outreach event activity (0% vs. 28%, P<0.0001, Fisher exact test). Barriers to recruitment success in the PCP arm included a perception of perceived harm to subjects from research participation and fear of losing patients through clinical research participation. Our results suggest that outreach efforts directed at the potential study subject/caregiver are not only cost-effective but are able to easily accomplish the desired result of direct recruitment into clinical research studies.",

    "abstract": "Background Inadequate recruitment into Alzheimer disease clinical trials is an important threat to the validity and generalizability of the studies. The majority of dementia patients are first evaluated by community-based physicians; however, physician perceptions of clinical research are largely unknown. Methods A survey was distributed to 3123 physicians in 3 states; 370 were returned. Survey items assessed attitudes, perceived benefits of and barriers to referral to clinical research, and physicians use of the internet for medical information. Results The mean age of the respondents was 50.6±10.8 years; 70% were male, 78% white, 61% were primary care providers; 63% used the internet ≥3 times/week. No demographic or medical specialty differences existed between those who were likely (n=193) and unlikely (n=162) to refer patients to clinical trials. Differences were discovered in perceived benefits reported by physicians who were more likely to refer, whereas differences in perceived barriers existed in primary care compared with specialists. Referral to clinical trials is predicted by close proximity to a research center [odds ratio (OR): 4.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-15.6] and availability of internet information regarding diagnostic evaluation (OR: 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-4.7). Primary barriers included concerns about exposure of patients to uncomfortable procedures (OR: 4.7; 95% CI, 1.2-18.7) and lack of time to discuss research participation (OR: 6.8; 95% CI, 1.4-32.3). Conclusions Proximity to a research center and availability of diagnostic clinical tools are strong predictors of clinical trial referral. Concern over risks to patients and lack of time are strong barriers. These results suggest that dementia outreach education targeted to physicians should emphasize the importance of clinical trials with a focus on discussing research participation in a time-efficient manner and increasing awareness of risk reduction and the safety of research protocols. Providing easy access to up-to-date, user-friendly educational materials on dementia diagnosis and research via the internet are likely to improve referrals of patients to Alzheimer disease clinical trials from community physicians.",

The objective of this study was to verify the applicability and validity of the Brazilian version of the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD-Br).The DAD was applied to caregivers of 89 patients with probable Alzheimer disease (AD) and to 40 elderly individuals without cognitive impairment (controls). We assessed the construct validity of the scale and its diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value). In addition, intergroup and intragroup analyses were conducted to characterize patient performance on basic and instrumental ADL and to determine underlying deficits (initiation, planning, or effective execution).AD patients and controls had mean ages of 76.4+/-6.9 years and 74.5+/-7.3 years (P=0.08), respectively. Mean Mini-Mental State Examination scores were 17.4+/-5.0 and 26.1+/-5.1 (P<0.001) and scores on the DAD were 68.4+/-19.0 and 99.8+/-0.9 (P<0.001), for patients and controls, respectively. The DAD scale showed good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha=0.77) and correlation with the Mini-Mental State Examination (r=0.44; P<0.001). The AD group did better on basic ADL than on instrumental ADL (P<0.001). As expected, controls did not exhibit significant deficits on the items evaluated.The Brazilian version of the DAD is an adequate and reliable tool for assessing functional ability in AD patients.",

The aim of this study was to establish in an Italian population, namely in Brescia County, the prevalence of early-onset neurodegenerative dementia, and how it is shared between AD and FTLD. A network among the participating centers has been established for 10 years. A standardized form was sent to be filled in for each patient. The census day was chosen as December 1, 2009. The prevalence of disease was calculated stratifying patients according to sex and diagnosis. On the census day, 175 patients in the whole population aged 45--65 years were enrolled into the study. The resulting overall prevalence of early-onset neurodegenerative dementia was found of 55.1 per 100,000 inhabitants (95%confidence interval, 47.0--63.4). A comparable prevalence between AD and FTLD was reported (25.5 and 29.6 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively), and no differences in sex distribution were found both in AD and FTLD. The improvement of knowledge on early-onset neurodegenerative dementias allows us to reconsider its epidemiology and to rethink its impact on public polices. This would be crucial for defining the urgency of treatment approaches.",

    "abstract": "Biomarkers are needed to improve the sensitivity and accuracy of diagnosis, and also prognosis, in individuals with early Alzheimer disease (AD). Measures of brain structure and disease-related proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been proposed as biomarkers, yet relatively little is known about the relationships between such measures. The present study was conducted to assess the relationship between CSF Aβ and tau protein levels and longitudinal measures of hippocampal structure in individuals with and without very mild dementia of the Alzheimer type.A single CSF sample and longitudinal magnetic resonance scans were collected. The CSF samples were assayed for tau, phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181), Aβ1-42, and Aβ1-40 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Large-deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping was used to generate hippocampal surfaces, and a composite hippocampal surface (previously constructed from 86 healthy participants) was used as a structural reference.Thirteen participants with very mild AD (Clinical Dementia Rating, CDR 0.5) and 11 cognitively normal participants (CDR 0).None.Initial and rate-of-change measures of total hippocampal volume and displacement of the hippocampal surface within zones overlying the CA1, subiculum, and CA2-4+DG cellular subfields, and their correlations with initial CSF measures.Lower CSF Αβ1-42 levels and higher tau/Αβ1-42 and p-tau181/Αβ1-42 ratios were strongly correlated with decreases in hippocampal volume and measures of progressive inward deformations of the CA1 subfield in participants with early AD, but not in cognitively normal participants.Despite the small sample size, we found that Αβ1-42 related and tau-related CSF measures were associated with hippocampal degeneration in individuals with clinically diagnosed early AD and may reflect an association with a common underlying disease mechanism.",

    "abstract": "A diagnosis of dementia is challenging to deliver and to hear; yet, agreement on diagnosis is essential for effective treatment for dementia. We examined consensus on the results of an evaluation of dementia in 90 patients assessed at an Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Diagnostic impressions were obtained from 5 sources: (1) the physician's chart; (2) the patient who was evaluated; (3) a companion present at the evaluation; (4) a diagnostic summary written by a nurse present during the evaluation; and (5) raters who watched a video of the diagnostic disclosure conversation. Overall, diagnostic consensus was only moderate. Patients and companions exhibited just fair agreement with one another. Agreement was better between physicians and companions compared with that between physicians and patients, although it was imperfect between physicians and video raters and the written summary. Agreement among sources varied by dementia severity, with the lowest agreement occurring in instances of very mild dementia. This study documents discrepancies that can arise in diagnostic communication, which could influence adjustment to a diagnosis of dementia and decisions regarding future planning and care.",

    "abstract": "Patients with neurodegenerative disease show distinct patterns of personality change, some of which may be traced to focal neurological damage, whereas others may be mediated by cultural reactions to functional impairment. Although such changes are early and pervasive in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), and milder changes are seen in Alzheimer disease (AD), no study has examined all Big 5 factors of personality in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. In addition, the influence of culture and ethnicity on disease-related personality changes has seldom been examined. Premorbid and current personality were measured in 47 Greek patients with bvFTD, AD, and MCI on the basis of informant reports using the Traits Personality Questionnaire 5, a 5-factor inventory in the Greek language that accounts for Greek cultural factors. bvFTDs showed greater decreases in conscientiousness compared with ADs and MCIs. ADs and MCIs showed increased neuroticism, whereas the bvFTD patients were rated as having become much less neurotic in the course of their disease. The pattern of personality change in MCIs was very similar to that of ADs, supporting recent evidence that personality changes occur as early as the MCI disease stage. In all the groups, personality changes were similar to those previously described in non-Mediterranean cultures, supporting the hypothesis that they may result directly from disease-specific neurological processes.",

    "abstract": "Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and other prion diseases are rapidly progressive spongiform encephalopathies that are invariably fatal. Clinical features and magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalogram, and cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities may suggest prion disease, but a definitive diagnosis can only be made by means of neuropathologic examination. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is not routinely used to evaluate patients with suspected prion disease. This study includes 11 cases of definite prion disease in which FDG-PET scans were obtained. There were 8 sporadic CJD cases, 2 genetic CJD cases, and 1 fatal familial insomnia case. Automated FDG-PET analysis revealed parietal region hypometabolism in all cases. Surprisingly, limbic and mesolimbic hypermetabolism were also present in the majority of cases. When FDG-PET hypometabolism was compared with neuropathologic changes (neuronal loss, astrocytosis, spongiosis), hypometabolism was predictive of neuropathology in 80.6% of cortical regions versus 17.6% of subcortical regions. The odds of neuropathologic changes were 2.1 times higher in cortical regions than subcortical regions (P=0.0265). A similar discordance between cortical and subcortical regions was observed between FDG-PET hypometabolism and magnetic resonance imaging diffusion weighted imaging hyperintensity. This study shows that there may be a relationship between FDG-PET hypometabolism and neuropathology in cortical regions in prion disease but it is unlikely to be helpful for diagnosis.",

We retrospectively studied very mild and mild AD participants who were treated (N=25) or untreated (N=19) with ChEIs with respect to rs-fcMRI measure of 5 resting state networks (RSNs): default mode, dorsal attention (DAN), control (CON), salience (SAL), and sensory motor. For each network, a composite score was computed as the mean of Pearson correlations between pairwise time courses extracted from areas comprising this network. The composite scores were analyzed as a function of ChEI treatment and APOE ε4 allele. Across all participants, significant interactions between ChEI treatment and APOE ε4 allele were observed for all 5 RSNs. Within APOE ε4 carriers, significantly greater composite scores were observed in the DAN, CON, and SAL for treated compared with untreated participants. Within APOE ε4 noncarriers, treated and untreated participants did not have significantly different composite scores for all RSNs. These data suggest that APOE genotype affects the response to ChEI using rs-fcMRI. Rs-fcMRI may be useful for assessing the therapeutic effect of medications in AD clinical trials.",

Objective: We aimed to investigate the frequencies of GRN and MAPT mutations in FTD cohorts from 2 Brazilian dementia research centers, the University of Sao Paulo and the Federal University of Minas Gerais medical schools. Methods: We included 76 probands diagnosed with behavioral-variant FTD (n=55), semantic-variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) (n=11), or nonfluent-variant PPA (n=10). Twenty-five percent of the cohort had at least 1 relative affected with FTD. Results: Mutations in GRN were identified in 7 probands, and in MAPT , in 2 probands. We identified 3 novel GRN mutations (p.Q130X, p.317Afs*12, and p.K259Afs*23) in patients diagnosed with nonfluent-variant PPA or behavioral-variant FTD. Plasma progranulin levels were measured and a cutoff value of 70 ng/mL was found, with 100% sensitivity and specificity to detect null GRN mutations. Conclusions: The frequency of GRN mutations was 9.6% and that of MAPT mutations was 7.1%. Among familial cases of FTD, the frequency of GRN mutations was 31.5% and that of MAPT mutations was 10.5%.",

This phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept, and dose-finding study adaptively randomized patients to receive ABT-089 (5, 10, 15, 20, 30, or 35 mg once daily) or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale, cognition subscale (ADAS-Cog) total score. A Bayesian response-adaptive randomization algorithm dynamically assigned allocation probabilities based on interim ADAS-Cog total scores. A normal dynamic linear model for dose-response relationships and a longitudinal model for predicting final ADAS-cog score were employed in the algorithm. Stopping criteria for futility or success were defined. The futility stopping criterion was met, terminating the study with 337 patients randomized. No dose-response relationship was observed and no dose demonstrated statistically significant improvement over placebo on ADAS-Cog or any secondary endpoint. ABT-089 was well tolerated at all dose levels. When administered as adjunctive therapy to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, ABT-089 was not efficacious in mild to moderate Alzheimer disease. The adaptive study design enabled the examination of a broad dose range, enabled rapid determination of futility, and reduced patient exposure to nonefficacious doses of the investigational compound.",

    "abstract": "Given the long preclinical disease course of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology, novel treatments may be more efficacious if administered before the emergence of dementia. Thus, accurate prediction of who will develop AD dementia is of key importance in selecting individuals for trials of treatment and may become crucial for future selection of patients for therapy.As part of the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing, 901 individuals who did not have dementia were recruited. We assigned individuals according to Petersen criteria and Winblad criteria for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) at baseline. We then stratified individuals with amnestic MCI into 2 groups according to the severity of their memory impairment on baseline neuropsychological assessment. Incident diagnosis of AD dementia was established by consensus of an expert panel at 36 months.At 36 months, 725 (80.5%) participants were followed up, 54 (7.4%) of whom developed AD dementia. Subjects with amnestic MCI according to Petersen criteria were more likely to develop AD dementia [positive predictive value; PPV, 24.1%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 18.4-30.6] than healthy controls (PPV, 1.0%; 95% CI, 0.3-2.3). Winblad criteria were also effective, with multiple domain amnestic MCI being most accurate at predicting AD dementia (PPV, 47.3%; 95% CI, 33.7-61.2). Finally, more severe amnestic impairment below the median was useful for predicting the development of AD dementia in single domain amnestic MCI (PPV, 28.1%; 95% CI, 17.0-41.5) and in multiple domain amnestic MCI (PPV, 65.7%; 95% CI, 47.8-80.9).Memory impairment per se, impairment in multiple cognitive domains and severity of memory impairment were all associated with greater risk of developing AD dementia in this sample. Characterizing the severity of memory impairment may provide prognostic stratification within Petersen or Winblad taxonomies of amnestic MCI.",

    "abstract": "The recruitment of asymptomatic volunteers has been identified as a critical factor that is delaying the development and validation of preventive therapies for Alzheimer disease (AD). Typical recruitment strategies involve the use of convenience samples or soliciting participation of older adults with a family history of AD from clinics and outreach efforts. However, high-risk groups, such as ethnic/racial minorities, are traditionally less likely to be recruited for AD prevention studies, thus limiting the ability to generalize findings for a significant proportion of the aging population. A community-engagement approach was used to create a registry of 2311 research-ready, healthy adult volunteers who reflect the ethnically diverse local community. Furthermore, the registry's actual commitment to research was examined, through demonstrated participation rates in a clinical study. The approach had varying levels of success in establishing a large, diverse pool of individuals who are interested in participating in pharmacological prevention trials and meet the criteria for primary prevention research trials designed to delay the onset of AD. Our efforts suggest that entry criteria for the clinical trials need to be carefully considered to be inclusive of African Americans, and that sustained effort is needed to engage African Americans in pharmacological prevention approaches.",

The present study aimed to identify associations between neuropsychiatric symptoms as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q) and cognitive and functional performance. Participants were 256 AD patients enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease and Memory Disorders Center at Baylor College of Medicine. An exploratory factor analysis of the NPI-Q indicated a 2-factor structure consisting of Negative/Oppositional and Anxiety/Restlessness factors. Regression analyses revealed significant associations between greater total severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms and poorer performance on basic and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. Greater severity of Anxiety/Restlessness symptoms was associated with poor performance on measures of visuospatial functioning and basic and instrumental activities of daily living. The Negative/Oppositional factor was not related to cognition or functioning. In summary, neuropsychiatric symptoms (particularly Anxiety/Restlessness symptoms) were related to cognition and everyday functioning. Proper assessment and treatment of these symptoms is essential for improving cognition and functioning in AD patients.",

    "abstract": "National policy in England is to encourage referral of people with suspected dementia to Memory Assessment Services (MAS). However, little is known about the characteristics of new referrals, which limits our capacity to evaluate these services. The objectives were to: describe the characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and comorbidity) of referred patients, and examine the relationships between these characteristics and cognitive function (tertiles of Mini-Mental State Examination score) and health-related quality of life (HRQL) (DEMQOL, DEMQOL-Proxy). We used multivariable regression methods to analyze data from 1420 patients from 73 MAS, and their lay carers (n=1020). The mean age of patients was 78 years; 42% had cognitive function equivalent to Mini-Mental State Examination <24. Characteristics associated with lower function were: older age, being female, deprivation, and nonwhite ethnicity. Deprivation and nonwhite ethnicity were also associated with lower self-reported HRQL, as was having multiple comorbidities; older age was associated with better self-reported HRQL. Lower proxy-reported HRQL was associated with being female, deprivation and comorbidities, but not age and ethnicity. A large proportion of study participants had moderate or high cognitive function scores, suggesting that these patients were referred early to MAS. Research is needed to identify why apparent sociodemographic inequalities in use of MAS exist.",

The 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey was used to measure health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We investigated baseline associations between the cognitive domains of memory, executive function, and general fluid ability with 8 subscales of the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, bodily pain, general health perceptions, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, vitality, and general mental health) and the 2 component summary scores of physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS). Next, we used Cox proportional hazard models to assess the predictive validity of HRQoL subscales for the onset of incident dementia and incident AD.At baseline, higher scores (better HRQoL) on MCS and its 4 subscales (social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, vitality, and general mental health) were associated with higher performance on both memory and executive function domains. Higher scores in role limitation due to physical problems, role limitation due to emotional problems, and general mental health subscales were associated with reduced risk of incident dementia. Higher MCS, but not PCS, predicted a reduced incident of all-cause dementia and AD.These findings suggest that diminution of HRQoL precedes the onset of diagnosable dementia and may be useful in the prediction of dementia onset.",

This study aimed to evaluate the frequency of social cognition disorders 3 years after a first-ever stroke and to assess the factors associated with this condition. The second aim was to describe all the cognitive domains altered in the same population. Methods: Patients who suffered from a first-ever ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke underwent clinical and neuropsychological assessment, which included the mini-Social cognition and Emotional Assessment (SEA) for evaluating social cognition. Results: The 43 included patients were 67±15 years old, with a median Neurological Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) (± interquartile range) at 0±1, and a median modified Rankin Scale (± interquartile range) at 1±1. Twenty patients (46.5%) had poor results in the facial emotions subtest; this factor was associated with a low educational grade ( P =0.001). Fourteen patients (34.2%) had poor results on the “faux-pas” recognition subtest; this factor was associated with nonverbal episodic memory disorders ( P =0.01). Thirty four patients (79.1%) had cognitive impairment, with at least 1 cognitive domain affected. Conclusions: The study demonstrates the high frequency of social cognition impairment 3 years after the first-ever stroke in young patients. Doctors and nurses should be sensitized to cognitive handicap after stroke because of difficulties for rehabilitation and returning to work.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine whether exposure to long-known music would evoke more extensive activation of brain regions minimally affected by Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology and outside traditional memory networks using a functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm involving listening to long-known and recently-learned music in older adults with cognitive impairment to provide insight into mechanisms of long-term musical memory preservation in cognitively impaired older persons.Seventeen subjects with a diagnosis of mild AD or mild cognitive impairment were recruited for this study. Subjects were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed a music listening task, which included short clips of personally selected music from the patient's past and newly-composed music heard for the first time 60 minutes before scanning. From this task, we obtained group-level maps comparing brain areas associated with long-known and recently-heard music in all subjects.Exposure to long-known music preferentially activated brain regions including the medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, anterior insula, basal ganglia, hippocampus, amygdala, and cerebellum relative to recently-heard music. These areas are involved in autobiographical memory and associated emotional responses. In addition, they are minimally affected by early stage AD pathology, thus providing a neural basis for long-known musical memory survival.Long-known music activates a bilateral network of prefrontal, emotional, motor, auditory, and subcortical regions (cerebellum, putamen, limbic structures). This extensive activation, relative to recently-heard music, may offer structural and functional clues as to why long-term musical memory appears to be relatively preserved among cognitively impaired older persons.",

Materials and Methods: In 3886 individuals with mild cognitive impairment evaluated and followed at 34 National Alzheimer Coordinating Center sites, informant-reported Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) items associated with progression to dementia were derived in a training set (n=1943) and tested in the validation set (n=1943). Results: In the training set, the optimal combination comprised 6 FAQ items (FAQ6): difficulties with finances (2 items), remembering events/appointments, playing games of skill, current events, and travel. In the validation set, hazard ratio for dementia increased from 2.00 for 1 FAQ6 deficit to 5.56 for 6 FAQ6 deficits. In patients 50 to 67 years old with high Mini Mental State Exam scores, dementia risk rose from 12.06% for no FAQ6 deficits to 56.75% for 6 functional deficits. Likelihood of progression to dementia reached 80% to 89% in older age groups with low Mini Mental State Exam and severe FAQ6 deficits. Conclusions: Specific functional deficits increased dementia risk and, with age and global cognition, constituted a validated clinical algorithm to estimate dementia risk. Clinicians can use this clinically important algorithm to personalize decision-making about further investigation and identify high-risk patients for early treatment or inclusion in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between Alzheimer dementia (AD) and cancer. This inverse relationship was further explored. In addition, Pin1 expression has been implicated in the cell cycle regulation of both disease processes. The relationship of Pin1 expression in 10 cancer types and secondary diagnosis of AD was examined. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was performed using discharge data from the National Inpatient Sample from 1999 to 2008. Cancer was defined as the primary discharge diagnosis and AD was defined as the secondary discharge diagnosis. Cancer types were grouped according to their Pin1 expression to examine its relationship with AD. Analysis was performed by logistic regression. Results: Of ∼3 million cancer discharge diagnoses, 1.0% had a secondary diagnosis of AD. Discharge data of all 10 cancer types revealed a lower likelihood of secondary AD diagnosis. Prostate [crude odds ratios (OR): 0.26 (0.24 to 0.29), multivariate OR: 0.39 (0.35 to 0.43)], ovarian [crude OR: 0.38 (0.32 to 0.44), multivariate OR: 0.35 (0.30 to 0.41)], and lung cancer [crude OR: 0.39 (0.36 to 0.41), multivariate OR: 0.41 (0.39 to 0.44)] demonstrated the lowest odds of secondary AD diagnosis. When cancer types were grouped per Pin1 expression, cancer types with Pin1 underexpression were more likely to be associated with secondary diagnosis of AD than cancer types with Pin1 overexpression [crude OR: 1.4 (1.3 to 1.4), multivariate OR: 1.08 (1.02 to 1.14)]. Discussion: This secondary data analysis further demonstrated an inverse relationship between AD and 10 cancer types, with prostate, ovarian, and lung cancers displaying the greatest inverse relationship. Pin1 underexpressing cancer types had a significantly higher likelihood of secondary diagnosis of AD than Pin1 overexpressing cancer types.",

It also tested whether social engagement is associated with conversion independently from physical and cognitive engagements. Method: Data from 2 waves (2010 and 2014) of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) were used. The sample consisted of 1227 people who had CIND in 2010. To identify the heterogeneity of social engagement, latent class analysis was utilized. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was utilized to investigate the association between patterns of social engagement and probability of conversion to dementia and death or dropout. Results: The result showed that patterns of social engagement that represent higher level and more variety of social engagement were associated with lower probabilities of conversion to dementia in 4 years but not with probabilities of death or dropout. The relationship held after controlling for physical and cognitive engagements. Discussion: Findings implied that promoting social engagement may be protective against developing dementia even for the high-risk group of people with CIND. Future studies should investigate the mechanism behind the relationship between patterns of social engagement and lower probabilities of conversion to dementia.",

In this population-based longitudinal study, we describe potential predictors of driving cessation in older adults. Methods: Age-stratified random population cohort of 1982 adults aged 65 years and older drawn from voter registration lists. Participant characteristics were measured using demographics, physical and self-rated health, sleeping habits, driving status, cognitive screening, modified Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale, clinical dementia rating, and mini-mental state examination. Results: Over 12 years of follow-up, 390 participants stopped driving. These individuals were older, more likely to be women and to have a clinical dementia rating score ≥1, had worse self-reported health, and more symptoms of depression, compared with those who were still driving. In addition, individuals with lower test performance in all cognitive domains, loss of visual acuity and fields, and bilateral hearing loss were more likely to stop driving. Conclusions: Age, sex, cognitive impairments, physical health, and depressive symptoms were associated with driving cessation in this cohort. By identifying potential driving cessation predictors, health care providers and families may better recognize these risk factors and begin the driving cessation discussion early.",

Sixty-four normal elderly participants and 261 patients with AD stratified into severity groups based on Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores were rated on the BRSD at baseline and 12-month follow-up visits. A subset of subjects was evaluated at a 1-month follow-up visit. Baseline BRSD Total Score discriminated the normal group from each AD group, and mean Total Score significantly increased with increasing dementia severity. Test-retest reliability between baseline and 1-month Total Scores was satisfactory for all AD groups. Longitudinal change was evaluated by 12-month change scores, which were significant in only the normal and in one AD group. From the results, we argue that the value of behavioral pathology assessment in clinical trials would be enhanced if additive scores were based on groups of correlated items rather than on a broad array of behaviors, some of which may increase and others may decrease in frequency as AD progresses.",

    "abstract": "Ethnically diverse populations are not represented in the dementia-related noncognitive behavioral symptom research arena. Some of the obstacles are structural, centering around the lack of inclusion of ethnic minority groups within existing projects. These impediments are surmountable by the systematic targeting and incorporation of ethically diverse populations in research and the deployment of a variety of research-related outreach approaches. The more formidable barriers are conceptual. They relate to the need to differentiate cultural factors from socioeconomic and social status (SES) artifacts and to include life-long exposure to various forms of prejudice and discrimination, all of which can come together in the late-life manifestation of behavioral symptoms. A culture-fair behavioral assessment and intervention model is presented. It allows researcher and clinician alike access to ethnocultural data, while differentiating SES influences. A comparative Hispanic/Anglo dementia caregiver pilot study has provided a partial test of the model with statistically significant outcomes. Two-tailed t tests (p < or = 0.05) uncovered ethnic group differences with respect to four specific dimensions of caregiving. The differences were demonstrated around reactivity to caregiving burden, caregiver health status, coping and helpseeking styles, and configuration of social support received from social network members. Further multiple regression analysis sustained the observed differences despite income, education, and mean age variance between the two ethnic groups. The model has an overall multicultural applied intent. More study is indicated.",

Investigators need to limit exclusion criteria as much as possible. The extremely low recruitment rates of pharmacologic studies in frail persons with dementia may render the results irrelevant for that population.

    "abstract": "Summary: Advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) now permit responsible discussion of therapies that may go beyond relief of cognitive and behavioral symptoms and actually slow progression of disease. The mechanisms of neuronal death and the pathologic role of glia are being elucidated, and epidemiologic studies have suggested potential protective value for anti-inflammatory drugs, estrogen, and free-radical scavengers. However, demonstrating disease-modifying drug effects for progressive conditions such as dementia can be a daunting task, fraught with clinical, statistical, and ethical dilemmas. To evaluate trial designs for demonstrating such effects, the International Working Group on Harmonization of Dementia Drug Guidelines (IWG) conducted a symposium at the Sixth International Congress on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders, held July 1998 in Amsterdam. The presentations at the IWG symposium covered the two basic designs currently being used in clinical trials, survival analysis and staggered-start/withdrawal, in addition to clinical data generated from the National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study vitamin E/selegiline trial in patients with AD and the phase III clinical studies of propentofylline in patients with AD and VaD. It is hoped that this article will open a dialogue among investigators and regulatory authorities regarding appropriate trial designs to support a regulatory claim for disease-modifying effects. This symposium was sponsored by an unrestricted educational grant from Hoechst Marion Roussel.",

    "abstract": "Clinical and pathological overlap between Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) has been well described; however, the mechanisms of overlap between these two disorders remain unknown. We retrospectively examined clinical and neuropathological features from 66 individuals participating in the Rochester Alzheimer Disease Center to determine the association of AD with substantia nigra (SN) pathology. SN pathology, identified by a loss of pigmented neurons and the presence of gliosis, pigment-laden macrophages, and Lewy bodies, was blindly scored in 48 AD cases and 18 normal elderly controls. We found moderate or severe pathology in the SN in 2 control brains (11%) and 29 AD brains (60%). The numbers of neocortical and hippocampal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and senile plaques (SPs) were not associated with nigral pathology. There was also no significant association of SN pathology with NFTs or SPs in the striatum, the site to which these neurons project. There was no significant association of increasing SN pathology with aging among AD patients, nor with increasing severity and duration of AD. The signs and symptoms of an extrapyramidal movement disorder were, however, associated with increasing SN pathology. We confirm that pathological lesions in the SN are a common feature of AD and an uncommon feature in normal aging. AD is a significant risk factor for SN lesions and PD, but the pathologic severity of AD, as measured by NFTs and SPs, was not associated with SN lesions.",

    "abstract": "A specialized brain autopsy recruitment program was implemented within the context of advance medical directives and end-of-life treatment decisions. The program was implemented within the framework of a larger study. The purpose of the program was to (1) improve the rate of consent for brain autopsy among African Americans diagnosed with stroke and dementia, and (2) obtain more empirical information on the underlying reasons for the low response rate (4%) in this minority group. A convenience sample of 133 patient and family caregiver pairs was selected for participation. Face-to-face, open-ended interviews were conducted to ascertain reasons for autopsy preferences and to identify respondents interested in the postmortem procedure. Preferences for brain autopsy were ascertained and individuals interested in the procedure were subsequently followed through death or over the 2 1/2 year course of the study. Brain necropsies were conducted on patients requesting the examination. Thirty-six (36) patient and family pairs consented to the procedure, 16 were indecisive and 81 refused. Factors influencing decisions included existing attitudes toward autopsy, family agreement regarding the procedure, and assurance that funeral arrangements would not be delayed. Ninety deaths and two autopsies were conducted before implementation of the specialized recruitment program, yielding a 2.22% completion rate, and 34 deaths with 10 postmortems conducted within the time frame of the recruitment study, yielding a 29% autopsy completion rate. Fisher exact test (p < 0.0001) revealed a significant difference in the proportion of autopsies completed before and after implementation of the specialized recruitment program. Findings strongly suggest that culturally sensitive recruitment programs may increase the rate of autopsy request made by African American caregivers for relatives diagnosed with dementia and stroke. To obtain a higher rate of consent than that obtained in the general population, the program must contain ethnically sensitive recruitment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Summary: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate methanesulfonyl fluoride (MSF), a very long-acting CNS-selective acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, as a palliative treatment for senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT). In experiment I, MSF (0.03-0.18 mg/ kg) was administered orally to 10 normal volunteers to measure toxicity and establish dose/ response function in erythrocyte AChE. MSF produced a dose-response function of % inhibition=(40)(Logl0[MSF mg/ kg] + 51.7) with no toxicity at these doses. Experiment II was a 16-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of MSF in doses of up to 0.18 mg/Kg given three times per week in 5 men and 10 women (60-82 years), with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores of 9-24, who had SDAT. MSF produced a mean of 89.5% inhibition of erythrocyte AChE in patients and improved cognitive performance as measured by the MMSE, Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-COG), Global Deterioration Scale, and the Clinical Interview Based Impression of Change (CIBIC). Most of the improvement on the ADAS-COG was maintained 8 weeks after ending MSF. No patients left the study because of drug-related adverse events and there were no toxic effects. MSF may be a safe and effective palliative treatment for SDAT and further clinical trials in larger groups of patients are warranted.",

    "abstract": "The \"Predictors Study\" is a prospective cohort study of the natural history of Alzheimer disease (AD), the aim of which is to identify milestones in disease progression and to develop a model to predict disease course in individual patients. The empirical background to this study is based on previous reports that the presence of extrapyramidal signs (EPS), myoclonus, and psychosis in AD may signify greater disease severity at any given stage and a more rapid course of the disease over time. The present analyses were conducted to determine whether these independent \"predictor\" variables were associated with greater disease severity at baseline within a new cohort of 224 mild AD patients recruited from three different medical centers (in New York, Baltimore, and Boston). Measures of disease severity were provided by the modified Mini-Mental State Examination (mMMSE) and the Blessed Dementia Rating Scale (BDRS), which measures functional capacity. Independent variables were EPS, delusions, and slowing of the posterior dominant EEG rhythm. The frequency of myoclonus and hallucinations was too low to permit adequate statistical assessment of their effects at this time. EPS and EEG slowing were associated with low mMMSE scores, whereas delusions were primarily associated with impaired functional capacity. These effects were independent of the influence of age and disease duration. These results indicate that the effects of these independent variables can be detected at mild stages of AD and that these effects can be generalized across different geographical regions.",

    "abstract": "Cascading glial cell activation is believed to play an essential pathogenic role in the development of dementia. Reactive microglia may contribute to neuronal damage by the generation of free oxygen radicals and nitric oxide (NO), which forms the particularly aggressive peroxynitrites, and by the release of potentially neurotoxic cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). The pathologically stimulated release of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) from microglial cells triggers secondary activation of astrocytes, which are forced to proliferate and to give up their differentiated state. As a consequence, physiologically required astrocyte functions may be impaired, such as uptake of glutamate and K+ from the extracellular space and release of neurotrophic factors. At the same time, production of inflammatory proteins which, for example, promote the formation of toxic beta-amyloids, is reported to be stimulated in reactive astrocytes. Because the complex molecular signaling that controls glial cell activation is only beginning to be elaborated, we attempted to elucidate the role that has been adopted during evolution by the endogenous cell modulator adenosine. This nucleoside exerts a homeostatic effect on reactive glial cell functions by a sophisticated control of the second messenger interplay, counteracting a pathologically induced dysbalance of the Ca2+- and cAMP-dependent signaling. A strengthening of the cAMP-dependent signaling chains was found to counteract the proliferation rate, the formation of free oxygen radicals, and the stimulated release of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in cultivated microglia. It also helped proliferative astrocytes to regain their differentiated state and a mature ion channel pattern. The cAMP-linked homeostatic adenosine effects could be reinforced or mimicked by propentofylline, a pharmacon that raises the effective extracellular concentration of adenosine by inhibiting its cellular reuptake and increases the cellular cyclic nucleotide content by selective phosphodiesterase inhibition. We conclude that a pharmacologically reinforced homeostatic control of the pathologically altered Ca2+/cAMP crosstalk may prevent glia-related neuronal damage, providing a potential option for the treatment of dementia.",

A weak inverse correlation was also found between CSF concentrations of tau and Aβ1–42 within the combined group of DAT and control subjects. Moreover, increased severity of dementia was correlated with increased CSF tau concentrations and decreased sAPP and Aβtotal concentrations. Increased CSF concentrations of tau significantly discriminated DAT and control subjects, as did the ratios of tau to Aβtotal and tau to Aβ1–42.",

Clinicians in six United States Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers (n = 200, 85% response rate) were surveyed regarding their use of practices recommended in the California Workgroup Guidelines for Alzheimer's Disease Management. The majority of providers (89% to 73%) reported that they routinely conducted neurological examinations, obtained histories from caregivers, discussed the diagnosis with the patient's family, discussed durable power of attorney, and made legally-required reports of drivers with dementia. Roughly two-thirds of providers said they routinely conducted cognitive screening examinations, screened for depression, reported elder abuse, and discussed care needs and decision-making issues with patients' families. Only half of all outpatient providers implemented caregiver support practices for at least half of their patients. Clinicians' choices of medications for cognition, mood, and behavior problems were broadly consistent with current practice guidelines. These results suggest possible priorities for quality improvement efforts. Further research is needed to clarify reasons for particular gaps between guidelines and practice and to identify specific targets for intervention.",

Physostigmine plasma concentrations were relatively stable (0.56 ± 0.10 ng/ml) and correlated well with blood acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Six of the 12 patients reported improved vigilance and concentration, and also had higher scores in all four neuropsychological tests employed (Mini Mental State examination, Short Mental Test [SMT], Wechsler's Memory Scale [WMS], and Buschke's Selective Reminding Test). The performance of two additional patients improved in only two tests (SMT and WMS). Transdermal delivery of physostigmine appears to be safe and may be useful for the treatment of a subset of AD patients.",

Informant reports were highly correlated with age of diagnosis in medical records, r(155) = .88 (P < 0.0001) for the single question, r(201) =.89 (P < .0001) for the in-depth interview. Age of diagnosis in the medical records lagged consistently 2.9 and 2.7 years behind age of onset from screening and in-depth interviews, respectively. Greater lag was associated with longer time since dementia onset, whether due to recall bias or improved detection of dementia. Lag was not influenced by dementia type, informant's relationship to proband, or proband's age. These findings suggest that informant reports of age of dementia onset are reliable and reasonably valid, even when only a single question is asked within the context of a larger interview.",

    "abstract": "Intellectual abnormalities are common in Parkinson disease (PD), occurring in a majority of patients and exhibiting a spectrum of severity from mild to severe. Alzheimer disease (AD) has been posited as the cause of dementia in PD. Comparative neuropsychological studies, however, show differences in memory, language, and frontal lobe functions between AD and PD patients even when the two groups have comparably severe dementia syndromes. The AD-type neuropathology occurs in 10–60% of PD patients, and dementia is usually overt when AD pathology is identified at autopsy. The AD changes are less frequent than intellecutal deterioration in PD, and dementia has been observed in PD patients without AD pathology. Therefore, concurrent AD cannot be the cause of all cases of dementia in PD. Cholinergic deficits occur in some PD patients, but cholinergic deficits have been described in patients without dementia and dementia has been documented in patients without cholinergic system abnormalities. Dopaminergic disturbances contribute to the dementia of PD. Differences in neuropeptide concentrations, electrophysiologic responses, and cerebral metabolism also support patholphysiologic distinctions between AD and the dementia of PD. Genetic investigations suggest a role for heredity in AD, whereas PD appears to be an acquired, nongenetic disorder. These studies indicate that despite areas of overlap in clinical symptoms and neuropathology, AD and the dementia of PD are largely distinct.",

    "abstract": "Objective The purpose of this study is to investigate the characteristics of patients for whom it is decided to forgo artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH) and characteristics of the ANH decision-making process. We conducted an observational study with the use of written questionnaires. For 178 nursing home patients with dementia, the treating nursing home physician (NHP), a family member, and a nurse filled out a questionnaire directly after the decision was made to forgo ANH. Results We found that most patients had severe dementia and two thirds had an acute illness. Advance care planning had taken place in 68% of the cases. In two thirds of the cases, the primary aim in forgoing ANH was to avoid unnecessary prolongation of life; and nurses seemed to have less influence on the decision-making process than NHPs and family members. Almost all respondents evaluated the decision-making process as “good” or “adequate.” Dissatisfaction was felt when the decision had to be made under the pressure of time constraint. Conclusions On the basis of these results, we recommend that discussions that include NHPs, family members, and nurses concerning decisions about possible future situations be held on a regular basis. This will form the basis for the difficult ANH decision and will probably reduce the pressure of time constraint.",

    "abstract": "The number of older individuals with dementia will likely increase significantly in the next decades, but there is currently limited information regarding the out-of-pocket expenditures (OOPE) for medical care made by cognitively impaired individuals and their families. We used data from the 1993 and 1995 Asset and Health Dynamics Study, a nationally representative longitudinal survey of older Americans, to determine the OOPE for individuals with and without dementia. Dementia was identified in 1993 using a modified version of the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status for self-respondents, and proxy assessment of memory and judgment for proxy respondents. In 1995, respondents reported OOPE over the prior 2 years for: 1) hospital and nursing home stays, 2) outpatient services, 3) home care, and 4) prescription medications. The adjusted mean annual OOPE was $1,350 for those without dementia, $2,150 for those with mild/moderate dementia, and $3,010 for those with severe dementia (p < 0.01). Expenditures for hospital/nursing home care ($1,770 per year) and prescription medications ($800 per year) were the largest OOPE components for those with severe dementia. We conclude that dementia is independently associated with significantly higher OOPE for medical care compared with those with normal cognitive function. Severe dementia is associated with a doubling of OOPE, mainly due to higher payments for long-term care. Given that the number of older Americans with dementia will likely increase significantly in the coming decades, changes in public funding aimed at reducing OOPE for both long-term care and prescription medications would have considerable impact on individuals with dementia and their families.",

This study evaluated the reliability and validity of the Dementia Deficits Scale (DDS), a new multidimensional instrument for the assessment of self-awareness of cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits associated with dementia. Three parallel forms of the DDS were independently completed by the patient, clinician, and informant. The DDS yields two measures of deficit awareness: the discrepancy between clinician and patient assessments of the patient's deficits, and the discrepancy between informant and patient assessments. The DDS demonstrated adequate reliability and good divergent and convergent validity. Clinician and informant reports each added unique information, highlighting the importance of including both perspectives in the awareness assessment process. The DDS is recommended as a reliable and valid tool for the clinical and empirical assessment of deficit awareness in patients with dementia.",

Background: In 1989, Graff-Radford and Godersky noted that 3 of 30 patients diagnosed with NPH had large heads. They hypothesized that the cause of NPH in their patients was arrested congenital hydrocephalus becoming symptomatic later in life. Methods: Participants included 31 newly diagnosed NPH patients (21 male, 10 female) seen by the same neurologist (N.R.G.-R.) at Mayo Clinic Jacksonville from January 1, 1995 through December 31, 2000, and 459 normal controls (226 male, 233 female) from the Charlotte County Healthy Aging Study. Results: Head size was statistically larger for NPH males (median, 59.0 cm, range, 57.0–63.0 cm) compared with normal males (median, 57.8 cm, range, 53.3–62.8) (p < 0.01). Head size was also larger for NPH females (median, 6.3 cm, range, 53.5–58.0 cm) compared with normal females (median, 54.6 cm, range, 51.4–59.7 cm) (p < 0.02). Conclusion: Patients with NPH have larger head circumferences as a group than normal controls. This was found in both males and females. Results suggest that a significant proportion of patients with NPH may have congenital hydrocephalus that becomes symptomatic later in life.",

Twenty-two AD patients and 21 age-matched control subjects participated in this study. MEG signal analysis comprised the division of the entire 2 to 60 Hz spectrum in 2 Hz-width subbands. Both the relative power and the contribution of each subband to the correct classification of AD patients and controls were calculated. The relative power in 2 bands comprised between 2 to 4 Hz and 16 to 28 Hz was selected by a restrictive multiple-comparison test, among the entire 2 to 60 Hz spectrum. Using 2 to 4 Hz values it is possible to choose a classification rule with an estimate sensitivity and specificity given by 68% and 76% respectively. Alternatively, when 16 to 28 Hz values are used, it is possible to obtain a better classification rule with an estimate sensitivity and specificity given by 81% and 80%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first electroencephalography or MEG study where a so exhaustive analysis of the magneto-electric spectrum has been performed. This study supports the notion that more attention should be devoted to the study of β band in AD.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of a specific association between nerve growth factor (NGF) and basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) marks the beginning of a new era of research into neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD). Degeneration of BFCNs appears to be one of the earliest and most prominent neuropathological features of a broad range of diseases of the human brain that give rise to loss of memory and dementia (including, in addition to Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, Lewy body dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, dementia pugilistica, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome). Selective localization of NGF receptors on BFCN, the relatively high levels of NGF mRNA in BFCN target areas, and numerous effects of exogenous NGF in vivo and in vitro provide overwhelming evidence that the structure and function of BFCNs in the adult brain are dependent on this molecule. The question then arises as to how this special relationship is disturbed in the diseased human brain? Initial investigations in AD have already indicated a normality of NGF mRNA and retention of receptors in the basal forebrain region. Interpretation of these results and the therapeutic relevance of NGF obviously depend upon future developments in understanding the role of NGF in the normal and pathological brain.",

Objective: To determine if a free memory screening program is associated with an earlier diagnosis of AD, compared with traditional referral methods, such as by physicians and family members. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective study of 1489 consecutive patients with AD who presented to an outpatient memory disorders clinic between 1993 and 2002. Subjects were classified according to referral source (memory screening, physician, family/friend, other), and self-reported ethnicity (white non-Hispanic, white Hispanic). The associations between referral source and the presenting cognitive and behavioral status of subjects were evaluated using analysis of variance and logistic regression analyses, after controlling for potentially confounding factors. Main Outcome Measures: Score on the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), duration of cognitive symptoms, and presence of psychosis, defined as delusions and/or hallucinations. Results: After controlling for ethnicity, gender, and the year of diagnosis, subjects with AD, who were referred by the memory screening program, scored significantly higher at presentation on the MMSE (20.8 ± 5.7), than those referred by physicians (18.8 ± 6.6), family/friends (16.8 ± 6.6), or other referral sources (15.3 ± 7.1). Subjects with AD, referred by the memory screening program, also had a lower reported duration of illness at presentation, and a decreased frequency of psychosis compared with those referred by family/friend and other methods. Other factors related to a diagnosis of AD at a later stage included female gender, Hispanic ethnicity, and a diagnosis early in the 1993 to 2002 time period. Conclusions: The memory screening program referred patients with AD to a memory clinic at an earlier phase of illness compared with traditional methods such as physician referral.",

To characterize the specific cognitive benefits of memantine in patients with mild to moderate AD, a post hoc analysis was conducted of a 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial comparing memantine (10 mg twice daily) to placebo. Cognition was assessed using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) total score, individual items, and aggregated subscales, using a mixed model repeated measures analysis. As assessed by the ADAS-cog total score, participants in the placebo group demonstrated significantly more cognitive decline from baseline than participants treated with memantine at all visits beginning at week 8. Subjects treated with placebo also declined significantly more than individuals in the memantine group on 5 of 11 ADAS-cog individual items: orientation, language, comprehension, word finding, and recall of test instructions. Out of 3 ADAS-cog aggregated item subscales (language, memory, and praxis), outcomes in 2 (language and memory) favored memantine. Consistent with findings from trials conducted in moderate to severe AD patients, this post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial suggests that memantine benefits core aspects of language and some aspects of memory in patients with mild to moderate AD.",

The degree to which this complicates the use of frontotemporal atrophy as a diagnostic criterion for the frontotemporal dementias (FTDs) has not been reported. The present case-control study compared frontotemporal volumes delineated with semi-automatic brain region extraction [n=30 controls vs. 16 behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) vs. 14 primary progressive aphasia]. Logistic regression identified those regions least helpful for distinguishing bvFTD and primary progressive aphasia from controls. Linear regression tested the correlation of duration of illness to atrophy severity. The control group showed high variance in volumes. Controls had right frontal lobe volumes that overlapped considerably with bvFTD volumes, but, as anticipated, the left anterior temporal volumes of interest showed 91% accuracy in distinguishing the aphasic subgroup from controls. Left-sided and not right-sided atrophy in the medial middle frontal region distinguished the bvFTD group from controls. The relegation of structural imaging to a supportive criterion for diagnosis is reasonable in the context of the range of atrophy due to normal aging. While volumetry identified left-sided atrophy as useful for identifying FTD cases, future studies should determine whether clinicians could make these distinctions on viewing routine diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging scans.",

Our study aimed at describing memantine use in real-world practice in a cohort of 5283 memantine-treated patients (mean age: 80.1 y; women: 69.4%) randomly selected from the database of the national healthcare insurance, which covers 70% of the French elderly population. Mean follow-up after starting memantine prescription was 10.4 months (range: 1 to 20 mo). Patients were older and had a less severe cognitive impairment than patients included in the first controlled clinical trials. Memantine was prescribed with a cholinesterase inhibitor in 53.3% of cases. At 6 months, 26% of the patients had stopped memantine therapy (36% at 12 mo); conversely, patients who continued treatment were highly compliant.

    "abstract": "Deficits in attention are present early in the course of Alzheimer disease (AD). Acetylcholine receptors are appealing molecular targets for intervention as cholinergic pathways are involved in the neurobiology of attention. For this reason, measures of attention were included in 2 independent, multicenter, randomized, parallel, controlled trials in subjects with AD comparing the effects of galantamine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and postulated nicotinic receptor modulator, and donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. The attention battery of the Cognitive Drug Research computerized assessment system was used in both trials. Small magnitude, positive signals were observed for simple and choice reaction times for both compounds. Attention task performance tended to improve early for galantamine-treated subjects. A consistent temporal pattern of improvement was not observed in donepezil-treated subjects. Quantitative findings appeared more pronounced in subjects with moderate AD. Galantamine's proposed action as a nicotinic receptor modulator may bear on these findings. Improved attention may have positive effects on cognitive and functional outcomes for AD patients, although this hypothesis requires further study and validation.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) traits can serve as more specific measures of degenerative or cerebrovascular brain injury than can be ascertained through personal history, risk factors, clinical signs, or symptoms. They are potentially useful intermediate phenotypes for genetic studies of Alzheimer disease (AD). Recent studies have estimated heritability of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) among cognitively normal family members to be between 0.55 and 0.73. Persons discordant for AD are expected to have substantially different MRI phenotype distributions; our goal was to determine whether MRI traits in siblings discordant for AD are heritable. We measured cerebral atrophy, medial temporal atrophy (MTA), WMH, and a rating of cerebrovascular disease (CVR) via MRI in 815 participants from 424 families of the Multi-Institutional Research in Alzheimer's Genetic Epidemiology Study. Residual heritability after adjustment for covariates ranged from 0.17 (P=0.009) for MTA to 0.57 (P=10(-7)) for CVR. The number of APOE-epsilon4 alleles was significantly associated with WMH (P=0.01) and CVR (P=0.005) but not cerebral atrophy (P=0.25) or MTA (P=0.83). Heritability remained significant and high after adjusting for APOE genotype, suggesting that a substantial proportion of the additive genetic variation in these MRI traits is explained by other genes. In the Multi-Institutional Research in Alzheimer's Genetic Epidemiology Study of AD-discordant siblings, MRI traits are heritable and are potential endophenotypes for genetic association studies.",

This assumes items to have (1) equal measurement precision and (2) hierarchically ordered categories. Methods Rasch analysis on the basis of pooled data from 3 Randomized Controlled Trials was used to examine these assumptions and to estimate each patient's level of impairment. Analyses were replicated in an independent sample. Results The original ADAS-cog scoring did not fit the Rasch Model and did not reliably distinguish between impairment levels. Patients with equal test scores had different impairment levels. Similarly, patients with different test scores could have the same impairment level. Revising the ADAS-cog by (1) weighting the items by their measurement precision and (2) collapsing nonhierarchical item categories resulted in good fit and a valid one to one correspondence between sum scores and estimated impairment levels. This revealed that equal differences in ADAS-cog scores did not reflect equal differences in impairment level along the test's score range. Conclusions It is appropriate to summate the ADAS-cog items provided that the items are weighted and have their categories hierarchically ordered.",

Additional queries yielded history of premature ovarian failure. Genetic testing showed heterozygous fragile X mental retardation gene premutation with 103 CGG repeats in the abnormal allele and 31 CGG repeats in the normal allele. Also, the X inactivation pattern was skewed with the active X chromosome predominantly having the premutation allele.

The greatest disturbance was in recent memory. The patients' remote memory and orientation were relatively intact. Mental dullness and a decline in daily activities were also observed. No overt seizures were observed in any of the patients. Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed spikes in the left temporal region in 3 patients and in the left central region in the other patient. Single photon emission computed tomography or positron emission tomography revealed focal areas of hypofunction in the frontal, parietal, and parietotemporal regions. Performance of activities and memory improved rapidly in all patients after treatment with carbamazepine; the improvement was maintained after more than a year. It might be speculated that epileptic discharges caused dysfunction in the temporal lobe and the remote cortex through the neocortical and mesiotemporal network. EEG would be useful to rule out the possibility of a reversible condition in patients with cognitive disturbance. Moreover, investigation of this epilepsy-related condition with the combination of EEG and neurofunctional imaging might provide clues to clarify the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease.",

Narratives about verbal repetition were characterized using a qualitative framework analysis approach. Results Verbal repetition was reported in 100/130 patients, 57 of whom identified diminished repetition as a desired outcome of treatment. Most patients (76/100) repeated questions (usually about upcoming events); fewer (32/100) patients repeated statements/stories (usually about recent events). Most repetitions occurred within a 2-hour interval (65/100), and for 52/100 patients the problem was consistent (eg, occurred everyday). There were no differences for interval between repetitions by dementia severity, but most patients who repeated statements/stories were mild (27/32). Conclusions Verbal repetition is a common problem, and seems especially to be provoked by upcoming events. More frequent repetitions (shorter intervals between each repetition) were associated with goal setting around this problem.",

Effective disease-modifying therapies for AD are desperately needed, but none currently exist on the market. Thus, accelerating the discovery, development, and approval of new disease-modifying drugs for AD is a high priority for individuals, physicians, and medical decision makers. Potentially disease-modifying drugs likely will have significant therapeutic benefits but also may have treatment-related risks. We quantified older Americans' treatment-related risk tolerance by eliciting their willingness to accept the risk of treatment-related death or permanent severe disability in exchange for modifying the course of AD. A stated-choice survey instrument was administered to 2146 American residents 60 years of age and older. On average, subjects were willing to accept a 1-year risk of treatment-related death or permanent severe disability from stroke of over 30% for a treatment that prevents AD from progressing beyond the mild stage. Thus, most people in this age cohort are willing to accept considerable risks in return for disease-modifying benefits of new AD drugs. These results are consistent with other studies indicating that individuals view AD as a serious, life threatening illness that imposes heavy burdens on both patients and caregivers.",

Explicit memory was also assessed, using the verbal paired-associate learning subtest from the Wechsler Memory Scale and the Visual Association Test. Patients with AD obtained a floor performance on both explicit memory tests, whereas a significant learning curve was found for both the stem-completion and the fragmented pictures subtests of the Implicit Memory Test. Delayed testing on the fragmented pictures subtest showed a preserved performance that may have been mediated by implicit learning. Delayed performance on the stem-completion subtest, however, showed clear memory decay that suggests contamination by explicit memory function, at least in the controls. These findings extend the earlier results on word-stem completion and fragmented picture identification in patients with mild-to-moderate AD and indicate that residual learning capacity can be assessed in severe AD.",

Two siblings fulfilling diagnostic criteria for familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) were investigated using [11C]PIB and [18F]FDDNP PET in combination with CSF measures of Aβ42, t-tau and p-tau. PET data were compared with paired [11C]PIB and [18F]FDDNP data from age-matched sporadic AD patients (n=9) and healthy controls (n=6). [11C]PIB retention and CSF levels of Aβ42 in both patients resembled those of controls suggesting the presence of nonamyloid pathology. Genetic testing confirmed the absence of mutations in the presenilin 1 gene in 1 patient; subsequent testing revealed the R406W tau mutation in both individuals leading to a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia [18F]FDDNP retention broadly correlated with CSF levels of t-tau and p-tau. Despite both individuals harbouring the same mutation, [18F]FDDNP retention and CSF t-tau and p-tau were elevated in 1 patient, but not in the other. [11C]PIB imaging and CSF measures of Aβ42 are useful in refuting the presence of underlying amyloid pathology. This, in combination with elevated levels of CSF t-tau and p-tau, has potential value in differential diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia from AD.",

To whole—head MEG recordings were obtained from three diagnosis groups: Alzheimer disease (AD), MCI, and control. Magnetic resonance imaging volumetric data of global brain, temporal lobe, and hippocampal volumes, were also obtained. Results indicated that a reduction of volume in the hippocampal structure allowed the discrimination between AD and MCI patients as compared with controls. The percentage of correct classification was 91.3% when AD versus controls was compared, and 83.3% when we compared MCI versus control. MEG data showed that AD patients exhibit higher θ and δ activity than MCI and controls. Such higher activity was significant in parietal, temporal, and occipital areas. Left parietal theta classified controls versus MCIs with 78.3% rate of correct classification. Right occipital theta and the left parietal delta allowed the discrimination of controls versus ADs, with 81.8% rate of correct classification. Left parietal theta discriminated between ADs and MCIs with 56.6% rate of correct classification. In addition, the combination of both techniques significantly improved the rate of correct classification, thus indicating that a multidisciplinary perspective of techniques may improve the diagnostic capabilities.",

The aim of this study was to examine the sensitivity of the EOLD scales in detecting significant differences in clinically relevant outcomes in nursing home residents with advanced dementia. The SM-EOLD scale was sensitive to detecting changes in comfort among residents with pneumonia, pain, dyspnea, and receiving burdensome interventions. The SWC-EOLD scale was sensitive to detecting changes in HCP satisfaction with the care of residents when addressing whether the health care provider spent >15 minutes discussing the resident's advanced care planning, whether the physician counseled about the resident's live expectancy, whether the resident resided in a special care unit, and whether the physician counseled possible resident health problems. This study extends the psychometric properties of the EOLD scales by showing the sensitivity to clinically meaningful change in these scales to specific outcomes related to end-of-life care and quality of life among residents with end-stage advanced dementia and their HCPs.",

Few reported the mortality and predictive factors on survival of dementia in Asia, especially China. Methods To characterize the epidemiologic pattern of dementia in Shanghai, China, including prevalence and survival, we conducted a cross-sectional, population-based survey among Shanghai residents (≥55 y) and followed a subsample for up to 40 months for survival analysis. A stratified, multistage cluster sampling design was adopted. Results Crude and age-standardized prevalence of dementia was 2.99% and 2.66%, respectively, higher in women and increased with age. Prevalence of Alzheimer was higher than vascular dementia. Furthermore, Alzheimer disease was more prevalent in rural areas than in urban, whereas geographic distribution of vascular dementia was quite the opposite. Crude and age-standardized mortality of dementia was 6.06 and 5.30 per 1000 person-years. There was a striking difference in survival between the demented and nondemented, whereas no significant survival discrepancy existed between Alzheimer and vascular dementia. Factors including overall physical and cognitive function, age, and severity of disease strongly influenced survival and might be predictors for fatal events in dementia patients. Conclusions The epidemiologic pattern of dementia in Shanghai, China is similar to that of western countries.",

The conceptual model proposed that expressed willingness to use a CS would be directly associated with attitudes toward computerized programs, patient-physician relationship, and satisfaction with current health care. In addition, it was hypothesized that technology anxiety and past behavior with CS for dementia diagnosis would affect the expressed willingness to use a CS. Interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of 420 Israeli adults (mean age, 64 y). Structural equation modeling was used to examine the hypothesized relationships. Expressed willingness to use a CS for dementia diagnosis was moderate, although significantly higher when performed by a professional than when performed alone. Overall, the expressed willingness to use a CS for dementia diagnosis was affected by attitudes toward computerized programs, toward patient-physician relationship, and by the level of technology anxiety. Participants with lower socioeconomic status and female participants reported lower levels of intention to use a CS for dementia diagnosis. Findings of the study encourage the development of educational interventions aimed at promoting the use of CS for dementia diagnosis.

However, there has been no study on the correlation of DAT levels between IPD patients with and without cognitive dysfunction. Thus, we evaluated the differences in regional DAT density in the brain of patients with IPD without dementia and those with dementia using FP-CIT positron emission tomography. We recruited 24 consecutive patients with IPD, including 7 with IPD without dementia and 17 with IPD with dementia, and 18 healthy controls. FP-CIT positron emission tomography scans were acquired 90 and 210 minutes after the FP-CIT injection. The DAT density did not differ in the caudate nucleus or the putamen between patients with IPD without dementia and those with dementia. However, the DAT density between the 2 groups with IPD demonstrated a significantly decreased density compared with that of healthy controls in the putamen. We cautiously suggest that there is no relationship between DAT density and cognitive severity because there were no significant differences in the DAT density between IPD with dementia and those without dementia.",

We analyzed MRI scans with FLAIR and/or DWI available of 29 patients with the E200K or the V210I mutation, and a control group of 29 sCJD patients to compare the MRI lesion profile and evaluate the applicability of new MRI criteria to genetic CJD patients.

Lesion profile and frequency of hyperintensities did not differ significantly from the findings in sCJD. New diagnostic MRI criteria yield similar sensitivity for gCJD and sCJD, being 79% and 72%, respectively. MRI provides useful information in E200K and V210I gCJD patients.

The subjects were divided into 3 groups: AD, DLB, or Lewy body variant (LBV). The UPDRS motor scores were totaled and analyzed within and across the MMSE strata using regression techniques. Further, we divided UPDRS subscores into 9 EPSs, dichotomized as either present or absent. Logistic regression analysis was used to compare each of the EPS in the AD and Lewy body (DLB+LBV) groups. DLB subjects (n=130) were more likely to be male individuals, younger, and have higher MMSE scores (P<0.001) compared with that in AD (n=1826) or LBV (n=105) subjects.

However, the range of measures currently available to assess inhibitory processes in FTD is limited, and, as such, inhibitory dysfunction in FTD remains relatively underexplored. Subjective caregiver questionnaires are useful for defining disinhibition as it manifests behaviorally; however, endorsement of symptoms can vary largely across patients as it is contingent on the perceptiveness of the caregiver. The few objective neuropsychological tasks that tap directly into inhibitory functioning have potential, although they mostly rely on intact language and semantics, which can confound performance in FTD patients. An emergent possibility is to explore inhibitory functioning in FTD through nonverbal experimental tasks. Adaptation of such experimental tasks into clinical tools is a promising avenue for exploring one of the earliest behavioral features in FTD patients and concomitantly tap into their prevalent orbitofrontal cortex dysfunction. We suggest that improved characterization of early inhibitory dysfunction may facilitate more accurate diagnosis of FTD.",

Data were obtained from the Dementia Clinic of Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre database and included 407 participants (115 healthy elderly, 41 aMCI, 165 AD, and 86 VD). Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated to detect best CDR-SB cutoffs. Average education was 4 years. A CDR-SB cutoff ≥0.5 was obtained to correctly identify MCI from normal controls (sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 98.3%). The cutoff ≥4.5 correctly identified aMCI from dementia altogether or separately (AD and VD) (sensitivity of 96.4% and specificity of 100%) in 96.9% of the individuals. Similar AUC was found for ≤4 and >4 years of education. The CDR-SB showed good clinical validity to detect and classify severity of cognitive impairment Brazilian patients with low educational attainment. Findings were similar to the original study carried out with higher educated individuals.",

Prospectively collected medication data from 1988-1990, 1993-1995, and 1998-2000 were used to categorize NSAID use history at the cognitive baseline (1998-2000). Aspirin use and nonaspirin NSAID use were separately examined. Cox regression models were used to estimate the associations between NSAID use history at baseline and incident cognitive impairment in 2003-2005 or 2009-2010. Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate associations with a second outcome, mild cognitive impairment/dementia, available in 2009-2010. Participants using aspirin at baseline but not 5 years prior were more likely to develop cognitive impairment (adjusted hazard ratio=1.77; 95% confidence interval=1.11, 2.82; model 2), with nonsignificant associations for longer term use. Nonaspirin NSAID use was not associated with incident cognitive impairment or mild cognitive impairment/dementia odds. These results provided no evidence to support a potential protective effect of NSAIDs against dementia.",

In a longitudinal sample of 51 patients with consensus conference diagnosed MCI likely due to Alzheimer disease (AD), two-year change scores were calculated for a performance measure of functional ability, cognitive variables, and 3 outcome measures used to track progression in neurological disorders. We examined patterns of financial and cognitive decline across the 2-year study period, and used these data and the 3 outcome variables to construct discrete predictor models of clinical progression in MCI. We found that both financial skills and cognitive abilities declined over the 2-year study period, were significantly associated with clinical progression, and contributed unique variance to all 3 predictor models. The resulting models accounted for 40% to 75% of variance in clinical progression across outcome variables. Taken together, our results indicate that changes in both cognitive abilities and higher order functional skills appear integral to understanding clinical progression in MCI likely due to AD. Specifically, declines in financial skills contribute unique variance to measures commonly used to track progression in neurological disorders associated with aging, and thus represent an important functional marker of clinical progression in prodromal AD.",

We sought to identify predictors of driving cessation in patients with dementia, including both baseline characteristics and changes in cognition and function over time as indicators of disease trajectory. A total of 779 patients with dementia were recruited from 9 memory clinics around Australia. Patients and their carers reported their driving status and completed measures of dementia severity, cognition, function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and medication use at regular intervals over a 3-year period. Of the 247 patients still driving at baseline, 147 (59.5%) stopped driving during the study. Variables that predicted driving cessation included older age; female sex; greater dementia severity and cognitive and functional impairments at baseline; and greater increases in dementia severity and cognitive and functional impairments over 3 and 6 month periods. The findings confirm that easily assessable characteristics, including changes over time, predict future driving status. The findings underscore the value of regularly assessing patients with standardized measures to determine disease trajectory and likely prognosis",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Guidelines recommend short-term targeted use of antipsychotic medications for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia only when other strategies have failed. Antipsychotic prescribing in dementia is common internationally, but data on duration of use are limited. Our objectives were to determine duration, time to initiation, and prevalence of antipsychotic use among people with dementia. Methods: This work was a retrospective dynamic cohort study of people aged 65 years or above with dementia in 68 residential aged facilities during the period spanning from 2014 to 2017. Medication administration records were used to identify antipsychotic medication use. Medication outcomes (prevalence, duration, and time to initiation) were estimated using regression. Covariates included comorbidities and sociodemographic and facility characteristics. Results: A total of 5825 residents with dementia were identified. The annual prevalence of antipsychotic use ranged from 27.6% to 32.6%. Mean time to initiation after admission was 308.4 days (for female individuals) and 173.2 days (for male individuals). An overall 65% of people who used antipsychotics did so for &gt;3 months even without psychiatric comorbidities; mean durations were 212.74 (95% confidence interval: 170.24, 255.25) days (for female individuals) and 216.10 (95% confidence interval: 165.31, 266.89) days (for male individuals) at median ages. Discussion: Antipsychotics are often used longer than recommended. Current guidelines and restrictions may be insufficient to limit antipsychotic medication use. Further efforts are needed to ensure that antipsychotic medications are used as recommended in dementia.",

Although quality research assists in addressing the needs of these caregivers, recruiting caregivers into clinical studies is often problematic. This investigation explores the difficulties and successes in recruiting dementia caregivers into community-based clinical research by reporting the findings of a mixed-method substudy of a multicenter randomized controlled trial involving 40 community-dwelling dementia caregivers living in Adelaide, South Australia. Data for the substudy were derived from standardized trial monitoring documentation and structured telephone interviews. From a total of 16 distinct methods used across a 12-month recruitment campaign, the most cost-effective strategy was the distribution of flyers through a single study site. This approach generated the greatest number of enrollments of all methods used, achieving a 67% recruitment yield. The least cost-effective strategy, with a 0% recruitment yield, was the publication of a newspaper advertisement. Themes that emerged from the interviews pointed toward 5 key facilitators and 3 barriers to future trial recruitment. This study has generated new insights into the effective recruitment of dementia caregivers into clinical trials. We anticipate that these lessons learnt will assist in shaping the recruitment strategies of future studies of dementia caregivers.",

Dementia severity was measured semiannually with the Bedford Alzheimer Nursing Severity-Scale (BANS-S).The median BANS-S score at baseline was 13 (range, 7 to 28). Pneumonia occurred in 103 (28%) and intake problems in 126 (34%) of 367 residents with complete registration of pneumonia and intake problems. Compared with dementia severity, incident pneumonia and, even more so, incident intake problems were more strongly associated with mortality risk. Pneumonia and intake problems both mediated the relationship between more severe dementia and mortality.Developing pneumonia and intake problems affects survival, and this is not limited to advanced dementia. The occurrence of pneumonia and intake problems are important signals to consider a palliative care approach in nursing home residents with dementia, and an active focus on advance care planning is needed. Future studies should investigate whether this is also relevant for patients in primary care.",

Both pain and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are clinically relevant and individually associated with a lower QoL; however, there are no studies that investigated pain and NPS together in relation to QoL.In this study, we explored the relationship of pain and NPS with QoL in nursing home residents with dementia by investigating the association between pain concurrently with NPS, and QoL.Secondary data analyses of cross-sectional data from 199 residents were collected by observations at dementia special care units of 10 nursing homes. QoL was measured with Qualidem, pain with the Mobilization Observation Behavior Intensity Dementia (MOBID-2) Pain Scale and NPS with the Neuropsychiatric Symptoms Inventory. The relation of pain and NPS to QoL was studied using multiple linear regression analyses. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, activities of daily living, comorbidity, medication use, and dementia severity.Regression models with pain and NPS, showed no independent relationship between pain and QoL subdomains, but NPS, in particular agitation and depressive symptoms, were significantly associated with lower QoL subdomain scores. Agitation was related to lower scores on the subdomains \"relationship\" [95% confidence interval (CI), -0.083 to -0.059], \"positive affect\" (95% CI, -0.037 to -0.013), \"restless tense behavior\" (95% CI, -0.003 to -0.004), and \"social relations\" (95% CI, -0.033 to -0.009), whereas depression was related to lower scores on the subdomains \"positive affect\" (95% CI, -0.054 to -0.014), \"negative affect\" (95% CI, -0.114 to -0.074), \"restless tense behavior\" (95% CI, -0.075 to -0.025), and \"social relations\" (95% CI, -0.046 to -0.002).Only NPS were significantly associated with QoL in nursing home residents with dementia.

Oral intake is an important interventional target for addressing these nutritional consequences. However, the efficacy of interventions remains poorly understood as prior syntheses have failed to examine the impact of intervention approaches on malnutrition and hypothesized mechanisms of action in persons with dementia. This review aimed to determine the efficacy of mealtime interventions to improve oral intake and nutritional outcomes in persons with dementia. Four databases yielded 1712 studies, resulting in 32 studies that met inclusion criteria. Studies included education, environmental modifications, feeding, oral supplementation, and other pharmacologic/ecopsychological interventions. While the majority of studies reported statistically significant improvements in at least 1 nutritional outcome, study design and outcome measures were heterogenous with many lacking adequate statistical power or blinding. Collectively, we found moderate evidence to suggest the efficacy of oral supplementation, and preliminary evidence to suggest that feeding interventions, education, and environmental modifications may confer improvements. Findings clarify the state of existing evidence regarding various interventional strategies for improving malnutrition in persons with dementia. While some approaches are promising, adequately powered and rigorously designed multidimensional intervention trials are needed to inform clinical decision-making in real-world contexts.",

We aimed to analyze the impairment of cholinergic pathways by positron emission tomography using the [F]-F-A-85380 (FA85) tracer, which has a high affinity for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Aging was assessed by comparing young (n=10) and elderly (n=4) healthy subjects, and the pathologic process of AD was assessed by comparing elderly controls and age-matched AD patients (n=8). We measured an index of the nAChR density in the cortex and the hippocampus and the total number of FA85-binding sites by taking into account the volume changes. In AD, the nAChR density was preserved in both the cortex and hippocampus. The total estimated number of FA85-binding sites was decreased in the hippocampus despite the lack of a significant loss of volume, whereas the difference in the cortex did not withstand the adjustment for multiple comparisons despite a significant loss of volume. In contrast, in aging, the estimated number of FA85-binding sites was decreased in both the cortex and hippocampus with significant hippocampal atrophy. These findings suggest a preferential impairment of cholinergic pathways in the cortex during aging, whereas in AD, this damage predominated in the hippocampus with a potential compensatory cholinergic effect in the cortex.",

    "abstract": "Trace metal dyshomeostasis has been linked to loss of cognitive performance. In particular, a disturbance in the regulation of copper (Cu), characterized by an increase in circulating Cu not bound to ceruloplasmin (non-Cp Cu), is thought to play a role in the development of Alzheimer disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases in the aging population. Non-Cp Cu is redox active and its toxicity is thought to result from its ability to accelerate oxidative stress and advanced glycation endproduct (AGE) formation, leading to extracellular matrix damage in tissues including the brain. Cognitive loss is increasingly recognized to be a feature of type 2 diabetes and the increased AGE formation characteristic of diabetes may play a role in the development of this complication. There also is evidence for copper dyshomeostasis in type 2 diabetes, and therefore this could contribute to the cognitive deterioration associated with this disease. Demonstrating that disturbances of copper homeostasis correlate with an increased rate of cognitive decline in type 2 diabetes patients, and that they correlate with an increased rate of conversion from prediabetes to diabetes would bring almost immediate benefits in the clinical community in terms of treatment efficacy, AD prevention, and cost savings.",

    "abstract": "Awareness of disease is the ability to acknowledge changes caused by deficits related to the disease process. We aimed to investigate whether there are differences in awareness of disease between young-onset dementia (YOD) and late-onset dementia (LOD) and examined how awareness interacts with cognitive and clinical variables.Using a cross-sectional design, 49 people with YOD and 83 with LOD and their caregivers were included. We assessed awareness of disease, cognition, functionality, stage of dementia, mood, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and caregivers' quality of life (QoL) and burden.We found that people with YOD were more aware of the disease than people with LOD (P<0.005). Multivariate linear regression revealed that higher impairment in functional level was associated with unawareness in both groups (YOD=P<0.001; LOD=P<0.001). In the YOD group, preserved awareness was related to worse self-reported QoL (P<0.05), whereas, in LOD, deficits in awareness were related to caregivers' worst perceptions about people with dementia QoL (P<0.001).The findings highlight the distinct nature of awareness between YOD and LOD. The YOD group had higher levels of disease awareness compared with the LOD group, even though the first group had a greater impairment in functionality.",

Investigators conducted telephone interviews with individuals living with DLB and caregivers from a Lewy body dementia specialty center. Interviews employed a semistructured questionnaire querying helpful aspects of care and unmet needs. Investigators used a qualitative descriptive approach to analyze transcripts and identify themes. Twenty individuals with DLB and 25 caregivers participated. Twenty-three of the caregivers were spouses, 2 were daughters. Aspects of clinical care valued by individuals with DLB and caregivers included clinician time, diagnosis, education, symptom management, communication, and caring staff. Unmet needs or challenges included patient/caregiver education, education of nonspecialist clinicians and community care providers, scheduling difficulties, caregiver support, financial concerns, assistance with advance care planning and finding local resources, and effective treatments for DLB symptoms. Improving care for individuals with DLB and their families will require a multipronged strategy including education for nonspecialist care providers, increasing specialty care access, improved clinical care services, research to support disease prognosis and treatment decisions, and local and national strategies for enhanced caregiver support.",

This scoping review aimed to map patients’ and relatives’ experiences of genetic testing and counseling for familial ALS and FTD and the factors influencing their decision to proceed with testing or counseling. Informed by the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology, 5 databases were systematically searched. Thirty studies from 39 references were included. A descriptive numerical summary analysis and narrative synthesis was conducted. Mostly positive diagnostic testing experiences were reported, but issues arose due to progressive disease and discordant results. Predictive testing impacted at-risk relatives, regardless of the result received, and psychosocial sequelae ranged from relief to guilt, worry or contemplating suicide. Four reproductive testing experiences were reported. Personal, familial and practical factors, and the lived experience of disease, informed decision-making. Greater uncertainty and complexity may be faced in familial ALS/FTD than in other late-onset neurodegenerative diseases due to clinical and genetic heterogeneity, and testing limitations. Genetic counseling models of care should consider this difference to ensure that individuals with, or at risk of, ALS/FTD are effectively managed. Implications for research and practice are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Background: The relationship between the Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet and cognition has not been widely investigated in low- to middle-income countries. We investigated the relationship between MIND diet and cognition in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) baseline data. Methods: We included 11,788 participants. MIND diet adherence was based on the intake of 15 components according to a food frequency questionnaire. We analyzed the association between MIND diet adherence and global cognition, memory, and executive function using adjusted linear regression. We examined the interaction between income and MIND diet adherence on cognition and presented income stratified analyses. Results: MIND diet adherence was not associated with cognition in the whole sample. Income was an effect modifier of MIND adherence on global cognition ( P =0.03) and executive function ( P &lt;0.001). For participants with high income, greater adherence was associated with better executive function [β=0.015, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.002; 0.028, P =0.025]; while for participants with low income, greater adherence was associated with lower global cognition (β=−0.020, 95% CI=−0.036; −0.005, P =0.010) and executive function (β=−0.023, 95% CI=−0.039; −0.007, P =0.004). Adherence to the MIND diet was higher among participants with high income ( P &lt;0.001). Conclusion: For high-income participants, greater adherence was associated with better cognitive performance; for low-income participants, greater adherence was associated with lower cognitive performance.",

The results of amyloid PET scans could help people with cognitive impairment and caregivers better understand their diagnosis; however, there are concerns that they could also cause psychological harm. Methods: A systematic review of psychosocial and behavioral quantitative outcomes following the disclosure of an amyloid PET scan for persons living with cognitive impairment (subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s Disease, and other dementias) and caregivers. Findings: Ten papers were identified from 7 studies. There was little evidence of an association between disclosure and depression. However, persons with mild cognitive impairment and their caregivers with elevated levels of amyloid had an increased risk of distress or anxiety compared with those without elevated amyloid. Participants correctly recalled the scan results; however, it is unclear whether this led to an increased understanding of their diagnosis. We did not identify any studies measuring behavioral outcomes. Conclusions: We found mixed evidence on the relationship between amyloid scans and psychosocial and behavioral outcomes in people with cognitive impairment and caregivers. These findings highlight the need for more methodologically rigorous research on this topic.",

Methods: One hundred caregivers completed a survey that included TCQ items along with measures of technology proficiency and patient and caregiver-centered outcomes. Results: The final 34-item TCQ scale had adequate to excellent internal consistency (raw Cronbach alpha = 0.75; standardized Cronbach alpha = 0.95; Guttman lambda-6 = 0.97). TCQ scores demonstrated modest convergent associations with scores from measures of smartphone ( r = 0.265, P &lt; 0.01) and computer proficiency ( r = 0.230, P &lt; 0.05) but a strong association with overall technology experience scores ( r = 0.578, P &lt; 0.001).

Methods: The study examined 1124 participants, including 343 with Alzheimer disease (AD), 127 with AD with TBI, 266 cognitively normal adults with TBI, and 388 cognitively normal adults without TBI. Cortical thickness was quantified from T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data. Multiple linear regression was used to determine the interaction between AD and TBI on cortical thickness. Results: Among those with AD, TBI was associated with an earlier age of AD onset but, counterintuitively, less cortical thinning in frontotemporal regions relative to non-AD controls. Discussion: AD with TBI represents a distinct group from AD, likely with distinct pathologic contributions beyond gray matter loss. This finding has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of AD in the presence of TBI and indicates that models of AD, aging, and neural loss should account for TBI history.",

This study explored its factor structure, characterized carers’ experiences at discharge, and identified predictors of carer preparedness to manage medications at discharge. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of carers across Australia was distributed. Survey responses were analyzed descriptively, and exploratory factor and regression analyses were performed. Results: A total of 185 survey responses were completed. Exploratory factor analysis revealed 2 factors in the CATCH tool: (1) shared and supported decision-making in medication management (16 items loading 0.47 to 0.93); 2) provision of medication management guidance that is easy to understand (4 items loading (0.48 to 0.82). Internal consistency was acceptable (Cronbach alpha &gt;0.8). Almost 18% of participants stated that they were not included in decisions about medications for people with dementia. The carer reported that the measure of how guidance is provided was positively related to their confidence in the management of medications postdischarge and satisfaction ( P &lt; 0.05 for both). Conclusions: The CATCH tool can give the patient and carer an opportunity to provide feedback on key elements of medication management guidance delivered at discharge.",

The frequency of light or heavy PA was summarized as 2 continuous variables. Outcomes were z-scored executive function, semantic memory, and verbal episodic memory. We tested associations of PA with mean cognition using linear regression and used quantile regression to estimate the association of PA with the 10th-90th percentiles of cognitive scores. Results: Higher levels of PA were associated with higher mean semantic memory (b = 0.10; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.14) and executive function (b = 0.05; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.09).

We used mortality data from the Rotterdam study, a population-based prospective study in the 55+-year age range to calculate overall and severity-specific excess mortality for the demented. Lost life years were calculated by decomposing the (mixed) Dutch life table of 1990-1992 in two populations, the demented and the healthy, using prevalence and excess (all cause) mortality. Healthy life loss was calculated by a modified Sullivan technique, weighting for disease severity. Our results indicated that mortality was increased in the demented, in all age, sex, and severity groups. Mortality rate ratios were 2.1 (men) and 2.3 (women), with ranges of 1.7-3.4 (men) and 2.0-3.1 (women), depending on severity. Fifty-five-year-old men lose 1.2 life years due to morbidity and mortality and 0.7 life years due to mortality resulting from dementia. Women lose 3.1 and 1.9 life years, respectively. This population-based study provides evidence that mortality is increased in the demented at all stages, including minimal dementia. The quantified health impact on the general population is in the same order as that of lung cancer or stroke",

Development of improved outcome measures for AD clinical trials is a major objective of the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS), an NIA-sponsored, multisite clinical trials consortium. The ADCS Instrument Development Project evaluated the sensitivity, reliability and validity of new or improved measures in each of five assessment domains: (a) cognition (immediate and delayed memory, praxis, attention, and executive function); (b) clinical global change; (c) activities of daily living; (d) behavioral symptoms (agitation and other noncognitive symptoms); and (e) cognition in severely impaired patients. A total of 306 English-speaking subjects were enrolled in the study, including AD patients stratified by disease severity and cognitively normal, age-matched elderly subjects. Half were retested at 1 month and 2 months after baseline, and all received 6-and 12-month follow-up assessments. Spanish versions of these new measures are currently being evaluated. The development of this multisite study, the common methods and procedures, and a detailed description of the cohort are provided in this overview article. This multisite project demonstrates the feasibility of a consortium approach to instrument development. We were able to develop new instruments and efficiently evaluate their reliability and sensitivity to longitudinal change by capitalizing on the experience and patient resources of the participating ADCS research sites.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that the sensitivity of global cognitive and functional measures to change in Alzheimer disease is related to overall disease severity. The present study assessed the sensitivity to decline, over a 12-month interval, for individual items of the cognitive portion of the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog), the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (IADLS), and the Physical Self-Maintenance Scale (PSMS). This study was conducted in an effort to identify individual items likely to be sensitive at different stages of the disease. A total of 151 patients with Alzheimer disease were classified into four dementia categories by baseline scores on the Blessed Test of Information, Memory, and Concentration. The patients were retested after 12 months. For the individual items and for total scores on both the ADAS-Cog and the IADLS, rate of change was greater for patients in the moderate and severe categories than for mild or very severe patients. For individual items and for the total score on the PSMS, rate of change was greater for severe and very severe patients than for patients with mild or moderate disease.",

    "abstract": "Summary: In recent years, a possible relation between the aluminum and silicon levels in drinking water and the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) has been established. It has been suggested that silicon may have a protective effect in limiting oral aluminum absorption. The present study was undertaken to examine the influence of supplementing silicon in the diet to prevent tissue aluminum retention in rats exposed to oral aluminum. Three groups of adult male rats were given by gavage 450 mg/kg/day of aluminum nitrate nonahydrate 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Concurrently, animals received silicon in the drinking water at 0 (positive control), 59, and 1 18 mg Si/L. A fourth group ( — Al, —Si) was designated as a negative control group. At the end of the period of aluminum and silicon administration, urines were collected for 4 consecutive days, and the urinary aluminum levels were determined. The aluminum concentrations in the brain (various regions), liver, bone, spleen, and kidney were also measured. For all tissues, aluminum levels were significantly lower in the groups exposed to 59 and 118 mg Si/L than in the positive control group; significant reductions in the urinary aluminum levels of the same groups were also found. The current results corroborate that silicon effectively prevents gastrointestinal aluminum absorption, which may be of concern in protecting against the neurotoxic effects of aluminum.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia in developed Western countries. Over time, affected patients invariably develop cognitive and functional decline, and most develop early or later behavioral disturbances. Declining cognitive and functional abilities contribute to loss of independent living and feelings of denial, confusion, fear and guilt until, finally, the patient loses most abilities to think, move, speak, or perceive. As patients' dependency on assistance increases, the level of caregiver strain rises. The caregiver may develop feelings of anger, grief, loneliness and resentment, and the health and well-being of most caregivers are often affected. Approximately 3-4 million people currently have AD in the USA, at an annual cost of up to US$100 billion, and the disease is expected to reach epidemic proportions by 2020. To achieve a clinically relevant, long-term outcome, pharmacotherapy must have sustained favorable effects on cognitive, functional and behavioral symptoms of AD. Slowing the development of these features of the disease will mean a long-term improvement in quality of life for patients and caregivers. Postponing the emergence of behavioral symptoms would bring about direct beneficial effects on patients with AD and their families, help delay long-term care placement and lower costs.",

In 1860, Morel recognized brain atrophy with aging. The modern history of vascular dementia began in 1896, when Emil Kraepelin in his textbook Psychiatrie included \"arteriosclerotic dementia\" among the senile dementias, following the ideas of Otto Binswanger and Alois Alzheimer, who had differentiated clinically and pathologically arteriosclerotic brain lesions from senile dementia and from neurosyphilitic general paresis of the insane.

Kinetic analysis was performed to calculate k3, an index of acetylcholinesterase activity. The k3 values were significantly reduced in the neocortex, hippocampus, and amygdala of all patients with Alzheimer disease, suggesting a loss of cholinergic innervation from the basal forebrain. Most profound reductions of k3 values were observed in the temporal (-30%) and parietal cortices (-31%), although reductions of k3 values were relatively uniform in the cerebral neocortex.

    "abstract": "Because the clinical picture of Alzheimer disease (AD) is often difficult to discriminate from other dementing illnesses, the diagnosis of AD requires neuropathological confirmation. However, for the pathological diagnosis of AD, there are no unanimously accepted criteria. The three currently used sets of pathological criteria (Khachaturian: Khachaturian, Arch Neural 1985;42:1097–105; Tierny: Tierney et al., Can J Neural Sci 1986;13:424–6; CERAD: Mirra et al., Neurology 1991;41:479–86) for the disease differ from each other considerably. We applied these criteria to the first 43 consecutive subjects (37 demented) with no neuropathology other than AD-type pathology from autopsies after longitudinal prospective clinical study in the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA). The results show that the CERAD category of definite AD corresponds closely with the cases that fulfill Tierney A3 inclusion criteria for AD. The combined CERAD categories of possible, probable, and definite AD correspond closely to cases fulfilling Khachaturian criteria for AD. The influence of a clinical diagnosis of dementia when Khaehaturian and CERAD criteria were applied was considerable because between 9.3% and 90.7% of patients would have been categorized differently depending on whether clinical dementia was present or absent.",

Seventy-one AD patients who lived in the community, 50 institutionalized AD patients, both AD groups' respective primary caregivers, and 50 healthy elderly subjects were interviewed. The interviews covered information about the number of caregivers' hours invested in caring for the patient and amount of expenditures such as in house paid help and payments for day care. The annual social cost of caring for a person with AD in Israel was approximately $17,000, whether the patient lived at home or in a nursing home, but the cost components differed in the two groups. For community-dwelling patients, 60% of the cost represented an imputed value of unpaid indirect care compared with 12% for institutionalized patients. Also, in both residences, the private cost was significantly higher than the public cost, i.e., more 75% of the services provided to patients were paid out of pocket. Cost of institutionalization was the major component of the social cost. The cost of the disease increased with functional and cognitive deterioration for the community-dwelling group only. With projected increases in the number of persons at risk for developing AD, the economic impact of the disease on future costs will be significant. Efforts to delay deterioration and, as a result, delay institutionalization seem crucial for cost containment.",

These studies were analyzed for their common findings, strengths, and limitations. Many studies reveal an increased crash rate for drivers with DAT compared with nondemented older drivers. Studies suggest that 50% of DAT drivers stop driving within 3 years of the onset of disease, the risk for a motor vehicle crash increases with the duration of driving after disease onset, males are at increased risk for crashes, dementia severity does not correlate with risk for a crash, and additional medical conditions may further contribute to crash risk. Areas of focus for future studies in this field are discussed.",

In a nursing home an area was selected to provide an appropriate environment for individuals with dementia. The physical environment was adapted, and the staff was trained to meet the needs of demented patients. Sixteen residents were transferred from traditional wards to the SCU. Functional status, cognitive performance, behavioral symptoms, and use of psychotropic drugs or physical restraints were assessed before and 6 months after admission to the SCU. Our findings show that transferring demented persons from traditional nursing home wards to an SCU significantly lessens behavioral problems but does not improve functional abilities or cognitive status after a short period of follow-up. Changes in caring strategies (in particular the use of physical restraints) seem to be important in reducing behavioral problems. The regional government of Lombardia (8.5 million inhabitants) decided to open small (20-bed) SCUs in 60 nursing homes (corresponding to 3.5% of the total nursing home beds in our region) and to reserve these units for demented a high level of behavioral disturbances.",

AChE is suggested to guide and stabilize growing axons. Pathologically, cholinesterase expression in AD shows some resemblance to that in the embryo. These findings are inconsistent with the \"cholinergic hypothesis.\" Rather, it is suggested that cholinesterases in AD function nonclassically as in the embryo, possibly as part of a \"neoembryonic\" restorative program.

Thirteen patients had ≤8 years of schooling (less educated subgroup), and the other 11 had ≥8 years (higher educated subgroup). There were no significant differences between the two subgroups regarding age and duration of symptoms. Performance within each subgroup was compared with that of a specific set of education-matched elderly controls. In the less educated subgroup, 10 patients evidenced a homogeneous pattern of cognitive impairment, with all cognitive areas being similarly affected. Conversely, 10 higher educated patients had at least one cognitive area relatively preserved in comparison with the others, characterizing a heterogeneous pattern of impairment.

    "abstract": "Red blood cell (RBC) acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition has been used as a peripheral surrogate marker for the activity of centrally acting AChE inhibitors (AChEIs) in the treatment of Alzheimer disease. As a valid peripheral surrogate marker, RBC AChE inhibition should reflect the central pharmacodynamic activity of the compound and should demonstrate a relation with cognitive or global improvement in patients with Alzheimer disease. As a useful clinical tool, RBC AChE inhibition should also provide an advantage in dose optimization. However, the application of surrogate markers in research and clinical use is controversial (Prentice, 1989; Gotzsche, 1996; Colburn, 1997; De Gruttola et al., 1997). For instance, surrogate markers that have been identified or applied inappropriately can lead to erroneous conclusions, slowing the drug development process (Colburn, 1997). Also, the validation of surrogate markers for the pharmacodynamic activity of central nervous system drugs is not always possible because samples of brain tissue cannot be analyzed in humans. Finally, although validation of peripheral markers for central nervous system drugs has been approached via analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (Cutler et al., 1998a), few markers have been subjected to such rigorous evaluation in clinical studies. The extent to which measures of peripheral AChE inhibition accurately model central drug activity and therapeutic effectiveness of AChEIs, both as individual agents and as a drug class, is the focus of this review. AChEIs comprise a group of structurally diverse compounds with a wide range of relative specificities for the various molecular species of cholinesterase found in plasma, RBCs, and the brain. Studies of RBC AChE inhibition after administration of AChEIs in animals are of limited utility because of the differential sensitivity of AChEIs for human versus animal forms of AChE, the poor correlation between effective doses in animals and humans, and the lack of standardized measurements of effectiveness. Although clinical studies of donepezil, metrifonate, and eptastigmine have suggested the potential use of RBC AChE inhibition as a predictor of clinical response, the degree of inhibition yielding maximum cognitive improvements was highly variable from compound to compound (30–80%). Further, investigators did not prove a relation between central and peripheral pharmacodynamics or demonstrate an advantage over dose in the ability of RBC AChE inhibition to predict clinical response. A study of rivastigmine in patients with Alzheimer disease revealed that cerebrospinal fluid AChE inhibition correlated well with cognitive performance, whereas peripheral inhibition did not. Therefore, RBC cholinesterase inhibition is not a reliable surrogate marker for the activity of AChEIs as a class of drugs, and its usefulness as a dose optimization tool for individual agents has yet to be demonstrated clearly.",

    "abstract": "The ±4 allele at APOE, the polymorphic locus for apolipoprotein E, increases the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD), especially among those with the homozygous ±4/±4 genotype. In family studies, ±4 homozygotes typically develop AD at 55–75 years, an age range when AD is otherwise relatively infrequent. Population-based studies of the AD risk associated with allele ±4 (and especially with genotype ±4/±4) are limited in number, and most such studies have included few AD cases between the ages of 55 and 75 years. In a large population-based twin registry, the screening of 12,709 men who were 62–73 years old yielded 38 prevalent cases of AD whose onset age ranged from 54 to 73. Genotype at APOE was determined for 37 of these cases and, independently, for a similarly aged probability sample of 344 men from the same registry. The ±4 allele frequencies among the AD cases and the population samples were 0.39 and 0.15, respectively. The odds ratios (ORs) for AD were 17.7 for genotype ±4/±4 versus ±3/±3 and 13.8 for ±4/±4 versus all remaining genotypes. By contrast, the ORs with heterozygous ±4/±3 were only 2.76 versus ±3/±3 and 2.01 versus all genotypes other than ±4/±3 (p for homozygote vs. heterozygote ORs = 0.002). The estimated etiologic fraction for AD with homozygous ±4 among men in their mid-50s to mid 70s is therefore 0.20; for the much more common heterozygous genotype ±4/±3, the fraction is 0.18. In combination with other studies that have adjusted statistically for age, these results suggest that the effect of the ±4 allele dose is neither linear nor homogeneous for age. Homozygous ±4/±4 appears to confer an extreme risk of AD at the age when onset with this genotype is most likely. These results are consistent with the view that individual genotypes modify risk by predisposing to substantially different distributions of AD onsets.",

In contrast, no difference was found between the two diagnostic groups in the levels of β-thromboglobulin, prothrombin fragment 1+2, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor. No other association but diagnosis was found with thrombomodulin and sE-selectin. These findings suggest that endothelial dysfunction is an early event in AD patients.",

    "abstract": "Nonneural tissues are now widely used to search for abnormalities in genes as well as for other markers of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). Studies of nonneural tissues can experimentally circumvent problems inherent in the study of autopsy brain, but to be meaningful, abnormalities identified in the periphery must be correlated with abnormalities in the brain, which is the tissue of clinical interest. Among the topics in DAT research that can be readily studied in nonneural cells (including tissue cultures) are molecular genetics, amyloid precursor protein formation and metabolism, systemic manifestations of immunological and inflammatory mechanisms, proteolysis, membranes, signal transduction, and mitochondria and metabolism. Although phenomena suggesting the possibility of cytoskeletal abnormalities in nonneural DAT cells have been described, the τ molecules involved in paired helical filament formation are relatively brain-specific. Since the neuropathological diagnosis of DAT depends on recognizing a pattern of changes rather than any single abnormality, it seems unlikely that any one laboratory abnormality in peripheral tissues will correlate precisely with the clinicopathological entity of DAT. However, abnormalities found in nonneural DAT cells that correlate with the existence of similar abnormalities in the brain are likely to be informative about the disease process in the patients in whom they occur.",

    "abstract": "Summary: Multi-infarct dementia (MID), thought to result from the cumulative effect of repeated episodes of cerebral infarction, represents a sizable proportion of the dementia cases in the population. The frequency of MID as the cause of dementia is commonly quoted as 12-20%, but a more conservative figure on the order of 10% is suggested from prospective epidemiologic studies. Its prevalence increases steadily with advancing age, and a male predominance has been noted. Geographical variations in prevalence of MID may reflect true geographic/ethnic differences or lack of uniformity in the use of diagnostic criteria. Risk factors possibly associated with dementia after stroke include advancing age, previous cerebral or myocardial infarction, an atherothrombotic stroke mechanism, and cerebral atrophy as detected by imaging studies. In order to clarify the role of cerebrovascular disease as a cause of dementia, future epidemiologic studies should define the entity in precise terms, and place emphasis on clearly establishing the temporal relationship between stroke and dementia; new onset of dementia should be correlated with the clinical and anatomic features of the stroke.",

To fulfil these aims, a four-point competency rating scale (1 = incompetent, 2 = marginally competent, 3 = sufficiently competent, and 4 = completely competent) was used in 70 patients (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score >9; Global Deterioration Scale score <6) and in 40 cognitively normal caregivers. Patients were divided into two subgroups (competency ratings 1 and 2 versus 3 and 4) to calculate positive and negative predictive values of MMSE and Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale–cognitive (ADAScog) for absent/marginal competence. Main results were as follows: (1) 32.9% of AD patients were \"incompetent\" (no caregivers), 37.1% were \"marginally competent\" (20% caregivers), 18.6% were \"sufficiently competent\" (50% caregivers), and 11.4% were \"completely competent\" (30% caregiverss). (2) Competency ratings and age did not correlate in AD, whereas a negative correlation was significant in caregivers; competency ratings positively correlated to education in caregivers. (3) ADAScog and MMSE were the tests most significantly correlated to competency; MMSE score below 18 had a positive predictive value of 95% and a negative predictive value of 63.3%. The fact that 95% of patients with MMSE scores below 18 are incompetent or marginally competent points to an urgent need for ethical procedures capable of creating a balance between difficulties in obtaining valid consent and a patient's right to benefit from advances in clinical research.",

The present report describes the neuropathology of 52 brains with FTLD without tau pathology compared with 10 brains of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) without dementia using ubiquitin immunohistochemistry. The 52 cases were classified into 47 cases of FTLD with motor neuron disease (MND)-type inclusions but without MND (FTLD-MNI), three cases of FTLD with MND (FTLD-MND), and two cases of dementia lacking distinctive histopathology (DLDH) based on the features of ubiquitin-immunoreactive (ubiquitin-ir) structures in the caudate, frontotemporal cortices and dentate fascia, and presence or absence of neuronal loss in lower motor neurons. Many ubiquitin-ir neuronal inclusions and neurites in the caudate nucleus, frontotemporal cortices, and ubiquitin-ir crescent-or ring-shaped neuronal inclusions in the dentate fascia characterized FTLD-MNI. Ubiquitin-ir neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NII) were observed in 26 of 43 cases and associated with many neurites in the caudate nucleus as well as a familial history in most cases. A subset of cases had Pick-body-like inclusions in the dentate fascia and caudate nucleus with paucity of neuritic pathology and no NII; another had crescent-shaped inclusions in the dentate fascia and neuritic pathology with NII in the caudate. FTLD with MND was characterized by a few or no ubiquitin-ir inclusions in the caudate nucleus and frontotemporal cortices and ubiquitin-ir granular inclusions in the dentate fascia, as well as loss of lower motor neurons. These features were similar to ALS, but different from FTLD-MNI. The findings suggest that FTLD-MNI has a different pathogenesis from FTLD-MND and ALS.",

We identified characteristics that differed between autopsied and non-autopsied subjects from an incident-based dementia case series and compared autopsy-based estimates of the relative frequency of np diagnoses before and after adjusting for potential selection bias. Clinically demented subjects who were autopsied (n = 206), had died but were not autopsied (n = 271), were still alive (n = 71), or had dropped out of the study (n = 82) were included. Compared with non-autopsied subjects, autopsied subjects were more likely to be Caucasian, educated beyond high school, and married. They also tended to have a lower baseline Mini-Mental State Examination score and were more likely to have a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) than non-autopsied subjects. Neuropathological AD with Lewy bodies (LB) had the largest crude relative frequency estimate at 38% of the autopsy sample, followed by 25% for AD with vascular lesions, 13% for pure AD, 13% for LB (with or without vascular lesions), and 8% for pure vascular pathologies. Adjustment for potential sources of selection bias had little effect on relative frequency estimates, suggesting that np diagnoses in the autopsied subjects provide reasonable dementia relative frequency estimates among all clinically demented cases in this series.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between semantic dementia (SD) and primary progressive aphasia (PPA) has been the subject of debate ever since the syndromes were first described, in converging streams of research from the neuropsychological and neurologic communities. The most salient clinical features of SD are anomia with circumlocution and semantic paraphasia, single-word comprehension deficit, and reduced category fluency. Of critical importance is the fact that patients also show deficits on non-verbal tasks using visual, auditory, and other modalities, suggesting that the key impairment in SD is a breakdown in conceptual knowledge rather than a specific problem with language. The finding of item consistency between the various tests supports this view. The order in which the features appear can be explained by the variable degree of redundancy in access to semantic knowledge from the different perceptual modalities. Atrophy is seen in the anterior and inferior temporal lobe rather than in classic language areas, further distancing SD from aphasic syndromes. Semantic dementia and progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA) share some clinical and pathologic characteristics with frontal variant frontotemporal dementia, but there are also clear differences between the three syndromes. We believe that many patients described as having fluent primary progressive aphasia in fact have early SD. Semantic dementia is a well-defined syndrome, distinct from PNFA but related to it within the spectrum of frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes.",

    "abstract": "Summary: The dietary intake of 29 healthy controls was compared with that of 35 community-dwelling patients with probable or definite senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT), based on NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. The control subject or the caregiver of the SDAT patient completed a 3-day estimated-dietaryintake record. Foods offered to patients were chosen, for the most part, by caregivers, but SDAT patients were allowed to eat ad libitum from those choices, and food consumed was recorded. Dietary intake was evaluated against the 1989 Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA). Dietary intakes did not differ significantly between control and SDAT patients for any of the 32 nutrients analyzed. The controls and SDAT patients met the RDA guidelines for intake of total energy, protein, and micronutrients, with the exception of female SDAT patients, who did not consume a minimum of two thirds of the RDA for vitamin D. All biochemical indices of nutritional status were within normal limits for the SDAT patients. In addition, cognitive function did not correlate with intake of any nutrient studied. We conclude that moderately impaired, community-dwelling patients with SDAT do not differ from healthy controls in nutritional status or nutrient intake. Neither general nor nutrient-specific malnutrition was present in this population. Based on this cross-sectional study, malnutrition does not appear to be a major contributor to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. However, this investigation examined only a single point in time, when patients were being fed by caregivers, so that the role of malnutrition at the beginning of the disease was not addressed.",

The human diseases belonging to this group are Creutz-feld-Jakob disease, kuru, and Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome. Scrapie, transmissible mink encephalopathy, chronic wasting disease of mule deer and elk, and the recently discovered bovine spongiform encephalopathy are similar diseases found in animals. Unusual characteristics of the unconventional slow infections clearly distinguish these disorders from conventional infections. These include: unusually long incubation periods (from months to years); progressive CNS degeneration with characteristic histopathological lesions; the lack of an immune or inflammatory response; unconventional biological and physical properties of the etiologic agents. There has been considerable controversy concerning the nature of the causative agent. The 3 main hypotheses, virus, virino, and modified host protein, are reviewed relative to their ability to explain the properties of the agent and the unusual characteristics of the disease process. The discovery of an abnormal structure, termed scrapie associated fibrils (SAF) and an abnormally modified 33–37 kDa host-encoded glycoprotein unique to unconventional slow infections opened new areas of intense interest and investigation. SAF are abnormal filamentous structures which copurify with infectivity and possess characteristics of “amyloids.” The major component of SAF is the host-encoded scrapie-specific protease resistant glycoprotein. Considerable data has accumulated on the biochemistry, immunology and molecular biology of this host coded scrapie protein. The relationship of SAF and the scrapie-specific protein to the infectious agent is discussed in the context of each of the “nature of the agent” hypotheses.",

About 50% of the sample received ChE-Is. The total follow-up period was 36 months. We used Cox proportional hazard regressions to estimate the risk of NH placement. After adjusting for age, sex, race, and cooccurring diagnoses, we found that dementia patients receiving ChE-Is had reduced risk of NH placement by 28% at 12 months [hazard ratio (HR)=0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-0.94] and 21% at 18 months (HR=0.79, 95% CI 0.62-0.99). The reduction in risk was more pronounced in patients with Alzheimer disease only and was still significant at 24 months after baseline (HR=0.66, 95% CI 0.43-0.99). At 36 months, the association between taking ChE-Is and risk of NH placement was not significant and the proportion of participants placed in a nursing was almost identical. Therapy with ChE-Is may temporarily reduce the risk of NH placement in Medicaid beneficiaries with dementia, thereby improving quality of life and preserving personal and societal resources.",

    "abstract": "For observational or prevention studies, accurately identifying by mail and telephone cognitively normal elderly volunteers would be cost effective. We describe how to recruit cognitively normal sib-pairs over age 80 using commercially available lists by age and ZIP code. We mailed an Institutional Review Board-approved letter to 24,366 persons over 85 around Jacksonville, FL, and received ∼3000 postcard replies with ∼500 answering 3 screening statements affirmatively. Of these, we recruited 128 persons who underwent both in-person and telephone evaluations, the latter using the Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status-modified (TICS-m) and Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR). Blinded to the TICS-m and CDR data, clinicians made a consensus diagnosis for each participant, 120 were normal and 8 had mild cognitive impairment. With CDR, 119 patients (93%) screened as normal, and of these 115 (97%) were confirmed as normal with the consensus diagnosis. A TICS-m score cut-off of <29 resulted in a similar proportion of normals in the screened sample (97% or 103/106); however, 13 normal volunteers would have been excluded because they scored <29 on the TICS-m. Supplementing the sample, we recruited 12 age-matched cases having consensus diagnosis of dementia (n=2) or mild cognitive impairment (n=10). A CDR>0 correctly identified 12/12, whereas the TICS-m <29 correctly identified 7/12. Hearing loss present in 50% did not influence TICS-m or CDR performance. Using stringent entry criteria and the telephone CDR, this method accurately identified normal elderly persons.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological data reporting the predisposition of women to Alzheimer disease has provided researchers with an important clue as to the identity of the driving pathogenic force and lead many to question the potential role of sex steroids, namely estrogen, in disease pathogenesis. However, while estrogen has become the primary focus of research in the field, inconclusive data regarding estrogen replacement therapy has lead some researchers to begin investigating the effects of the other hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis on the aging brain. Certain hormones of the HPG axis, namely the gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone), are not only involved in regulating reproductive function via a complex feedback loop but are also known to cross the blood-brain barrier. Recently, we proposed that an increase in gonadotropin concentrations, not the decrease in steroid hormone (eg, estrogen) production following menopause/andropause, is a potentially primary causative factor for the development of Alzheimer disease. In this review, we examine how the gonadotropins may play a central and determining role in modulating the susceptibility to, and progression of, Alzheimer disease. Based on this, we suggest that therapeutic interventions targeted at gonadotropins may both prevent disease in those patients currently asymptomatic or may halt, and even reverse, disease in those currently afflicted.",

The purpose was to determine whether performance on the CERAD-NB, a cognitive screening battery used to evaluate dementia in the elderly, is affected by cultural differences between these two groups, after controlling for age, education, and gender. All subjects were administered the CERAD-NB as part of a standard diagnostic evaluation. Statistical analyses revealed no significant differences between the two groups on any measures from the CERAD-NB. Thus, the CERAD-NB appears to be an efficient cognitive screening assessment in English-speaking Native Americans with known or suspected dementing illness and it appears that special norms may not be necessary in this population. However, additional studies of larger samples are needed for confirmation and to explore factors such as education, acculturation, and degree of Native American heritage, which may influence cognitive test performance.",

    "abstract": "In 1907, Alzheimer's single case report of presenile dementia led to the condition being recognized as a rare disease of middle-aged people. In 1964, Roth and colleagues reported an epidemiologic survey showing that the same condition was in fact a relatively common disease of the elderly. In 1987, Katzman introduced the concept of brain reserve, suggesting how individuals could have Alzheimer disease pathology in their brains without clinically manifesting the disease. In 1999, Petersen described mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as an amnestic state, since broadened to include other cognitive deficits, which, in the majority of patients, was a prelude to the development of full-blown Alzheimer disease or other dementia. MCI today is in some ways analogous to Alzheimer disease a century ago. We recognize and describe MCI clinically, among patients with memory complaints, but we do not know its distribution, outcomes, and risk factors in the elderly population at large. All population-based studies to date have found MCI to be an unstable and heterogeneous entity with a far wider range of outcomes than in the clinical setting, including reversion to normal in a substantial proportion. However, these studies thus far have been purely descriptive, and retro-fitted on to existing studies of dementia, using measurements not necessarily appropriate for the assessment of MCI. This review will address what is known and what has yet to be determined about MCI from the perspectives of the classic 7 uses of epidemiology.",

    "abstract": "Background Medical, functional, and behavioral problems are associated with transitions from assisted living (AL), but limited information is available on those at highest risk for transition. Methods We conducted a multidisciplinary geriatric team assessment of individuals newly admitted to 2 dementia-specific AL communities from January 2000 to March 2002. Transitions of individuals to permanent skilled nursing facilities (SNF) was assessed for 9 months. Multidisciplinary assessment on admission included medical and cognitive evaluations, physical function, nutritional status, and psychosocial adjustment. Results Twenty-four men and 24 women with a mean age of 83±6 years were assessed. Mental status score was 15±6. Residents had 2.1±1.7 comorbidities and were prescribed 1.7±1.2 medications. During follow-up, 23 (47.9%) transitioned to SNF and 9 (18.8%) individuals died (censored events). Significant predictors of transfer to nursing home from AL by one-predictor Cox proportional hazards model included depression score [hazard ratio (HR) 1.19; P=0.008], dependent activities of daily living (HR 1.18; P=0.014), gait speed (HR 1.15; P=0.004), modified Berg Balance Score (HR 0.88; P=0.004), and mental status score (HR 0.924, P=0.034). Our multivariate model selected by the forward procedure indicates that the modified Berg Balance Scale score predicted transfer to permanent nursing home with a interquartile HR of 0.91 (95% CI 0.8264, 0.989). Conclusions A significant number of new residents of dementia-specific AL transitioned to SNF over 9 months. In univariate analysis, depression score, walking speed, balance, and mental status score were significantly associated with transition and in multivariate analysis, balance performance predicted transfer. These results suggest that fall risk should receive attention on admission to AL to potentially mitigate the high transfer rate.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the changes of intrahemispheric and interhemispheric linear spectral electroencephalography (EEG) coherence associated with increasing hippocampal atrophy (HA) and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Eighty-five MCI patients underwent clinical and neuropsychologic assessment, EEG recordings, and magnetic resonance imaging. Intrahemispheric (fronto-temporal, temporo-parietal, and fronto-parietal) and interhemispheric (frontal, temporal, and parietal) linear EEG coherence was computed. MCI patients were categorized into classes of increasing HA and WMHs on the basis of tertile distribution of volume loss (high, mid, and low). Neuropsychologic tests were also gathered and compared in MCI subgroups. As expected, MCI patients with high WMHs had poorer performance on visuospatial and cognitive flexibility, whereas those with high HA failed on memory tests. Significant differences of EEG functional coupling were present in the fronto-temporal network in patients with high WMHs and high HA, but without a different pattern. In high WMHs the EEG coherence in low frequencies was increased (with the exception of α1 band), whereas coherence in the fast frequencies was decreased proportional to increasing damage. In high HA a change of coherence was present in the δ and α2 frequency bands that was not proportional to HA, fast frequencies being unaffected. Our results show a lateralization (right hemisphere for cerebrovascular disease and left hemisphere for hippocampal atrophy) of the pathologic modifications of functional coupling.",

Because of substantial skew in the distribution of peptide levels, analyses used log transformations of the data. The ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40 was associated with the presence of dementia (P=0.003, df=196, F=9.37); this association persisted after adjustment for age, sex level of mental retardation, and apolipoprotein E genotype. Consistent with recent reports regarding the effect of presenilin mutations on peptide generation, our finding supports the theory that the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40 rather than absolute levels of the peptides is important to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease in genetically susceptible populations.",

The Northwestern Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer's Disease Center in collaboration with Coalition of Limited English Speaking Elderly and Alzheimer's Association-Greater Illinois Chapter collaborated to raise awareness in 5 limited English proficiency (LEP) communities (Assyrian, Arabic, Bosnian, Hindi, and Urdu) during 2005 to 2008 through a grant from the Administration on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Demonstration Grants to States. After the second year of the program, 267 individuals with cognitive impairment were identified with cognitive impairment and enrolled; however, only 13% of those sought a medical evaluation to obtain a diagnosis or further help for their memory problems. This project sought to: (1) understand how these LEP community groups conceptualize dementia and (2) understand reasons LEP communities sought or did not seek a diagnosis. Using a community-based participatory research approach, ethnic community leaders conducted 48 interviews in a convenience sample of persons enrolled in the previous Administration on Aging demonstration grant. These interviews were conducted with family members of identified persons with dementia in their native language. Interview notes were translated and subjected to thematic analysis. The majority view memory loss as explainable and normative—due to aging, reaction to medication or trauma experienced by war, family problems, or the immigration experience. This conceptualization and the perception that a doctor cannot help influenced whether they sought an evaluation. Those who saw a doctor were looking for medical treatment and help with difficult behaviors. Experience in the doctor's office was variable. Discussion of analysis with ethnic communities revealed the significance of stigma in the data gathering. Continued community-based participatory research approaches with LEP communities could further highlight needs for culturally relevant education and intervention.",

    "abstract": "Introduction The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC) was modified for use in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) trials and tested in the ADCS MCI randomized clinical trial of donepezil, vitamin E, and placebo. We assessed feasibility for its use by determining whether or not: (1) it distinguished a medication effect at 6 months and 12 months, (2) baseline demographic or clinical characteristics predicted change, (3) there was an association between MCI-CGIC and change in other clinical measures in order to evaluate external or concurrent validity. Methods We used a generalized estimating equations approach for ordinal outcome data to test the effects of treatment, baseline characteristics, and change in clinical measures on the MCI-CGIC over 12 months, and ordinal logistic regression to assess the association between MCI-CGIC and change in clinical measures at 6 months and 12 months. Results On the MCI-CGIC overall, 12.9% and 10.6% were rated as having improved, and 31.6% and 39.8% as having worsened over 6 months and 12 months, respectively. The MCI-CGIC did not distinguish the donepezil or vitamin E groups from placebo at 6 and 12 months treatment. Variables at screening or baseline that were associated with worse CGIC scores over 6 and 12 months included white race, greater years of education, worse depression, dementia severity rating, cognitive, and daily activities scores, and lower memory domain scores on a neuropsychological battery. Rate of worsening on the MCI-CGIC over 12 months was associated with change on the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive and on executive function. Worsening at 6 months and 12 months, separately, were associated with the corresponding change in Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive, Activities of Daily Living, Beck Depression Inventory, Mini-Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes, memory, and executive function. Conclusions Change detected by the MCI-CGIC was associated with baseline clinical severity and with change in clinical ratings over 6 and 12 months, supporting the validity of a CGIC approach in MCI. The effect size of the donepezil-placebo difference was similar to that of other outcomes at 12 months. About 40% of MCI patients were judged worse and about 11% improved, consistent with clinical experience and other ratings.",

    "abstract": "Treatment success in Alzheimer disease (AD) trials is generally based on benefits over placebo-treated controls. Consequently, variation in rates of decline among placebo-treated patients could impact outcomes from AD trials. In the present analyses, individual patient data [baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE): 10 to 26] were pooled from randomized, placebo-controlled studies of donepezil for AD conducted during the 1990s, and grouped by initiation year—group 1: 1990 to 1994; group 2: 1996 to 1999. Changes in MMSE and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) were compared between groups 1 and 2 for placebo, and then between donepezil and placebo. Data were available from 3403 patients in 13 trials. Group 2 (post-1995) included patients with lower baseline MMSE scores, older patients, fewer males, more comorbidity, and more concomitant medications. MMSE decline by week 24 was significantly greater among group 1 (pre-1995) placebo patients versus group 2; a similar trend was observed with the ADAS-cog. Nevertheless, donepezil-mediated treatment effects were consistent over the decade of enrollment. These analyses suggest that patients are showing slower rates of cognitive decline in more recent trials compared with older trials, although having more comorbidities. This finding may have important potential implications for future clinical trial design.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the influence of race and education on informants' reports of cognitive decline in 252 community-residing older persons who were receiving services from senior health agencies. An expert consensus panel made diagnoses of normal cognition, cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND), and dementia based on clinical evaluations and standardized neuropsychological testing (using both population and race-adjusted norms). Informants were interviewed using the Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). Informants of black participants with CIND reported less cognitive decline (lower IQCODE scores) than informants of white CIND participants [3.03 (0.61) vs. 3.23 (0.41); t (117)=2.12, P≤0.036] even though there were no significant differences in the participants' functional and neuropsychological impairments. An analysis of covariance which controlled for informant education indicated that this difference in IQCODE scores was attributable to the fact that black informants had fewer years of education than white informants. There was no statistically significant difference in IQCODE scores for black and white participants with dementia [4.0 (0.7) vs. 4.3 (0.7); t (67)=1.37, P=0.177]. We conclude that racially determined differences in perceptions of early cognitive decline and education may influence informant ratings of older persons. These differences may contribute to disparities in the detection and treatment of cognitive disorders in older black persons.",

    "abstract": "In common forms of Alzheimer disease (AD), anterograde memory impairment is the first deficit to occur. However, the disease, especially in its presenile forms, may also manifest itself through initial deficits that are predominantly of a nonmemory type. These distinct clinical profiles, which reflect the distinct topography of the underlying pathologic processes, may also differ in terms of their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers. The aim of this study was to assess the levels of total tau, phosphorylated tau, and amyloid-beta 42 peptide in the CSF of \"atypical\" (nonmemory) early-onset AD patients. CSF biomarkers were evaluated in 22 atypical patients, and compared with those from a group of 13 \"typical\" patients, with a memory onset form of the disease. Our results show that independently of age, disease duration, education level, and clinical severity indices, patients with an atypical onset have significantly higher levels of total tau in the CSF (P=0.023). These findings indicate that an assessment of CSF biomarkers may be of particular use in the clinical diagnosis of \"atypical-onset\" forms of early-onset AD in which the initial symptoms involve language and visuospatial abilities rather than memory. In addition, they highlight the heterogeneity of pathologic processes in AD, suggesting more intense degeneration in the forms of the disease that primarily involve neocortical structures.",

Most identified risk factors for dementia are similar to vascular disease risk factors for heart disease and stroke. In 2010, the National Institutes of Health Conference concluded that there are no validated modifiable factors to reduce the incidence of AD or to change its course. This research perspective specifically concerning AD disregards the fact that in community-dwelling elderly, the most common forms of dementia involve the cerebral macrovasculature and microvasculature, manifesting as VaD and mixed dementia (the combination of VaD and AD) in autopsy-confirmed cases. Thus, prevention of dementia in clinical practice should be considered from this broader and more relevant view and not just a research perspective on \"pure\" AD. Practicing clinicians can reasonably state to patients that, although more definitive research is clearly needed, the management and treatment of vascular disease risk factors are likely beneficial not only to prevent heart disease and stroke, but also common forms of dementia in the community.",

PCPs' recognition of cognitive impairment being suboptimal, we investigated factors associated with improved recognition. Eligible patients were aged 65 years and above, without documented dementia or previous work-up for dementia, seen consecutively over 2 months by one of 13 PCPs. PCPs indicated whether they, the patient, or the family had concerns about each patient's cognition. We enrolled 130 patients with any cognitive concerns and a matched sample of 133 without cognitive concerns, and administered standardized neuropsychological tests. PCP's judgments of cognitive concern showed 61% sensitivity and 86% specificity against the neuropsychological standard. When combined with a Mini-Mental State Examination score ≤26, PCP recognition improved in sensitivity (82%) with some loss in specificity (74%). True positives increased when PCPs' practices included more cognitively impaired patients and when patients reported poor memory. False positives increased when patients had diabetes, reported poor memory, or no or light alcohol consumption. Medical decision making can be improved by the Mini-Mental State Examination and greater exposure to cognitively impaired patients, but knowledge of certain risk factors for cognitive impairment negatively affected these decisions.",

    "abstract": "Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a genetically heterogenous syndrome and has been associated most recently with a hexanucleotide repeat expansion within the C9ORF72 gene. Pathogenic TDP-43 gene (TARDBP) mutations have been identified in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but the role of TARDBP mutations in FTLD is more contradictory. To investigate the role of TARDBP mutations in a clinical series of Finnish FTLD patients, we sequenced TARDBP exons 1 to 6 in 77 FTLD patients. No evident pathogenic mutations were found. We identified a novel heterozygous c.876_878delCAG sequence variant in 2 related patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia without amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The variant is predicted to cause an amino acid deletion of serine at position 292 (p.Ser292del). However, p.Ser292del was also found in 1 healthy middle-aged control. Interestingly, both patients carried the C9ORF72 expansion. Therefore, the TARDBP variant p.Ser292del might be considered a rare polymorphism and the C9ORF72 repeat expansion the actual disease-causing mutation in the family. Our results suggest that TARDBP mutations are a rare cause of FTLD. However, the interaction of several genetic factors needs to be taken into account when investigating neurodegenerative diseases.",

However, noncognitive factors impact educational attainment, potentially leading to incorrect categorization as MCI. We examined whether using an adjustment based on reading performance [Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) Reading] improved MCI diagnostic accuracy. Methods: A total of 935 Framingham Offspring (mean age, 72±5 y) underwent tests of memory, executive function, abstraction, language, and visuospatial function as part of a neuropsychological test battery. Domain-specific test scores were regressed onto age and WRAT score, or education, to define MCI. Survival analyses were used to relate baseline MCI to incident dementia. Results: The 2 MCI definitions differed most for the lowest and highest education groups. The WRAT definition was more strongly associated with incident dementia for all 5 tests. MCI level abstraction performance was associated with incident dementia using the WRAT definition (HR=3.20, P=0.033), but not the education definition (HR=1.19, P=0.814). Discussion: The WRAT should be considered along with the standard measure of years of education, as it may be a better surrogate marker of premorbid abilities.",

Knowledge about AD, demographic, and occupational characteristics were also obtained. Participants perceived AD as a chronic disease associated with severe consequences. Statistically significant differences were found between the groups, as nurses attributed psychological reasons to AD more than the social workers. Nevertheless, social workers perceived AD as more chronic with severe consequences compared with the nurses.

Therefore, continuing to distribute materials to professionals regarding AD is recommended, with attention to the unique characteristics of each professional group.

Participation in cognitive/social activities was positively associated with education, depression, literacy, mobility, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), verbal learning, and subcomponents of executive function. A linear regression identified IADLs, education, depression, and verbal learning as independent predictors. Participation in physical activities was positively associated with sex, depression, IADLs, and subcomponents of executive function. An ordinal regression identified executive function and depression as independent correlates. These data suggest that unique characteristics are associated with cognitive/social and physical activities in older African Americans with MCI. These characteristics, coupled with low activity levels, may increase the risk of progression from MCI to dementia. Culturally relevant behavioral interventions to reduce cognitive decline in this high-risk population are needed.",

Generalized linear mixed models were fitted with age at visit, gender, and cardiovascular factors as fixed effects and Alzheimer’s Disease Centers as random effects. In late life, only BMI of ProbAD and DLB patients was statistically significantly lower than that in normals ( P –values &lt;0.001). When accounting for colinearity within cardiovascular factors, a low BMI was a comorbidity of certain dementia etiologies as compared with normals. These data support a concept of disease-specific associations with certain cardiovascular factors.",

Non-Hispanic blacks exhibited higher spending relative to Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites 1 year after diagnosis. Non-Hispanic blacks had higher total (mean=$205,000) Medicare expenditures from diagnosis to death compared with non-Hispanic whites (mean=$118,000). Hispanics’ total expenditures and utilization after diagnosis was similar to non-Hispanic whites despite living longer with dementia.

All participants had a lumbar puncture to obtain CSF.CSF Aβ42, but not tau or ptau181, was associated with self-reported navigation ability. Lower self-reported navigation was associated with reduced driving extent, but not driving errors. Self-reported navigation mediated the relationship between CSF Aβ42 and driving extent.Findings suggest that cerebral amyloid deposition is associated with lower perceived ability to navigate the environment, which may lead older adults with AD pathology to limit their driving extent.",

Interventions: Participants completed the eMoCA and paper Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in a randomized order during 1 session. Participants reported their touchscreen experience and comfort and indicated their modality preferences. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures were paper MoCA and eMoCA total and subscale scores. Secondary outcome measures included participants’ reported touchscreen experience and comfort, as well as post-administration preferences. Results: A moderate statistically significant correlation was found between eMoCA and paper MoCA performance across all participants. Analysis comparing first administration modality only (eMoCA vs. paper MoCA) found no statistically significant difference in total scores; however, there was a statistically significant difference for the visuospatial/executive subscale, which required physical interaction with paper or the tablet. For this subscale, participants scored lower on the eMoCA versus paper MoCA. There was a statistically significant correlation between experience with touchscreen devices and performance on the eMoCA, but not between modality preference and performance. Conclusion: Modality of administration can affect performance on cognitive assessments. Clinicians should consider individuals’ level of touchscreen experience before selecting administration modality.",

We sought to investigate the contribution of vascular risk factors in late life to cognitive decline in a cohort of normal elderly individuals.Cognitively normal subjects were identified from the longitudinal cohort of participants in the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC) database (n=2975). The association between a composite score of vascular risk factors (based on the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile) and cognitive function was tested at baseline visit and estimated in longitudinal analyses using linear mixed-effects models.Total vascular risk factor burden was associated with worse cognitive performance at baseline and faster decline longitudinally in univariate analyses but only with worse WAIS digit symbol performance in cross-sectional (estimate=-0.266 units/1 unit of Framingham Stroke Risk Profile Score; 95% confidence interval, -0.380 to -0.153; P<0.001) and longitudinal (estimate=-0.034 units/1 unit of Framingham Stroke Risk Profile Score/year; 95% confidence interval, -0.055 to -0.012; P=0.002) analyses after adjusting for age, education, and APOE genotype. Individuals with history of stroke performed significantly worse on the trails B, category fluency, and Boston naming tests in cross-sectional analyses and in delayed logical memory and digit span backwards in longitudinal analyses.Although the modified Framingham Stroke Risk Profile in late-life predicts rate of decline on selective neurocognitive measures in previously normal elderly individuals, age appears to be the strongest risk factor for cognitive impairment in this population.

The efficacy of the MoCA for screening frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and related disorders is unknown. The objectives were: (1) to determine whether the MoCA detects cognitive impairment (CI) in FTD subjects; (2) to determine whether Alzheimer disease (AD) and FTD subtypes and related disorders can be parsed using the MoCA; and (3) describe longitudinal MoCA performance by subtype. We extracted demographic and testing data from a database of patients referred to a cognitive neurology clinic who met criteria for probable AD or FTD (N=192). Logistic regression was used to determine whether dementia subtypes were associated with overall scores, subscores, or combinations of subscores on the MoCA. Initial MoCA results demonstrated CI in the majority of FTD subjects (87%). FTD subjects (N=94) performed better than AD subjects (N=98) on the MoCA (mean scores: 18.1 vs. 16.3; P=0.02). Subscores parsed many, but not all subtypes. FTD subjects had a larger decline on the MoCA within 13 to 36 months than AD subjects (P=0.02). The results indicate that the MoCA is a useful tool to identify and track progression of CI in FTD. Further, the data informs future research on scoring models for the MoCA to enhance cognitive screening and detection of FTD patients.",

We also explored differences in medial temporal volumes, and relative frontal and medial temporal area contributions to memory consolidation.Participants had clinical diagnoses of AD and bvFTD who were pathologically confirmed at autopsy or supported with Pittsburgh compound B amyloid imaging. We used cognitive and imaging data collected at baseline visits for a sample of 26 participants with AD (mean age=63.7, education=16.2, Clinical Dementia Rating=0.8), 25 participants with bvFTD (mean age=60.7; education=15.7; CRD=1.1), and 25 healthy controls (mean age=65.6; education=17.5; Clinical Dementia Rating=0.2).AD participants showed more rapid forgetting than bvFTD, and both groups showed more rapid forgetting than controls. In contrast, bvFTD did not conform to a more dysexecutive pattern of performance as patient groups committed similar number of intrusion errors and showed comparably low rates of improvement on cued recall and recognition trials. For patients with neuroimaging, there were no group differences in medial temporal volumes, which was the only significant predictor of consolidation for both dementia groups.",

The scan results were processed using GE ADW4.6 processing software and V0xar 3D workstation to acquire the hippocampal volume. The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) was used to evaluate the olfactory function of MCI patients. The correlations of UPSIT score with hippocampal volume and hippocampal head volume were evaluated by Pearson correlation coefficient analysis. Results: MCI patients had significantly smaller left (2.78±0.50 vs. 3.19±0.31 cm 3 ) and right (2.97±0.42 vs. 3.31±0.25 cm 3 ) hippocampal volumes compared with normal controls ( P &lt;0.05). In addition, patients with olfactory dysfunction had smaller volumes of the hippocampus (left hippocampal volume, 2.57±0.39 vs. 3.23±0.40 cm 3 ; right hippocampal volume, 2.86±0.43 vs. 3.22±0.30 cm 3 ) and hippocampal head (left hippocampal head volume, 1.18±0.16 vs. 1.53±0.25 cm 3 ; right hippocampal head volume, 1.25±0.22 vs. 1.54±0.22 cm 3 ) compared with those with normal olfactory function ( P &lt;0.05). No significant difference in the hippocampal body volume and hippocampal tail volume was found between MCI patients with olfactory loss and those with normal olfactory function.

APOE -ɛ4 and BIN1 (Bridging Integrator 1) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease, but, although DNA methylation of dinucleotide CpGs in the BIN1 gene influences alterations, it has not been studied in Hispanics. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the BIN1 3′ intergenic region DNA methylation patterns in a Colombian sample of LOAD patients. Methods: A case-control study was conducted in 50 individuals with LOAD and 50 age-sex matched controls to determine associations of LOAD with DNA methylation. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood, and methylation levels of 8 CpGs were estimated by bisulfite conversion followed by Sanger sequencing with direct PCR analysis. Logistic regression models adjusted by age, sex, and APOE were used to calculate risk associations between methylation levels and LOAD. Results: Overall, participants with LOAD had significantly lower methylation levels on CpG26 (0.86±0.11 vs. 0.95±0.05; P &gt;0.001), CpG44 (0.84±0.09 vs. 0.94±0.06; P =0.001), and CpG87 (0.64±0.12 vs. 0.82±0.10; P &gt;0.001). Adjusted regression models showed that decreased methylation levels of these CpGs remained as risk factors for LOAD ( P &lt;0.05). Conclusions: Hypomethylation of CpGs in BIN1 might play an important role in the expression of BIN1 and may be a biomarker for identifying individuals at high risk of developing LOAD.",

However, the effects of exercise on longitudinal change in AD biomarkers have not been thoroughly investigated. The current study examined whether individuals with higher baseline exercise exhibited less longitudinal change in AD biomarkers and cognitive functioning, and whether APOE and/or brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) genotypes moderated the effects of exercise on longitudinal changes. Methods: Clinically normal individuals completed a questionnaire on physical exercise over the prior 10-year period at baseline. Ninety-five individuals had serial cerebrospinal fluid samples collected to examine Aβ 42 , ptau 181 and total tau; 181 individuals underwent multiple assessments of amyloid positron emission tomography imaging with Pittsburgh Compound-B; 327 individuals underwent multiple cognitive assessments, including measures of episodic memory, executive functions, verbal fluency, and processing speed. Results: Greater exercise was associated with less steep decline in processing speed. Baseline exercise did not robustly impact longitudinal change for any other outcomes. Neither APOE nor BDNF genotype robustly moderated the effect of exercise on trajectories of AD biomarkers or cognitive decline. Interpretation: Results suggest that self-reported physical exercise may be limited as a moderator of changes in AD biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Background: Bone mineral density (BMD) is a potential surrogate marker of lifetime estrogen exposure previously linked to increased risk of Alzheimer dementia among elderly women. We examine the association between BMD in the “young old” with imaging biomarkers of brain aging and cognitive performance. Methods: Offspring participants (N=1905, mean age 66) of a population-based cohort who had BMD, brain imaging and detailed cognitive assessment were included in the study. Sex-stratified, linear, and logistic regression models were used for analysis. Results: Higher femoral neck BMD was associated with lower white matter hyperintensity burden and better performance on Trails B-A in both sexes, even after adjustment for cerebrovascular risk factors. Among women, the positive association with Trails B-A performance was seen only in APOE4 allele carriers. Higher BMD measurements were linked to better visual reproductions test performance in men. Finally, among women, higher femoral trochanter BMD was associated with better logical memory and Hooper visual organization test performance. Conclusion: Among the “young old,” higher BMD is associated with less white matter hyperintensity burden and better, domain-specific, cognitive performance. This suggests that lifetime estrogen exposure may modulate the degree of cumulative vascular brain injury independent of cerebrovascular risk factors.",

Methods: Retrospective cross-sectional study. Participants were New Zealanders who were assessed with International Residential Assessment Instrument (interRAI) assessments (including community-dwelling adults and those in long-term care) from 2016 to 2019 and had a diagnosis of dementia. Outcomes were sociodemographic and clinical characteristics captured in the interRAI assessment. Results: People with YOD were more likely to be male, of non-European ethnicity, and live in a dwelling other than a private home or be homeless. They were more likely to exhibit problematic behaviors and neuropsychiatric symptoms but were less frail and less dependent for activities of daily living. Financial strain and loneliness were more common in people with YOD. Carers of people with YOD were more likely to feel distress, anger, or depression, and families of people with YOD were more likely to feel overwhelmed. Conclusions: YOD patients have different needs than older adults with dementia. These differences must be considered by clinicians and organizations that provide care and support to people living with dementia.",

Disclosure protocols must be informed by diverse participants’ perspectives on if/how the information would be useful. Methods: This study utilized semistructured interviews assessing interest in receiving positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid and tau results, as well as perceived risks and benefits of hypothetical PET disclosure as a function of race and participant diagnosis. Participants: Participants [39% Black; 61% White; M age =74.28 (5.98)] included 57 adults diagnosed as either cognitively healthy (58%) or with mild cognitive impairment (42%) and their respective care partners [33% Black; 67% White; M age =66.93 (10.92)]. Results: Most dyads endorsed strong interest in PET results (82.5% of both participants and partners) regardless of race or diagnosis. Black care partners were less interested in receiving the participant’s results than White care partners ( χ 2 (4) =8.31, P =0.047). Reasons for disclosure were diverse and highly personalized, including access to treatments or clinical trials (23.2% participants; 29.8% partners), advance planning (14.3% participants; 17.5% partners), and improved health knowledge (12.5% participants; 15.8% partners). In contrast, over 80% of respondents denied any risks of disclosure. Discussion: Results suggest that predisclosure education, decisional capacity assessment, and a flexible disclosure approach are needed.",

Nine studies (combined sample size = 175; mean duration of follow-up = 2.9 years) reported at least two mental status scores separated by at least 1 year. Among four studies using the Mini-Mental State Examination, no consistent differences in annualized rate of decline could be observed for MID compared with AD. Also, no factors were identified that predict rate of decline. This review reveals many limitations in our current knowledge about the natural history of VaD. Understanding would be enhanced by multinational harmonization of definitions for study entry point, diagnosis of VaD, classification of subtypes, as well as cognitive, functional, and behavioral endpoints.",

In a subset of 42 cases for which genomic DNA was available, greater severity of CAA was associated more with cases that were homozygous for apolipoprotein epsilon4 than in cases with only one or no epsilon4 alleles (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.005). In all brain regions, severity of CAA was inversely correlated with numbers of neurons. This correlation was statistically significant in the temporal lobe (r = -0.29,p = 0.004) and the frontal lobe (r = -0.22, p = 0.02).

Today, the clinician has to rely on clinical examination, history, and, possibly, brain imaging to identify cerebrovascular damage and other signs of VaD. The clinical diagnosis of subcortical VaD may be difficult because the clinical manifestation of this disorder is often similar to that of Alzheimer disease. There are also mixed forms of the two disorders. Biochemical diagnostic markers, which reflect the pathogenetic processes in the brain, would add to the accuracy of the diagnosis. There are some interesting candidate markers: the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum albumin ratio could be used to identify blood-brain barrier damage to the small intracerebral vessels, CSF sulfatide to identify ongoing demyelination of the white matter, CSF neuron-specific enolase to identify ongoing neuronal degeneration, and CSF tau protein and CSF neurofilament light protein to identify ongoing axonal degeneration. None of these potential markers is specific to subcortical VaD, but together and used in conjunction with the conventional diagnostic workup, they may be of diagnostic value.",

During this time, 989 new patients were evaluated by the clinic staff. Driving data were available from 634 patients. The only factor significantly associated with crashes was driving alone (odds ratio = 2.23, 95% confidence interval = 1.20–4.15). Twenty-five percent of patients who drove alone had caregiver-reported crashes in the previous 5 years, compared with 13% of those who drove only with a passenger. Patients who drove alone were more likely to have spousal caregivers than patients who drove only with a passenger (72% vs. 58%, p = 0.028). Thus, cognitively impaired patients allowed to drive alone were more likely to have been involved in crashes than patients not driving alone. However, the causal nature of this association cannot be established with the present design. Prospective studies are required to determine if the presence of a co-pilot represents a safe strategy to extend driving privileges in cognitively impaired older drivers.",

    "abstract": "Summary During the past 10 years, there has been a rapidly growing number of pharmaceutical industry-sponsored drug trials for treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. As public awareness and concerns about AD have grown, so has interest in developing drug therapies for retarding symptom progression, delaying onset, and ultimately curing the disease. Ethical debate on the use of placebo control trials in AD research has come of age in the United States with the availability of treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The experts and the public agree that more effective therapies are necessary, and new therapeutic options are being developed as rapidly as possible. The arguments on each side of the debate are provocative and important but do not provide unequivocal justification for either the abandonment or the maintenance of placebo-controlled trials in all AD research. Clinical trials differ with respect to scientific and practical goals, and these factors inherently affect the ethical priorities of each study. We present these contrasting points of view to delineate some of the issues rather than to make specific recommendations other than to urge that all clinical trials in AD should be designed with careful consideration of the ethical issues surrounding the use of placebo controls. As new and more effective treatments emerge, the ethical framework for placebo use in AD studies will require frequent re-examination. To make wise choices, patients, caregivers, physicians, and ethicists (among others) must have a voice in this continuing discussion",

To investigate the effect of the APOE epsilon4 allele on cerebral metabolism in AD, we examined regional cerebral glucose metabolism in 83 patients with AD by using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography. Cerebral glucose metabolism in the fronto-parieto-temporal association and limbic cortices was significantly decreased in the AD patients compared with 26 age- and sex-matched normal controls. Regional cerebral glucose metabolic rate was not correlated significantly with the number of APOE epsilon4 alleles in any region, which was consistent even after controlling the effects of age, sex, and severity of dementia, and in a subgroup analysis of those aged between 60 and 75. These results supported the view that the APOE epsilon4 allele is not associated with specific deficits in brain metabolism in AD despite evidence of preclinical alterations.",

    "abstract": "The symptomatology of Alzheimer disease (AD), its longevity, and associated cost make it an extremely challenging disease for individuals, their families, health care, and social support systems. Moreover, the expanding aging population worldwide means that strategies to contain costs are an urgent priority. As the largest component of the direct costs of AD is due to the cost of institutionalization, cost-containment strategies have focused on ways to maintain the AD patient in the community for as long as possible. Disease severity is a strong predictor of institutionalization, and patients' cognitive function (in the form of their Mini-Mental State Examination score) is frequently used as a prognostication of their living environment, and thus the overall cost of their care. Strategies to maintain patients at home are directed at either the patient's symptoms or the caregiver's ability to cope with those symptoms and the responsibilities of caregiving. Examples of strategies directed at the caregiver include education and support programs. Drug treatments, notably acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, present the best option for improving patient function, thereby preserving patient autonomy. A number of preliminary studies, whose results are summarized here, have demonstrated that the use of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors tacrine, metrifonate and donepezil, and the glial cell modulator, propentofylline, results in reductions in the overall costs of care. Most health economic studies have focused only on comparison of the costs associated with paying for administering a treatment and the savings produced by postponed institutionalization. However, there is a growing realization that some measures of the quality of life or well-being of both patient and caregiver should also be incorporated. Thus, the health economics of dementia is an extremely complex area of study that is rapidly growing, due to the likelihood that cost-effectiveness will form the basis for future reimbursement decisions.",

    "abstract": "Summary: White matter changes are detected with high frequency by neuroimaging techniques in aged subjects with cerebrovascular risk factors or diseases and in cognitively impaired patients. Their direct role in causing cognitive deterioration has not been established, although their frequency is higher in demented subjects than in normal controls, and they are associated with specific cognitive deficits, particularly those related to impairment of frontal lobe functions. The aim of this paper is to critically review the existing knowledge about the role of white matter lesions in cognitive impairment of vascular origin. After reviewing the scarce evidence and the numerous clues suggesting a possible role of white matter lesions in causing mental decline, proposals are advanced about elements that could be a basis for revised criteria for vascular dementia for clinical trials. Finally, some items requiring future joint investigations in the fields of age-related white matter lesions are identified.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a C/T polymorphism in the promoter region of the interleukin 1-alpha (IL-1alpha) gene (position -889) was reported to be associated with Alzheimer disease. In this study, the polymorphism of IL-1alpha was examined in patients with Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, and nondemented controls in a Chinese population in Taiwan. No difference was found in the IL-1alpha T allele frequency among the three groups. The predominant polymorphic allele ( approximately 90%) of IL-1alpha was the C allele. The APOE4 allele was overrepresented in the AD cohort. The presence of the APOE4 allele did not influence the IL-1alpha genotype or allele distribution. The prevalence of the IL-1alpha T allele, in particular the homozygous form, was lower than in whites and may account for the lack of association between IL-1alpha C/T polymorphism and Alzheimer disease among Chinese in Taiwan. The presence of the heterozygous IL-1alpha T allele cannot be used for distinguishing Alzheimer disease or vascular dementia from controls.",

We performed in vivo 31P MRS in 16 patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable AD with mild to moderate dementia severity (mean Blessed Dementia Score=17.5, range=7-37) and in 8 healthy, nondemented, age-matched, control subjects. MR studies were performed on a commercial 1.5 T MR imager using a volume head coil. We acquired brain spectra by sampling a 6-cm-thick axial slice through the cerebrum (a region that includes ~900 ml of brain tissue); we measured B-nucleoside triphosphate (B-NTP), phosphocreatine (PCr), phosphomonoesters (PME), phosphodiesters (PDE), and inorganic phosphate (P,) concentrations, then calculated ratios of these resonances. The B-NTP, PCr, and P, resonances in AD and control subjects were not significantly different. These data indicate that brain energy stores are not depleted in AD. No significant differences were detected in the absolute measurements of PME and PDE between the AD and control groups. However, among the calculated ratios, an increase in the PME/PDE ratio of ~50%, mostly due to a decrease in the PDE signal, was statistically significant (AD PME/PDE mean=0.35, range 0.13-0.71; normal PME/PDE mean=0.22, range 0.16-0.34). We speculate that the difference in PDE reflects changes in the biophysical state of membrane phospholipids in AD.",

    "abstract": "Forty-one participants representing diverse professional back-grounds attended a workshop on genetic predictive testing for familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) on January 23, 1993 at Surrey Place Centre in Toronto, Canada. Rapidly emerging molecular genetic findings in AD indicate that predictive testing is now technologically feasible for selected individuals, although defining eligibility criteria remains problematic. Legal, ethical, biomedical, and psychosocial issues related to establishing predictive testing programs for AD were discussed at the workshop. This article reflects these discussions, provides the current biomedical background for them and examines the Huntington's disease (HD) predictive testing experience. Observations concerning molecular genetic predictive testing for AD in light of its genetic heterogeneity and clinical characteristics, such as usual later age of onset than HD, are presented. It is proposed that predictive testing for AD can now be cautiously offered in a research setting primarily according to the recommendations contained within the Ethical Issues Policy Statement on Huntington's Disease Molecular Genetics Predictive Test. However, in their application to AD, some points in the statement are considered to require emphasis, modification, or currently to be of uncertain applicability. This represents an initial step in an on-going process of debate concerning AD that will be required as new advances occur in genetic and clinical research and in bioethics.",

Sixteen (17.8% of the total group of 90) subjects maintained their personal activities of daily living independence over the full 5-year period or up to 3 months before death (15.1% if the four subjects reclassified as not demented at the second wave are excluded).

An absence of sensory problems was a statistically significant favorable prognostic factor in bivariate analysis. Prior studies on the time required for patients with dementia to progress to functional milestones used clinic-based samples. Our findings, which have potential public health implications, need to be confirmed and expanded upon.",

Sixteen patients with a clinical diagnosis of \"probable\" Alzheimer disease were screened with standardized neuropsychological instruments to estimate the severity of dementia. Tissues were obtained at autopsy from the subiculum, four neocortical areas, and the nucleus basalis of Meynert; NFT counts were assessed with the thioflavin S stain. Overall, the subiculum showed the most NFTs, followed by visual association and premotor cortices, primary cortex (motor and visual), and the nucleus basalis. NFT counts were significantly positively correlated with the duration of disease in the nucleus basalis and less strongly in the motor cortex. Neuropsychological impairment was significantly correlated with NFT counts only in the nucleus basalis. In turn, counts in the nucleus basalis were reliably correlated with those in all other brain regions except the subiculum. Counts in the subiculum showed no correlation with any other area. Numbers of NFTs within functionally related sites, the primary motor and premotor cortices or primary and visual association cortices, were significantly or near-significantly correlated, whereas motor and visual cortical counts showed no intercorrelation. Our results indicate that although there is less NFT accumulation in the nucleus basalis than in many other brain regions, counts in this structure bear a close relationship to disease severity and duration and to NFT accumulation in other regions.",

The precise mechanism of this direct neurotoxicity is not known, nor have the frequency, clinical course, or methods of early diagnosis been clearly established; however, a critique of 56 clinical reviews or case reports regarding approximately 800 subjects suggest that at some point following infection an HIV-induced dementia is extremely common, as are marked histopathological changes throughout the CNS.

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases and, in particular, Alzheimer disease, are characterized by progressive neuronal loss correlated in time with the symptoms of the disease considered. Whereas the symptoms of those incapacitating diseases are beginning to be managed with a relative efficacy, the ultimate objective of therapy nonetheless remains preventing cell (neuronal and/or astrocytic) death in a neurocytoprotective approach. In biologic terms, in the light of progress at basic research level, three strategies may be envisaged: (1) antagonizing the cytotoxic causal events (excess intracellular calcium, accumulation of abnormal proteins, excitotoxic effects of amino acids, oxidative stress, processes related to inflammation, etc.); (2) stimulating the endogenous protective processes (anti-free radical or DNA repair systems, production of neurotrophic factors, potential cytoprotective action of steroids, etc.); (3) promoting damaged structure repair strategies (grafts) or deep brain or cortical neurostimulation with a view to triggering (beyond the symptomatic actions) potential 'protective' cell mechanisms. The clinical transition of the various strategies whose efficacy is being tested in animal and/or cell models, experimental analogs of the diseases, and thus the objective demonstration in humans of pharmacological and/or surgical neurocytoprotection, is currently the subject of considerable methodological debate (What are the right psychometric assessment criteria? What are the most pertinent laboratory or neuroradiological markers, etc.?). A number of clinical trials have been completed or are ongoing with drugs that are reputed to be neuroprotective. Thus, elements of the response are beginning to be generated with a view to determining whether it will soon be possible to effectively slow or even stop the neurodegenerative process whose etiology, in most cases, remains obscure.",

    "abstract": "Most cost-effectiveness studies using simulation modeling have demonstrated that donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine are cost effective for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease (AD). These conclusions are in large part based on the assumption that improvement in cognitive status, or prevention of cognitive and functional decline, reduces the amount of time patients spend institutionalized or receiving other full-time care. However, as discussed in this article, outcomes besides delay to institutionalization affect the costs of AD. In reviews of utilization data from Medicare and managed care organizations, it was noted that hospitalization and post acute care in skilled nursing facilities accounted for the largest amount of excess direct costs, even among patients with mild or moderate AD. These utilization reviews also suggest that many patients with AD and related dementias require inpatient care because they are not able to self-manage comorbid conditions. The improvements in cognitive status and daily functioning associated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) therapy are expected to translate into improved management of comorbidities and reduced caregiver burden, thus reducing the total cost of care. To confirm these and other economic benefits of AChEIs, pharmacoeconomic outcomes should be evaluated routinely as part of randomized, controlled trials and through well-controlled observational studies of AD patients in community and institutional settings.",

Objectives Determine whether: (1) Physical Performance Test (PPT) scores are associated with the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), (2) PPT scores are correlated with clinical measures of health, and (3) impaired physical performance affects the clinical assessment of DAT. Design A retrospective and cross-sectional study. Setting An Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Participants Ninety-nine research volunteers aged 85 years and older were assessed from September 1997 through July 1999; 45 had DAT (CDR = 0.5–2), and 54 were nondemented controls. Measurements Clinical health history, daily functioning, physical and neurologic status, CDR, sum of boxes, and total PPT score were obtained during clinical evaluation. Independently assessed psychometric measures of verbal and nonverbal episodic and semantic memory, visuospatial abilities, and psychometric speed yielded to a factor score representing general cognitive function. Our outcome measure was the CDR (ie, the clinical dementia rating, where higher scores indicate greater dementia severity). Results The majority (88%) of subjects in this sample of demented and nondemented older adults had some degree of physical impairment as measured by the PPT. Correlational analyses identified clinically important relationships (|τb| > 0.30, p < 0.05) between impaired PPT performance, higher CDR rating, and poor general health, including difficulty ambulating. The correlation between PPT performance and dementia severity (τb = −0.36) decreased after controlling for cognitive ability (τb = −0.19). The correlation between the cognitive factor score and dementia severity when PPT performance was controlled (τb = −0.60) was similar to the unadjusted correlation of the factor score with dementia severity (τb = −0.64). Conclusions The presence of some degree of physical impairment was common in our sample, and PPT scores correlated with both physical and cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, Alzheimer Disease Research Center clinicians appear able to successfully distinguish between physical and cognitive causes of functional impairment and assign a CDR rating that accurately reflects DAT severity in individuals with impaired physical performance.",

On immunoblots of NF proteins, the antibodies recognized epitopes that were variably sensitive to Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase. Eight of the antibodies showed reactivity with ANT and decreased binding to electroblotted NF after phosphatase treatment. The same eight antibodies reacted with tau proteins from bovine and rat brain, binding to tau proteins was also substantially reduced by phosphatase. Of the eight antibodies that bound to animal tau proteins, five also bound to tau proteins from normal human brain. All of the antibodies that bound to animal tau proteins stained ANT in frozen tissue sections. Brief treatment of tissue sections with trypsin in most cases enhanced antibody binding to ANT. All antibodies that lacked reactivity with tau proteins failed to bind ANT. Phosphatase treatment of Alzheimer tissue sections did not change the immunoreactivity of ANT and neurites in senile plaques with ANT-reactive, anti-NF antibodies, except for two antibodies that showed decreased binding to ANT. In contrast, axonal staining was decreased or eliminated by phosphatase treatment, similar to the response of electroblotted NF and tau proteins. These results suggest that staining of ANT by anti-NF antibodies may be due to cross-reaction of anti-NF with epitopes in tau proteins, the epitopes in axons, NF, and tau are sensitive to the effect of phosphatase, whereas the majority of those in ANT are not, and some of the epitopes in ANT that are shared with NF and tau proteins are not readily accessible to antibody binding.",

We sought to understand what clinically detectable changes would be evident to the patient with dementia, their caregivers, and the treating physician during a trial of memantine therapy. A literature search was performed on MedLine, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane database. The statistically significant findings from the memantine literature were reviewed using treatment effect size as a measure of clinical meaningfulness. There have been 3 phase 2 studies of memantine in dementia, and 6 phase 3 studies published as of August 1, 2005. Of the 6 published phase 3 trials of memantine in dementia; 2 were in mild-moderate vascular dementia, 1 in mild-moderate AD, 2 in moderate-severe AD, and 1 in severe dementia (both AD and vascular dementia). The most convincing evidence of a clinically meaningful treatment effect of memantine therapy is in the moderate-severe AD patient population. Cognition, as measured by the Severe Impairment Battery, had an effect size of 0.32 and 0.49 in the 2 published trials, indicating a small-to-medium effect of the medication. Global, functional, and behavioral scales also showed a small-to-medium response to memantine.",

Cross-reactivity of the ubiquitin antisera for tau protein, neurofilament proteins, and high molecular weight microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) were ruled out by (i) the inability of the ubiquitin antisera to stain these proteins in immunoblotting experiments and (ii) the inability of tau, neurofilament, and MAP preparations, when preincubated with the ubiquitin antisera, to inhibit the selective neurofibrillar staining observed.

    "abstract": "Progressive decline in cognition is a hallmark feature of dementia, and the rate and profile of cognitive decline has been well characterized in Alzheimer disease (AD). Less is known about decline in cognition over time in other forms of dementia such as the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and primary progressive aphasia (PPA). The present study examined rate of cognitive decline across domains of memory, language, and executive function measured by neuropsychologic tests, in AD (n=84), FTD (n=66), and PPA (n=44). Patients were in the mild stages of dementia, with comparable duration of illness at the baseline evaluation. A best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) analysis was used in which the slope of the relationship between a cognitive measure and time was estimated for each person. AD subjects demonstrated a floor effect on measures of memory at baseline and a decline on measures of language and executive functioning over time. FTD showed the greatest decline over time on the Mini-Mental State Examination, executive functioning, and naming. PPA patients demonstrated prominent decline on language measures, verbal memory measures, and attention. Results suggest that the profile of rate of change over time has unique features on the basis of the type of dementia syndrome. However, there is overlap in the profiles of decline likely influenced by the overlap in cognitive constructs measured by neuropsychologic tests. The comparison of the rate of decline in FTD and PPA may also reflect the neuroanatomic overlap in these syndromes over time.",

    "abstract": "Objectives This study estimated the prevalence of diagnosed dementia among Indiana Medicaid beneficiaries in 2004. The dependence of prevalence estimates upon use of several patient selection criteria to identify patients with dementia also was evaluated. Methods Indiana Medicaid claims data were analyzed for the period July 1, 2002 to December 31, 2004. An expert panel survey was conducted to assess perceived specificity of ICD codes used in previous studies to define dementia. Prevalence estimates were calculated with varying levels of each selection criteria, that is, ICD code set, interval of data examined, and number of occurrences of dementia-related claims. To assess specificity and sensitivity of the dementia patient selection criteria, Minimum Data Set data for a subset of beneficiaries that resided in a nursing home any time in 2004 were examined. Results Depending on the patient selection criteria used, estimates of prevalence of diagnosed dementia for individuals 40 years old or older varied from 7.7% to 15.3%, whereas prevalence estimates for individuals 60 years old or older varied from 14.5% to 26.6%. When the following selection criteria were used: (1) occurrence of one or more dementia-related claims, (2) the expert panel ICD set, and (3) up to 30 months of data for defining dementia, the prevalence estimates in the Indiana Medicaid population were 10.9% for individuals 40 years old or older and 20.3% for individuals 60 years old or older. Conclusions Careful selection of claims-based criteria for identifying patients with dementia is important because the criteria may affect estimates by 100%. Prevalence of diagnosed dementia among Indiana Medicaid beneficiaries was 3 to 4 times higher than the reported prevalence from a decade ago in Medicaid populations of other states, even when the same patient selection criteria were used. A number of factors beyond increased occurrence of the disease including increased screening, greater likelihood of recording dementia codes in claims, or other factors may be responsible. The combination of patient selection criteria used in this study had good sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy when compared with Minimum Data Set data.",

Those presenting as bv-FTD were divided according to their tau isoform, 3R versus 4R, and compared with age-matched and sex-matched control patients with 4R tauopathies but presenting clinical syndromes other than bv-FTD. Twenty-four cases with tau-positive bv-FTD and 18 4R tau-positive controls were included in the study. Patients with 4R tauopathies had significantly shorter disease duration than patients with 3R tauopathy (median, 6.5 y vs. 9.5 y; P<0.05), despite similar age of disease onset and regardless of whether bv-FTD was the presenting clinical syndrome. Among bv-FTD cases, those with 4R tauopathies were more likely to display behavioral underactivity than those with 3R tauopathy (P=0.03), although 3R and 4R tauopathy patients shared many similar clinical features. In summary, survival in 4R tauopathies seemed independent of the presenting clinical phenotype, and there may be subtle clinical differences between bv-FTD patients with 3R and 4R tauopathies.",

In this paper, we compare pain assessments using 3 different measurement types: self-report, informant rating, and observational assessments. Participants were 153 nursing home residents from 4 nursing homes. Four different self-report assessments were compared with 3 observational scales and 2 informant-based assessments, which included 3 summary rating scales. Only 60% of participants were able to complete atleast 1 of the self-report assessments. The strongest correlations between assessments were found among instruments of the same type, that is, among the different self-report measures, among the different observational measures, between the 2 informant rating questionnaires, and among the 3 informant rating summary questions. Our results show that the different formats of pain assessments resulted in somewhat overlapping results, yet the differences were much larger than those obtained from different assessments within the same format type. The results reraise the questions of what pain is in this population, and whether the new assessments aimed to uncover such pain have targeted the correct construct. Results suggest that a multimethod type assessment may be needed to effectively manage pain.",

In a sample of 473 randomly recruited community-dwelling Chinese older persons aged 60 or above, we evaluated the cognitive characteristics of subjects with Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0.5. The cognitive profiles of CDR 0.5 subjects were compared with standard clinical criteria for mild cognitive impairment. The Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale and list learning delay recall test scores were between −1 and −2 SD below the cutoff for clinically not-demented subjects (CDR 0). Concordance between CDR 0.5 and mild cognitive impairment classifications were related to educational level of the subjects. A higher agreement was found in subjects having >6 years of education than subjects having ≤2 years of education (85.2% vs. 53.8%) (χ2=35.41, df=2, P<0.0001). The results suggested that CDR is able to identify mild but significant cognitive impairment in the Chinese community. The use of CDR suggested that attention should be paid to local cultural characteristics.

Sixty-eight percent of the responders always announce the diagnosis to their patients, 24% prefer to reveal the diagnosis only to patients with mild dementia. Doctors who announce the diagnosis to all their patients and who believe that its a benefit for the patient (67%) were more likely to be younger, to be neurologists, and to speak Dutch. The most important arguments in favor of announcing the diagnosis were the patient's right to know and the reinforcement of the doctor-patient relationship. The main arguments against revealing the diagnosis were the patient's right not to know and fear of provoking a depression. Two-third of the participants informed the patients about the prognosis and natural evolution of AD. These doctors tended to be younger, to be neurologists, and to speak Dutch. Young doctors tend to be more \"open\" toward their patients concerning the diagnosis of AD, consistent with the current guidelines. The differences between Dutch and French speaking doctors might be partially due to the fact that in French, \"démence\" has a psychiatric connotation.",

Participants One hundred forty-seven persons from the African American Health (AAH) project were screened for dementia; 61 of 93 who were invited had follow-up clinical assessments for dementia diagnosis. Measurements The AD8, Mini-Mental State Examination, Short Blessed Test, Brief Instrument for Dementia Detection, and a neuropsychologic battery were administered at visit 1. The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) was administered at visit 2 by clinicians blinded to visit 1 results; the presence of dementia was determined by a CDR greater than 0. Results Four hundred sixty-five individuals from the AAH cohort were sent a letter describing the study and, among this group, 252 individuals were contacted by phone to request participation in this study. Six percent (14/252) of the participants contacted by phone were unable to identify an informant (required for the AD8). One hundred fifty individuals agreed by phone to participate of which 2% (n=3) did not have an informant available at the time of participation. The AD8 alone was effective at discriminating between CDR 0 and CDR 0.5 (area under the curve=0.847; P<0.001; 95% confidence interval, 0.73-0.96). Conclusions A brief informant-based instrument, the AD8, has high sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing CDR 0 from CDR 0.5 in the community. Informant availability may not be a barrier for using the AD8 in an African American community sample; however, further study in larger samples with a higher response rate, different community settings (eg, community clinics), and among older age groups (eg, age 75+) is warranted to confirm this.",

    "abstract": "Introduction The presence of frontal and/or temporal atrophy on neuroimaging has been designated as supportive in the clinical consensus criteria for behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). As magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a relatively low sensitivity for bvFTD, a substantial proportion of patients may present with a normal MRI. Thus, there may be clinical differences between patients with and without lobar abnormalities on MRI. We compared clinical characteristics of bvFTD patients with frontotemporal lobar atrophy on MRI to those lacking the typical pattern at presentation. Methods MRIs of 49 patients from our memory clinic, diagnosed with bvFTD were rated for the presence or absence of frontal and/or temporal atrophy. Demographic, behavioral, and cognitive features were compared between subjects with and without typical bvFTD atrophy pattern. Results Twenty-three patients showed lobar atrophy on MRI, whereas 26 patients lacked the characteristic frontotemporal lobar atrophy, including 13 patients with a normal MRI and 13 with other abnormalities. Disinhibition occurred more often in the group with frontal and/or temporal atrophy on MRI compared with the group with other abnormalities, whereas imitation did not occur in patients lacking the typical bvFTD atrophy pattern. No differences were found in neuropsychologic profiles. There was a trend for a lower mean Clinical Dementia Rating and less severe language impairment in patients with a normal MRI compared with the group with frontal and/or temporal atrophy. Conclusions The clinical phenotype of FTD cannot be predicted by the presence or absence of lobar atrophy on MRI, although imitation and disinhibition are more prevalent in bvFTD patients with characteristic MRI abnormalities. Furthermore, patients with a normal MRI seem to be less severely demented in comparison to patients with frontal and/or temporal atrophy.",

In this study, we examined whether community volunteers with CIND and reduced awareness had worse cognitive performance and cognitive decline over 18 months than CIND participants with intact awareness or healthy controls. We recruited 92 participants with CIND and 91 healthy controls with their respective informants. We used discrepancy scores (informant minus participant) on the Anosognosia Questionnaire for Dementia and Dysexecutive Questionnaire to ascertain participants' awareness of their cognitive performance. The main cognitive outcome variable was the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale: Cognitive Section. Bivariate correlations showed no relationship between the awareness measures and cognitive performance or decline. Overall, CIND participants' ratings of cognitive deficits correlated significantly with their Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale: Cognitive Section score after 18-months (for Anosognosia Questionnaire for Dementia, r=0.45, P <0.001) and showed a stronger relationship with cognitive performance than informant ratings. These results indicate that reduced awareness of deficit may be uncommon in community volunteer samples with CIND. In addition, self-report of cognitive complaints may be at least as useful as informant report when screening community-dwelling older adults at risk of cognitive decline and dementia.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this descriptive study was to estimate and compare the association between cognitive decline and quality of life (QOL) for 2 groups of dementia patients differing by place of residence: home or institution. Each subject was placed within a specific subgroup according to their Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score and was evaluated by a QOL proxy-assessment [Alzheimer Disease Related Quality of Life (ADRQL)] and a dependency assessment (Katz Activities of Daily Living classification). For the \"at home\" and \"institution\" groups, global and subscale ADRQL scores showed significant differences between the 5 MMSE subgroups. Place of residence and MMSE subgroups significantly affected global and subscale ADRQL scores. The MMSE 4 to 8, 9 to 13, and 14 to 18 subgroups had ADRQL global scores significantly better in the institution group than the at home group. In contrast, the MMSE 19 to 23 and 0 to 3 subgroups had similar ADRQL global scores in both places of residence. In conclusion, there is no direct relationship between cognitive decline and QOL, and QOL does not seem to be better at home compared with the institution.",

    "abstract": "The precise operational definition of psychosis in dementia lacks consensus, partially owing to incongruence in the various assessment tools used. This study compares assessments of psychotic symptoms in persons with dementia, specifically of hallucinations and delusions, through the 4 most frequently used assessments. Participants were 74 nursing home residents from 9 nursing homes in Israel, diagnosed with dementia. Assessment tools used included the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Homes (NPI-NH), the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Behavior Rating Scale for Dementia (CERAD-BRSD), and the Columbia University Scale for Psychopathology in Alzheimer's Disease (CUSPAD). The highest prevalence rates of delusions were found through the CUSPAD, and the lowest through the CERAD-BRSD. Rates identified by the BEHAVE-AD were intermediate and similar to those of the NPI-NH. As for hallucinations, rates indicated by the BEHAVE-AD, the NPI-NH, and the CUSPAD were similar, with small sample-based differences, and higher than those found through the CERAD-BRSD. The CERAD-BRSD, soliciting reports of the fewest specific symptoms, detected the fewest psychotic symptoms. The CUSPAD, soliciting the most items, presented the highest prevalence rates. The BEHAVE-AD and the NPI-NH had similar rates and showed a high convergent validity.",

We use data from a trial of treatments to delay the progression of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer disease (AD) [NEJM 2005;352 (23):79 to 88] to determine predictors of study participant dropout and inform the design and implementation of future trials. Time to study discontinuation was modeled by proportional hazards regression with censoring at incident dementia or trial completion. Of 769 participants, 230 (30%) discontinued prematurely. Risk of dropout was higher among nonwhites [hazard ratio (HR) 2.1, P=0.0007], participants with less than college education (HR=1.6, P=0.02), participants with a Hamilton Depression score of 6 or more (HR=1.3, P=0.04), unmarried males (HR=2.1 relative to married males, P=0.003) and participants recruited by commercial clinical sites (HR=2.2 relative to participants recruited by NIA-funded AD research centers, P<0.0001). A trial using commercial sites with the discontinuation rates and incident dementia event rates experienced in this trial would require 80% more participants than a comparably powered trial using NIA-funded AD research center sites. Targeted retention efforts and utilization of academic sites could substantively improve the statistical power and validity of future clinical trials of cognitively impaired elderly.",

Simulations varied the number of test cases, and their distribution across CDR stage; to derive the sample size yielding a 95% confidence that estimated is at least 0.60. We found that testing raters on 5 or more patients per CDR level (total N=25) will yield the desired confidence in estimated κ, and if the test involves greater representation of CDR stages that are harder to evaluate, at least 42 ratings are needed. Testing newly trained raters with at least 5 patients per CDR stage will provide valid estimation of rater consistency, given the point estimate for κ is roughly 0.80; fewer test cases increases the standard error and unequal distribution of test cases across CDR stages will lower κ and increase error.",

    "abstract": "In search for biomarkers of neurodegeneration, increasing attention has been focussed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In particular, PBMC from patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) have been suggested to carry apoptotic changes and alterations of neurotransmitter receptor expression, which may resemble those occurring in central nervous system neurons. We investigated the expression of apoptosis-related proteins Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 and the levels of dopaminergic receptors (DR) D3 and D5 mRNA in PBMC from 17 AD patients and 11 age-matched healthy subjects. Apoptosis-related proteins were assayed by standard Western blotting analysis and DR mRNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction techniques. PBMC from healthy subjects and from AD patients expressed Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 to about the same extent, and the Bcl-2/Bax ratio did not differ in the 2 groups. Levels of mRNA for DRD3 and DRD5 were similar in cells from healthy subjects and from AD patients. In conclusion, we found no evidence that PBMC from AD patients may express apoptosis-related proteins or DR mRNA to any different extent in comparison to cells from healthy subjects. These findings do not necessarily imply that immune cells cannot be exploited as biomarkers in AD (and in other central nervous system disorders). Future studies, however, should take into account the inherent complexity of the immune network.",

    "abstract": "To assess health care utilization and associated costs among patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), with and without dysphagia.MarketScan Commercial and Medicare databases were analyzed. Patients with a diagnosis of AD with and without dysphagia between October 2006 and September 2010 were included. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor usage, the number of outpatient and emergency room (ER) visits and hospitalizations, and associated health care costs were assessed. All variables were measured 1 year after the initial diagnosis of AD at the patient level. Patients with dysphagia were matched to patients without dysphagia using propensity score-matching (PSM) methods. Regression models were conducted to compare utilization and costs between the 2 groups.A total of 485 patients with dysphagia and 8492 patients without dysphagia were included. Before matching, patients with dysphagia were older (81.1 vs. 79.8 y), and had higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores (2.4 vs. 1.7). After matching, all baseline covariates were not statistically different between the 2 groups. Multivariate regression results showed that patients with dysphagia had a higher likelihood of all-cause hospitalizations [odds ratio (OR)=2.26, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.70-2.99, P=0.001] and all-cause ER visits (OR=1.45, 95% CI=1.12-1.87, P=0.007) compared with patients without dysphagia; they also had a higher likelihood for AD-related hospitalizations and ER visits. The difference in all-cause total health care, ER, and hospitalization costs between patients with and without dysphagia were $3620 (95% CI=$2863-$4375), $258 (95% CI=$241-$274), and $3547 (95% CI=$3325-$3770), respectively.This study suggests that patients with AD and dysphagia have higher health care utilization and costs compared with patients without dysphagia.",

Principal components analysis and intergroup comparisons were used. Results A 5-factor solution accounted for 78.4% of the total variance with good separation of neuropsychological variables. As expected, both groups were anomic with preserved visuospatial function and mental speed. Patients with SD had lower scores on comprehension-based semantic tests and better performance on verbal working memory and phonological processing tasks. The opposite pattern was found in the PNFA group. Conclusions Neuropsychological tests that examine verbal and nonverbal semantic associations, verbal working memory, and phonological processing are the most helpful for distinguishing between PNFA and SD.",

    "abstract": "Whether the neuropathological profile of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) reflects an intermediate state between normal aging and dementia is not clear. Identifying which phenomena initiate disease and which occur secondary to the neuropathological process is important for targeted disease prevention. Current definitions of MCI include amnestic (aMCI), nonamnestic (nMCI), and multidomain (mMCI) subtypes. In an unbiased population-based cohort of brain donors, we have determined how many individuals fulfill these criteria in the period leading up to death [n=10 (5 multidomain MCI, 4 amnestic MCI, 1 nonamnestic MCI)]. All MCI cases were collapsed into 1 group and we tested whether their pathologic profile, including markers of Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular disease (VD), is intermediate to individuals (matched for age, sex, and education) without cognitive impairment (n=20) or dementia (n=20). The main findings are of a significant linear trend in the odds of neuritic plaques (entorhinal/hippocampus), atrophy (hippocampal and cortical), infarcts, and small vessel disease (SVD) with increased cognitive impairment. Neuropathologically, MCI is complex, with 10% of MCI brains classified as normal, 10% as VD, 10% as AD, and 40% as mixed AD/VD, with the remaining showing other pathologies. Rather than pure pathologic changes, several different factors seem to contribute to the impairment of MCI. In MCI, both AD and non-AD pathology should be considered as possible intervention targets.",

An illustrated story paradigm memory task was used to evaluate the effects of emotional arousal on memory and assess the caregivers' cognitive compensation capacity. Younger (n=19) and elderly (n=24) noncaregivers and elderly caregivers (n=14) took part in 2 experiments to elucidate the effects of aging (experiment 1) and chronic stress (experiment 2) on memory performance and cortisol levels. Each group was divided in 2 subgroups: one that was exposed to an emotionally neutral story, and one that was exposed to a similar, but emotionally arousing story. Participants completed a multiple-choice questionnaire in the test session. Salivary cortisol samples were collected at 8:00 AM, 4:00 PM, and 10:00 PM, 1 day after memory testing. Experiment 1 showed that, despite an age-related memory deficit, arousal manipulation produced a similar effect in both age groups. Experiment 2 showed that, in addition to the characteristic memory decline of aging, elderly caregivers did not benefit from emotionally arousing material as their noncaregiver counterparts did. This impairment correlated with elevated nighttime cortisol levels, indicating a potential worsening impact of caregiver burden on age-related cognitive decline.",

A few PSEN mutations have also been previously detected in patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). In order to evaluate the role of these genes in a clinical series of Finnish eoAD and FTLD patients, we sequenced exons 16 and 17 of the APP gene and the coding regions of the PSEN1 and PSEN2 genes in 140 eoAD and 66 FTLD patients. No pathogenic mutations were identified in the cohort. The E318G variant was detected with similar frequencies in the cases with eoAD and FTLD and the healthy controls, therefore, showing no association between E318G and eoAD. Furthermore, the PSEN2 R71W variant seems to be nonpathogenic, because it was present in our healthy controls. Mutations in the PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP genes seem to be rare in this population, as these genes exhibited no pathogenic mutations in our cohort of eoAD and FTLD patients even though about 40% of the cases were familial ones. This suggests the involvement of other, still unknown genetic factors in the pathogenesis of these diseases.",

This prospective, multicenter, observational, cohort study assessed baseline data and 6-month disease changes in moderate AD patients (n=1249) from Spain. Baseline Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) scores defined 2 cohorts (depressive ≥8 or nondepressive <8). Fewer patients had baseline Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental disorders-IV depression diagnosis (38.9%) than CSDD ≥8 (55.6%). Analysis of diagnostic accuracy of the CSDD versus the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental disorders-IV criteria showed an optimal cutoff score of ≥12. However, the predefined CSDD cutoff score showed subsyndromal depressive symptomatology associated with lower functionality, worse neuropsychiatric symptomatology, increased caregiver distress, and greater 6-month functional and clinical impairments. Cognition (baseline and 6-month progression) was not significantly associated with depressive symptomatology. Depressive patients received more antidepressive and/or antipsychotic treatments, showing CSDD and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (severity and caregiver distress) 6-month improvements but maintaining doubled scores than nondepressive patients. In conclusion, CSDD ≥8 identified depressive symptomatology in moderate AD patients, significantly associated with excessive neuropsychiatric symptoms and functional, but not cognitive, 6-month deterioration. The health effects over patients and caregivers, alongside the finding that most patients remained depressive after 6 months, demand accurate diagnostic tools and effective treatments for depression in AD.",

Whether these approaches can be applied to patients assessed within lower-acuity outpatient settings is unknown. Methods: A total of 96 patients with suspected RPD were assessed within the Washington University School of Medicine (Saint Louis, MO) outpatient memory clinic from February 2006 to February 2016. Consensus etiologic diagnoses were established following independent review of clinical data by 2 dementia specialists. Results: In total, 67/90 (70%) patients manifested with faster-than-expected cognitive decline leading to dementia within 2 years of symptom onset. Female sex (42/67, 63%), median patient age (68.3 y; range, 45.4 to 89.6), and years of education (12 y; range, 6 to 14) were consistent with clinic demographics. Atypical presentations of common neurodegenerative dementing illnesses accounted for 90% (60/67) of RPD cases. Older age predicted a higher odds of amnestic Alzheimer disease dementia (OR, 2.1 per decade; 95% CI, 1.1-3.8; P =0.02). Parkinsonism (OR, 6.9; 95% CI, 1.6-30.5; P =0.01) or cortical visual dysfunction (OR, 10.8; 95% CI, 1.7-69.4; P =0.01) predicted higher odds of another neurodegenerative cause of RPD, including sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Conclusions and Relevance: The clinical environment influences the prevalence of RPD causes. The clinical evaluation should be adapted to promote detection of common causes of RPD, specific to the practice setting.",

The mean time between switching from donepezil to the rivastigmine patch was 579 (SD=317.3) days. The mean PDC for the rivastigmine patch was highest among patients who switched within 3 months (80.4% vs. 90.7%; P=0.04) and within 7 to 9 months (61.3% vs. 71.0%; P=0.05) of initiating donepezil. When adherence was analyzed in increments of 1 year, patients who switched to the rivastigmine patch within the first year of treatment had significantly greater adherence to rivastigmine compared with those who were on donepezil (PDC 69.3% vs. 60.6%; P=0.0004).Switching from donepezil to the rivastigmine patch seems to be associated with increased adherence, especially in patients who switched within the first year of initiating donepezil.",

    "abstract": "Discovery of effective treatment for Alzheimer disease (AD) depends upon the availability of outcome measures that exhibit good sensitivity to rates of longitudinal decline on global functional performance. The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living inventory (ADCS-ADL) is a frequently used functional endpoint in clinical trials for AD that assesses patient functional ability on the basis of informant ratings of patient performance on a variety of everyday tasks. Previous research has shown that the items comprising the ADCS-ADL are sensitive to characteristic longitudinal trajectories in AD. However, standard procedures for combining information from individual items into an overall test score may not make full use of the information provided by informant responses. The current study explored an application of item-response theory (IRT) techniques to the calculation of test scores on the ADCS-ADL. Using data from 2 ADCS clinical trials on mild-to-moderate AD patients we found that IRT based scoring increased sensitivity to change in functional ability and improved prospective statistical power of the ADCS-ADL as an outcome measure in clinical trials.",

Significant differences in battery performance were found among groups on the BADS subtests Rule Shift Cards, Program of Action, Zoo Map, 6 Modified Elements, and 3 total scores. Early changes in executive functions were detected in both AD (irrespective of age of onset) and aMCI patients. The BADS proved useful for differentiating between these patient groups. Our results confirmed the presence of early alterations in executive functions among aMCI and mild AD patients.",

The present study aimed at evaluating whether the rate of cognitive worsening in AD may be predicted by widely available and easy-to-assess factors.Mild to moderate AD patients were recruited in the ICTUS study. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed to measure the association between several sociodemographic and clinical variables and 3 different rates of cognitive decline defined by modifications (after 1 year of follow-up) of the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score: (1) \"slow\" progression, as indicated by a decrease in the MMSE score ≤1 point; (2) \"intermediate\" progression, decrease in the MMSE score between 2 and 5 points; and (3) \"rapid\" progression, decrease in the MMSE score ≥6 points.A total of 1005 patients were considered for the present analyses. Overall, most of the study participants (52%) exhibited a slow cognitive course. Higher ADAS-Cog scores at baseline were significantly associated with both \"intermediate\" and \"rapid\" decline. Conversely, increasing age was negatively associated with \"rapid\" cognitive worsening.A slow progression of cognitive decline is common among AD patients. The influence of age and baseline cognitive impairment should always be carefully considered when designing AD trials and defining study populations.",

Accumulating cues were used within each SR trial in the SR/EL group. The participants' recall performance, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, and the portion of a meal that participants had eaten were measured. After the 8-week training period, results showed significantly improved recall performances (P<0.0031) and food intake (t=2.140, P=0.038) in the SR/EL group compared with the SR-only group. MMSE scores showed no significant differences after the 8-week intervention (t=1.315, P=0.194).

We investigated whether unawareness affects distinct domains to different degrees and identified the factors related to the awareness impairment in Alzheimer Disease (AD). Using a cross-sectional design, we assessed 89 people with AD (PwAD) and their caregivers. Awareness was evaluated by scoring discrepant responses between PwAD and their caregivers across domains including cognitive functioning and health condition, functional activity impairments, emotional state, social functioning, and interpersonal relationships. The awareness of functional activity impairments domain showed a greater discrepancy compared with the other domains. Multiple regression analysis revealed that lack of awareness of cognitive functioning and health condition was related to PwAD unawareness of functional activity impairments, age, and caregiver burden. The emotional state domain was related to PwAD unawareness of functional activity impairments and depressive symptoms. There was also a relationship between the social functioning and relationships domain and caregiver burden. The functional activity impairments domain was related to deficits in the following domains: cognitive functioning and health condition, emotional state, social and emotional functioning, and PwAD self-reported quality of life. Although we observed that 1 domain can influence another, our results suggest that the factors related to each of the different objects of awareness are varied.",

    "abstract": "Euthanasia is a controversial and complex issue, especially when involving incompetent patients. On December 10, 2015, Quebec became the first Canadian province to give access to medical aid in dying (MAiD) (ie, euthanasia performed by a physician) to competent patients who satisfy strictly defined criteria. Less than 2 years later, Quebec is considering extending MAiD to incompetent patients who made an advance request. With the objective of contributing scientific data to current societal debates, we conducted a survey among 471 informal caregivers of persons with dementia, reached through Alzheimer Societies. We used a series of vignettes featuring a person with Alzheimer disease to investigate respondents’ attitudes towards MAiD. The response rate was 69%. Two-thirds [68%; 95% confidence interval, 63%-73%] found it acceptable to extend MAiD to an incompetent patient at an advanced stage of Alzheimer disease who had made a written request while competent, and 91% (95% confidence interval, 87%-94%) found it acceptable at the terminal stage. Self-determination was the most widely endorsed argument in favor of access to MAiD for incompetent patients. Findings suggest strong support among informal caregivers for extending MAiD to incompetent patients, provided they are terminally-ill and had made a written request before losing capacity.",

Objective: To examine the relationship of current engagement in lifestyle activities to previous cognitive performance among individuals who were cognitively normal at baseline, and whether this relationship differed for individuals who subsequently developed mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or by APOE-4 genotype, age, and level of cognitive reserve. Methods: Participants (N=189) were primarily middle-aged ( M =56.6 y) at baseline and have been prospectively followed with annual assessments ( M follow-up=14.3 y). Engagement in physical, cognitive, and social activities was measured by the CHAMPS activity questionnaire. Longitudinal cognitive performance was measured by a global composite score. Results: Among individuals who progressed to MCI (n=27), higher lifestyle activity engagement was associated with less decline in prior cognitive performance. In contrast, among individuals who remained cognitively normal, lifestyle activity engagement was not associated with prior cognitive trajectories. These effects were largely independent of APOE-4 genotype, age, and cognitive reserve. Conclusions: Greater engagement in lifestyle activities may modify the rate of cognitive decline among those who develop symptoms of MCI, but these findings need to be confirmed in prospective studies.",

The aims of this study were: (1) to assess caregivers’ awareness of ER deficits in care-receivers with early AD or MCI; (2) to examine the mediating role of caregivers’ subjective evaluations on the relationship between caregiver burden and ER deficits in persons with MCI and early AD. Methods: Persons with MCI (N=29) and with early AD (N=26) performed an ER task (objective emotion recognition, OER) of watching short clips of dynamic bodily and dynamic facial expressions of 6 basic emotions. In addition, their family caregivers (N=55) were interviewed to measure their evaluation of their relatives’ ER ability (subjective emotion recognition, SER) as well as their own experience of burden. Results: Two thirds of the caregivers either underestimated or overestimated the care-receivers’ ER deficits. Regression results yielded a significant positive relationship between OER and SER, as well as a significant negative relationship between SER and caregiver burden. Moreover, SER was found to mediate the relationship between OER and caregiver burden. Conclusion: Caregivers’ better awareness of ER deficits in people with MCI and early AD might mitigate the deleterious consequences of caregiving for persons with cognitive deterioration and might therefore allow better chances for people with dementia to age in a homecare setting.",

His brain magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse T2/FLAIR hyperintensity of basal ganglia, thalami, cerebral peduncles, ventral pons, and supratentorial white matter with a frontal predominance. Hyperintensity was noted along the corticosubcortical junction on diffusion-weighted images. NIID was suspected and the patient underwent triple biopsy of the sural nerve with adjacent skin and biceps biopsy. Biopsy revealed ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions surrounding the myofibers, and vascular smooth muscles suggestive of NIID.NIID is a rare neurodegenerative disorder usually diagnosed postmortem. The rectal and skin biopsy had proved helpful in antemortem diagnosis. We have increased the diagnostic armamentarium by showing the presence of intranuclear inclusions in smooth muscle cells of the muscle. Hence, a high degree of suspicion, magnetic resonance imaging features, with nerve/muscle/skin biopsy can help in diagnosis of NIID.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies about personality changes in dementia suggest that they may be due to the disruption of the biological basis of personality traits, and hence, that they are disease specific and universal. However, evidence about its specificity is still limited and scarce regarding culturally diverse populations. Accordingly, our aim was to compare personality changes in Argentinean patients with Alzheimer disease, behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia, and primary progressive aphasia. The closest living relatives of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer disease (n=19), behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (n=16), and primary progressive aphasia (n=15) were asked to complete 2 versions of the personality inventory NEO Personality Inventory-Revised, one for assessing patients' premorbid personality traits, and the other for assessing current traits. All groups showed changes in several domains and facets of the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised. Globally, the observed pattern of changes was fairly consistent with previous studies based on the same model of personality. Nevertheless, our results regarding disease-specificity were less conclusive. Even if there were some indicators of specific differences between groups, most traits varied similarly across the 3 groups, revealing a pattern of generalized changes in personality expression after illness onset. More studies are needed that help to distinguish real personality changes from other affective or cognitive symptoms that accompany dementia, as well as further data from culturally diverse populations.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to explore the temporal trends and geographic variations in dementia mortality in China.Annual dementia mortality counts (years 2006 to 2012) in 161 counties and districts (Disease Surveillance Points, DSP) were extracted from the nationally representative China Mortality Surveillance System and stratified by 5-year age group (aged >65), sex, and time. These counts were linked to annually adjusted denominator populations. Multilevel negative binomial regression with random intercepts and slopes were used to investigate spatiotemporal variation in dementia mortality.Dementia mortality varied over 2-fold between DSPs (median rate ratio: 2.59). Significant variation in DSP slopes through time (variance 0.075, SE 0.020) indicated spatiotemporal variations. Mortality rates were significantly higher in the east (rate ratio 2.28; 95% confidence intervals, 1.45-3.60) compared with the north. There was a declining trend in 2 (east and northwest) of the 7 regions. Dementia mortality decreased by 15% in urban areas but increased by 24% in rural areas.Our findings indicate that regional inequalities in dementia mortality are salient, and the increase in mortality rates in rural areas is an emerging public health challenge in China. Tailored preventive health strategies should be in place to narrow down this avoidable and wholly unnecessary inequality.",

Methods: A case-control study was conducted in 362 individuals (181 LOADs and 181 controls) to determine the association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in A POE (e2, e3, and e4), TOMM40 (rs2075650), CR1 (rs665640), PVRL2 (rs6859), SORL1 (rs11218304), PICALM (rs3851179), and GWA_14q32.13 (rs11622883) with LOAD in a sample from Colombia. Results: We were able to confirm the previously reported association of the APOE 4 allele with AD. In addition, we report a new significant association with rs2075650 of TOMM40 for LOAD in our sample. We did not detect any significant interaction between TOMM40 and APOE 4 carriers (heterozygous or homozygous) for disease risk development. However, Kaplan-Meier survival analyses suggest that AD patients with TOMM40 allele rs2075650-G have an average age of disease onset of 6 years earlier compared with carriers of the A allele. In addition, the age of disease onset is earlier if APOE 4/4 is present. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that rs2075650 of TOMM40 could be involved in earlier presentation of LOAD in the Colombian population.",

The identification of deterministic genes for these common adult-onset genetic diseases is moving the field of genetic counseling toward a new and challenging direction. With the identification of genes associated with AD and FTD, there is considerable interest in the clinical application of genetic information in genetic counseling and testing. Progress in the genetics of dementing disorders and the availability of clinical tests for practicing physicians therefore increases the need for a better understanding of the multifaceted issues associated with genetic testing. The aims of this systematic review are: (1) to underline the need to consider a genetic etiology of AD, FTD, and LBD; (2) to provide clinicians with information necessary to effectively translate genetic diagnosis into clinical practice; and (3) to highlight gaps and uncertainties in the field which will need to be addressed by future research.",

Our 12 patients had a median age of onset of 56 years (range, 48 to 63 y) and were followed for a median of 6 years (range, 3 to 9 y). Patients either presented with complex visual phenomena or developed them with time. Six patients underwent flurodeoxyglucose and Pittsburgh investigational compound B imaging which showed a mismatch between metabolic activity and amyloid deposition with reduced metabolism in parieto-occipital regions on flurodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and diffuse neocortical uptake of amyloid without occipital predominance. All patients progressively deteriorated using a quality of life and total functional capacity assessments and this change is similar to the natural history of other early-onset AD variants (typical amnestic presentation, logopenic, and frontal). Two patients had neuropathologic assessments and were shown to have AD using standard pathologic criteria. Of interest, 5 of our 12 patients had occupations strongly dependent on visuospatial functioning. PCA is a syndrome that is most likely a variant of early-onset AD and our correlative clinical, structural, functional, and amyloid imaging data, along with neuropathologic studies in 2 patients, support this concept. The natural history of PCA shows progression with time and this trajectory seems to reflect that of other variants of early-onset AD.",

It is characterized by the accumulation of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites which are composed of aggregated phosphorylated alpha-synuclein, which is a presynaptic neuronal protein genetically and neuropathologically linked to Parkinson disease and to LBD. Alpha-synuclein is thought to contribute to LBD pathogenesis and to linked to disruption of cellular homeostasis and neuronal death, through effects on various intracellular targets, including synaptic function. Methods: In the present study, we did a meta-analysis on the reliability of alpha-synuclein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for the discrimination between LBD and other neurodegenerative disorders including AD, Parkinson disease (PD) dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Results: CSF alpha-synuclein levels were significantly different in LBD compared with AD, but no statistical difference was found between LBD, and dementia in PD, MSA, PSP, and FTD. Conclusion: Alpha-synuclein levels in the CSF can be used for the discrimination between LBD and AD, but not LBD and other neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia in PD, MSA, FTD, and PSP.",

    "abstract": "Differences in cognition between frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer disease (AD) are well described in clinical cohorts, but have rarely been confirmed in studies with pathologic verification. For emerging therapeutics to succeed, determining underlying pathology early in the disease course is increasingly important. Neuropsychological evaluation is an important component of the diagnostic workup for AD and FTD. Patients with FTD are thought to have greater deficits in language and executive function while patients with AD are more likely to have deficits in memory.To determine if performance on initial cognitive testing can reliably distinguish between patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and AD neuropathology. In addition, are there other factors of the neuropsychological assessment that can be used to enhance the accuracy of underlying pathology?Using a logistic regression we retrospectively compared neurocognitive performance on initial evaluation of 106 patients with pathologically verified FTLD (pvFTLD), with 558 pathologically verified AD (pvAD) patients from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center using data from the Uniform Data Set (UDS) and the neuropathology data set.As expected, pvFTLD patients were younger, demonstrated better memory performance, and had more neuropsychiatric symptoms than pvAD patients. Other results were less predictable: pvFTLD patients performed better on one test of executive function (trail making test part B) but worse on another (digit span backward). Performance on language testing did not strongly distinguish the 2 groups. To determine what factors led to a misdiagnosis of AD in patients with FTLD, we further analyzed a small group of pvFTLD patients. These patients demonstrated older age and lower Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire counts compared with accurately diagnosed cases.Other than memory, numerical scores of neurocognitive performance on the UDS are of limited value in differentiating FTLD from AD at the initial visit. These results highlight the difficulty of obtaining an accurate early diagnosis of FTLD and argue for adding supplemental tests to those included in the UDS to assess cognition in FTD and AD patients.",

We investigated dementia incidence in a representative sample of the Greek population in the age group of 65 years and above. Methods: This research is part of the Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (HELIAD). The incidence cohort consisted of 1072 participants who were reevaluated after a mean period of 3.09 years. Results: The incidence rate of dementia was 19.0 cases per 1000 person-years (age-standardized and sex-standardized incidence: 25.4/1000 person-years), of which 16.3 per 1000 person-years were attributable to Alzheimer disease. Each additional year of age increased dementia risk by 19.3% and each additional year of education decreased dementia risk by 12.1%. Apolipoprotein E (APOE)-ε4 homozygous participants were 18 times more likely to be diagnosed with dementia. A baseline diagnosis of mild cognitive decline (MCI) resulted in a risk for dementia increased by 3.7 times compared with the cognitively normal; in participants with MCI at baseline, APOE-ε4 carriage increased dementia risk by 4.5 times. Conclusions: The incidence rate of dementia in people 65 years and above in Greece is generally consistent with recently published rates in Europe and North America. Advancing age, baseline MCI, and APOE-ε4 homozygosity are risk factors, while higher educational attainment seems protective.",

The present study follows a previous report showing the faster conversion from MCI to Alzheimer disease for bilingual patients than comparable monolinguals, as predicted by a cognitive reserve (CR). Purpose: Identify whether the increased CR found for bilinguals in the previous study was accompanied by greater gray matter (GM) atrophy than was present for the monolinguals. Methods: A novel deep-learning technique based on convolutional neural networks was used to enhance clinical scans into 1 mm MPRAGEs and analyze the GM volume at the time of MCI diagnosis in the earlier study. Patients: Twenty-four bilingual and 24 monolingual patients were diagnosed with MCI at a hospital memory clinic. Results: Bilingual patients had more GM loss than monolingual patients in areas related to language processing, attention, decision-making, motor function, and episodic memory retrieval. Bilingualism and age were the strongest predictors of atrophy after other variables such as immigration and education were included in a multivariate model. Discussion: CR from bilingualism is evident in the initial stages of neurodegeneration after MCI has been diagnosed.",

Because of the complications of drug treatments, nonpharmacological interventions, such as exercise, are of particular value. This study aimed to investigate the effect of exercise on the NPS of dementia and draw recommendations for the disease management. Methods: Meta-analyses were conducted on the findings of randomized controlled trials identified during an initial systematic review of the literature, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The included studies examined the effect of exercise interventions on patients with dementia or mild cognitive impairment using valid assessment tools. The quality of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation analysis. Results: The meta-analyses revealed that exercise significantly limits NPS [mean difference: −5.28, (95% CI, −9.46, −1.11), P = 0.01] and symptoms of depression [standardized mean difference: −0.16, (95% CI, −0.29, −0.02), P = 0.02], and has a beneficial effect on agitation symptoms. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation analysis results showed that exercise has a moderate and high confidence positive effect on NPS and depression, respectively. Conclusions: Exercise could be an alternative approach for nonpharmacological treatment of NPS in dementia.

However, social behavior is difficult to assess in outpatient settings. We evaluated whether impaired emotion recognition is related to proxy-rated social behavioral problems and thus can serve as a marker of these changes. Patients and Method: Emotion recognition was assessed with Ekman 60 Faces Test (EFT-total, 6 separate emotions) in patients (n = 31 AD; n = 37 aMCI) and healthy controls (n = 60 HCs). Social behavioral problems were rated by proxies with the neuropsychiatric inventory (agitation, apathy, irritability, disinhibition, and a sum score). It tested whether EFT scores differed between patients with and without behavioral problems. Results: AD had worse EFT-total ( P &lt;0.001), disgust ( P = 0.02), and fear ( P = 0.001) than HC, but not than aMCI, who did not differ from HC. AD displayed more disinhibition ( P &lt; 0.05). EFT and neuropsychiatric inventory sum scores were not significantly correlated. Patients with apathy had lower EFT-total ( P = 0.02). Conclusions: Measuring emotion recognition adds value: it is impaired in early neurodegeneration and associated with apathy but not necessarily related to overall changes in social behavior in this population.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of drugs that may slow progression of Alzheimer disease, if administered early during its course, has necessitated early diagnosis of the disease itself. Among the functional imaging methods that could assist in early diagnosis, positron emission tomography has an important role in providing quantitative measures of various aspects of brain function affected by the disease. Positron emission tomography studies in patients with Alzheimer disease have revealed a typical pattern of metabolic deficits in the temporal and parietal lobes. Additionally, converging evidence from numerous studies indicates that a similar pattern of deficits can be observed in nondemented subjects who are at risk of developing the disease, such as those with recognized genetic traits such as familial Alzheimer disease with mutations in chromosomes 21 and 14, Down syndrome, subjects with the ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene, and individuals with mild cognitive impairment. These findings might have implications for the selection of patients for clinical trials, defining the outcome measures and evaluation of treatment efficacy and responder characteristics, but should be confirmed by prospective studies comprising larger samples and include clinicopathologic correlations.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the safety and tolerability of betaine in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). Betaine is an alternative methyl donor, distinct from the folate-and cobalamin-dependent conversion pathway between homocysteine and methionine. Betaine has been used successfully to reduce homocysteine levels in homocystinuria. The rationale for betaine in AD was to decrease serum homocysteine levels and to increase brain methionone and S-adenosylmethionine, both of which might delay disease progression. Hyperhomocysteinemia is a possible risk factor for AD. Eight patients with probable mild AD (7 men; mean age, 69.6 years; mean Mini-Mental State Exam score, 23.7) received oral betaine (3 g twice daily) for 24 weeks. All patients were on donepezil 10 mg/day for at least 3 months before entry and throughout the study. One patient suffered a myocardial infarction and withdrew after 6 weeks. Another patient, who completed the trial, experienced diarrhea and prostatitis. Four of the 7 patients who completed the trial were rated on the Clinician's Global Impression of Change as worse after 24 weeks. On the cognitive portion of the AD Assessment Scale, 2 patients worsened by at least five points over 24 weeks, whereas the others had changes in scores of no more than two points either way. Six of 8 patients tolerated betaine for 24 weeks without difficulty. Several patients worsened over 24 weeks, but as a pilot study without a control group, efficacy measurements cannot be interpreted. The current study provides a basis for pursuing larger controlled trials with betaine in AD. The homocysteine to S-adenosylmethionine pathway is of interest in AD therapeutics.",

Only 8.7% of patients with probable AD and 11.1% of patients with possible AD exhibited large confluent areas of subcortical leukoaraiosis. The remaining patients had variable degrees of leukoaraiosis surrounding the lateral ventricles. The magnitude of leukoaraiosis correlated with the patient's age but not with the Hachinski Ischemic and Mini Mental Status scores. Postmortem studies of two Alzheimer patients showed that their large confluent areas of subcortical leukoaraiosis consisted of rarefied white matter, gliosis, and arteriosclerotic small arteries. Eight additional Alzheimer patients who underwent autopsy had similar but less pronounced white matter changes limited to the periventricular regions of the cerebral hemispheres. Large confluent areas of rarefied subcortical white matter occur in a small minority of Alzheimer patients and are probably not caused by AD.",

We have utilized the Columbia University Scale for Psychopathology in Alzheimer's Disease to monitor a number of behavioral symptoms in 235 patients with early probable AD. Markov analyses were used to predict the probability of developing or retaining a given symptom at 6-month follow-up. The results show that the symptoms of psychopathology in AD fluctuate with time. Agitation was both the most frequent and persistent symptom, while paranoid delusions and hallucinations were less persistent. Most behavioral disturbances, except paranoid delusions, were associated with greater cognitive impairment. There was no association between depressive features and either cognitive or functional impairment. These results have important implications for the optimal treatment of the psychopathological symptoms of AD.",

A global CDR score is reported that is derived from individual scores in six domains. In this study, we examined both agreement and disagreement, among raters and with a gold standard, to identify domain-specific and global dementia severity level ratings that would most benefit from further training or greater emphasis in future training. We found that raters-in-training experienced the most difficulty with rating normal and questionable dementia. They also had the most trouble scoring the memory domain. When they disagreed with the gold standard, they nearly always gave higher ratings. A third, extremely experienced group of raters were uniform in their high levels of agreement on each domain and the global CDR and tended to give lower ratings if they disagreed with the gold standard. Analysis of the agreement and disagreement patterns suggested that greater emphasis on the memory, home and hobbies, and orientation domains during CDR training, and increasing the information provided for the judgment and problem solving domain on the standardized CDR worksheets, could improve the consistency of raters and increase the efficiency with which they are trained to use the CDR.",

Consent was refused in 8% of those to whom the experimental drug was offered.

Refusals can be categorized according to several types: complete refusal, refusal that is time-contingent, partial refusal, and contingent agreement. Rates of consent vary greatly across studies of persons with dementia. This variation can also be affected by different methodologies of calculating rates, in addition to differences in content of studies, populations, and procedures. To warrant consent, a study must first be scientifically sound, with a high likelihood of advancing knowledge, and must provide maximal protection to participants. Consent rates are affected by the following factors: levels of anticipated risks and benefits of the study, relationships among the different caregivers involved in the care of the potential subject, the ability of the researcher to properly identify and locate the person who needs to provide consent, characteristics and attitudes of the person providing consent, and the method of obtaining consent, including timing, location, method of presentation, and type of consent requested. An understanding of these issues can assist the researcher in tailoring research procedures so as to maximize rates of consent. It also raises ethical issues that warrant further discussion concerning the process of obtaining consent from and for persons with dementia.",

Nevertheless, we can tentatively summarize current epidemiologic data in four points. (1) Both the prevalence and the incidence of VaD increase steeply with age. (2) The prevalence of VaD is generally higher among men than among women; the sex difference is more controversial for incidence. (3) There are sizeable differences in both incidence and prevalence across countries.

    "abstract": "Summary: The First International Pharmacoeconomic Conference on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) was held in Amsterdam in July 1998. The meeting was held under the auspices of the International Working Group for Harmonization of Dementia Drug Guidelines (http://dementia.ion.ucl.ac.uk/harmon), bringing together academics, clinicians, purchasers, and representatives from industry. Presentations were given on the methodology of pharmacoeconomic studies in AD, particularly focusing on caregiver burden, quality of life (QOL), and resource utilization. Three economic models of AD were presented based on data from the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. In two studies, these data were then used to model the cost-effectiveness and effect on cost of treatment with donepezil. Both studies suggested a possible cost advantage for the use of donepezil, when compared with no placebo or treatment, particularly when donepezil is used appropriately in mild-to-moderate AD. These data need to be interpreted with care, as none of the cost or utility information were collected during the clinical trials. Additional data from a 2-year clinical trial of selegiline and vitamin E suggest that cognitive measures may be poor predictors of economic outcome, which is better measured directly. Both economic models of donepezil rely on short-term cognitive data to predict long-term outcome, a methodf that may not be useful in predicting economic savings. The issues facing pharmacoeconomists, researchers, clinicians, and families in the future were addressed in a series of workshops using a method of strategic futuring. The workshops attempted to see 7 years into the future for a range of areas, including consumer and caregiver use of pharmacoeconomic data; early detection and prevention; Japanese perspectives; activities of daily life and what will be daily life activities; caregiver burden; QOL at the end of life; new uses for new information and communication technology in clinical research; and physicians' use of pharmacoeconomic data. A range of exciting futures were predicted, although common themes that arose when considering barriers to achieving these futures included cost, education, political will, confidentiality, privacy, and ethics. The first conference was deemed to have been a success, having attracted more than 160 delegates and many distinguished speaker. A second conference is planned for the year 2000. Over the next 2 years, research needs to be broadened particularly in the methodological areas of resource utilization, QOL, and caregiver burden. Data from clinical trials with relevant economic and QOL outcomes will be needed by purchasers if drug treatments for dementia are to gain widespread use. It is also hoped that the models described at the meeting may become more freely available to politicians, purchasers, clinicians, and caregivers to help them make better decisions about treatment.",

    "abstract": "Memantine is a moderate-affinity, voltage-dependent, uncompetitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. In contrast to competitive NMDA antagonists, Memantine is well tolerated in humans and is being developed for the treatment of dementia. The pathogenesis of vascular dementia (VaD) is largely unknown, and is likely multifactorial, but it involves the impairment of blood circulation as a common denominator. There is broad evidence for the efficacy of Memantine in several animal models of ischemia. Memantine also acts on several secondary, potentially contributing factors in VaD such as neuronal depolarization, removal of magnesium block of NMDA receptors, chronic overstimulation of these receptors, and, possibly, mitochondrial dysfunction. Among others, it also has additional positive effects on long-term potentiation and cognition in standard animal models of impaired synaptic plasticity. Recently, clinical efficacy of Memantine has been shown in an etiologically mixed population of severely demented patients, including those with VaD. Given the difficulties of diagnosing VaD in clinical practice, an optimal antidementive drug should be beneficial in both Alzheimer disease and VaD. Preclinical data presented in this paper indicate that such benefits can be achieved with Memantine. In addition, phase II clinical data in dementia are summarized, and two ongoing pivotal trials in VaD are described. Suggestions for VaD guideline development are made regarding clinical instruments, and etiologies and severity stages are considered.",

In the present study, this dual tracer approach was evaluated in the rhesus monkey by altering the rCBF or by administering (S)-(—)-[11C]nicotine at either high or low specific radioactivity. The model parameter, k2 = k2/rCBF, was found to be independent of rCBF in different regions of interest in the monkey brain. The parameter, k2, increased significantly when (S)-(—)-[11C]nicotine was given at low specific radioactivity, indicating lower nicotine binding in the brain. Thus, this observation implies an influence on specific receptor binding on the corrected efflux rate constant. This dual tracer model may be useful in evaluating nicotine binding changes in the human brain and the effect of drug treatment in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease.",

    "abstract": "A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was undertaken to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a once-daily oral administration of metrifonate in patients with probable mild to moderate Alzheimer disease. Metrifonate was given as a loading dose of 125–225 mg based on weight (2.5 mg/kg) for 2 weeks, followed by a maintenance dose of 50–90 mg based on weight (1.0 mg/kg) for 4 weeks. Twenty-nine patients received metrifonate, and 10 patients received placebo. Metrifonate produced a mean erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase inhibition at the end of treatment of 86.3%. The proportion of patients who experienced at least one adverse event was comparable between the metrifonate (76%) and placebo (80%) groups. Selected adverse events in disfavor of metrifonate (defined as those for which the incidence in the metrifonate and placebo groups differed by at least 10%) were diarrhea, nausea, leg cramps, and accidental injury. Adverse events were predominantly mild in intensity and transient. No severe adverse events were experienced by any patient. The most notable hemodynamic change observed during metrifonate treatment was a clinically insignificant mean decrease in the heart rate (by electrocardiogram) of approximately 9 beats/min, compared with an approximate 3-beats/min decrease for the placebo group. No muscle weakness was observed in this study. No clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities, such as liver toxicity, or changes in exercise tolerance or pulmonary function tests were found with metrifonate treatment. This metrifonate dose provided a high level of acetylcholinesterase inhibition, which was associated in these patients with a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Indeed, the magnitude of the peripheral acetylcholinesterase inhibition is the highest tolerable inhibition level yet observed.",

    "abstract": "Summary: The relationship between cognitive deterioration and abnormalities detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was investigated to determine the radiological correlates of cognitive deterioration in hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis- Dutch type (HCHWA-D). Twenty HCHWA-D subjects (12 patients who had suffered one or more strokes and eight who had not suffered a stroke) were studied with MRI and underwent extensive neuropsychological examination. On MRI the number of focal lesions was counted, and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) were scored semiquantitatively. A significant correlation between cognitive deterioration and WMH score and number of focal lesions was found. However, cognitive deterioration, WMH score, and the number of focal lesions all increase with age, and therefore their mutual correlation can be explained as an age effect. This study shows that cognitive deterioration in HCHWA-D is not correlated with abnormalities detected by MRI (number of focal lesions and subcortical WMHs) independently of age. Although a contribution of white matter changes and/or focal lesions, possibly in combination with age, to cognitive deterioration cannot be excluded. Cognitive deterioration in these HCHWA-D patients is probably primarily the result of chronic damage of amyloid angiopathy to the brain, to which may be superimposed cognitive impairment from focal cerebral hemorrhage or infarction",

Dissemination of information is likely to be slowest among the general population, who may be the first to recognize dementia symptoms but may also be reticent to discuss concerns because of fear, embarrassment, and/or inadequate knowledge. The feasibility of providing public education and access to dementia resources was studied using a toll-free interactive voice response (IVR) telephone system. Public interest in this service and willingness to use this technology were evaluated in a 1-month study conducted in a predominantly rural upper Midwest county (population of 102,565). One hundred ninety-three calls were received during November 1999, with an average length of 9 minutes and 29 seconds. One in six calls lasted 15 minutes or longer. One third of the calls were received outside typical business hours (8:00 AM to 6:00 PM). Concern for a parent or grandparent was the most frequent reason (50.6%) given for the call. Self-concern was indicated by 24.7% of the callers. Callers provided positive feedback. Such IVR technology may provide a cost-effective bridge to the \"digital divide\" existing among elderly, lower socioeconomic status, and rural populations underrepresented as computer and Internet users.",

    "abstract": "Based on several lines of evidence, it has been hypothesized that decreased neuronal metabolic rate may precede cognitive impairment, contributing to neuronal atrophy as well as reduced neuronal function in Alzheimer disease (AD). Additionally, studies have shown that stimulation of neurons through different mechanisms may protect those cells from the deleterious effects of aging and AD, a phenomenon we paraphrased as \"use it or lose it.\" Therefore, it is attractive to direct the development of therapeutic strategies toward stimulation of metabolic rate/neuronal activity to improve cognition and other symptoms in AD. A number of pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches discussed here support the concept that stimulation of the brain has beneficial effects and may, to a certain degree, restore several aspects of cognition and other central functions. For instance, the circadian system, which controls the sleep/wake cycle, may be stimulated in AD patients by exposing them to more light or transcutaneous nerve stimulation. We will also discuss a procedure that has been developed to culture human postmortem brain tissue, which allows testing of the efficacy of putative stimulatory compounds.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition leading to progressive, irreversible loss of cognitive and behavioral function. Despite considerable investments in neuroscience research, only four drugs, all cholinesterase inhibitors, have been approved for the symptomatic management of AD in the United States. Although basically safe and modestly effective, these drugs are far from ideal, being neither universally efficacious nor disease modifying. AD exacts a considerable toll in direct medical costs, quality of life, and caregiver burden for persons and society. In addition to the obvious clinical benefit, therapeutic agents for AD and related dementias represent a considerable market opportunity for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. There are currently 8–10 million AD sufferers in the seven major pharmaceutical markets. The market will grow rapidly in coming decades, as the developed world experiences an enormous increase in its elderly population. Given the great need for new therapeutic agents to manage and prevent AD, the Institute for the Study of Aging and the Fidelity Foundation organized a workshop, “Barriers to the Discovery and Development of Drugs for Alzheimer's Disease,” to examine ways to expedite drug discovery and development. The identified barriers and potential solutions will be discussed here and in the accompanying articles in more detail.",

To use a directly translated instrument without minimal explanation of the procedures for determining the equivalence between the original and secondary language instrument is questionable. Ensuring equivalence of a translated Chinese version of the EdFED-Q for patients with dementia is an essential prerequisite for identifying culturally specific expressions of feeding difficulty under investigation. Phase 1 consisted of experts doing the initial translation into Chinese and then English back-translations of the questionnaire. Six experts determined the equality of the Chinese and English versions, and five monolingual nurses provided information for the C-EdFED-Q. In phase 2, two bilingual gerontological nurses rated 33 residents with dementia to determine equivalence across time. In phase 3, three groups of bilingual nurses used the Chinese, English, and finally both versions simultaneously to judge a model case's feeding behavior on the videotape. In phase 1, the rating on the equality of the items on the Chinese and English versions was 0.969. In phase 2, kappa coefficients for all items on the C-EdFED-Q and E-EdFED-Q ranged from 0.44 to 1.00. In determining the consistency of the scores for the C-EdFED-Q and E-EdFED-Q between the two raters across time, the intraclass correlation coefficient for the absolute agreement was found to range from 0.85 to 0.90. In phase 3, except for items 6 and 9, all items showed no significant difference among the three groups. Further studies to assess the relationship between constructs and to compare it with known and predicted relationships are recommended.",

The threshold was determined as the target duration at which 50% of the words were read.The mean number of errors in Color Discrimination and Spatial Contrast Sensitivity did not differ significantly among the three groups. WRT was significantly longer in the AD group (122.6 +/- 70.8 ms) in comparison with ENC group (53.8 +/- 15.9 ms) (p < 0.001).

Four of the 13 MCI subjects also exceeded this threshold and all four progressed to AD within 2 year follow-up.Word Reading Threshold determination discriminates mild AD subjects from ENC, and correlates with severity of cognitive impairment.

There were 3 target-motion conditions at frequencies representing varying ranges of target velocity. DAT patients differed from controls on all measures of smooth pursuit quality: their gain was reduced at high target velocities and lower target accelerations, they made more frequent directionally appropriate saccades and had more saccadic intrusions, they led the target with their eyes (phase lead) in all 3 conditions, and lag-adjusted cross-correlation coefficients, computed between digitized eye-movement and target signals, were lower among patients. The cross-correlation measure was most sensitive to between-group variability. These results suggest that the impaired SPEM observed in DAT patients reflect degeneration of cortical oculomotor centers, either through inappropriate saccadic intrusions in smooth pursuit as a result of physiologic disinhibition or through effects on attentional processes or both.",

Only a few years ago, the proposition that AD may be amenable to any kind of therapy would have met with considerable skepticism. Yet, recent, exciting developments appear to suggest that immunizing against Aβ may bear some potential for arresting or even curing AD. However, a clinical trial of vaccination with synthetic human Aβ in AD patients was halted because of the development of meningoencephalitis in some patients. Further studies aimed at elucidating the mechanism of Aβ clearance upon Aβ immunization are needed. Such knowledge might facilitate the design of specific vaccination regimens, allowing exclusive targeting of Aβ plaques without inducing detrimental side effects.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease is the most common form of dementia in Western countries and the leading cause of disability in the over-65 population. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a multifunctional protein implied in lipid metabolism and neurobiology. Polymorphisms of the APOE gene have been associated with a variety of medical disorders, from arteriosclerosis to AD. A high frequency of the APOE epsilon4 allele has been found in patients with AD and they seem to have a higher risk of developing the disease. Various authors have suggested a possible relationship between the efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors and the presence of the APOE epsilon4 allele. The purpose of the present study was to compare prospectively the efficacy of rivastigmine in patients with mild to moderately severe AD presenting different polymorphisms of the APOE gene on chromosome 19 and to determine if there was a difference in the response to rivastigmine treatment in AD patients with the APOE epsilon4 allele (heterozygous or homozygous) versus patients who had other forms of APOE, such as epsilon2 and epsilon3. This was an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study in patients over 50 years of age diagnosed with mild to moderately severe AD. The results of the analysis of this study indicate that the presence of at least one APOE epsilon4 allele does not determine a difference in the response to treatment with rivastigmine. The data indicate that knowledge of the patient's genotype is not necessary for treatment with rivastigmine. It would be interesting in the future to analyze the interaction between these 2 factors using other available anticholinesterase drugs.",

A search of Medline, CINAHL, PsychInfo, AARP Ageline, and Sociofile from 1984 to 2005 was performed. No published studies focus primarily on the timing of follow-up of drivers with mild dementia. Three studies present longitudinal data that the authors reference when recommending periodicity of follow-up. This study identifies a concerning research gap in the field of dementia and driving. To provide better evidence to guide recommendations for periodicity of follow-up, 3 recommendations are proposed: (1) that prospective cohort driving research be undertaken to follow patients with mild dementia who continue to drive, (2) that data from such longitudinal research be presented as survival analyses, and (3) that existing research on the progression rates of Alzheimer disease be employed as a default until the first 2 recommendations are realized.",

Its reliability and validity have been confirmed. The NPI was the subject of a workshop in Asia in conjunction with the International Workgroup on Dementia Drug Guidelines (IWG). Investigators using the NPI from 4 Asian areas— Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand—presented conclusions from their research. A high prevalence of behavioral disturbances across Asian countries was found and the rates are similar to those observed in Western countries. Apathy is more difficult to detect and characterize in Asian populations. Neurobiologic studies show an excess of some serotonin receptor gene polymorphisms in patients without behavioral disturbances and positron emission tomography reveals reductions in frontal lobe metabolism in patients manifesting depression as measured by the NPI. Studies in Thailand show relationships among verbal fluency, activities of daily living, and neuropsychiatric symptoms particularly agitation, apathy, and disinhibition. This suggests a triad of symptoms of behavioral abnormalities, executive dysfunction, and abnormalities of activities of daily living that impugn frontal lobe function. The NPI is a reliable and useful instrument to characterize behavioral changes in Asian and Western populations.",

Family members described difficult decisions they had made to date, noting a significant transition in their decision making role when the elders' decisions needed to be superseded (especially with changes in living arrangements). In most families, one person or couple assumed the principal decision making responsibility. When decisions were made in the context of family conflict, managing the conflict became the focus, rather than the elder's care. In such cases, the elder's previously stated wishes regarding end of life care were not as likely to be honored.",

We have now examined the role of cognitive and perceptual mechanisms in the navigational impairment of AD to test the hypothesis that men and women with AD may focus on different navigational cues. We conducted navigational, neuropsychologic, and psychophysical testing in men and women from 3 groups: older normal controls, patients with mild cognitive impairment, and patients with AD. Men and women showed parallel declines in navigational capacities from the older normal control, to the mild cognitive impairment, to the AD groups with men and women making similar numbers of errors but different types of errors. There were small sex differences in neuropsychologic and psychophysical performance but large sex differences in how those measures related to navigational capacity: men showed strong links between visual motion processing and navigation. Women showed strong links between verbal capacities and navigation. The findings of these cross-sectional comparisons suggest that there may be sex differences in the progressive navigational decline of AD: men and women who are impaired to the same degree may suffer somewhat different patterns of decline with men relying more on visuospatial processing and women relying more on verbal mediation.",

Baseline Clinical Dementia Ratings identified 36 participants as CN, 37 with MCI, and 34 as MD. Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) and Mini-Mental State Examinations were administered during clinic visits at weeks 0, 8, 16, and 24. IVR cognitive testing was completed at each visit and from participants' homes at weeks 4, 12, and 20. Study partners provided dementia symptoms severity ratings via IVR. The assessment system received 719 participant and 723 partner calls. All calls initiated by CN participants, 99.2% by MCI participants, and 87.3% by MD participants were completed. Telephonic Remote Evaluation of Neuropsychological Deficit tasks showed significant performance differences between participant groups, good reliability, and convergent validity with Mini-Mental State Examinations and ADAS-Cog measures. Automated cognitive testing calls took about 18 minutes to complete, and informant calls took approximately 4 minutes. IVR informant data were convergent with the ADAS-Noncog measure. Computer-automated assessments of cognitive functioning via IVR provided reliable, valid data. Such assessments might benefit routine clinical care and large-scale, longitudinal research in the future, but will require additional research over longer periods.",

Using guidelines as a benchmark for standard care, we examined medical records to assess the documentation, assessment, and treatment of aggression in patients newly diagnosed with dementia. Study participants were at least 60 years old and diagnosed with dementia at the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center in Houston, TX, from 2001 to 2004. Of 385 eligible patients screened by telephone using 3 probes from the Ryden Aggression Scale, 75 had positive response to 1 or more of 3 probes from the Ryden. Medical records of these patients were reviewed for 12 months before and 3 months after telephone screening. Aggression had been documented in 31 (42%), nonpharmacologic interventions had been used in 11 (35%), and pharmacologic interventions had been used in all 31. Among the 44 patients without previously documented aggression, pharmacologic interventions were used in 34 (79%) patients. Patients with documented aggression had more psychiatric comorbidities and received more psychotropic medications than patients with undocumented aggression. We conclude that dementia patients should be systematically screened for aggression and that new strategies to increase use of nonpharmacologic interventions and decrease use of pharmacologic interventions, particularly antipsychotics, should be identified.",

We used The National Longitudinal Caregiver Study (NLCS, 4 annual surveys, 1999 to 2002) and identified 3 distinct longitudinal patterns (trajectory classes) of total daily caregiving time provided by the wife to her husband using Generalized growth mixture models (GGMM). About 56.4% of the sample (N=828) was found to have an increase in the trajectory of total daily caregiving time (mean 252 min/d at baseline, rising to 471 min/d at time 4). Four hundred forty-four (30.3%) caregivers had a trajectory described by a moderate increase in caregiving time (an increase from a mean of 464 min/d at baseline to 533 at wave 4), whereas 195 (13.3%) had a sharply declining trajectory (a decline from a mean of 719 min/d at baseline to 421 at wave 4). There was no significant difference in the duration (time since onset) of caregiving at baseline for these 3 trajectories. GGMM are well suited for the identification of distinct trajectory classes. Here they show that there are large differences in caregiving time provided to persons with dementia, who seem to be quite similar.",

To develop such a tool, data on 875 patients from 4 double-blind–randomized studies of donepezil in severe AD [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 0 to 12 inclusive] were pooled and analyzed to identify Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) items, which are sensitive to change over time. Eight of the 51 SIB items were chosen based on effect sizes and relative ease of administration. The resulting SIB-8 was then applied to a validation data set (not used to generate the short form) to characterize its usefulness. The items, Month, Months of Year, Write Name, Sentence, Fluency, Confrontational Naming–Spoon, Using Spoon–Photograph, and Digit Span, were sensitive to change with treatment (P<0.0001) and easy to administer. Baseline SIB-8 scores were correlated with baseline MMSE and full-scale SIB scores, and provided a good distribution of scores in patients at the lower end of the MMSE. The SIB-8 is a brief (≤3 min) assessment for patients with severe AD that is sensitive to change and able to detect treatment response. Supplemental Digital Content is available in the article",

    "abstract": "This report describes a pilot study to evaluate feasibility of new home-based assessment technologies applicable to clinical trials for prevention of cognitive loss and Alzheimer disease. Methods: Community-dwelling nondemented individuals ≥75 years old were recruited and randomized to 1 of 3 assessment methodologies: (1) mail-in questionnaire/ live telephone interviews (MIP); (2) automated telephone with interactive voice recognition (IVR); and (3) internet-based computer Kiosk (KIO). Brief versions of cognitive and noncognitive outcomes were adapted to the different methodologies and administered at baseline and 1-month. An Efficiency measure, consisting of direct staff-to-participant time required to complete assessments, was also compared across arms. Results: Forty-eight out of 60 screened participants were randomized. The dropout rate across arms from randomization through 1-month was different: 33% for KIO, 25% for IVR, and 0% for MIP (Fisher Exact Test P=0.04). Nearly all participants who completed baseline also completed 1-month assessment (38 out of 39). The 1-way ANOVA across arms for total staff-to-participant direct contact time (ie, training, baseline, and 1-month) was significant: F (2,33)=4.588; P=0.017, with lowest overall direct time in minutes for IVR (Mn=44.4; SD=21.5), followed by MIP (Mn=74.9; SD=29.9), followed by KIO (Mn=129.4; SD=117.0). Conclusions: In this sample of older individuals, a higher dropout rate occurred in those assigned to the high-technology assessment techniques; however, once participants had completed baseline in all 3 arms, they continued participation through 1 month. High-technology home-based assessment methods, which do not require live testers, began to emerge as more time-efficient over the brief time of this pilot, despite initial time-intensive participant training.",

One such disease is frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), an early-age-of-onset dementia that disproportionately affects social behavior. We report the demographic and neuropsychologic characteristics of more than 300 patients diagnosed with FTLD in the United States, Greece, and Turkey. We find that patients with the frontal variant of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are diagnosed at an earlier age and report earlier symptom onset in the United States than in Greece or Turkey. Furthermore, neuropsychologic measures indicate that at diagnosis, FTD patients in the United States are less impaired than patients in Greece and Turkey. Patients with FTD in Greece and Turkey are diagnosed later in the disease, presumably because their behavioral symptoms are not easily detected by the medical system in these countries. Our study underscores the need to create culturally appropriate indices of the behavioral symptoms of FTLD, so that patients may be diagnosed and treated at an earlier stage.",

Both groups reported similar prevalence of diabetes, acute myocardial infarction, heart disease, prostate cancer, breast cancer, angina, and emphysema; respondents with dementia-related functional limitations were more likely to report diabetes, depression or anxiety, and vision problems as being related to functional limitations. Persons with dementia-related functional limitations were also more likely than persons with non-dementia-related functional limitations to report feeling sad, hopeless, worthless, nervous, and that \"everything is an effort.\" Improving or maintaining functional independence in patients with dementia will likely require a multifaceted approach across disease states. Additional research will help define the impact of dementia on the development and progression of functional limitations related to comorbidities.",

First diagnosis acetyl-cholinesterase inhibitor and psychoactive drug-free outpatients (n=50) were recruited in memory clinics and reassessed after 3 and 6 months. Global cognitive functioning, depressive symptoms and MDE frequency were evaluated with the Mini Mental State Examination, the CERAD Dysphoria scale and the modified DSM-IV criteria for MDE in AD. MDE frequency reduced significantly from the first diagnostic visit (100%) to the 6-month follow-up (62%). We also found a significant reduction in CERAD Dysphoria scores that decreased from 6.2±3.9 mean±standard deviation to 4.9±4.5 at the 6-month follow-up. In AD patients with MDE rivastigmine alone can have a positive impact on depressive phenomena. Thus, future controlled study are justified to definitively verify if rivastigmine alone may improve depression in AD.",

This study explored the costs of dual-tasking in relation to SH severity in AD and normal controls (NCs). Cadence while walking on a treadmill, and speed-accuracy-tradeoff (SAT), on 3 working memory tasks, were measured during single-task and dual-task conditions. Dual-task costs (DTC) on SAT, cadence, and overall DTC were measured for each of these tasks. On visual rating of SH severity, AD and NC groups were subdivided into high-SH and low-SH subgroups. Compared with the NC, the AD group performed poorly on all working memory tasks across both conditions, decreased cadence on dual-tasking, and showed a decrement in overall DTC (all P<0.01). When grouped according to SH severity, the low-SH-NC group performed superiorly on working memory tasks (P<0.001) and the high-SH-AD group (P=0.001) showed a decrease in dual-task costs of cadence. Although the AD group showed a decrement in overall DTC (P<0.01) compared with NC, when assessed in terms of SH severity, the high-SH-AD group showed the largest decrement in DTC (P<0.01). Greater SH severity is associated with a decrement in overall dual-tasking ability in AD.",

Retinal vessels provide a direct measure to study cerebral small-vessel disease in vivo. In a cohort of 1065 persons (mean age, 67.5 y and 51% women), from the population-based Rotterdam Study, we investigated how retinal vascular calibers relate to brain atrophy and to gray matter and white matter atrophy separately. Retinal arteriolar and venular calibers were semiautomatically measured on digitized fundus transparencies. Using automated quantification of MRI scans, we obtained whole-brain volume and volumes of gray matter and white matter. Both narrower arteriolar and wider venular calibers were associated with smaller brain volume, independent from each other. These associations were primarily driven by smaller white matter volume, whereas no associations were seen for gray matter volume. Adjustments for cardiovascular risk factors attenuated the results, but wider venular caliber remained borderline significantly associated with smaller white matter volume. Our data provide evidence that cerebral small-vessel disease contributes to brain atrophy primarily by affecting the cerebral white matter.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have demonstrated that patients with essential tremor (ET) may also have mild cognitive impairments (MCIs), and cross-sectional and population-based studies have shown that ET is associated with prevalent dementia. Different presentations of MCI are suggested to be associated with different pathologies. For example, amnestic MCI may be associated with Alzheimer disease. Therefore, in this study, we explored whether the MCI subtype in patients with ET (MCI-ET+) is different from the MCI subtype in patients without ET attending a memory outpatient clinic (MCI-ET-).Using a case-control study design, cognitive status in MCI patients with ET and without ET was assessed by neuropsychological testing. Patients with MCI were stratified into groups: amnestic and nonamnestic MCI, or single-domain and multidomain MCI.Of the 93 patients in the ET+ group and the 169 in the ET- group, 45 (48.4%) and 94 (55.6%) patients had MCI, respectively. The frequency of MCI subtypes between the 2 groups was different, such that 25 (55.6%) patients had nonamnestic MCI in the ET+ group and 68 (72.3%) patients had amnestic MCI in ET- group (χ=10.195, P=0.001). Compared with the MCI-ET+ group, patients in the MCI-ET- group showed more severe impairments in verbal and visuospatial memory functions.ET is associated with MCI, particularly the nonamnestic subtype. These results suggest that cognitive change in patients with ET may have a different pathogenesis from that of Alzheimer disease.",

Ambulatory residents who exhibited wandering were divided into: those whose behavior was easily altered [modifiable wandering (MW)] and those whose wandering behavior was not easily altered by the staff [nonmodifiable wandering (NMW)]. The duration of time for which they had opportunity to be involved in meaningful activities was estimated from involvement in activities of nonambulatory residents.The prevalence of wandering increased with severity of cognitive impairment. MW was present in 3.5% of total residents (8.5% of ambulatory), whereas NMW was present in 11.2% of the total ambulatory and nonambulatory residents (26.6% of ambulatory). The risk of NMW was increased with resistiveness to care and decreased with antipsychotic use. Individuals with NMW were less involved in activities. NMW was more prevalent in facilities in which residents were involved in activities for a shorter duration.Involvement of residents in meaningful activities should be tested for reducing the incidence of problematic wandering and for decrease in usage of antipsychotic medications.",

Results summarize a comprehensive survey of psychotropic effects on messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression for 52 genes linked to AD.

Risk may be attenuated by antipsychotics and lithium (down-regulate TNF), atypical antipsychotics (down-regulate TF), risperidone (down-regulates IL1B), olanzapine (up-regulates TFAM, down-regulates PRNP), fluoxetine (up-regulates CLU, SORCS1, NEDD9, GRN, and ECE1), and lithium coadministered with antipsychotics (down-regulates IL1B). Risk may be enhanced by neuroleptics (up-regulate TF), haloperidol (up-regulates IL1B and PION), olanzapine (down-regulates THRA and PRNP, up-regulates IL1A), and chlorpromazine, imipramine, maprotiline, fluvoxamine, and diazepam (up-regulate IL1B). There were no results for dextromethorphan-plus-quinidine. Fluoxetine effects on CLU, NEDD9, and GRN were statistically robust. Drug effects on specific variants, polymorphisms, genotypes, and other genes (CCR2, TF, and PRNP) are detailed. Translational AD risk applications and their limitations related to specific genes, mutations, variants, polymorphisms, genotypes, brain site, sex, clinical population, AD stage, and other factors are discussed.

Both verbal and visual memory tests are used in the diagnosis of aMCI; however, it is unknown which type of test is superior at predicting the underlying pathologic changes associated with AD. In this study, we compared the topography of cortical thinning among 3 subtypes of patients with aMCI: 33 patients with predominant verbal memory impairment (verbal-aMCI), 35 with predominant visual memory impairment (visual-aMCI), and 56 with both verbal and visual memory-predominant impairment (both-aMCI), and 143 patients with normal cognition. As a result, patients with verbal-aMCI showed cortical thinning in the left anterior and medial temporal regions compared with individuals with normal cognition, while those with visual-aMCI did not show significant cortical thinning. The cortical thinning areas of both-aMCI group overlapped those of verbal-aMCI but were more widespread involving the bilateral temporal regions. These findings suggest that the verbal-aMCI and both-aMCI are more likely to be a precursor of AD than visual-aMCI, and that both-aMCI may be more advanced subtype than verbal-aMCI on the spectrum from MCI to AD.",

However, this element has been detected in neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in patients with Alzheimer disease. Its presence in neuritic plaques in hippocampus is especially relevant, as this is an area closely related to spatial learning and memory. In this study, the diet of wild-type and Tg2576 mice (animals overexpressing the human amyloid precursor protein) was supplemented with Al lactate (1 mg/g). General neurotoxic Al effects were evaluated using a functional observational battery and a novel object recognition task. Four experimental groups were used: Control-wild, Al-wild, Control-Tg, and Al-Tg mice. The results show a decreased home-cage activity and an increase in piloerection in all Al-exposed animals, and an increased sensorimotor reactivity in Tg2576 mice given Al. Neither Al treatment nor genotype had any noticeable effect on corticosterone levels and Al concentrations in frontal cortex and cerebellum of the mice. Recognition memory was impaired in Tg2576 mice, whereas β-amyloid plaque depositions were observed in all these animals. However, Al did not alter the recognition memory and β-amyloid plaque loads of Tg2576 mice.",

Relative to trials enrolling exclusively based on low cerebrospinal fluid Aβ, trials including participants with a high ratio of phosphorylated tau to Aβ would include an additional 15% of participants. Fewer (34% to 62%) participants met criteria for Aβ and tau. Differences in clinical and demographic characteristics of modeled trial samples were minimal.

Broadening inclusion criteria beyond amyloid alone may facilitate recruitment but include patients showing slower progression over time. Biomarker criteria selection should be informed by the goal of enrolling individuals most likely to utilize and benefit from the intervention under investigation in a particular setting.",

    "abstract": "The overrepresentation of very old people (75 or older) in pedestrian crash statistics raises the issue of the effects of normal and pathologic ageing on gap-selection difficulties during street crossing. The present study focused on Alzheimer disease, a condition commonly associated with cognitive declines detrimental to daily life activities such as crossing the street. Twenty-five participants with mild dementia and 33 controls carried out a street-crossing task in a simulated environment. They also took a battery of cognitive tests. The mild-dementia group was more likely than the control group to make decisions that led to collisions with approaching cars, especially when the traffic was coming from 2 directions and they were in the far lane. Regression analyses demonstrated that the increased likelihood of collisions in the dementia group was associated with impairments in processing-speed and visual-attention abilities assessed on the Useful Field of View test. This test has already proven useful for predicting driving outcomes, falls, and street-crossing difficulties in healthy old adults, and among drivers with Alzheimer disease. Clinicians are encouraged to use it to help estimate whether a patient can drive, walk, and cross a street safely.",

    "abstract": "Background: Changes in neuropsychological testing, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid may precede mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, these markers are not routinely performed in outpatient clinical visits. Objective: To evaluate whether a simple clinical index, consisting of questions given to patients and their informants, could predict the onset of symptoms of MCI among cognitively normal individuals. Materials and Methods: Two hundred twenty-two participants in the BIOCARD study received a detailed history, physical examination, and neuropsychological testing annually. An index was calculated by including questions about memory problems, depression, age, education, history of cerebrovascular disease risk factors, and brain injury, family history of dementia, and the Mini-Mental State examination score. Cox regression analyses were used to determine if this index score was related to diagnosis of MCI. Results: The BIOCARD Index score mean for individuals who progressed to MCI was 20.3 (SD=2.9), whereas the score for individuals who remained normal was 24.8 (SD=2.3) ( P &lt;0.001) [hazard ratio, SE for subsequent diagnosis of MCI=0.75 (0.67 to 0.84); P &lt;0.001]. Conclusions: Lower BIOCARD Index score predicted symptoms of MCI several years before the MCI diagnosis. The BIOCARD Index can be easily used in clinics to identify cognitively normal older individuals who are at risk for deterioration.",

Birth state IMRs from 1928 were ranked into quartile (worst IMRs quartile range, whites: 69 to 129 deaths/1000 live births, Non-whites: 129 to 277 deaths/1000 live births). Cox proportional hazard models estimated the dementia risk associated with birth state IMR quartile adjusting for demographics and lifecourse health indicators.Compared with whites born outside of states in the worst IMR quartile, African Americans born in states in the worst IMR quartile had 92% increased dementia risk (HR=1.92; 95% CI: 1.42, 2.59), and African Americans born outside those states had 36% increased risk (HR=1.36; 95% CI: 1.20, 1.53). There was no association between birth state IMR and dementia risk among whites.Birth in states with the highest rates of infant mortality was associated with elevated dementia risk among African Americans but not whites. The large absolute difference in IMRs likely reflects harsher early childhood conditions experienced by African Americans. These findings suggest that childhood conditions may play a role in racial disparities in dementia rates.",

Design: This study was a retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort study. Setting: Six North American movement disorder clinics. Measurements: SCCs were elicited through a modified Neurobehavioral Inventory administered to patients and close contacts, a general complaint question, and Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale item question 1.1 administered to patients. Clinical evaluation, formal neuropsychological testing and Disability Assessment for Dementia were conducted in Ontario state. Agreement between SCCs eliciting methods was calculated. Associations between SCC, cognitive testing, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were assessed. Results: Of 139 participating nondemented PD patients, 42% had PD-MCI at baseline. Agreement between SCC eliciting methods was low. Neither patient-reported nor close contact-reported SCCs were associated with impaired baseline cognitive testing or PD-MCI nor were they associated with cognitive decline over time. In PD patients with normal baseline cognition, 26% of patients with 1-year follow-up and 20% of patients with 2-year follow-up met MCI criteria. Conclusions: Agreement between SCC eliciting methods is poor and no SCC method was associated with cognitive testing or decline over time. With no clear superior method for eliciting SCCs, clinicians should consider performing regular screening.",

The results show that the MMSE-2:SV had excellent discriminative ability in distinguishing older controls from patients with dementia, with cut-off scores of 26 and 27 (max=30) yielding appropriate sensitivity (0.810 and 0.924, respectively) and specificity (0.940 and 0.806). Discriminative power was close to good in distinguishing between older controls and patients with MCI. Here, however, no optimal cut-off point could be determined.

Little is known about the effects of these issues on clinical problems for those with moderate and severe dementia. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the associations of disturbed rest-activity rhythms and extended sleep duration with activities of daily living (ADL). Methods: Sleep parameters were measured using an actigraphy device. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination and Cognitive Test for Severe Dementia, the Hyogo Activities of Daily Living Scale was used to assess ADL, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home scale. Associations among rest-activity rhythms, sleep duration, and other clinical variables were analyzed with multiple linear regression. Clinical variables were compared between 2 groups categorized by onset timing of rest peak. Patients: Sixty-four participants with moderate and severe dementia were assessed. Results: In the correlation analysis, unstable daily rest-activity rhythm was associated with lower ADL. In the multiple linear regression analysis, low intradaily variability, and long daytime sleep duration were associated with low ADL. Aberrant rest peak timing showed lower ADL compared with nonaberrant timing. Conclusions: Abnormal rest-activity rhythm and sleep duration in persons with moderate and severe dementia may affect ADL.",

We used data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set to examine the frequency of informant replacement among Alzheimer disease dementia participants, whether patient and informant characteristics were associated with replacement, and how replacement affected research outcome measures. Informant replacement was common (15.5%) and typically occurred after the first or the second research visit. Adult child (24%) and other (38%) informants were more frequently replaced than spouse informants (10%). Older spouse informant age and younger adult child informant age were associated with replacement. The between-visit change in Functional Assessment Questionnaire scores was greater in patients who replaced informants than in those with stable informants. Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes, Functional Assessment Questionnaire, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores showed greater variability in between-visit change in patients who replaced informants compared with those with stable informants. These findings suggest that informant replacement is relatively common, may have implications to study analyses, and warrant further examination in the setting of clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is a common complex neurodegenerative disorder accounting for nearly 50% to 70% of dementias worldwide. Yet the current diagnostic options for AD are limited. New diagnostic innovation strategies focusing on novel molecules and pathways are sorely needed. In this connection, microRNAs (miRNAs) are conserved small noncoding RNAs that regulate posttranscriptional gene expression and are vital for neuronal development and its functional sustainability. Conceivably, biological pathways responsible for the biogenesis of miRNAs represent a veritable set of upstream candidate genes that can be potentially associated with the AD pathophysiology. Notably, whereas functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA biogenesis pathway genes have been studied in other complex diseases, surprisingly, virtually no such study has been conducted on their relevance in AD. Moreover, novel diagnostics identified in easily accessible peripheral tissues such as the whole blood samples represent the initial entry or gateway points on the biomarker discovery critical path for AD. To the best of our knowledge, we report here the first association study of functional SNPs, as measured by real-time PCR in 10 \"upstream\" candidate genes critically situated on the miRNA biogenesis pathway, in a large sample of AD patients (N=172) and healthy controls (N=109) in a hitherto understudied world population from the Mersin region of the Eastern Mediterranean. We observed a significant association between 2 candidate genes and AD, TARBP2 rs784567 genotype and AD (χ=6.292, P=0.043), and a trend for RNASEN rs10719 genotype (χ=4.528, P=0.104) and allele (P=0.035). Functional SNP variations in the other 8 candidate genes (DGCR8, XPO5, RAN, DICER1, AGO1, AGO2, GEMIN3, and GEMIN4) did not associate with AD in our sample. Given the putative biological importance of miRNA biogenesis pathways, these emerging data can provide a new foundation to stimulate future debate and genetic investigations of AD, focusing on new molecular mechanisms such as miRNA biogenesis, particularly in accessible peripheral tissues for novel molecular diagnostics for dementia.",

In a population-based study on 3745 nondemented individuals aged 45 years and above, we investigated the relationship between cerebellar volume and cognitive function.Brain volumes were obtained using automatic tissue segmentation of magnetic resonance imaging scans. Cognitive functioning was assessed using MMSE and cognitive compound scores of global cognition, executive function, information processing speed, memory, and motor speed. Linear regression modeling was used to study the associations between cerebellar volumes and cognitive measures, independent of cerebral volumes.We found a relationship between larger cerebellar volume and better global cognition, executive function, information processing speed, and motor speed. After adjustment for cerebral volume, only cerebellar gray matter volume remained borderline significantly associated with global cognition and information processing speed. After Bonferroni correction, the few associations found between cerebellar volume and cognition disappeared.We only found a minor relationship between larger cerebellar volume and better cognition in healthy older adults, which further attenuated after correcting for cerebral volume. Our findings support the notion that cerebellar volume has an influence on cognition in aging, but that it is not the major leading structure.",

C-TOC version 4 was then validated against neuropsychological tests (NPTs), and by comparing performance scores of subjects with normal cognition, Cognitive Impairment Not Dementia (CIND) and Alzheimer disease. C-TOC's language tests were validated in subjects with aphasic disorders.The most important usability issue that emerged from consultations with 27 older adults and with 8 cultural advisors was the test-takers' understanding of the task, particularly executive function tasks. User interface features did not pose significant problems. C-TOC version 4 tests correlated with comparator NPT (r=0.4 to 0.7). C-TOC test scores were normal (n=16)>CIND (n=16)>Alzheimer disease (n=6). All normal/CIND NPT performance differences were detected on C-TOC. Low computer knowledge adversely affected test performance, particularly in CIND. C-TOC detected impairments in aphasic disorders (n=11).In general, C-TOC had good validity in detecting cognitive impairment.

Methods: An anonymous survey querying clinical use of diagnostic tests/biomarkers was sent to 38 center of excellence investigators. The survey included “indicative” biomarkers (dopamine transporter scan, myocardial scintigraphy, polysomnography), “supportive” biomarkers [magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)], positron emission tomography, or single-photon emission computed tomography perfusion/metabolism scans, quantitative electroencephalography), and other diagnostic tests (neuropsychological testing, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, genetics). Responses were analyzed descriptively. Results: Of the 22 respondents (58%), all reported the capability to perform neuropsychological testing, MRI, polysomnography, dopamine transporter scans, positron emission tomography/single-photon emission computed tomography scans, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis; 96% could order genetic testing. Neuropsychological testing and MRI were the most commonly ordered tests. Diagnostic testing beyond MRI and neuropsychological testing was most helpful in the context of “possible” DLB and mild cognitive impairment and to assist with differential diagnosis. Myocardial scintigraphy and electroencephalograpy use were rare. Conclusions and Relevance: Neuropsychological testing and MRI remain the most widely used diagnostic tests by DLB specialists. Other tests—particularly indicative biomarkers—are used only selectively. Research is needed to validate existing potential DLB biomarkers, develop new biomarkers, and investigate mechanisms to improve DLB diagnosis.",

Physical function measures (per SD) were associated with cognitive test z-scores in linear regression models adjusted for demographic, behavioral, and clinical factors. Racial/ethnic differences were tested using interaction terms and stratification. Results: Stronger grip was associated with better executive function [β=0.10 (95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.15)], semantic memory [β=0.13 (0.09-0.18)] and verbal episodic memory [β=0.07 (0.02-0.13)] with no racial/ethnic differences. Faster gait was associated with better executive function [β=0.29 (0.22-0.36)], semantic memory [β=0.23 (0.16-0.30)], and verbal episodic memory [β=0.20 (0.13-0.27)]; however, the association between gait speed and executive function varied by race/ethnicity with the strongest associations in Asians and Whites. Conclusion: Across race/ethnicity, grip strength and gait speed were associated with cognition with racial/ethnic differences in the association of gait speed and executive function.",

This review evaluates the efficacy and specific adaptations of CBT in persons with mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Methods: A literature search of PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO was conducted up to March 2020. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias criteria. Results: Twelve publications were identified. Seven of the studies demonstrated CBT efficacy to improve depression, anxiety, and/or quality of life. One study’s positive postintervention outcome became insignificant with longer term follow up. Two of the studies improved sleep outcomes. Four studies integrated caregivers into intervention delivery. Three studies utilized content, memory, and adherence adaptations aimed to improve intervention efficacy. Two studies included adaptations to address caregiver burden and depression. Conclusion: There is strong evidence to suggest that CBT is associated with improvements in anxiety, depression, and quality of life in persons with mild cognitive impairment and dementia. CBT showed a reduction in insomnia and improvements in sleep quality. However, there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the effects of CBT on insomnia. These results suggest that further investigation into insomnia outcomes is needed.",

Methods: We used an Anticholinergic Rating (ACR) scale, Clinical Dementia Rating, APOE genotype, and number of prescription medications. We examined time to incident MCI and incident dementia in a population-based cohort (n=1959). We assessed whether developing MCI or dementia was associated with (1) any anticholinergic drug use, (2) total ACR score, or (3) number of anticholinergic drugs taken. Results: Taking any anticholinergic drug was significantly associated with higher risk of developing MCI; however, higher ACR score or higher number of anticholinergic drugs, compared with lower, were not associated with greater risk of developing MCI. We found no significant relationship between anticholinergic use and developing dementia. The relationship between anticholinergic use and cognitive outcome was not affected by APOE genotype. Conclusions: Among cognitively normal older adults in a population-based sample, anticholinergic drug use is independently associated with subsequently developing MCI, but not dementia. Thus, anticholinergic drug use may influence risk of MCI that is nonprogressive to dementia and potentially be a modifiable risk factor for MCI.",

The resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging combined with memory scales assessment were performed before and after the intervention. To elucidate the therapeutic mechanism of rTMS, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and functional connectivity were calculated. The Pearson correlation was used to measure the relationship between ALFF and memory performance.Compared with the sham group, ALFF significantly increased in the right insula, right inferior frontal gyrus-opercular part, and decreased in the left middle occipital gyrus, left angular gyrus, and left lingual gyrus after rTMS. The change in Auditory Verbal Learning Test scores were negatively correlated with ALFF decreases in the left lingual gyrus. Functional connectivity significantly increased between the posterior cingulate cortex and right supramarginal gyrus, and decreased between the right frontoinsular cortex and right supramarginal gyrus after intervention.High-frequency rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex could facilitate improvement on impaired memory in patients with MCI via modulating the neuronal activity and brain network.",

The purpose of this review is to characterize the psychiatric phenotype (specifically with respect to psychosis) of PSEN1 and PSEN2 variant-associated AD. A PubMed search was completed in July 2023. Only articles that described individuals harboring a PSEN1 or PSEN2 mutation who experienced symptoms of psychosis were included in the review. Thirty-three articles describing 52 individuals were included in the review, as well as one other study that provided limited information pertaining to an additional 21 cases. While visual hallucinations were the most common psychotic symptom, followed by persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations occurred in ~17% of individuals. In ~33% of the reviewed cases psychotic symptoms were present at or near disease onset, and 9 of these individuals experienced auditory hallucinations and/or delusions in the absence of visual hallucinations (~17% of all cases). In many cases, symptoms developed at a relatively young age. As presenilin gene variant-associated psychosis may resemble a primary psychotic disorder, clinicians should be vigilant with respect to screening for signs/symptoms suggestive of neurodegeneration in first-episode psychosis.",

To identify areas for improvement in early AD management, dementia specialists convened in a virtual roundtable meeting. Methodology: A modified version of the nominal group technique was followed to prioritize specific topics and allow experts to provide their opinions. The overarching topics prioritized and discussed were (1) education and support for primary care physicians on cognitive assessment, detection of mild cognitive impairment, and patient monitoring; (2) nonpharmacological interventions; (3) and the introduction of disease-modifying therapies. Conclusions: Consensus was achieved regarding the need for educating primary care physicians on identifying people with cognitive impairment and for better diagnostic tools for its detection and early management. Management of mild cognitive impairment due to AD should encompass an adequate follow-up schedule aiming to maintain function for as long as possible, and primary care physicians and patients should be aware of the benefits of nonpharmacological interventions.",

Out of a total of 239 patients with cognitive impairment, 155 with positive amyloid-PET results were included. Among these, 43 had early-onset ADCI (EOADCI) and 112 had late-onset ADCI (LOADCI). Patients with LOADCI exhibited a higher prevalence of hypertension, lacunes, white matter hyperintensities, and BG-ePVS than those with EOADCI. BG-ePVS showed a significant correlation with age at the onset and the number of lacunes, whereas CSO-ePVS did not exhibit any association. The higher prevalence of BG-ePVS in patients with LOADCI might be attributable to vascular risk factors (hypertension) and cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). These findings support the hypothesis that BG-ePVS is associated with CSVD and vascular risk factors, whereas CSO-ePVS is associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy.",

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFRβ) is a biomarker of BBB pericyte injury and has been implicated in cognitive impairment and AD. Methods: We aimed to study CSF PDGFRβ protein levels, along with CSF biomarkers of brain amyloidosis and tau pathology in a well-characterized population of cognitively unimpaired individuals and correlated CSF findings with amyloid-PET positivity. We performed an institutional review board (IRB)-approved cross-sectional analysis of a prospectively enrolled cohort of 36 cognitively normal volunteers with available CSF, Pittsburgh compound B PET/CT, Mini-Mental State Exam score, Global Deterioration Scale, and known apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) ε4 status. Results: Thirty-six subjects were included. Mean age was 63.3 years; 31 of 36 were female, 6 of 36 were amyloid-PET-positive and 12 of 36 were APOE ε4 carriers. We found a moderate positive correlation between CSF PDGFRβ and both total Tau (r=0.45, P =0.006) and phosphorylated Tau 181 (r=0.51, P =0.002). CSF PDGFRβ levels were not associated with either the CSF Aβ42 or the amyloid-PET. Conclusions: We demonstrated a moderate positive correlation between PDGFRβ and both total Tau and phosphorylated Tau 181 in cognitively normal individuals. Our data support the hypothesis that BBB dysfunction represents an important early pathophysiologic step in AD, warranting larger prospective studies.

Patients: We convened 13 experts from different disciplines (neurology, psychiatry, psychology, pharmacy, palliative care, hospice, nursing, social work, primary care, geriatrics, and professional home caregivers) to identify elements of LEs. Results: Experts provided a range of opinions on medical and clinical explanations and questions to understand LEs. Consensus on LEs when presented with clinical vignettes was not reached. Panelists highlighted key medical and contextual factors needed to make a definitive judgement about LEs. Conclusion: There is variability in how LEs are interpreted by clinical experts, which complicates the identification of LEs in Alzheimer disease and related dementias.",

Methods: Using a structured search, we conducted a systematic scoping review of relevant published journal articles across 5 databases. Study titles/abstracts and selected full-text articles were screened by 2 investigators in Covidence systematic review software. Articles were excluded if they were not about clinical communication, focused only on caregiver–patient communication or communication in residential care, were interventional, lacked empirical data, or were not in English. Extracted data were documented using Google Forms. Results: The study team screened 3426 article titles and abstracts and 112 full-text articles. Forty-four articles were included in the final review. Results were categorized by 3 communication scenarios: diagnostic communication (n=22), general communication (n=16), and advanced care planning communication (n=6). Conclusions and Relevance: Across the included articles, the conceptualization and assessment of communication lacked homogeneity. Future directions include addressing these research gaps, establishing recommendations for clinicians to effectively communicate with individuals with dementia and caregivers, and creating and testing communication skills trainings for caregivers/family members, clinicians, and/or individuals with dementia to facilitate effective communication.",

Results: Totally, 711 family members/partners (mean age=58.7 y, SD=12.5; females=81.3%) of patients (mean age=81.6, SD=9.6; females=66.9) with dementia completed the FROM-16. The FROM-16 mean total score was 17.5 (SD=6.8), meaning “a very large effect” on QoL of family members, with females being more adversely impacted. Conclusions: Dementia profoundly impacts the QoL of family members/partners of patients. Routine use of FROM-16 could signpost provision of care support, reducing family members’ burnout. Such routine data could be used in economic analysis of the burden of dementia as well as in predicting institutionalization.",

    "abstract": "Summary: Dementia is common among patients with cerebrovascular disease, particularly in a setting of one or more clinically evident strokes. Prior cohort and case studies have suggested that the cognitive syndrome of vascular dementia is characterized by predominant executive dysfunction, in contrast to the deficits in memory and language function that are typical of patients with Alzheimer disease. The course of cognitive decline may also differ between those dementia subtypes, with many, but not all, patients with vascular dementia exhibiting a stepwise course of decline caused by recurrent stroke and most patients with Alzheimer disease exhibiting a gradually progressive course of decline. The findings of prior studies of the cognitive syndrome of vascular dementia must be interpreted with caution, however, because of (1) possible inaccuracies in the determination of the dementia subtype and the loss of precision that might result from pooling heterogeneous subgroups of patients with vascular dementia, (2) difficulties inherent in identifying a pattern of strengths and weaknesses in patients who are required to have memory impairment and other deficits to meet operationalized criteria for dementia, and (3) the use of limited test batteries whose psychometric properties are incompletely understood. Specific questions that should be addressed by future studies are discussed.",

We asked the directors of the 29 U.S. research centers funded by the National Institute on Aging as \"Alzheimer Disease Centers\" to provide us with policies or guidelines used in their centers or associated institutions with regard to research involving cognitively impaired subjects. Twenty-four of the 29 centers (83%) responded. Five institutions (21%) had authored their own institutional policies, seven (29%) used guidelines issued by the Department of Health and Human Service's Office for Protection from Research Risks, and 12 (50%) had no policy or guidelines. The five institutional policies addressed a variety of issues, including obtaining consent from cognitively impaired subjects or their authorized representatives, subjects' assent to research participation, and guidance concerning determination of subjects' intellectual capacity. A well-written policy on the protection of cognitively impaired research subjects is one way a research institution demonstrates that it gives serious attention to the rights and welfare of these vulnerable persons. We recommend that all institutions conducting such research author written policies articulating appropriate safeguards for these vulnerable subjects. To promote the protection of cognitively impaired subjects, federal agencies and other funding groups may want to consider requiring written institutional policies as one condition of receiving funds to conduct such research.",

    "abstract": "The NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for the clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer disease (AD) state that \"gait disturbances at the onset or very early in the course of the illness make the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease uncertain or unlikely,\" yet there have been few studies documenting the validity of the statement. We therefore reviewed all cases of pure autopsy-proven AD in the Ramsey Brain Bank to determine how frequently an abnormal gait was noted at time of presentation. Any reported gait disturbance was considered an abnormal gait. Only cases for which medical records were available documenting the patient's presentation for dementia were included. Cases were excluded if any other pathology was present that may have contributed to the patient's dementia or to a gait disorder, if neuroleptic medication had been used, or if there was a preexisting gait disorder. Clinical dementia severity at time of presentation was graded as mild, moderate, or severe per DSM-IIIR criteria. Of the 95 cases that met study criteria, none of the 36 patients with mild dementia were reported to have had an abnormal gait. Sixteen percent of the patients with moderate and 32% with severe dementia had gait abnormalities reported. This study confirms the statement regarding gait in the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria.",

The frequencies of the disturbance were assessed by using the Troublesome Behavior Scale according to its three categories, agitation, hyperactivity, and miscellaneous. The patients' characteristics found to contribute most to their own behavioral disturbances were visual and speech function, activities of daily living, years of education, cognitive function, and sex, whereas the caregivers' characteristics contributing to these disturbances were duration of caregiving, age of caregiver, and relationship to the patient. In addition, a mutual relation among the three categories was found. Among the three categories, agitation was most strongly related to the caregivers' psychologic health status rated by use of the General Health Questionnaire. Behavioral disturbance as a whole was the only predictor of the patient's institutionalization within 2 years after baseline examination. Thus, behavioral disturbances were found to be influenced by the personal characteristics and situational circumstances of both the patient and caregiver, influencing, in turn, the caregivers' psychologic health status.",

    "abstract": "Clinical Alzheimer disease (AD) is a heterogeneous disorder, and it is possible to subgroup patients by a number of different criteria. One such subgrouping is those who have a positive response to cholinergic therapy and those who do not. This phenomenon has been clearly recognised in a number of therapeutic trials of cholinesterase inhibitors and is likely to be an issue in clinical practice. Tacrine, the first cholinesterase inhibitor to be approved for the treatment of AD, has, at best, modest effects on 20–50% of patients and is associated with a high frequency of side effects, including liver transaminitis. The potential of clinical tests or other investigations to identify those patients who are more likely to respond to cholinergic therapy would be a valuable aid in the clinical use of these therapies. In this article we review the issue of heterogeneity in patient populations, in the design of trials and in the pharmacological compounds used in trials. We then summarise the findings of a number of small studies of potential response predictors, which include the use of psychometric tests, orthostatic blood pressure, pupillary dilation, the electroencephalogram, cerebrospinal fluid neurochemistry, and techniques involving functional imaging. Although some results are promising, generalisability is limited by the small numbers of patients studied and the frequent open nature of the designs used. The main conclusion that can be drawn is that adequate doses are required to achieve therapeutic plasma levels before nonresponse is accepted.",

Young, aged adults, and patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) were tested on a delay response task measuring spatial memory that also placed high demands on attentional resources. Aged adults performed as well as young, suggesting that neither attentional nor memory abilities were exceeded in either group. However, AD subjects were severely impaired on this task. Two further experiments with AD patients examined the relative contribution of attentional and memory deficits in the performance of this population. Both memory and attentional impairments were found; however, errors due to memory factors were more closely related to severity of disease as measured on the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination than were errors of attentional origin. These studies demonstrate the necessity of accounting for attentional components in studies examining memory, especially in patients with AD.",

    "abstract": "The Second International Pharmacoeconomic Conference on Alzheimer's Disease was held in Stockholm, Sweden, on April 4, 2000. The presentations focused on the role of cognition in pharmacoeconomic evaluations, the costs and consequences of behavioral disturbances, quality of life, disease progression models, and methods for valuing informal care. The results from individual studies will be published separately. Cognition has been used as the sole measure of disease severity in economic evaluations in dementia. However, behavioral disturbances are an important determinant of both cost and quality of life and should also be considered when appraising the effect of treatment. Quality-of-life assessment constitutes a single measure of the total impact of the disease, as well as a way of quantifying the benefits of treatment with antidementia drugs so that they can be compared with interventions in other disease areas. Measuring the quality of life of patients with dementia is associated with methodologic difficulties related to the difficulties for some patients in completing usual assessment processes. Disease progression models may be helpful in extrapolating the results from clinical trials to longer time periods and more representative populations. Modeling is an unavoidable part of the economic evaluation of antidementia drugs, and efforts should be made to increase transparency and comparability among models. Informal care constitutes a large percentage of the total care for patients with dementia, and the valuation of these services has a large impact on the results of pharmacoeconomic evaluations. Difficulties lie in quantifying the time spent on caring for the elderly and in attaching the correct price to each unit of time. The contingent valuation method is an alternative way of valuing informal care that so far has not been used in the field of dementia.",

    "abstract": "The rapid increase of ethnically diverse late onset dementia-affected persons is bringing a special urgency to Alzheimer disease and associated disorders research. By this decade's end, non-European heritage ethnically diverse persons will account for 25% of the dementia-affected cohort and 33% by mid-century. These populations have received some attention in both dementia-focused basic biomedical and social-behavioral research. However, studies differ greatly with regard to the constructs of culture used, the methodologies used, and representativeness of the populations sampled. Moreover, social status factors are often confounded with cultural variables. Therefore, several clarifying research approaches are suggested. In biomedical research, categorically ascribed (US census type) definitions, or assumed (self-reported) ethnic group designators will not suffice where actual biophysiological sampling precision is needed. A strategy for the phenotypic sampling of cohorts is therefore suggested for this research domain. In social-behavioral research, the acceptance of a common operational definition of culture is urged. And, with reference to a specific social status confound, namely literacy, a neuroimaging research strategy is proposed to determine whether non-literates might not be misclassified relative to the determination of their actual cognitive functioning status. Additionally, two conceptual models for addressing within group heterogeneity and acculturation factors are briefly presented.",

After at least 2 years, dementia may develop, but the aphasia predominates. Few families with hereditary PPA have been reported; some have autosomal dominance. A chromosome 17 mutation in tau exon 13 has been found in one family, and a few have linkage to chromosome 17. However, early appearance of prominent memory, behavior, and motor impairments differentiates these patients from typical PPA. The objective was to report clinical features, pathology, and genetic analysis of a family with typical PPA. We report three siblings with the typical clinical syndrome of PPA. Each presented with word-finding difficulties and early anomia. Ages at onset were 60, 61, and 65 years. Aphasia was the only symptom for at least 2 years. A nonaffected brother is 75 years of age. Family history review found no other affected relatives. Neuropathology in one patient demonstrated \"dementia lacking distinctive histopathology\" with ubiquitin-positive cortical neurons. DNA analysis of the proband did not detect any known mutation in tau exons 1-5, 7, or 9-13. To our knowledge, this is the first family presenting with hereditary aphasia in which typical PPA occurs in all affected members.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment, a core feature of Alzheimer disease (AD), is highly correlated with functional decline and caregiver time. Over 12 months, patients with mild-to-moderate AD deteriorate by 5-6 points from baseline on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). Stabilizing cognitive decline is, therefore, an important treatment outcome in AD. Cognitive deficits are thought to result in part from central cholinergic impairment, which provides the rationale for the enhancement of cholinergic neurotransmission as a treatment approach for AD. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition has, to date, produced the most promising outcomes in clinical trials. Galantamine appears to be novel among marketed agents in that it inhibits AChE and modulates cholinergic nicotinic receptors, perhaps increasing neurotransmission via both mechanisms. Long-term effects of AChE inhibitors and galantamine on ADAS-cog scores of patients with mild-to-moderate AD have been studied in placebo controlled trials as well as open-extension studies that followed randomized, double-blind studies for up to 6 months. Conventional AChE inhibitors (rivastigmine and donepezil) have maintained ADAS-cog baseline scores for up to 40 weeks in open extension studies, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores for up to 52 weeks in a placebo-controlled study. The mean ADAS-cog score of galantamine-treated patients did not change from baseline at 12 months (6 months double-blind study followed by 6 months open-label extension), suggesting that cognitive function had been maintained. These results suggest that cholinergic treatments, including galantamine, may stabilize cognitive decline of AD patients. This outcome is likely to make an important difference to patients and caregivers.",

    "abstract": "Summary: In Alzheimer disease (AD) the \"primum movens\" is amyloid (AM) production within the cerebral cortex. Cerebral AM alone may be asymptomatic. Clinical symptoms (amnesia, instrumental disorders) appear when AM induces neighboring neuritic alterations: paired hellical filaments (PHF), and distant neuronal body lesions: neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), i.e. pathologic synthesis of abnormal proteins. The timing for these inductions should be equal to the survival after the onset of amnesia: a mean of 14 months for the induction of the peri-AM neuritic alterations and a mean of 52 months for the induction of the distant to AM NFT in the hippocampic neuronal bodies. We postulate that the AM induces this neuronal pathology by producing functional zinc deficiency. The hippocampal zinc decreases in AD. The mechanism of the AM-induced zinc deficiency may be the following: the AM is formed within the walls of capillaries (senile plaques), disturbs the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and toxic metals (i.e., iron, aluminum, mercury) may enter in the cerebral cortex, where they displace the zinc in some enzymes. NFT and neuronal dysfunction may be produced by deficiency of the following zinc enzymes: (a) those of DNA metabolism, inducing abnormal DNA in the neurons and therefore abnormal protein synthesis, PHF-NFT; (b) those of glutamate (GLU) dehydrogenase (which catabolizes GLU), resulting in an excitotoxic increase of GLU; (c) those of neuronal detoxification, superoxydedismutase, carbonic anhydrase, and lactate dehydrogenase leading to neuronal toxicity. During the window between AM formation and PHF-NFT production (14-52 months), a zinc complex crossing the BBB may be useful to prevent AM of producing PHF-NFT, and also to normalize neuronal detoxification. By the zinc treatment, AM should remain asymptomatic and clinical dementia should be prevented.",

Early-onset AD is characterized by shorter survival, more rapid cognitive deterioration, greater frequency of language disturbance, more severe and widespread neurochemical abnormalities, and a greater density of neurohistologic lesions. In addition, both the chromosome 14 genetic abnormality and chromosome 21 amyloid precursor protein mutations appear restricted to early-onset familial AD. Age of onset of AD subjects may be relevant to the design of clinical trials. For example, the efficacy of a drug that slows disease progression may be more easily demonstrated in subjects with early-onset disease.",

Thirty patients with probable Alzheimer disease as well as 22 elderly controls underwent quantitative proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of parietal gray and white matter with use of a short-echo time localization technique (echo time, 20 ms; repetition times, 6,000 and 3,000 ms, 2.0 Tesla) providing access to the regional concentrations of N-acetylaspartate, creatine, choline-containing compounds, myo-inositol, glutamate, glutamine, and lactate. No statistically significant alterations of the metabolites were found in patients relative to controls. There were also no differences between patients with early and late onset of the disease and with respect to the presence of APOE-ε4 phenotype. A general trend for slightly decreased levels of N-acetylaspartate and creatine was not observed for their respective concentration ratios. In summary, the spectroscopic findings were in accord with known Alzheimer disease neuropathology, i.e., mild gliosis in white matter as well as mildly enhanced cortical atrophy in comparison to elderly controls. However, cortical atrophy with little or no N-acetylaspartate changes provided no evidence for a major decrease of neuronal density or loss of viable neurons. The data do not support the utility of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy as an early diagnostic tool for Alzheimer disease.",

The features of hospice that were most important to caregivers were continued follow-up evaluation by the patient's primary care provider and hospice's emphasis on helping patients to avoid hospital admission. The least important was the availability of a chaplain. There was moderate agreement between the importance of various hospice features to caregivers, and the representation of that feature in hospice promotional materials.

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to describe the evolution of dementia severity in a very old dementia population. We investigated a representative group of demented subjects gathered from a population-based study (n = 223). Changes in cognition, functioning, and performance on global scales were followed over a period of 7 years. At baseline, 19% of the demented subjects were found to be severely impaired according to the Clinical Dementia Rating scale, 41% according to the Mini-Mental State Examination score, and 31% according to Katz activities of daily living scale. After 7 years these proportions were 78%, 93%, and 68%, respectively. The probability of surviving 3 years, 5 years, and 7 years after baseline examination was 48%, 28%, and 15%, respectively. Over a 7-year follow-up period, subjects suffering from questionable-mild dementia had a mean survival of 3.9 years (95% confidence interval 3.3-4.5), whereas subjects with severe dementia survived on average 2.9 years (95% confidence interval 2.5-3.2). Male gender, lower education, and poor cognitive and functional status were associated with shorter survival in milder cases, whereas the only factors that predicted shorter survival in more severe cases were older age and poor functional status. Long-term survivors in dementia are not rare, and as the absolute number of demented people is increasing, expanding our knowledge of these persons is of high public health importance.",

Advances in biological research are beginning to pay off with both short-term and long-term strategies for the development of more effective medications. Short-term strategies are aimed at treating the primary cognitive symptoms in AD as well as the secondary behavioral disturbances that occur frequently. Short-term strategies include drugs that act on cholinergic systems, including muscarinic agonists and cholinesterase inhibitors, to improve memory and perhaps attention. Drugs that act through bioaminergic systems may be useful in treating the behavioral symptoms. Long-term strategies for drug development are focusing on medications that may slow the progression of the disease. Growth factors and drugs that may act through other mechanisms to prevent alterations in cell metabolism offer the hope of actually preventing neural degeneration",

    "abstract": "Summary: Multi-infarct dementia (MID) is commonly considered a dementia syndrome evolving in connection with multiple ischemic brain lesions, without other changes known to cause dementia. The ischemic brain lesions result from various vascular mechanisms, and different brain mechanisms are involved in the genesis of MID. Typical features for MID are abrupt onset of cognitive symptoms, stepwise deterioration of mental functioning, and focal neurologic symptoms or signs, but in 20% of cases the onset is insidious and the course is even. The main steps in diagnosis of MID include diagnosis of dementia, diagnosis of specific causes of dementia and secondary factors potentially aggravating cognitive decline, and demonstration of ischemic brain changes assumed to be responsible for the evolution of dementia. Methods used for clinical diagnosis of MID include clinical history and examination, brain imaging, ischemic scores, neurophysiologic investigations, and a variety of laboratory investigations designed to detect concomitant illness. According to strict clinical criteria for MID, the accuracy of the antemortem diagnosis as verified postmortem in one series was ˜90%.",

If this is the case, the enhanced apoptosis may be due to components in the patients' sera or to an increased sensitivity of the cells to apoptotic stimuli. To examine this possibility, the percentage of apoptotic cells in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 12 patients with Alzheimer disease was compared with that of 12 age-matched non-demented persons and 12 middle-aged healthy control subjects. In addition, the effect of sera from subjects in the three groups on the apoptosis, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α production by peripheral blood cells from healthy control subjects was examined. It was found that the percentage of apoptotic PBMC from patients with Alzheimer disease was higher than that from the remaining two groups. However, incubation of control cells with sera from patients with Alzheimer disease and non-demented elderly persons did not affect the number of apoptotic cells. Sera from patients with Alzheimer disease and non-demented elderly subjects caused an increase in IL-2 and a decrease in IL-10 production by PBMC from middle-aged control subjects but did not affect IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα secretion, indicating alterations of the immune system related to aging.",

Sensitivity of the assay was verified by the detection of HSV-1 nucleic acids in neurons of trigeminal ganglia taken from cases of AD and normal controls. This indicated that the hybridization reaction was sufficiently sensitive to detect latent HSV-1 infections. Positive hybridization in the brain was only detected in a confirmed case of herpes simplex virus encephalitis. These results appear to confirm previous reports that HSV-1 infection is not directly involved in the pathology associated with AD.",

    "abstract": "The characterization of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is complicated and not widely recognized. Connected language measures (ie, discourse) and functional neuroimaging may advance knowledge specifying early distinctions among frontal dementias. The present study examined the correspondence of discourse measures with (1) clinical diagnosis and (2) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. Nineteen subjects were selected from Alzheimer's Disease Center (ADC) participants if they were diagnosed with early-stage frontotemporal lobar degeneration and also underwent single photon emission computed tomography and discourse evaluation. First, clinical diagnoses given by specialists at an Alzheimer's Disease Center were compared with the discourse-based diagnostic profiles. Secondly, compromised brain regions that were predicted from discourse profiles were compared with SPECT findings. Results revealed a significant correspondence between the ADC diagnosis and the discourse-based diagnoses. Also, the discourse profiles across frontotemporal lobar degeneration subtypes were consistently associated with distinctive patterns of SPECT hypometabolism in the right frontal, left frontal, or left temporal lobes. These findings suggest that discourse methods may be systematized to provide an efficient adjunct measure beyond the traditional word and sentential level measures. Objectifying complex language performance may contribute to early detection and differentiation among frontotemporal lobar degeneration variants because consensus in the literature states that language is a core disturbance of frontotemporal lobar degeneration.",

A continuous recognition paradigm was used, in which subjects were instructed to identify the repeated faces in an ongoing series of faces presented on a video monitor screen. A signal detection analysis of the data revealed that the DAT patients were markedly impaired in their ability to discriminate between new and repeated faces. Multiple presentations of faces improved the recognition accuracy of the early DAT patients only, but their rate of learning was slower than that of the normal subjects. In comparison to the young normals, elderly normals exhibited a mild deficit in recognition memory. All of the elderly subject groups exhibited a more liberal response bias than the young normals, which eliminates the possibility that the impaired memory task performance of the aged subjects could be attributed to a more conservative test-taking strategy. The DAT patients exhibited impaired recognition even when the second presentation of a face immediately followed the first, which perhaps implies that task performance was also sensitive to the effect of DAT on visuoperceptual abilities or psychomotor speed.",

    "abstract": "When patients with severe dementia become acutely ill, little is known about the extent to which physicians take actions intended to hasten death. For 143 nursing home patients with dementia who died of pneumonia after a decision not to treat with antibiotics, we asked Dutch facility-employed physicians whether they intended to hasten death and any estimated life shortening. In 53% of cases, the physicians reported an explicit intention to hasten death; in another 41% of cases they reported taking into account a probability or certainty that the withholding of antibiotics or other palliative treatments would hasten death. Opiates were frequently used for symptom control (43%), but the administration of medications specifically intended to induce death was rare (2%). Considering all treatments, physicians estimated that life was shortened by 24 hours or less in 46% of patients and 1 month or longer in 24% of patients. The frequent withholding of antibiotics with an intention to hasten death may reflect a willingness to abandon a cure-oriented approach in dying patients for whom prolongation of life is not an aim. The results reflect the importance of explicit goals for medical interventions in patients with end-stage dementia where life-prolonging treatments may be seen as prolonging suffering.",

Similarly the pathology should be regarded as a spectrum even though histological varieties are distinguished. More than half of FTD pathology is associated with ubiquitin positive and tau negative inclusions that are common in ALS. However the majority of FTD cases do not have ALS clinically and relatively few ALS cases develop FTD. The pathological and biochemical varieties can be dichotomized as tau positive and tau negative pathology and biochemistry. The genetics of the tau positive variety is associated with tau mutations and so far the tau negative variety is not, although some are linked to chromosome-17 also. There is a corresponding clinical dichotomy combining the behavioral variety of FTD presentation with semantic dementia and usually ubiquitin positive tau negative pathology on one hand and the association of primary progressive aphasia and cortical basal degeneration/PSP syndrome with tau positive pathology on the other. The overlap between them is too great to establish two separate diseases.",

Although the exact cause(s) of neurodegeneration in AD is uncertain, strong candidates are β-amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) within neurons. VaD arises as a consequence of ischemic insults such as hemorrhage and hypoperfusion that trigger neurodegeneration by depriving the cells of oxygen and glucose. The initial insults in AD and VaD result in regional differences in the pattern of neurodegeneration, with cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons being particularly vulnerable in AD, and neurons of whatever neurochemical phenotype close to the vascular insult being more at risk of death in VaD. Although the initial trigger of neurodegeneration and the population of neurons affected differ in AD and VaD, there is considerable overlap in the downstream pathways that mediate cell death. As a consequence there are, therefore, a number of levels in the cytotoxic pathway common to AD and VaD at which a neuroprotective agent might be targeted.",

To explore whether APPr values at baseline may predict the rate of cognitive decline, we evaluated patients with mild AD before and after 1 year of treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.

We examined the association between serum potassium and the biologic marker cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta (Aβ42), which is decreased in Alzheimer disease patients. Psychiatric examinations, laboratory and other tests were conducted on a population-based sample of 1080 women aged 46 to 60 in 1968, with follow-ups in 1974, 1980, and 1992. In 1992, cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 levels were obtained from 81 women. Increasing serum potassium in 1968 was associated with increasing cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 (beta = 153.9, P = 0.041) in 1992 using age-adjusted linear regression. Compared with the lowest tertile of potassium, the middle (beta = 95.3, P = 0.138) and highest tertiles (beta = 193.5, P = 0.004) had incrementally increased cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 levels. Associations remained after controlling for blood pressure and other factors, and were similar among the 17 women in 1974 with available serum potassium. Potassium in 1980 and 1992 was not associated with cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42. Findings suggest low serum potassium in mid life, but not late life, is associated with low cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 levels in late life. It is possible potassium co-varies with another variable that is associated with cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42. Nonetheless, serum potassium is a modifiable risk factor and further examination of the potassium-dementia relationship is warranted.",

We describe an iterative process for the development and formative evaluation of a questionnaire about dementia knowledge and screening behaviors in older adults to understand the psychosocial factors underlying intention to obtain dementia screening to profile individuals manifesting intention to undergo dementia screening compared to those who will not. The Behavioral Model of Health Services Use was used as a conceptual framework for a questionnaire with constructs from the Health Belief Model, Theory of Reasoned Action and Self-Efficacy. After pretesting, we used a random dialing strategy to test our questionnaire on a final sample of 1024 older Missourians. Internal consistency and construct validity were examined. Pretesting identified several potential problems that were improved with rewording. Cronbach α was greater than 0.6 (range 0.62 to 0.92) in all but one construct testing dementia knowledge, suggesting good to excellent internal consistency. Convergent (construct) validity was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis. All constructs but 3 demonstrated good validity. Addressing these issues will allow researchers to identify unique characteristics based on age, race, sex, socioeconomic differences and geographic location, and characterize barriers to screening programs to more effectively develop targeted community-based interventions.",

    "abstract": "Information about quality of life (QOL) is valuable in evaluating pharmaceutical agents but it is not adequately assessed in many dementia drug trials. In prevention trials, following participants to conversion to AD requires QOL scales appropriate for both normal and cognitively impaired individuals. Our objective was to evaluate the utility of several scales for subject or informant QOL assessment: Quality of Life-AD; Quality of Life Activity Inventory; SF-36; SF-12 (a shortened version of the SF-36); and Satisfaction with Life Scale. Measurements were collected from 644 subject-study partner pairs, half of whom completed the instruments at the clinic and half at home. Three-month test-retest data were collected. Scales administered at home or in clinic did not differ significantly. Subject self-ratings showed a wide range for all scales. Test-retest intraclass coefficients ranged from 0.67 to 0.77. Moderately high interscale associations suggest that the scales are measuring common aspects of QOL but are not equivalent. Furthermore, they differed with respect to associations with demographic variables and QOL determinants. We conclude that the QOL scores at baseline show sufficient range and reliability to suggest they will have utility in tracking QOL through conversion to dementia.",

The present study was undertaken to determine whether smaller head circumference (HC), a predictor of AD in late life, could influence educational attainment earlier in life, specifically among individuals at increased risk for AD. Data from the Nun Study, a longitudinal clinicopathologic study of dementia, were analyzed using logistic regression to assess the association between HC and attainment of less than a bachelor's degree. Modification of this association was studied by comparing those with and without evidence of increased AD risk, including possession of apolipoprotein E (APOE)-ε4 alleles, occurrence of dementia before death, and satisfaction of AD neuropathologic criteria at autopsy. Small HC was associated with lower educational attainment in those carrying an APOE-ε4 allele [odds ratio (OR)=6.27, 1.21 to 32.48], those who became demented (OR=3.23, 1.27 to 8.21), and those who fulfilled AD neuropathologic criteria (OR=5.03, 1.29 to 19.66), but not in those without these characteristics. These findings suggest that small HC limits educational attainment only among individuals who have greater risk of AD owing to their APOE genotype or who are destined to develop this illness later in life.",

We investigated the frequency and variables associated with its use in mild to moderate/severe AD as defined by criteria involving the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale. Consecutive possible and probable AD patients seen at our research center from November 2003 to December 2006 were included. Individuals were classified as mild dementia either by CDR=1 or MMSE ≥15, using criteria derived in part from the pivotal trials of memantine used for its approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Of 117 patients, 37% of those with mild AD by MMSE criterion (total N=94), and 38% of those with mild AD by CDR criterion (total N=86) used memantine. Logistic regression was used to simultaneously estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of the likelihood of memantine usage associated with a set of predictor variables. Lower MMSE was associated with a greater likelihood of using memantine independent of CDR [ORMMSE=7.45, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.50-37.05]; CDR was not significantly related to memantine use. Controlling both MMSE and CDR, Whites were more likely to use memantine than African Americans (OR=6.47, 95% CI=1.25-33.39). Patients who used other antidementia medications were more likely to use memantine than those who did not (OR=3.15, 95% CI=0.995-9.97). Eight other patient characteristics were not significant predictors. Use of memantine in mild AD was common. Patterns of memantine usage are complex and deserve further study in a larger sample because of their implications for medical system cost, equitable access to care, and risk of drug interactions.",

Nine centers were involved, located across the whole country (3 in Northern, 3 in Central, and 3 in Southern Italy). Diagnostic pathways were tracked for 474 patients with an expert diagnosis of neurodegenerative or vascular dementia (age 76±8; 62% females; Mini-Mental State Examination 17.70±5.7). The contribution of neuropsychology and structural neuroimaging to diagnosis was estimated as “number needed to test” (NNT), denoting the number of patients who need to undergo such procedures to improve expert diagnosis of 1 unit. Expert physicians reached their diagnosis without resorting to structural imaging examinations and neuropsychologic tests in 93% of Alzheimer disease (AD) and 76% of non-AD dementias. The completion of the extended assessment led to improvement of diagnostic accuracy in both cases: the NNT was 15.3 (95% confidence interval: 10.4-29.1) and 4.1 (3.0 to 6.5) for AD and non-AD diagnoses. The added value of structural imaging and neuropsychologic testing in the routine clinical assessment of demented patients is substantial in both AD and non-AD cases.",

Background Differences in cardiovascular risk factors have been linked to decreased total cerebral brain volume and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). Although brain morphology has been related to cognitive performance, few studies have addressed sex-specific effects in this relationship. Methods Framingham Offspring who were stroke and dementia-free underwent a brain MRI scan and NP testing (n=2085; 978 men). Factor analysis identified 4 domain-specific NP factors. MRI participants were divided into 4 MRI subgroups based on measures of total cerebral brain volume and combinations of the presence of WMH and silent cerebral infarcts (≥3 mm). Results Overall, the relationship between MRI and NP measures was similar between the sexes. The exception was that only men showed a positive relationship between executive function and cerebrovascular disease defined as large WMH volume plus silent cerebral infarct. This finding was attributed only among men with Framingham Stroke Risk Profile scores >90th percentile range (P=0.0019). Conclusions Measures of brain atrophy and subclinical markers of vascular disease showed that sex does not significantly alter the relationship between MRI and NP, except among men and women who are at high risk for stroke; these men show poorer performance on executive function, whereas the women do not.",

    "abstract": "The inability to name objects (anomia) is one of the most common findings in the neurologic examination of primary progressive aphasia (PPA). In the semantic variant of PPA, the anomia is profound and reflects a combination of object naming and word comprehension deficits. In contrast, nonsemantic variants of PPA display a more selective impairment of object naming, without corresponding impairments of word comprehension. The aim of the present study was to explore the nature of the anomia in nonsemantic variants of PPA with a sensitive chronometric test of covert word/picture association. We tested priming effects in 12 patients with nonsemantic variant of PPA and 18 controls. Stimuli consisted of written words and line pictures of concrete objects. Within-format (word-word and picture-picture) and cross-format (word-picture and picture-word) priming effects were assessed by measuring the shortening of response times to the second versus initial presentation of corresponding stimulus pairs. In addition to the expected impairment of picture-to-word priming, a condition simulating object naming, the nonsemantic PPA patients also showed unexpected impairments of word-to-picture and word-to-word priming. Picture-to-picture priming was preserved, demonstrating the selectivity of the deficit for lexical processing. These findings show that the information processing bottleneck in patients with nonsemantic variants of PPA is not confined to the stage of lexical access but that it also extends into the prior levels of lexical semantics. The boundaries between the semantic and nonsemantic variants are therefore far from rigid.",

FTD is clinically, pathologically, and genetically heterogeneous and has been associated with mutations in different genes located on chromosomes 17, 9, and 3. In our study we report a novel heterozygous g.26218G>A variant in exon 6 of charged multivesicular body protein 2B (CHMP2B), predicted to cause the amino acid change p.Ser187Asn, in one patient diagnosed with FTD. We were not able to determine the mode of inheritance of the mutation as we did not have access to the genetically informative family members of the proband; those who were screened did not carry the variant. We did not find this variant in 273 White controls although we did find it in 6 of 94 African-American controls. Most of the mutations in CHMP2B which are considered pathogenic lead to partial deletion of the C-terminus region of CHMP2B protein. Based on previous reports and on our current data, missense mutations in this gene seem unlikely to be pathogenic. The pathogenicity of CHMP2B mutations requires further investigation.",

Here, we report an Italian kindred with FAD and PSEN-1 double mutation E318G+G394V that clearly cosegregates with the pathology. The E318G mutation has not an assessed pathogenic function, but some data have highlighted a role as a risk factor for AD in a predisposed familiar background. The G394V mutation was still described in association to an AD case with reported (but not demonstrated) familiar cosegregation. In an attempt to better characterize the biochemical effect of this double mutation, we assessed Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) concentrations in conditioned media from primary skin fibroblasts obtained from AD-affected and healthy family members. We did not find any modification of the Aβ(1-42)/Aβ(1-40) ratio, suggesting that this double mutation might be involved in early-onset AD etiopathogenesis by affecting a PSEN-1 function other than γ-secretase activity.",

This analysis compared the effect of body weight on tolerability in Alzheimer disease patients receiving rivastigmine capsules or rivastigmine patch. Using data from a 24-week trial, adverse events and discontinuations were evaluated in patients stratified on the basis of extreme low weight (<50 kg), medium weight (50 to 80 kg), and high weight (>80 kg) at baseline. Rivastigmine patch was generally well tolerated, regardless of patient body weight. Among patients receiving rivastigmine patch, lower body weight, as stratified, was not associated with a higher adverse event rate; however, there was an association between a higher adverse event rate and low body weight among patients receiving rivastigmine capsules. Discontinuations because of adverse events were not directly related to weight. A lower incidence of adverse events was apparent with transdermal delivery of rivastigmine compared with oral administration.",

Several studies reported the effect of thyroid hormones on cerebral blood flow. The aim of this study was to objectively evaluate regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in association with thyroid hormone levels within the normal range in patients with AD. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free T3, and free T4 levels were measured in 62 patients with AD (23 men and 39 women; age 56 to 91 y; mean age 77.3 y) and 27 control subjects (9 men and 18 women; age 61 to 93 y; mean age 75.8 y). The 99mTc ethylcysteinate dimer single photon emission computed tomography was performed in all subjects. The rCBF in the region of interest was measured by the noninvasive Patlak plot method and calculated using FineSRT, which is a fully automated region of interest technique. No significant correlation was found between thyroid hormone levels and Mini-Mental State Examination scores or global CBF values. Serum levels of TSH, but not free T3 or free T4, were significantly inversely correlated with rCBF in the middle and inferior temporal regions of right cerebral hemisphere in patients with AD. Control subjects showed no significant correlation between thyroid hormone levels and rCBF. Although these findings of a regional relationship must be considers preliminary, this study proposed the hypothesis that altered TSH levels within the normal range may be related to brain perfusion in right temporal region.",

Baseline MCI groups were categorized by CDR-MCI, cognitive function (Cog-MCI), and a combined CDR-Cog approach. The cognitive approach adopted the Mayo clinic criteria. For the combined approach, nonamnestic MCI combined CDR 0.5 plus nonmemory cognitive deficits. The overall concordance between CDR and Cognitive test ratings were 65.3% (χ2 = 256.4, P<0.001, κ=0.44). With a combined approach, 424 (57%) participants were classified as normal. CDR-MCI group had higher cognitive scores compared with MCI groups by other criteria (1 way analysis of variance or ANOVA). At 2 years, the combined CDR-Cog MCI group identified all dementia (N=24) converters although group differences were not significant. Cognitive function and CDR identified participants potentially at-risk for furthermore decline, but exhibited some differences in detection profiles. A combined approach may be more practical in screening for MCI participants with diverse educational and cultural background.",

Both had hippocampal volumes at or below the first percentile of the age-specific distribution, retrosplenial glucose hypometabolism, and inversion of tau/amyloid beta-42 cerebrospinal fluid ratio. Both showed progression of the cognitive deficit over the following 12 months. Conclusions These 2 patients with progressive MCI and positivity to all Alzheimer markers predicated by the new research criteria provide preliminary support to their validity. Future work will characterize the marker profile of the vast majority of patients with incomplete marker positivity.",

Data were obtained on whether 421 community-dwelling patients with AD in the CATIE-AD trial received institutional services in the month preceding baseline and at 3-month, 6-month, and 9-month follow-up. All participants had a caregiver who lived with or visited them regularly. Outcome variables include hospital, nursing home, residential, and combined institutional costs. Mixed models were employed to estimate the interaction of Health Utility Index (HUI)-III scores (a health status measure) and 5 measures of caregiver burden. Wherever significant, results indicate that greater caregiver burden weakens the inverse relationship between health utilities and institutional costs, leading to greater costs than would be expected at a given level of health. Altogether 45.0% of the models (9/20) showed this effect (positive coefficient on the burden-HUI interaction term). Interventions to support caregivers should be based on caregiver burden, regardless of care recipient health status, for even seemingly manageable patients may be at heightened risk for institutionalization if caregivers experience sufficiently high levels of burden.",

A total of 280 patients (normal or Alzheimer disease and related disorders) received a total of 1514 assessments using the functional assessment staging test (FAST) procedure and the MCI Screen. A hierarchical Bayesian cognitive processing model was created by embedding a signal detection theory model of the MCI Screen-delayed recognition memory task into a hierarchical Bayesian framework. The signal detection theory model used latent parameters of discriminability (memory process) and response bias (executive function) to predict, simultaneously, recognition memory performance for each patient and each FAST severity group. The observed recognition memory data did not distinguish the 6 FAST severity stages, but the latent parameters completely separated them. The latent parameters were also used successfully to transform the ordinal FAST measure into a continuous measure reflecting the underlying continuum of functional severity. Hierarchical Bayesian cognitive processing models applied to recognition memory data from clinical practice settings accurately translated a latent measure of cognition into a continuous measure of functional severity for both individuals and FAST groups. Such a translation links 2 levels of brain information processing and may enable more accurate correlations with other levels, such as those characterized by biomarkers.",

Baseline Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) ratings were determined by either (1) clinician interviews or (2) a previously developed computer algorithm based on 60 questions (of a possible 131) extracted from clinician interviews. We developed age+sex+education-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models using CDR-sum-of-boxes (CDR-SB) as the predictor, where CDR-SB was determined by either a clinician interview or an algorithm; models were run for the full sample (n = 342) and among those jointly classified as vMCI using clinician-based and algorithm-based CDR ratings (n = 156). We directly compared predictive accuracy using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.AD hazard ratios (HRs) were similar for clinician-based and algorithm-based CDR-SB: for a 1-point increment in CDR-SB, the respective HRs [95% confidence interval (CI)] were 3.1 (2.5, 3.9) and 2.8 (2.2, 3.5); among those with vMCI, the respective HRs (95% CI) were 2.2 (1.6, 3.2) and 2.1 (1.5, 3.0). Similarly high predictive accuracy was achieved: the concordance probability (weighted average of the area-under-the-ROC curves) over follow-up was 0.78 versus 0.76 using clinician-based versus algorithm-based CDR-SB.CDR scores based on items from this shortened interview had high predictive ability for AD-comparable to that using a lengthy clinical interview.",

Two crossed aphasic patients with a nonfluent variant of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) have been reported previously. This report aims to document for the first time the occurrence of crossed logopenic progressive aphasia in a dextral patient.A 57-year-old monolingual housewife presented with word-finding difficulties. She was strongly right handed, had no clinical history for brain damage to the left hemisphere, and no left handers in her family history. Her language comprised simple, grammatically correct sentences with a fluctuating speech rate and intermittent word-finding pauses. Rare phonological errors were noted. Sentence repetition tasks showed impairments with grammatically complex sentences. Comprehension was intact as were writing and reading. The language disability remained isolated for 3 years. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging depicted somewhat asymmetrical atrophy of the parietal lobes (R>L), whereas single-photon-emitted computed tomographic imaging demonstrated hypoperfusion in the right parietal cortex, indicating right hemisphere dominance for language.This case report provides evidence that crossed PPA can present with a logopenic variant in addition to the nonfluent type demonstrated by others. Functional neuroimaging showed unexpected right-sided hypoperfusion in this case with only subtle structural brain asymmetry, implicating a reverse pattern of language dominance.",

We compared the use of cognitive and psychiatric medications in FTD and AD and evaluated the relationship between neuropsychiatric symptoms and medication use.Cognitive and psychiatric medication use, demographic variables, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) subscale symptoms were obtained from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set (n=3958, 8.1% FTD). Bivariate statistics and logistic regressions were calculated to evaluate which demographic or NPI subscale symptoms predicted medication use.Although cognitive medication was used more commonly in AD (78%), it was also commonly used off-label in FTD (56%). Psychiatric medications were in greater use in FTD than in AD (68% vs. 45%, respectively, P<0.001). In FTD, cognitive medication use was associated with elevated NPI elation scores and psychiatric medication use was associated with history of prior psychiatric disease. In AD, demographic variables (white, longer disease duration, higher education, more severe disease, or being male) were most predictive of cognitive medication use, whereas having psychiatric disease, being white, having longer disease duration, being younger, greater disease severity, and being disinhibited or anxious were associated with psychiatric medication use. Off-label antipsychotics were used by 4.7% of patients with AD and 10% of patients with FTD.Our results revealed significant off-label medication use in both FTD and AD. A notable finding from this study was the lack of consistent relationships between medication use and neuropsychiatric symptoms across the 2 illnesses.",

We report population-based normative data on the Social Norms Questionnaire (SNQ22) which asks individuals about the appropriateness of specific behaviors in hypothetical scenarios, errors being related either to breaking with norms or to over-adhering to perceived norms. Total SNQ scores represent the number of correct responses while subscale scores are error totals. Methods: We administered the SNQ22 to 744 adults aged 65+ within a population-based study, and examined the distribution of scores by demographics, other cognitive measures, and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Results: Most participants performed well with few errors. Women and young-old individuals performed significantly better than men and older individuals on total score and over-adherence; women had fewer break-norms errors than men. No race or education effects were observed. Worse (higher) total scores and (lower) over-adherence errors were inversely associated with literacy, CDR, Mini-Mental State Examination, attention, memory, language, executive, and visuospatial domains. Break-norms errors were rare and not associated with any of the above. Conclusions: In population-based normative data on the SNQ22. age and sex influenced total score and over-adherence errors, which showed the expected associations with CDR and other cognitive domains. Social norms screening may be useful in the cognitive assessment of older adults.",

It is unclear whether depressive features are a prodrome of AD. In addition, some studies of aging exclude depressed individuals, which may inappropriately limit generalizability. The aim of the present study was to determine whether depressive symptoms affect cognitive function in the context of preclinical AD. Methods: Cross-sectional multivariate analysis of participants in a longitudinal study of aging (n=356) that evaluates the influence of depressive symptoms on cognitive function in cognitively normal adults. Results: There is no relationship between the presence of depressive symptoms and cognitive function in those with either no evidence of preclinical AD or biomarker evidence of early-stage preclinical AD. However, in later stages of preclinical AD, the presence of depressive symptoms demonstrated interactive effects, including in episodic memory (0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-1.62) and global cognitive function (0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.028-0.89). Conclusions: The presence of depressive symptoms may be a late prodrome of AD. In addition, studies investigating cognitive function in older adults may not need to exclude participants with depressive symptomology, but may still consider depressive symptoms as a potential confounder in the context of more extensive neuronal injury.",

The aims of the study were to describe the clinical, neuroimaging, and genetic features of a cohort of 68 PPA patients, and to outline the natural history of the disease. Materials and Methods: A sample of 23 patients with the logopenic variant, 26 with the nonfluent/agrammatic variant, and 19 with the semantic variant was retrospectively collected and followed-up for a maximum of 6 years. Clinical-neuropsychological assessment, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic imaging, and genetic analyses were acquired at baseline. Disease progression was evaluated in terms of language impairment, global cognitive decline, and functional dependency. Results: During follow-up, one third of subjects presented total language loss, and 20% severe functional dependency. Global cognitive decline after the first year (hazard ratio, 5.93; confidence interval, 1.63-21.56) and high schooling (hazard ratio, 0.07; confidence interval, 0.008-0.74) represented risk factors for functional impairment. The apolipoprotein E status was associated with the progression of cognitive decline. Positive family history for dementia was frequent and 3 genetic autosomal dominant mutations were identified. Conclusions: There were no differences in the progression of PPA subtypes. Genetics plays an important role in disease onset and progression.",

Its association with Alzheimer disease (AD) recently played a key role in propelling scientists to choose AICD as a major molecule of interest. Although several studies have been conducted elucidating AICD’s participation in inducing neurodegenerative outcomes in AD condition, much remains to be deciphered regarding the linkage of AICD with cellular pathways in the AD scenario. Results: In the present study, we have pulled down interactors of nonphosphorylated AICD from the cerebrospinal fluid of AD subjects, identified them by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry, and subsequently studied the differential expression of these interactors in AD and control cases by 2-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis. The study has yielded some AICD-interactors that are differentially expressed in the AD cases and are involved in diverse cellular functions. Conclusions: This proteomic-based approach highlights the first step in finding the possible cellular pathways engaged in AD pathophysiology on the basis of interaction of one or more of their members with AICD.",

    "abstract": "Despite its implications on the personal and policy level, little is currently known about the specific diagnostic pathways that patients with cognitive impairment (CI) pass through before being diagnosed with Alzheimer disease (AD). Four major diagnostic pathways were identified in the Medicare claims records for 2001 to 2006: AD as initial diagnosis, cognitive disturbance followed by AD; dementia with suspected etiologies followed by AD; dementia without known cause followed by AD; and 1 triple pathway, cognitive disturbance followed by dementia without known cause followed by AD. For all of these pathways, previously low medical costs peaked during patients’ month of initial diagnosis and then declined to a level substantially higher than before. The 3 CI pathways that transition to AD included another peak in costs when a secondary AD diagnosis occurred. Each time, inpatient and skilled nursing facility services were major cost contributors. The primary diagnoses on Medicare claims for the AD event were usually comorbidities rather than CI. A linear regression model adjusting for demographic factors, selected comorbidities, and overall frailty found that the transitional CI diagnoses were significant independent cost determinants. They increased Medicare expenditures by an estimated $4600 to $14,200 relative to patients whose initial CI diagnosis was AD.",

To facilitate successful recruitment for the NIH-sponsored A4 (Anti-Amyloid treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer’s disease, NCT02008357) trial for the secondary prevention of Alzheimer disease, we developed a small-group community information session to attract and recruit potential research participants. After a successful media campaign, 213 participants were screened through telephone for eligibility, identifying 127 potential participants. Participants were given the option of a traditional one-on-one recruitment session or a small-group session. One-on-one recruitment was performed for 15 participants requesting this procedure, and yielded an overall recruitment rate of 67% (n=10). Substantially more individuals (n=112, 88%) requested small-group sessions to learn about the study. After attending the small-group informational sessions, 98% of potential participants self-reported a greater understanding of the study; and the recruitment rate from these sessions was 90%. Small-group sessions not only improved recruitment success rates, but also contributed to significantly shorter median time for consent processes (20 vs. 60 min) and reduced staff time spent on persons not recruited. Small-group education programs are an effective strategy for enhancing recruitment success and facilitating practical recruitment into clinical trials with high recruitment demands.",

Methods: This study estimated the ancestry of a group of individuals with late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) (N=280) and established whether there were any differences when compared with a control group (N=357) in a sample of the Colombian population. Results: When the analyses were adjusted for known risk factors such as age, sex, presence of APOEɛ4 , socioeconomic status, educational attainment, and place of birth, African ancestry was associated with an increased LOAD risk (odds ratio: 1.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-2.03; P =0.029), whereas Native American ancestry was associated with lower risk (odds ratio: 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.61-0.98; P =0.046), for every 10% increase in ancestry. In addition, there were significant differences in the proportion of Native American ancestry between carriers and noncarriers of the APOEɛ4 allele (Mann-Whitney U test, P =0.047), with noncarriers having higher mean Native American ancestry when compared with carriers. Conclusions: Our results are consistent with the presence of variants of African origin in the genome of the Colombian population and different from APOEɛ4 that represents a risk factor for the development of LOAD, whereas variants of Native American origin may be conferring protection. However, unknown environmental factors or epigenetic differences among continental groups could also explain the observed associations.",

We evaluated, testing interactions, whether education modified associations of MRI markers with intercept or rate of change of MMSE, Z -score composite, or IRT-cognition. Results: In linear models, education modified the associations of WMLV and CSFV with MMSE and CSFV and Z -score composite. In mixed models, education modified the associations of WMLV and CSFV with level of MMSE and the association of HCV with slope of MMSE. Education also modified the association with CSFV and slope of Z -score composite decline. There was no evidence that education modified associations between MRI measures and level or slope of IRT-cognition.

The current review aimed to identify factors that predict caregivers' coping strategies. Within this, we attempted to identify caregivers who are more likely to adopt dysfunctional coping strategies and be at risk of adverse outcomes. Several electronic databases were systematically searched. Twenty-one studies were eligible for review, describing 18 caregiver and care-recipient factors related to the 3 coping strategies. No factors were classified \"predictive,\" however, 16 factors were \"potentially predictive.\" Younger, more highly educated caregivers with greater emotional supports and knowledge of dementia were associated with solution-focused coping. Younger, less educated caregivers were associated with emotional support/acceptance-based coping strategies. Whereas nonwhite caregivers with less emotional supports caregiving for persons with more behavioral problems were associated with dysfunctional coping strategies. Enhancing caregiver self-efficacy, knowledge of dementia, improving social supports, linking to support groups, managing behavioral problems, as well as coaching adaptive coping strategies while flagging caregivers at risk for dysfunctional coping may improve outcomes for caregivers.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Early-onset dementia (EOD) is a rare condition, with an often atypical clinical presentation, and it may therefore be challenging to diagnose. Specialized memory clinics vary in the type of patients seen, diagnostic procedures applied, and the pharmacological treatment given. The aim of this study was to investigate quality-of-care indicators in subjects with EOD from 3 tertiary memory clinics in 3 European countries. METHODS: We included 1325 newly diagnosed EOD patients, ages 65 years or younger, between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2013, from the Danish Dementia Registry (Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen), the Swedish Dementia Registry (\"SveDem\", Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm), and the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (VU University Medical Center). RESULTS: The frequency of EOD among all dementia patients was significantly lower in Copenhagen (410, 20%) and Stockholm (284, 21%) compared with Amsterdam (631, 48%). Not all quality indicator targets were met, such as the time to diagnosis, the mini-mental state examination score available, and the prescription of cholinesterase inhibitors. Cerebrospinal fluid sampling, registered in 2 sites, was performed in over 80% of the subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In tertiary referral centers in Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Amsterdam, quality indicators were not always met for patients with EOD. Results partly reflect differences in referral pattern, the application of diagnostic criteria, and local best practices. Standardized international procedures for patients with EOD may reduce this variability.",

Given its substantial clinical importance, we derived an indicator of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and amnestic and nonamnestic subtypes at 3 time points. Methods: MCI status was derived at 3 waves of the LBC1936 at ages 76 (n=567), 79 (n=441), and 82 years (n=341). A general MCI category was derived as well as amnestic MCI (aMCI) and nonamnestic MCI (naMCI). A comparison was made between MCI derivations using normative data from the LBC1936 cohort versus the general UK population. Results: MCI rates showed a proportional increase at each wave between 76 and 82 years from 15% to 18%. Rates of MCI subtypes also showed a proportional increase over time: aMCI 4% to 6%; naMCI 12% to 16%. Higher rates of MCI were found when using the LBC1936 normative data to derive MCI classification rather than UK-wide norms. Conclusions: We found that MCI and aMCI rates in the LBC1936 were consistent with previous research. However, naMCI rates were higher than expected. Future LBC1936 research should assess the predictive factors associated with MCI prevalence to validate previous findings and identify novel risk factors.",

Genetic variants and haplotypes in regions near the APOE locus may be associated with LOAD in the Colombian population. Objective: We evaluated frequencies and risk of genetic variants and haplotypes in APOE , TOMM40 , and APOC1 promoters, also in putative regulatory enhancer elements ( TOMM40 IVS2-4 and TOMM40 IVS6) , and in cis-regulatory elements ( ME1 and BCR). Materials and Methods: Our case-control association study was carried out in 50 patients with LOAD and 50 controls. We determined frequencies and odd ratios for genetic variants and haplotypes. Results: We found a significant association between LOAD and genetic variants at the TOMM40 promoter, at TOMM40 IVS2-4 and TOMM40 IVS6 regulatory enhancer elements, and at the APOC1 promoter. Particularly, variants of Poly-T and APOC1 promoter could anticipate the age of onset of LOAD in our population. We identified three risk haplotypes in TOMM40 ( ACGGAG, ACGGGG, and ATAGGC) related to LOAD’s age of onset. We also found other risk or protection haplotypes at the TOMM40 and APOE promoters, at TOMM40 IVS2-4 , TOMM40 IVS6 regulatory enhancer elements, and at ME1. Conclusion: Genetic variants and haplotypes near the APOE locus are related to LOAD risk and accelerated onset of LOAD in the Colombian population.",

Methods: Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, single ascending dose (SAD, n=96) and multiple ascending dose (MAD, n=68) studies evaluated E2027 doses (5 to 1200 mg) in healthy subjects. The impact of age, race (Japanese/non-Japanese), and food on pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics were evaluated. Serial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected to assess the target engagement. Results: E2027 PK profiles were biphasic (elimination half-life: ~30 hours. Approximately 3-fold accumulation was observed following multiple once-daily dosing. E2027 single doses of 50 to 400 mg resulted in mean maximum increases in CSF cyclic guanosine monophosphate ranging from 293% to 461% within 5.37 to 12.9 hours after dose administration to assess target engagement. Dose-response modelling of steady-state predose CSF cyclic guanosine monophosphate concentrations showed ≥200% increase from baseline is maintained with doses of ≥50 mg QD. The most common adverse events with E2027 were post-LP syndrome and back pain. PK profiles were similar between Japanese and non-Japanese. Higher exposure observed in fed versus fasted state was not considered clinically significant. PK exposure was higher in elderly subjects. Conclusions: S.E2027 was well-tolerated following single and multiple administration.

    "abstract": "Frontotemporal dementia corresponds to a heterogenous group of syndromes characterized by progressive changes in behavior and/or language. Approximately 30% of patients with primary progressive aphasia, semantic variant (semantic dementia), present with atrophy in the right cerebral hemisphere, in a rare clinical condition called right temporal variant of frontotemporal dementia (rtvFTD). The objective of the study is to present the main demographic, clinical, neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and pathologic characteristics of rtvFTD patients. A systematic review of the literature was carried out in the PubMed, LILACS, and SCIELO databases between January and March 2022. After the evaluation process, 41 articles were selected, published between 1993 and 2021. We found that rtvFTD presents with severe and progressive prosopagnosia (related to anterior temporal lobe injury) associated with behavioral symptoms—desinibition (51%), apathy (39%), obsessive-compulsive symptoms (37%), changes in eating habits (33%), and depression (28%), which is different from semantic dementia. The most common pathologic pattern is TDP-43, type C. This field of knowledge has few studies (mainly reports and case series) and heterogenous nomenclature, which is a limitation. A multinational longitudinal registry of people with rtvFTD, with standardized assessment and description of symptoms, is necessary to elucidate the characteristics of this entity.",

    "abstract": "Background: Family caregivers of people living with dementia have high caregiver strain and poor health consequences. Limited research exists on Lewy body dementia (LBD) caregivers and their specific comorbidities. This study aimed to (1) identify the prevalence of self-reported comorbidities among LBD caregivers and (2) contextualize these findings with historical data on caregivers of persons living with Alzheimer disease and associated disorders (ADADs). Methods: In a national, online survey, LBD family caregivers completed the Self-Administered Comorbidity Questionnaire and we compared these findings with extant literature on ADAD caregiver comorbidities. Results: Among 217 LBD caregivers, 84.3% were female, 39.1% were 64 years old or younger, and 66.8% had &gt;2 years of caregiving experience. Caregivers self-identified as current (83.9%) or former (16.1%) caregivers. The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (38.2%), depression (35.0%), back pain (34.1%), and arthritis (27.7%). LBD caregivers, particularly younger caregivers, had a higher prevalence of depression compared with ADAD caregivers and older adult populations, and back pain prevalence nearly equivalent to spinal cord injury caregivers. Conclusions: Our study is the first to illustrate and contextualize specific comorbidities among LBD caregivers. Understanding the causality and impact of these conditions will be critical in designing effective interventions to improve the lives of families affected by LBD.",

    "abstract": "An educational symposium on the importance of meaningful treatment outcomes in Alzheimer disease (AD) was sponsored by Novo Nordisk and presented at ISPOR Europe 2023. To gather insights from different stakeholders, 5 speakers from the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry (Novo Nordisk and IQVIA), academia (Karolinska Institutet, Sweden), and the Norwegian Medical Products Agency (NOMA), as well as a person living with AD, participated in this symposium titled \"Time delay: Searching for a Meaningful Outcome of Disease Modification in Alzheimer Disease.\" CURRENT PRACTICE IN ASSESSING TREATMENT OUTCOMES IN AD AD is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disorder. In its early stages, the decline in cognitive function can be notable, although some people living with AD display minimal or no symptoms despite underlying brain changes. However, in later stages, there is accelerated cognitive decline, which ultimately leads to total loss of independent function (Fig. 1).1–3FIGURE 1: Evolution of AD symptoms. AD indicates Alzheimer disease; MCI, mild cognitive impairment.The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) is an established measure that was originally developed to capture treatment effects in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild AD. In addition, tools such as the Global Deterioration Scale and the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer Association (NIA-AA) Disease Framework can be used to characterize the different clinical stages of AD. Contemporary clinical trial designs and outcome assessments have also been developed to detect modest treatment effects on cognitive and functional decline. However, people living with early AD (MCI due to AD and mild AD dementia) show high variability in baseline cognitive and functioning ability, which makes it difficult to measure disease progression. Despite studies aiming to select homogeneous trial populations, traditional outcome measures such as Clinical Dementia Rating-sum of boxes (CDR-SB) may lack the sensitivity to detect moderate treatment effects in early AD. Thus, it is a challenge to interpret current outcome measures in terms of a patient-relevant treatment effect, such as slowing disease progression.1,4 A PATIENT'S PERSPECTIVE: WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO SOMEONE LIVING WITH AD? Birgitta Martensson was diagnosed with AD in 2017, aged 66 years. Birgitta still leads a relatively \"normal\" life in the early stages of disease, living alone, managing her own finances, seeing friends, and traveling. However, she understands that one day, she will not be able to make decisions for herself. Time is of the essence, and that's why she believes an early diagnosis is crucial for people living with AD. With an early diagnosis, Birgitta has been able to plan for her future with the support of her family and friends. However, a late diagnosis is a loss of time, whereby people living with AD cannot make their own decisions regarding their treatment and lifestyle.\"I want to make my own decisions for my future\" —Birgitta Martensson Evaluating the value of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in early AD requires a thorough understanding of the priorities of people living with AD.5 Early detection of AD and associated symptoms is crucial to manage dementia-related impacts on daily functioning, to enable people living with AD and their care partners to plan for the future and seek the support they need. A systematic review conducted on behalf of Real-World Outcomes Across the AD Spectrum for Better Care (ROADMAP)6 provided insights into the priorities of people living with AD, wherein 32 outcomes considered important by those people and their care partners were identified across 7 domains. According to the review, outcomes typically assessed in clinical trials, such as cognition and daily functioning, were considered important by people living with AD, but other priorities were uncovered, too, including the importance of maintaining quality of life, independence, and identity or personality.7 Similarly, the recent what matters most study conducted by the Alzheimer Disease Patient and Caregiver Engagement group8 asked people living with AD what an \"ideal treatment for AD\" would offer them. People whose disease fell across the AD continuum reaffirmed the importance of disease modification to slow progression and improve memory, as well as remaining independent and able to perform daily activities.9 TIME DELAY: A NOVEL METHOD FOR ASSESSING OUTCOMES IN AD During the symposium, panelists noted that developing tools that can measure meaningful changes and treatment responses in people with early AD is crucial, both from a patient perspective and a health economics perspective. Julie Hahn-Pedersen, Novo Nordisk A/S, highlighted the fact that DMTs can offer people with early AD hope for early intervention and improved outcomes. From a health economics perspective, Linus Jönsson of the Karolinska Institutet stated that reimbursement decisions around DMTs in AD will represent some of the most important reimbursement decisions in coming years, due to their perceived high price point and the substantial prevalence of the disease. Furthermore, DMTs present an incentive to diagnose the disease earlier and qualify people for treatment, which is vital for people living with AD and their care partners. Thus, it is crucial to ensure that interventions are evaluated and implemented appropriately.\"Reimbursement decisions around novel disease-modifying therapeutics in AD will represent some of the most important reimbursement decisions in coming years\" —Linus Jönsson, Karolinska Institutet Traditionally, when reviewing the results of clinical trials in AD, the mixed method for repeated measures (MMRM) is used. This method models data with high unexplained variability, and few assumptions are made regarding the response. It focuses on potential treatment-induced changes in the outcome measure from baseline at a fixed time point, without considering what has happened before or what will happen after the point of observation, producing a vertical point difference.10 Thus, its results can be difficult to translate into meaningful and interpretable outcomes for people with AD and their care partners.11 The time delay method is a novel progression model for repeated measures that may assist in the quantification of treatment outcomes from potential DMTs that aim to slow AD progression. For example, it can be used to measure the time taken to reach a specified disease state, or the time to disease progression with a potential treatment versus placebo.11 The time delay method can be applied to clinical trial readouts. In a recent study by van Dyck et al12 in which lecanemab was assessed in people with early AD (N=1795), the mean CDR-SB score at baseline was ~3.2 in both the investigational (n=898) and placebo arms (n=897). At 18 months, using the MMRM, the adjusted mean change from baseline in the CDR-SB score was 1.21 in the investigational arm and 1.66 in the placebo arm (difference, −0.45; 95% CI, −0.67 to −0.23; P <0.001).12 Applying the time delay method to this readout shows that the investigational arm took 18 months (78.2 wk) to reach the same CDR-SB score as the placebo arm at 12.7 months (55.2 wk). This indicates a 5.3-month (23.0 wk) slowing of disease progression with lecanemab (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2: Application of the time delay method to data from recent clinical trials. A, Data from Van Dyck et al (2023),12 demonstrating a 5.3-month (23.0-wk) delay in disease progression after treatment with a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody. B, Data from Sims et al (2023),13 demonstrating a 7.5-month (32.6-wk) delay in disease progression after treatment with a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody. *P<0.001; † P<0.0001. CDR-SB indicates Clinical Dementia Rating-sum of boxes.Sims et al13 compared the clinical benefits of donanemab in early AD with placebo. In the low-tau/medium-tau population (n=1182), the between-group difference in the least-squares mean change from baseline at 76 weeks was −0.67 (95% CI, −0.95 to −0.40) for CDR-SB, using the MMRM. Applying the time delay method to these data showed that the investigational arm took 17.5 months (76.0 wk) to reach the same CDR-SB score as the placebo arm at 10.0 months (43.4 wk), correlating to a 7.5-month (32.6-wk) slowing of disease progression (Fig. 2B).\"The time delay method allows for the translation of treatment outcomes into time saved for potential disease-modifying agents that aim to slow the progression of AD\" —Julie Hahn-Pedersen, Novo Nordisk When quantifying treatment outcomes using MMRM or the time delay method, clinicians and payers may refer to minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs). For people with MCI, the MCID referred to most commonly in the literature for the CDR-SB scale is 0.98, and for people with mild dementia, it is 1.63.14 Therefore, an 18-month trial requires the treatment to have an effect size between −0.98 and −1.63 to be considered clinically meaningful. Current MCIDs are unlikely to reflect what is meaningful to people with AD, especially people with MCI due to AD or mild AD dementia.14 For example, in the study by van Dyck et al,12 a point difference of −0.45 was observed in the adjusted mean CDR-SB score between the investigational and placebo arms at 18 months. Although this translates to a 5.3-month delay in disease progression, this value would not be deemed clinically meaningful with the MCID values stated above. To be considered clinically meaningful, an 11-month delay in disease progression (−0.98) would need to be observed in people with MCI, and a near halt in disease progression (−1.63) in people with mild dementia.15 As such, additional research to establish MCIDs specifically related to time delay would provide crucial support for people with AD, to better understand treatment outcomes, especially in early disease stages. APPLYING THE TIME DELAY METHOD TO HEALTH ECONOMIC MODELING Where current trials do not offer extended follow-up periods beyond 18 months, there is a lack of data on the long-term effects of therapeutics for AD and their impact on institutionalization and healthcare costs. To apply the time delay method in such contexts, economic models such as Markov state transition models and discrete event (microsimulation) models can be used. These models help researchers forecast economic impacts by combining trial results with data from registries and other sources.16,17 Although discrete event models may offer flexibility in certain aspects, Markov state transition model frameworks are more commonly used in AD. Long-term treatment effects can be estimated in terms of time delay using the Markov state transition model, with the assumption that the effect on time delay for long-term natural history data will be the same as that observed in the clinical trial of interest. In fact, the same results are seen when implementing treatment effects as a time delay as when treatment effects are implemented through the conventional way of reduced transition probabilities to more severe states. Furthermore, the use of time delay data means less dependence on the choice of outcome measure used in the trial of interest and offers a more intuitive interpretation of results. However, there are limitations to the method. The method measures outcomes throughout the disease continuum, including mortality. Therefore, it is important to consider how mortality is handled in the model, as it increases complexity and may reduce the applicability of time delay data when conducting economic evaluations of DMTs.18 A potential limitation discussed during the symposium was the time delay method's reliance on a surrogate endpoint (CDR-SB). Results of this measure are considered surrogate outcomes of outcomes unobservable in clinical trials (in this case, due to the short length of follow-up periods in relation to disease course). In discussing this limitation, Anja Schiel, a special advisor and lead methodologist in Regulatory and Pharmacoeconomic Statistics at NOMA, explained that the validity of surrogate outcomes has not been fully established, and they only indirectly predict treatment effect. To date, few surrogate outcomes have been shown to be true measures of tangible clinical benefit. Their use to assess the clinical benefit of health technology is neither widely accepted by HTA agencies, nor is it recommended in guidelines.19 Despite this limitation, it is important to recognize that endpoints may have different value for different stakeholders. For example, statisticians and regulators may not advocate the time delay method over traditional endpoint measurement methods, as both involve the same data, no MCID has been established for the time delay method, and the endpoint has not been validated for use in clinical practice or trials. However, physicians and researchers may consider the time delay method to be an additional, potentially more intuitive approach to measure treatment response in early AD, enabling treatment effects to be quantified such that they are interpretable by people living with AD and their care partners.\"Endpoints have different values for different decision makers\" —Anja Schiel, NOMA CONCLUSIONS The MMRM, an established method for assessing clinical trial results in AD, generates vertical point differences that can be challenging to translate into meaningful and interpretable outcomes for people living with AD and their care partners, particularly during early disease stages. With the advent of DMTs, there is a need to evaluate treatment benefits at a stage where people may display minimal or no symptoms. The time delay method, an innovative progression model for repeated measures, produces results that are easily interpretable, including by those living with the disease. As demonstrated using existing clinical trial readouts, this method can measure the time saved with a DMT versus placebo or natural disease progression. Additional evidence is required to validate this method from both a health economics and HTA perspective.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Many individuals with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) die of disease-related complications, but predicting the end of life can be challenging. We identified a phenotype associated with approaching end of life. Methods: We present 4 exemplar cases where individuals with DLB experienced refractory psychosis before death. We reviewed codebooks and quotes from 3 studies regarding end-of-life experiences in DLB to identify experiences that aligned with this phenotype. Results: In addition to the 4 cases, family caregivers in prior studies described prominent worsening of psychosis before death in some individuals with DLB. The worsening often occurred several months before death and was sometimes associated with rapid deterioration. Worsening psychosis was the prominent symptom and was not initially accompanied by cognitive or physical decline. In many cases, the refractory psychosis resulted in inpatient psychiatric hospitalization or residential care, but these scenarios were challenging because of the individual’s behavior. Conclusion: Refractory psychosis in DLB, particularly out of proportion to other symptoms, may be a signal of approaching the end of life. More research is needed to understand this phenomenon and to develop effective and safe treatments for psychosis in DLB.",

Women, non-whites, those with higher education, with no comorbidities, and lower ages had lower mortality rates for most diagnostic groups. Mortality rates were higher in the presence of APOE4 variants for several diagnostic groups. Lower MMSEs predicted worse survival for most diseases. Overall, 41% of patients survived during 12 years of follow-up, compared with an expected 75% in the US population.

We hypothesized that caregiver health status moderates response to peer mentoring. Post hoc analyses (N = 30 dyads) showed that 75% of mentees and 66% of mentors endorsed ≥1 comorbidity. Mentees and mentors with comorbidities showed greater improvement in LBD knowledge postintervention ( P = 0.039) and dementia attitudes post-training ( P = 0.016), respectively.

However, because of the variety of its clinical presentations, a definite diagnosis in public hospitals is not always possible. Therefore, this study will provide more information about the clinical data of probable sCJD cases in Thailand. Methods: This case series of probable sCJD patients who visited the Neurological Institute of Thailand during 2018 to 2023 was conducted. Demographic data, clinical presentations, brain MRI, EEG, CSF analyses, and clinical course were reviewed. Results: A total of 17 probable sCJD cases were studied. Eleven patients were female (64.71%) with a median age of 62 (IQR: 14.5) years. The median onset of symptoms was 2 months (IQR: 2) before hospital visit, in which cognitive impairment was the most common first presentation (29.41%) followed by ataxia (23.53%), and visual disturbances (17.65%). Most patients had typical high signal intensities at both caudate/putamen and cortical regions (76.47%). Generalized periodic discharges with triphasic morphology were found in 11/14 patients with EEG results (78.57%). Conclusion: sCJD has a diverse clinical presentation that resembles other cognitive disorders. Detailed assessment of signs and symptoms, together with proper investigations, could help to differentiate this condition in a resource-limited setting.",

    "abstract": "Background: Etalanetug (E2814), an anti-tau monoclonal antibody (mAb), is intended to inhibit spreading of pathologic tau species by binding to the microtubule binding region (MTBR). It is being developed as a potential disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer disease. Methods: This randomized, placebo-controlled study comprised of 2 parts: single ascending doses evaluating 5 etalanetug doses and multiple ascending doses evaluating 4 fixed doses in each cohort, 8 healthy subjects were randomized (3:1) to single etalanetug dose or placebo. Safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), antidrug antibodies (ADA), and target engagement (TE) were assessed. Results: Etalanetug was safe and well-tolerated following single and multiple infusions. After single-dose and multiple-dose administration, serum exposure of etalanetug increased in a dose-related manner. Serum-to-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration ratio at week 12 was ∼0.1% to 0.3% and ∼1% following single and multiple dosing, respectively. Mean t ½ was ∼19 to 25 days independent of dose and time. etalanetug immunogenicity was minimal, with low titers and no impact on PK. TE was demonstrated; CSF concentrations of etalanetug between 100 and 200 ng/mL saturated binding of MTBR-tau299 at 82.1% and binding of MTBR-tau354 at 64.9%. Conclusion: Etalanetug presented an adequate safety and immunogenicity profile in healthy adults. PK was comparable to other mAbs. Etalanetug demonstrated target engagement by binding to MTBR tau species.",

    "abstract": "Suspension and expulsion are common in US schools and disproportionately target structurally marginalized children. No research has examined whether these punitive practices may have long-term cognitive-aging implications. In the prospective National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 data (N=8021), we used confounder-adjusted linear models to investigate associations between early-life suspension or expulsion and global cognition, memory, and attention z -scores at age 50. Using interaction terms, we tested for additive scale effect modification by race, gender, and at their intersections. In all, 21.5% of participants had been suspended and 4.4% expelled, with Black men and women overrepresented among these early-life experiences. Punitive school discipline was associated with lower midlife global cognition, memory, and attention z -scores (eg, global cognition, suspension: : -0.21; 95% CI: -0.26, -0.15; expulsion: :-0.27; 95% CI: -0.38, -0.16). The expulsion-cognition association was stronger for men than women. Punitive school discipline-an exposure modifiable at multiple policy levels-is associated with lower cognitive performance in midlife, decades after school completion.",

    "abstract": "Dementia affects millions worldwide, with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) impacting up to 90% of those affected. These symptoms can escalate to crises, which present significant challenges for patients, caregivers, and health care systems. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of NPS and delirium in patients with dementia during acute crises. A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple bibliographic databases. Data extraction included NPS such as aggression and hallucinations, NPS measurement tool, delirium diagnoses, delirium screening tool, and discharge locations. Risk of bias was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT), and a meta-analysis was performed. The review was reported following PRISMA guidelines. Nineteen studies published from 1990 to 2023 were included. All were performed in hospitalized patients. Results indicated high heterogeneity in NPS prevalence: on medical wards, aggression 0.47 (95% CI: 0.35-0.59) was the most prevalent, followed by aggression/agitation 0.31 (95% CI: 0.15-0.48). In (gero)psychiatric wards, irritability 0.67 (95% CI: 0.52-0.79), and agitation 0.66 (95% CI: 0.59-0.73) were among the most common symptoms. In addition, 9 studies reported the rate of delirium; the pooled prevalence was 0.24 (95% CI: 0.11-0.38), with studies utilizing a screening tool reporting higher rates. These findings highlight the prevalence of NPS during crisis hospitalizations and the critical role of deliberate delirium screening. They enhance understanding of dementia crisis phenomenology and offer a foundation for targeted interventions to improve care quality. More research about crises in patients with dementia at home need to be performed.",

Exposures to EMF were rated as probable intermittent exposure or probable exposure for extended periods to levels above threshold. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate the risk of AD given EMF exposure stratified by IH. The odds ratios for ever having been exposed to EMF were 0.74 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29-1.92] and 0.95 (95% CI 0.27-2.43) for each IH, adjusting for age and education.

    "abstract": "Summary: The challenge of describing subgroups is particularly important in vascular dementia, which, in contrast to more stereotypic processes affecting cognitive function, is better thought of as several syndromes rather than as a disease. Many current diagnostic descriptions lack a strong empiric basis. Some of the categories now in use suffer from a priori assumptions about causality and pattern associations, which themselves have not been validated. The so-called mixed dementia syndrome may have been under-represented in our estimation of dementia subtypes, in comparison with so-called pure vascular causes. Within the vascular syndrome, whether seen in isolation or in combination with other causes of dementia, the relative contributions of white matter changes as compared with multiple cortical strokes needs to be clarified. It remains a matter of controversy as to whether prolonged or chronic intermittent cerebral ischemia is a statistically important part of the dementia. The variable relation between clinical presentation and neuroimaging localization has important consequences for understanding the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment arising from vascular causes. Recent data also suggest that we should focus away from both the Alzheimer disease model of dementia and the multi-infarct model of vascular dementia. There are important opportunities available to clinicians from many disciplines to collaborate in precise clinical descriptions of large numbers of patients to advance our understanding of the spectrum of vascular cognitive impairment.",

We reviewed the literature for original studies reporting either (a) duration of survival or (b) cognitive status following a diagnosis of multi-infarct dementia (MID). Among 13 papers (combined sample size=470; mean duration of follow-up=4.3 years), survival was significantly shorter following a clinical diagnosis of MID compared with Alzheimer disease (AD). Nine studies (combined sample size=175; mean duration of follow-up=2.9 years) reported at least two mental status scores separated by at least 1 year. Among four studies using the Mini-Mental State Examination, no consistent differences in annualized rate of decline could be observed for MID compared with AD. Also, no factors were identified that predict rate of decline. This review reveals many limitations in our current knowledge about the natural history of VaD. Understanding would be enhanced by multinational harmonization of definitions for study entry point, diagnosis of VaD, classification of subtypes, as well as cognitive, functional, and behavioral endpoints.",

We developed the Baylor Profound Mental Status Examination (BPMSE) modeled after the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) to meet this need. The BPMSE consists of 25 cognitive questions that assess orientation, language, attention, and motor functioning; 10 examiner ratings of presence or absence of problem behaviors; and 2 qualitative observations of language and social interaction. Two hundred eight probable or possible AD patients (MMSE scores of 20 or less) received the BPMSE. Some were also rated on the clinical dementia rating (CDR) and Lawton activities of daily living (ADL). A ceiling effect occurred at MMSE scores above 11. BPMSE cognitive scores and MMSE scores correlated significantly (r = 0.76, p < 0.0001). Subareas of the BPMSE also intercorrelated significantly. The BPMSE correlated with both CDR and ADL scores (p < 0.001). Internal consistency, interrater reliability, and test-retest stability were excellent. There was no floor effect, and BPMSE scores continued to decline after the MMSE reached 0. The BPMSE is a quick and easy staging tool with excellent validity and test-retest stability that measures cognitive function successfully in patients with MMSE scores below 12. The scale is sensitive to longitudinal change and continues to assess decline when performance has reached the lowest levels on conventional measures.",

We present an open-labeled trial of a dopamine agonist for treating perseveration in dementia. Eight patients with ischemic vascular or degenerative dementia completed a 25-day trial of bromocriptine with a maximum daily dose of 10 mg. Patients were assessed with ncuropsychological scales and a test battery for detecting perseveration. Recurrent and stuck-in-set types of perseveration significantly improved during the treatment, whereas measures for general attention and overall cognitive function showed no significant changes. We assume that bromocriptine supplemented the mesolimbocortical or ventral mcsostriatal dopamine system ameliorated a certain frontal lobe function such as focused attention or working memory and improved the patients' persevcrations. Although this study is preliminary because of the small sample size and open-labeled design, the results underline the possibility of pharmacotherapy for perseveration and recommend a double- blind, placebo-controlled study.",

Fifty-seven individuals who were institutionalized for advanced dementia and exhibited agitation or withdrawal were evaluated by direct observations and by interviews with nursing home staff. Engagement was measured by the Lawton Positive Affect scale, visual analog scale, and reported degree of patient's interest in the environment. Mood was measured by a global indicator of mood interpreted from facial expression and two mood items from the Multidimensional Observation Scale for Elderly Subjects. Agitation was measured by a visual analog scale and by the Short Form of the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory. Correlation analyses and multidimensional scaling provided evidence for three dimensions of psychological well-being: engagement-apathy, happy-sad mood, and calm-agitation. Evaluation of these three dimensions is important for measuring quality of care in long-term care settings and for determining effectiveness of therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Summary: The neuroprotective glial cell modulator propentofylline has been used in clinical trials involving more than 800 patients with vascular dementia (VaD). These data derive from two sources: a pooled group of VaD patients from four early phase III European trials, and a multinational European/Canadian phase III study (MN 305) that features a combined randomized withdrawal/delayed onset of progression design to evaluate the effect of propentofylline on disease progression. In the pooled studies, DSM-III-R criteria, Hachinski Ischemia Scores, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used to select subjects with mild-to-moderate disease; in MN 305, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN) criteria and neurologic examinations (including CT and MRI scans) were used to select patients with possible or probable VaD. The use of a central rater to assess cerebrovascular disease in neuroradiologic examinations for study MN 305 was considered to be a key feature for reducing the heterogeneity of the VaD patient population. In addition, the inclusion of patients with possible VaD in this trial greatly increased the number of eligible patients; subgroup analyses revealed no substantial differences between patients with probable versus possible VaD, justifying their inclusion in the study. VaD patients exhibited a more pronounced placebo response in global assessments compared with the Alzheimer disease population in a parallel study. In addition, they experienced less deterioration over time with respect to cognitive and global assessments. Beneficial effects of propentofylline were consistently demonstrated in the domains of cognitive and global function for both VaD populations; however, no treatment benefits could be demonstrated for activities of daily living, possibly due to factors relating to the study population/design, the lack of a validated test instrument for such patients, the caregiver-related phenomenon of “tutoring,” or the nature of the disease itself.",

Serum amyloid P component (SAP) is a normal plasma glycoprotein that binds to the fibrils in all types of amyloid deposit, and radiolabeled SAP is a specific, sensitive, quantitative diagnostic tracer for systemic amyloid deposits in vivo. However, we report that in 11 patients with probable or definite AD, conventional whole body planar scintigraphy after injection of 123I-SAP revealed no detectable localization of tracer within the brain or elsewhere. Significant amounts of systemic extracerebral Aβ amyloid are thus probably not a feature of AD.

    "abstract": "Data on superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients suffering from dementia (n = 32) as compared with a control group (n = 58), a Parkinson disease (PD) patient group (n = 12), and a group of individuals suffering from epilepsy (n = 13) are presented. SOD activity was determined by electron spin resonance spectrometry using the spin trap method. No significant correlation was found between CSF SOD activity and age in the control group. In addition, CSF SOD activity was not gender dependent. One-way analysis of variance showed a highly significant between-groups effect for the CSF SOD activity and specific CSF SOD activity of the four major groups (p = 0.0008). Post hoc comparison (Fisher PLSD test) revealed significant differences between the control group and the total dementia group (p < 0.001), between the dementia group and the epilepsy group (p < 0.01), and between the dementia group and the PD group (p < 0.05). The CSF of patients with PD or epilepsy showed a similar SOD activity as the CSF of control patients. In addition, CSF SOD activity levels were significantly lower in the total dementia group (p = 0.002) and in the group with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) (p = 0.001) than in the dementia age-matched control group. No significant difference was found for CSF SOD activity levels between the control group and the non-DAT dementia group. This result corresponded with a reduction of CSF SOD activity in the total dementia group, DAT subgroup, and non-DAT subgroup of 37, 43, and 22%, respectively. No significant correlation between the Mini-Mental State Examination score and CSF SOD activity was found in DAT. The lowered CSF SOD activity in Alzheimer disease, as demonstrated here, may reflect impaired radical defense mechanisms and may have possible pathophysiological significance.",

In NG108-15 cells, nefiracetam (1 microM) produced a twofold increase in L-type Ca2+ channel currents. A similar, but slightly less potent effect was observed with aniracetam, whereas piracetam and oxiracetam exerted no such effects. Cyclic AMP analogs mimicked the nefiracetam action. N-type Ca2+ channel currents inhibited by leucine (Leu)-enkephalin by means of inhibitory G proteins (Go/Gi) were recovered promptly by nefiracetam, whereas those inhibited by prostaglandin E1 via stimulatory G proteins were not affected by nefiracetam. Cells treated with pertussis toxin (500 ng/mL, > 20 hours) were insensitive to nefiracetam. In Xenopus oocytes functionally expressing N-type (alpha1B) Ca2+ channels and delta-opioid receptors, nefiracetam was also effective in facilitating the recovery from Leu-enkephalin-induced inhibition. These results suggest that nefiracetam, and possibly aniracetam, may activate N- and L-type Ca2+ channels in a differential way depending on how they recover from Go/Gi-mediated inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Summary: The potential role of oxidative metabolism in tacrine (1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9-amino acridine)-induced transaminitis has been investigated in an in vitro system. In the presence of human or rat liver microsomes, tacrine undergoes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent metabolism to stable, protein-reactive, cytotoxic metabolites. In human liver microsomes, CYP1A was identified as the major enzyme involved in the metabolism and bioactivation of tacrine. The reactive metabolite formed is an electrophilic species that may interact with cellular thiols, such as protein and reduced glutathione. Reactive metabolite formation is a two-step process involving an initial 7-hydroxylation of tacrine, followed by a postulated 2-electron oxidation that yields a chemically reactive quinone methide. Cell damage may result from the interaction of quinone methide with essential cellular macromolecules or from induction of futile redox cycling within the cell, brought about by induction of lipid peroxidation, generation of free radicals, and depletion of cellular cofactors such as glutathione. The presence of these processes in vivo may lead to a toxic reaction dependent on the balance between drug bioactivation and drug detoxication.",

    "abstract": "Physicians play an important role in the driver licensing process because drivers, most frequently older ones, acquire diseases that impact their ability to operate a motor vehicle safely and because patients, their families, and regulatory agencies rely on them for diagnosis and treatment. It is now fairly clear that moderately and severely demented patients cannot drive safely. However, the issue of whether the mildly or very mildly demented patient can drive safely has not been fully resolved, although substantial evidence is emerging that most of these individuals have a higher accident risk than their healthier aged counterparts. Physicians, most commonly primary care physicians, will be encountering growing numbers of aged driving persons, particularly those over 70, who are at the greatest risk for developing age-related brain diseases in addition to other physical ailments. It is now evident that the cognitive impairment that accompanies these conditions can have a dramatic impact on driving ability, and recent legislation in a growing number of states (e.g., California and Utah) requires physician reporting of cognitive impairment for driving purposes. Thus, what should the physician do with regard to the \"at risk\" older driver to ensure good medical practice while maintaining a sound ethical and legal posture toward the patient, his family, and the state and its agencies? This article reviews the status of physicians with regard to the cognitively impaired drivers, particularly in states where the law mandates reporting of such individuals. The problem of timely and effective screening for the cognitively impaired driver is raised, and alternative approaches to the screening process are discussed.",

We tested this association in newly diagnosed Alzheimer disease cases and controls of similar age and gender recruited from an established HMO serving Seattle, Washington and surrounding areas. In this, the largest case-control study reported to date, the T4336C variant was not associated with Alzheimer disease overall (present in 6 of 236 cases and 7 of 328 controls; odds ratio = 1.20, 95% CI 0.33 to 4.22). There was evidence of effect modification by Apolipoprotein E (APOE) status—among subjects with an APOE ε4 allele, the T4336C variant was associated with disease (present in 5 of 139 cases and none of 82 controls; odds ratio = infinity, 95% CI 0.73 to infinity). APOE may be an important modifier of the T4336C effect, potentially explaining variable findings across previous studies. Alternatively, the positive findings reported to date may simply reflect the problem of \"type I\" error inherent in genetic association studies. Substantially larger samples than are currently available would be required to resolve this question. G5460(A/T) variants were also investigated and found not to be associated with Alzheimer disease.",

Additionally, to illustrate the methodological problems inherent in evaluating linguistic competence, the performance on four linguistically oriented tasks of 12 PD patients who scored 8 or better on the Mental Status Questionnaire was compared to that of 32 age- and education-matched control subjects. These tasks, from which a composite variable representing performance was formed, were oral object description, story retelling, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and the Similarities subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), a test of verbal associative reasoning. After controlling for the effects of disease severity, a significant effect was observed for the presence of PD. However, when the additional effects of performance on the Block Design subtest of the WAIS were controlled, the PD effect was of borderline significance. These results typify those in the literature, that is, whereas nondemented PD patients can be demonstrated to perform significantly more poorly on linguistically oriented tasks, the performance deficit cannot be conclusively demonstrated to result from a language deficit per se.",

Older adults were recruited from the waiting rooms of 2 geriatrics outpatient clinics for face-to-face interviews regarding their interest in being screened for MCI. A short description of MCI adapted from The Alzheimer's Association's “Fact Sheet” was presented before asking about MCI testing. Multivariable ordinal regression was used to account for heavily skewed outcome data showing very high levels of interest in screening for MCI. The strongest, most consistent correlate across all of the intention measures was the desire to know as early as possible if one has Alzheimer disease. Another robust correlate was having had normal memory testing in the past. Older adults appear to have psychologically connected MCI to Alzheimer disease, but how well they understand this connection is not known and requires further study.",

These platelets retain full-length amyloid precursor protein on their surface and correlate inversely with disease severity in Alzheimer disease (AD). We have now investigated coated-platelet production and its relationship with disease severity in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients to determine whether our earlier observations were unique to AD. Methods Coated-platelet levels were assayed in 40 FTD, 40 AD patients, and 40 controls. Both patient groups were equally divided between mild-stage (Clinical Dementia Rating ≤1) and advanced stage dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating >1). Results Coated-platelet levels were not significantly different between patients with early-stage and advanced stage FTD (P=0.9), whereas early-stage AD patients had significantly higher levels than advanced stage AD (P<0.001). In addition, coated-platelet production was significantly elevated in early-stage AD versus early-stage FTD patients (P=0.01). Conclusions In contrast to AD, there is no significant relationship between disease severity and coated-platelet levels in FTD. Differences in coated-platelet levels between early-stage AD and early-stage FTD patients warrant further investigation for potential clinical applications in helping to differentiate between these 2 disorders.",

    "abstract": "Lexical-semantic competency in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) ε4 carriers was used as an endophenotype, and gray matter volume in MCI ε4 carriers/noncarriers and in noncarrier controls was compared. Residual gray matter volumes were correlated with age of acquisition values for words from a category fluency task, an index of semantic competency. MCI patients had significantly impoverished lexical-semantic output compared with controls, more marked in MCI ε4 carriers. Smaller volumes in the left hippocampus, bilateral regions of the uncus, and posterior cingulate cortex were associated with a tendency to retrieve earlier acquired words in the category fluency task in MCI ε4 carriers, whereas poor semantic performance in MCI noncarriers was associated with smaller volumes in the left uncus, bilateral regions of the parahippocampal gyrus, and hippocampus, and also in a large number of neocortical regions. There was a significant semantic competency by genotype interaction in the left perirhinal cortex, in a number of left frontal and temporal areas and in the right inferior parietal lobule and precuneus. MCI ε4 carriers, when compared with noncarriers, had lower gray matter volume values confined to the right precuneus and the cerebellum bilaterally, but the converse comparison showed that MCI noncarriers had lower values in extensive frontal, temporal, and parietal regions of the neocortex. Similar brain volumetric variations linked to genotype were found in minimal-to-mild AD. The results suggest a relatively specific impact of apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 burden and underline the value of linguistic assessment in preclinical diagnosis.",

Patients with probable Alzheimer disease AD (n=201) were recruited from the Predictors Study in 3 academic AD centers and followed from early disease stages for up to 6 years. Random effects logistic regressions were used to examine effects of patient characteristics on ChEIs/memantine use over time. Independent variables included measures of function, cognition, comorbidities, the presence of extrapyramidal signs, psychotic symptoms, age, sex, and patient's living situation at each interval. Control variables included assessment interval, year of study entry, and site. During a 6-year study period, rate of ChEIs use decreased (80.6% to 73.0%) whereas memantine use increased (2.0% to 45.9%). Random effects logistic regression analyses showed that ChEI use was associated with better function, no psychotic symptoms, and younger age. Memantine use was associated with better function, poorer cognition, living at home, later assessment interval, and later year of study entry. Results suggest that high rate of ChEI use and increasing memantine use over time are consistent with current practice guidelines of initiation of ChEIs in mild-to-moderate AD patients and initiation of memantine in moderate-to-severe patients.",

In a series of linear regression models, we examined the effect of race on FCI performance and identified preliminary predictor variables that mediated observed racial differences on the FCI. Prior/premorbid abilities were identified. Predictor variables examined in the models included race and other demographic factors (age, education, sex), performance on global cognitive measures (MMSE, DRS-2 Total Score), history of cardiovascular disease (hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia), and a measure of educational achievement (WRAT-3 Arithmetic). African American patients with MCI performed below white patients with MCI on 6 of the 7 FCI domains examined and on the FCI total score. WRAT-3 Arithmetic emerged as a partial mediator of group differences on the FCI, accounting for 54% of variance. In contrast, performance on global cognitive measures and history of cardiovascular disease only accounted for 14% and 2%, respectively, of the variance. Racial disparities in financial capacity seem to exist among patients with amnestic MCI. Basic academic math skills related to educational opportunity and quality of education account for a substantial proportion of the group difference in financial performance.",

A survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method was performed for 121 consecutive patients with clinically diagnosed FTLD who attended the Memory Disorder Clinic at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, Republic of Korea, between January 1995 and September 2006. The overall median survival from the onset of the first symptom was 9.6 years (95% CI=8.3-10.8 y). The survival was shortest in FTD-MND (3 y) and longest in SD (11.3 y). The median survival time of FTD (9.8 y) was shorter than that of SD and longer than that of FTD-MND and PNFA. The use of the Cox proportional-hazards model to examine the effect of demographics on survival revealed that only age at onset was associated with survival. In general, our data are comparable with those from the Western countries. However, the female proportion was greater across all subtypes of FTLD and the survival of patients with PNFA was shorter than those of other groups.",

We performed a retrospective analysis of the clinical records of all outpatients attending our memory clinic for AD or mixed AD, who had received mirtazapine (30 mg daily) with the specific purpose of inducing weight or appetite gain. Data were available for a total of 22 patients (mean age, 80.9 y, 86.4% female). The mean weight at baseline was 52.4 kg and the mean BMI was 20.5 kg/m2. 77.3% of the patients had gained weight after 3 months (mean gain, 1.93 kg or 3.9% of initial body weight) and 82.3% after 6 months (2.11 kg or 4.6%). One patient had to discontinue mirtazapine because of daytime sleepiness. Mirtazapine seems to be a safe and useful approach to counteract weight loss in AD, if possible in combination with nonpharmacological interventions. Body weight should be monitored during treatment to avoid excessive weight gain.",

The generalized estimating equation model had the MMSE scores at successive follow-up time points as dependent variables and had linear and quadratic age, follow-up time from baseline, CDR at baseline, and all the interactions among them as independent variables, controlling for MMSE at baseline, sex, race, and education. The mean age of the entire sample was 85.2±7.4 years at baseline. There were no significant interactions of linear age effects with rate of cognitive decline. The analysis of interaction of quadratic age with rate of cognitive decline showed complex relationships: in the nondemented group, there was no substantial quadratic association of age with the rate of cognitive decline (P=0.13); in the questionable demented group, the oldest subjects declined relatively faster (P=0.02); and in the demented group, the youngest and oldest subjects tended to decline relatively less than subjects in the intermediate ages (P=0.07).This study adds an additional aspect to the complexity of the association between age and rate of cognitive decline, showing that the direction and amplitude of this effect differs according to the stage along the course of cognitive decline.",

We examined the main effect of CHAT polymorphism and its interaction with apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphism in the development of AD in a well-powered elderly Korean sample. We analyzed CHAT 2384G>A polymorphism and APOE polymorphism among 736 Korean patients with probable AD and 1386 nondemented Korean controls. We tested the association between AD and CHAT genotype using a logistic regression model. In addition, we used generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction to investigate the interaction between CHAT and APOE with regard to the risk of AD. The CHAT A allele was associated with AD risk in a dose-dependent manner (odds ratio=1.40, 95% confidence interval=1.06-1.85, P=0.018 for heterozygotes; and odds ratio=3.92, 95% confidence interval=1.78-8.58, P=0.001 for homozygotes). The generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction approach identified a significant gene-gene interaction between CHAT and APOE (Balanced accuracy score=0.647, P=0.001). The CHAT A/A genotype was associated with earlier onset of AD (F=5.070, df=2, P=0.007). The CHAT A allele was associated with AD risk in a dose-dependent manner, and its interaction with the APOE ε4 allele was significant with regard to the development of AD. The CHAT A allele was also associated with earlier onset and possibly accelerated progression of AD.",

Design and Methods A case-control study (n=310; age>50 y) was conducted to determine the prevalence of 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of GAB2 (rs2373115, rs1385600, rs4945261, rs7101429, and rs7115850) in patients with AD in Chinese population of mainland China, and was investigated whether these polymorphisms are risk factors for AD. Results Our results supported a possible implication of 3 tested SNPs of GAB2 (rs4945261, rs7101429, and rs7115850) in AD in the ethnic Chinese Han, of which the maximal significance of association was at SNP rs7101429 C allele (P=4.0×10−5; odds ratio=2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-2.8), and this observed association was not affected by APOEε4 genotype. In the haplotypes analysis, the minor alleles of the 3 tested SNPs were composed of a TCG haplotype, which had a significant difference in haplotype distribution between the 2 groups (P=3.4×10−15; odds ratio=8.32; 95% confidence interval, 4.57-15.14). Conclusions Our findings implicate an association between genetic variations of GAB2 and AD in Han Chinese, and the minor alleles of the 3 tested SNPs (rs4945261, rs7101429, and rs7115850) might increase the risk of AD.",

The data used in this study was part of the Danish Alzheimer Intervention StudY. The patients were home-living patients with a clinical diagnosis, within the past 12 months, of probable AD or mixed AD; age =50 years; mini-mental state examination score =20; informed consent; and data available at 1-year follow-up. In total, 268 patients were included. We used a cut off of 4% in 1 year for defining weight loss. The mean age at inclusion was 76.1 years. Sixty-six patients (24.6%) lost more than 4% of their body weight during the study period. A logistic regression showed that an increase of 1 baseline body mass index point significantly increased the odds of weight loss by 9%. Furthermore, the results suggested a trend that for men, living alone was a risk factor for losing weight, whereas for women living with somebody was associated with a higher risk. However, further studies are pertinent within this area. As weight loss is a predictor of mortality in patients with AD, clinicians should be aware of prognostic social indicators to prevent or halt a potential negative development.",

A complete neuropsychological and neurological examination did not show deficits. A comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessment focusing on the post-stroke hospitalization period showed severe motor, cognitive and affective apathy with no depression or other neuropsychiatric symptoms. This case highlights the key role of the dorsal striatum in the development of pure apathy, possibly due to its function in regulating approach-attachment behavior, affect and initiative, which are the emotional, cognitive and motor dimensions of apathy.",

    "abstract": "In patients aged 75 years and above, dementia is associated with increased expenditure and high morbimortality. Although the incidence of dementia is well known, it is often underrecognized in primary care. We conducted a cross-sectional study in 2 areas in the southeast of France to identify the factors affecting dementia-screening implementation by the French general practitioners (GPs). In May 2008, an anonymized survey was sent by e-mail and/or post to all GPs with a large clinic practice. Two months later, reminder letters were sent. Overall, 493 GPs answered (26.8%) to self-reported behavior. Of these, 73.2% felt that annual screening was useful, although only 24.5% implemented it each year and 17.5% implemented it every 2 to 5 years. Factors that favorably influenced screening practices were: the older age of the GPs; belief in the usefulness of annual dementia screening; increased frequency of follow-up visits by elderly patients; and the proportion of dementia in the GP's practice. The main barrier to annual screening was the social problems encountered in the medical care of 75-year-old patients. Regardless of the differences in European national health policies or health care systems, all GPs encounter the same difficulties when dealing with elderly dementia patients.",

We aimed to describe change in patients’ health-related quality of life (HRQL) 6 months after referral to MASs and to examine associations with patient characteristics and use of postdiagnostic interventions. Data from 883 patients referred to 69 MASs and their informal caregivers (n=569) were collected at referral and 6 months later. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine associations of change in HRQL (DEMQOL, DEMQOL-Proxy) with patient characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and comorbidity) and use of postdiagnostic interventions (antidementia medications and nonpharmacological therapies). Mean HRQL improved, irrespective of diagnosis: self-reported HRQL increased 3.4 points (95% CI, 2.7-4.1) and proxy-reported HRQL 1.3 points (95% CI, 0.5-2.1). HRQL change was not associated with any of the patient characteristics studied. Patients with dementia (54%) receiving antidementia drugs reported greater improvement in their HRQL but those using nonpharmacological therapies reported less improvement compared with those note receiving therapy. HRQL improved in the first 6 months after referral to MASs. Research is needed to determine longer term sustainability of the benefits and the cost-effectiveness of MASs.",

Materials and Methods: American Indian participants (N=698; median age, 72 y) recruited for the Cerebrovascular Disease and its Consequences in American Indians study, an ancillary study of the Strong Heart Study cohort, were enrolled. Linear regression models assessed the relationship between magnetic resonance imaging brain volumes (total brain and hippocampi) and cognitive measures of verbal learning and recall, processing speed, verbal fluency, and global cognition. Results: After controlling for demographic and clinical factors, all volumetric measurements were positively associated with processing speed. Total brain volume was also positively associated with verbal learning, but not with verbal recall. Conversely, left hippocampal volume was associated with both verbal learning and recall. The relationship between hippocampal volume and recall performance was more pronounced among those with lower scores on a global cognitive measure. Controlling for APOE ε4 did not substantively affect the associations. Conclusions: These results support further investigation into the relationship between structural Alzheimer disease biomarkers, cognition, genetics, and vascular risk factors in aging American Indians.",

To explore its accuracy, informant report of symptoms was compared against objective measures of patient performance. Results: Adjusted analyses revealed Hispanics reported more symptoms than white informants. Informant report of symptoms was inversely correlated with patients’ global cognition in both ethnic groups. Only Hispanic report of symptoms was significantly associated with memory and language performance. Discussion: Informant report of symptoms was associated with patients’ global cognition, reflecting relatively accurate informant reports in both ethnic groups, and was stronger in Hispanics when examining memory and language.

Apart from cognitive deficits, these patients can express physical decline, which predicts adverse health outcomes. In this study, we investigated the cooccurrence of clinically relevant impairments in physical performance and CSVD in memory clinic patients. We included 131 patients with vascular brain injury, mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer disease with available 3T MRI and physical performance scores. CSVD was visually rated according to 3 subtypes and as a total burden score, composed of the presence of white matter hyperintensities (WMH), lacunar infarcts (LI), and cerebral microbleeds (MB). Physical performance was assessed with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), covering gait speed, balance, and chair stand performance. CSVD markers and impaired physical performance both occurred often. High total CSVD burdens cooccurred with impaired chair stand performances [odds ratio (OR) 2.67; 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.12-6.34)]. WMH cooccurred with impaired SPPB scores (OR, 3.76; 95% CI, 1.68-8.44), impaired gait speeds (OR, 4.11; 95% CI, 1.81-9.31) and impaired chair stand performances (OR, 5.62; 95% CI, 2.29-13.80). In memory clinic patients, high burdens of CSVD, particularly WMH, often cooccur with impairments in physical performance.

Objective: The objective of this study was to analyze the factor structure, internal consistency, reliability, and convergent validity of the Brazilian version of the Frontotemporal Dementia Rating Scale (FTD-FRS). Methods: A total of 97 individuals aged 40 years and above with &gt;2 years’ education took part in the study, 31 patients diagnosed with behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), 8 patients with primary progressive aphasia, 28 with Alzheimer disease, 8 with mild cognitive impairment, and a control group of 22 healthy subjects. The FTD-FRS was completed by family members or caregivers, and Neurologists completed the 8-item Clinical Dementia Rating for Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (CDR-FTLD) scale (6 original domains plus Language and Behavior). The Alzheimer disease and FTD patients had equivalent disease severity level. Results: The internal consistency of the FTD-FRS, estimated by Cronbach α, was 0.975 whereas test-retest reliability was 0.977. Scree plot and exploratory factor (Varimax rotation) analyses revealed the existence of 4 factors, with eigenvalues &gt;1, which together explained 77.13% of the total variance with values of 1.28 to 17.52. The domains of the Brazilian version of the FTD-FRS scale correlated with the domains of the CDR-FTLD. Conclusions: The present study is the first to document the factorial structure of the FTD-FRS and its convergent validity with the CDR-FTLD. These tools are key to determine dementia severity in FTD. The Brazilian FTD-FRS demonstrated adequate psychometric properties for use in Brazil. This instrument may contribute to disease staging in FTD and may help to document intervention-related changes.",

SCD was measured using the 12-item Everyday Cognition (ECog) scale. Using linear regression models with interaction terms, we evaluated 6 potential modifiers (age, sex, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, family history of dementia, and depressive symptoms) of the association between cognitive performance (episodic memory, executive function) and SCD.Lower episodic memory and executive function scores were associated with higher log(ECog scores) (more SCD). Older age and elevated depressive symptoms were associated with higher log(ECog scores). Age (interaction P=0.002) and education (interaction P=0.01) modified the association between executive function and log(ECog scores). Specifically, associations between executive function and log(ECog scores) were stronger among participants with more education and less pronounced among older participants.The association between cognitive performance and log(ECog scores) differed little across sociodemographic and psychological factors. SCD as measured by the ECog may be a valuable proxy for cognitive performance in diverse older adults.",

Materials and Methods: A total of 722 patients diagnosed with dementia were retrospectively screened. Fifty-seven of 98 DLB patients who received transdermal rivastigmine treatment with available serial electrocardiography and blood pressure measurements were included in the study. Baseline and follow-up measurements were compared for patients on the 9.5 to 13.3 mg/d rivastigmine dose for at least 4 weeks. Results: The mean age of the patients was 80.77±6.04, and the majority were women (63%). A total of 8 cases with bradycardia and 5 with orthostatic hypotension were detected during follow-up, and rivastigmine patch was stopped in one of those 8 patients due to symptomatic bradycardia. Nonetheless, there was no difference between baseline and follow-up measurements of the patients, including heart rate, cardiac rhythm, electrocardiographic intervals, blood pressure, pulse pressure, and postural blood pressure changes. Conclusions: Transdermal rivastigmine therapy is not associated with arrhythmogenic or hypotensive effects in the elderly patients with DLB. However, when prescribing transdermal rivastigmine, physicians should pay attention to newly emerging orthostatic hypotension during the follow-up in these patients.",

    "abstract": "The International Working Group (IWG) criteria for mild cognitive impairment have variable utility in predicting progression to dementia, partly depending on the setting. We explored an empiric approach to optimize the criteria and cutoff points in a population study.In a cohort of adults aged 65 years or older, we identified 1129 individuals with normal or only mildly impaired cognition by cognitive classification, and 1146 individuals without dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating <1). Operationally defining the IWG criterion set, we examined its sensitivity and specificity for the development of severe cognitive impairment and dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating ≥1) over 4 years. We then disaggregated the criteria and used Classification and Regression Tree analyses to identify the optimal predictive model.The operational IWG criteria had 49% sensitivity and 86% specificity for the outcome of severe cognitive impairment, and 40% sensitivity and 84% specificity for the outcome of dementia. Classification and Regression Tree modeling improved sensitivity to 82% for the cognitive outcome and 76% for the dementia outcome; specificity remained high. Memory scores were the most important predictors for both outcomes. The optimal cutoff points were around 1.0 SD below the age-education mean. The best fit was observed when prediction was modeled separately for each age-education group.Objective cognitive measurements contributed more to the prediction of dementia than subjective and functional measures. Those with less education only required memory testing, whereas those with more education required assessment of several cognitive domains. In cases in which only overall norms are available, the appropriate threshold will vary according to the individual's age and education.",

Therefore, erythrocyte abnormalities might indicate the progression of the oxidative damage in Alzheimer disease (AD). The aim of this study was to investigate erythrocyte membrane stability and plasma antioxidant status in AD. Fasting blood samples (from 17 patients with AD and 14 healthy controls) were obtained and erythrocyte membrane stability against hydrogen peroxide and 2,2'-azobis-(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH), serum Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), residual antioxidant activity or gap (GAP), erythrocyte catalase activity (CAT), erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, erythrocyte nonproteic thiols, and total plasma thiols were determined. A significant decrease in erythrocyte membrane stability to hydrogen peroxide was found in AD patients when compared with controls (P<0.05). On the contrary, CAT activity (P<0.0001) and total plasma thiols (P<0.05) were increased in patients with AD compared with controls. Our results indicate that the most satisfactory measurement of the oxidative stress level in the blood of patients with AD is the erythrocyte membrane stability to hydrogen peroxide. Reduced erythrocyte membrane stability may be further evaluated as a potential peripheral marker for oxidative damage in AD.",

    "abstract": "Most Alzheimer disease clinical trials that compare the use of health services rely on reports of caregivers. The goal of this study was to assess the accuracy of self-reports among older adults with Alzheimer disease and their caregiver proxy respondents. This issue is particularly relevant to Alzheimer disease clinical trials because inaccuracy can lead both to loss of power and increased bias in study outcomes.We compared respondent accuracy in reporting any use and in reporting the frequency of use with actual utilization data as documented in a comprehensive database. We next simulated the impact of underreporting and overreporting on sample size estimates and treatment effect bias for clinical trials comparing utilization between experimental groups.Respondents self-reports have a poor level of accuracy with κ-values often below 0.5. Respondents tend to underreport use even for rare events such as hospitalizations and nursing home stays. In analyses simulating underreporting and overreporting of varying magnitude, we found that errors in self-reports can increase the required sample size by 15% to 30%. In addition, bias in the reported treatment effect ranged from 3% to 18% due to both underreporting and overreporting errors.Use of self-report data in clinical trials of Alzheimer disease treatments may inflate sample size needs. Even when adequate power is achieved by increasing sample size, reporting errors can result in a biased estimate of the true effect size of the intervention.",

Operationalization of these stages is necessary for them to be applied in research. Methods: Cognitively normal individuals with known amyloid biomarker status were selected from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set. Participants and their caregivers provided information on subjective cognitive complaints, neurobehavioral features, and objective cognitive functioning. Patients: The sample included 101 amyloid positive (A+) and 447 amyloid negative (A−) individuals. Results: Rates of subjective cognitive complaints (A+: 34.90%, A−: 29.90%) and neurobehavioral symptoms (A+: 22.40%, A−: 22.40%) did not significantly differ between A+/− individuals. However, the frequency of transitional cognitive decline was significantly higher among A+ (38.00%) than A− participants (24.90%). We explored various empirical definitions for defining the early stages of the AC among A+ participants. Rates of classification into AC stage 1 versus AC stage 2 varied depending on the number of symptoms required: 57.40% versus 42.60% (1 symptom), 28.70% versus 71.30% (2 symptoms), and 6.90% versus 93.10% (all 3 symptoms). Conclusion: The presence of 2 of the proposed symptom classes to separate AC stage 2 from stage 1 seems to provide a good empirical balance.",

Materials and Methods: A total of 160 individuals were screened, 100 of whom were eligible (T2DM: n=51; nondiabetic: n=49). Participants were classified either as having healthy cognition (HC) or showing signs of MCI. Speech recordings were collected through a phone call. Based on automatic speech recognition, 15 temporal parameters were calculated. Results: The HC with T2DM group showed significantly shorter utterance length, higher duration rate of silent pause and total pause, and higher average duration of silent pause and total pause compared with the HC without T2DM group. Regarding the MCI participants, parameters were similar between the T2DM and the nondiabetic subgroups. Conclusions: Temporal speech characteristics of T2DM patients showed early signs of altered cognitive functioning, whereas neuropsychological tests did not detect deterioration. This method is useful for identifying the T2DM patients most at risk for manifest MCI, and could serve as a remote cognitive screening tool.",

Factors examined included delirium severity, pain, depression, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), and daytime physical activity. Multiple stepwise linear regressions evaluated factors related to dimensions of sleep quality (sleep duration, efficiency, latency, and fragmentation; measured by the MotionWatch 8). Results: Increased daytime physical activity was associated with higher sleep duration [β=0.164; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.111-0.717; P =0.008; 7.7% variance] and sleep efficiency (β=0.158; 95% CI, 0.020-0.147; P =0.010; 5.4% variance), and less sleep fragmentation (β=−0.223; 95% CI, −0.251 to −0.077; P &lt;0.001; 10.4% variance).

Existing short versions are premised upon a 1-factor or 2-factor structure or statistical techniques for item selection. Thus, there is a need for ZBI short versions that considers the multidimensional constructs of role strain, personal strain, and worry about performance (WaP) during item selection to provide a more holistic and comprehensive evaluation. Purpose: To develop and validate a short version of ZBI through a combined quantitative and qualitative approach that incorporates the validated 4-factor structure of role strain demands; role strain-control; personal strain, and WaP. Patients: We studied 202 caregivers of patients with dementia (84.2%) or mild cognitive impairment (15.8%) attending a memory clinic in Singapore. Methods: Confirmatory factor analysis and qualitative considerations from expert consensus were used for item selection. Confirmatory factor analysis fit statistics support the 4-factor structure. The 9-item ZBI-9 showed good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α=0.87) and convergent validity with anxiety and depression (Pearson correlation: Hospital Anxiety and Depression sub-scales, r≥0.56, P &lt;0.001; ZBI- 22, r=0.95, P &lt;0.001). Using a cut-off score of ≥13, ZBI-9 displayed good discriminatory ability for depressive symptoms (area under curve=0.79, P &lt;0.001; sensitivity=70%, specificity=75%). The ZBI-9 also displayed comparable performance to the 22-item full version and three 12-item short versions. Conclusion: The ZBI-9 is a multidimensional short-version assessment tool for caregivers of persons with dementia and mild cognitive impairment that is reliable, valid, and discriminates depressive symptoms.",

One mechanism implicated in AD is oxidative stress. We explored the potential association of ADNC with antioxidant vitamin supplements taken about 30 years before death. Methods: The 264 brain-autopsied participants were part of The 90+ Study, a longitudinal study of aging among people aged 90+ years, and originally members of the Leisure World Cohort Study, a population-based health study established in the 1980s. Intake of supplemental vitamins A, C, and E was collected by the Leisure World Cohort Study about 30 years before ADNC assessment. Odds ratios of ADNC (intermediate/high vs. none/low) for vitamin intake were estimated using logistic regression. Results: The adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) of ADNC was 0.52 (0.29-0.92) for vitamin E supplements and 0.51 (0.27-0.93) for vitamin C supplements. Supplemental vitamin E intake was the first variable, after education, to enter the stepwise model. Intake of vitamin A or C did not improve the model fit. Conclusions: The observed association of ADNC and supplemental vitamin E intake decades earlier suggests a beneficial effect and supports further investigation into a nutritional approach to preventing AD with vitamin supplementation.",

However, instability in this clinical diagnosis and variability in rates of progression to dementia raises questions regarding its utility for longitudinal tracking and prediction of cognitive change in PD. We examined baseline neuropsychological test and cognitive diagnosis predictors of cognitive change in PD.Persons with PD, without dementia PD (N=138) underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessment at baseline and were followed up to 2 years. Level II Movement Disorder Society criteria for PD-MCI and PD dementia (PDD) were applied annually. Composite global and domain cognitive z -scores were calculated based on a 10-test neuropsychological battery.Baseline diagnosis of PD-MCI was not associated with a change in global cognitive z -scores. Lower baseline attention and higher executive domain z -scores were associated with greater global cognitive z -score worsening regardless of cognitive diagnosis. Worse baseline domain z -scores in the attention and language domains were associated with progression to MCI or PDD, whereas higher baseline scores in all cognitive domains except executive function were associated with clinical and psychometric reversion to \"normal\" cognition.Lower scores on cognitive tests of attention were predictive of worse global cognition over 2 years of follow-up in PD, and lower baseline attention and language scores were associated with progression to MCI or PDD. However, PD-MCI diagnosis per se was not predictive of cognitive decline over 2 years. The association between higher executive domain z -scores and greater global cognitive worsening is probably a spurious result.",

    "abstract": "Aim: To determine whether exposure to neurotoxins in midlife is associated with changes in blood-based biomarkers of neurodegeneration and Alzheimer disease pathology. Methods: Blood cadmium, lead, neurofilament light (NfL) chain, total tau (TTau), and amyloid beta (Aβ) 40 and Aβ42 concentrations were measured in 1516 participants in the Beaver Dam Offspring Study. Linear mixed-effect models were used to determine associations between baseline cadmium and lead levels and baseline NfL, TTau, and Aβ42/Aβ40, and 10-year change in concentrations using repeated measures of these biomarkers as the outcome. Results: In women, higher cadmium and lead levels were associated with higher baseline TTau concentrations. A higher baseline cadmium level was associated with lower baseline Aβ42/Aβ40 in both men and women. In age-sex-adjusted models, a doubling in baseline cadmium level was associated with a 0.2% (95% CI: 0.0, 0.3) higher increase per year in NfL concentrations. In men, a doubling of baseline lead level was associated with a 0.9% (95% CI: 0.1, 1.7) higher increase per year in TTau concentration. Conclusions: Participants with relatively higher levels of cadmium and lead had blood biomarker concentrations consistent with more neuronal damage and Alzheimer disease pathology. Environmental exposure to neurotoxins may contribute to neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Background: Atypical aging in Down syndrome (DS) is associated with neuropathological characteristics consistent with Alzheimer disease. Gait abnormalities have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of dementia for the general population. The aim of this study was to determine whether gait disorders are associated with worse cognitive performance and dementia in adults with DS. Methods: We evaluated 66 individuals with DS (≥20 y of age), divided into 3 groups: stable cognition, prodromal dementia, and dementia (presumed Alzheimer disease). Each individual was evaluated with the Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA), Timed Up and Go test, and Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of Older People with Down’s Syndrome and Others with Intellectual Disabilities (CAMDEX-DS), in addition to a comprehensive clinical protocol to ascertain the occurrence of medical or psychiatric comorbidities. Results: The score on the POMA-Gait subscale score and body mass index were found to be independent predictors of prodromal dementia and dementia ( P &lt;0.001 for both). With the exception of perception, all cognitive domains correlated with the POMA-Total score ( P &lt;0.05). Conclusion: A lower POMA-Gait score increases the chance of prodromal dementia and dementia in adults with DS. Unlike other research, in this study higher body mass index was also found to increase the chance of prodromal dementia and dementia. In those individuals, applying the POMA could facilitate the early diagnosis of dementia, help identify fall risks, and promote the adoption of geriatric interventions focused on improving functional mobility.",

Previous studies have often focused on global or total WMH; less is known about associations of regional WMHs and cognitive abilities among older adults without dementia. Methods: A total of 610 older adults with normal cognition (n=302) or mild cognitive impairment (n=308) from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative underwent neuropsychological testing and magnetic resonance imaging. Linear regression models examined associations between regional WMH volumes and cognition, adjusting for age, sex, education, apolipoprotein E ε4 allele frequency, and pulse pressure. Results: Among all participants, greater regional WMH volume in all lobes was associated with poorer performance on memory and speed/executive functioning. Among participants with normal cognition, greater temporal and occipital WMH volumes were associated with poorer memory, whereas no regional WMH volumes were associated with speed/executive function. Discussion: Results show that greater regional WMH volume relates to poorer cognitive functioning—even among those with normal cognition. Together with results from previous studies, our findings raise the possibility that WMH may be a useful therapeutic target and/or important effect modifier in treatment or prevention dementia trials.",

Our aim in the current study was to investigate whether baseline sleep parameters can predict the conversion from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment or dementia at follow-up. The Hellenic Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet is a longitudinal population-based study designed to estimate the prevalence and incidence of cognitive decline and dementia in the older Greek population. Methods: A total of 955 cognitively normal older adults (aged ≥65 y) were drawn from the Hellenic Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet study. A comprehensive neurological and neuropsychological assessment was conducted at baseline and a mean of 3.1 (SD = 0.85) years later, resulting in 160 individuals diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment and 34 with dementia at follow-up, whereas 761 remained cognitively normal. Results: Using Cox regression analyses, no sleep parameters increased the risk of conversion status adjusting for demographics and clinical factors. Napping, however, decreased this risk by 19.3% ( P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: As several previous studies have proposed, napping constitutes a protective factor against cognitive decline. Thus, clinicians should encourage their elderly patients to adopt this healthy habit.",

Methods: A pre/posttest single group, multisite feasibility study, mixed methods exploratory design was applied. Primary caregivers of people with dementia in Brazil and India took a 3 to 4-hour course adapted for online delivery, with 10 to 15 caregivers. Measurements encompassed self-reports of carer competence, attitudes to dementia, and caregiver burden; satisfaction questionnaire completed immediately after the intervention; open-ended questions at 1-month follow-up to assess if caregivers applied information to caregiving role; semistructured interviews about how the intervention changed caregivers’ behavior and attitudes towards dementia. Results: Of the 70 caregivers who received the intervention (Brazil = 34; India = 36), 54 (77.1%) completed postintervention outcomes, and 39 (55.7%) completed questionnaires at 1-month follow-up assessment. Significant improvements were observed in attitudes to dementia in both countries and self-perceived carer competence (in India) postintervention. The themes from the 9 semistructured interviews were: acceptability, feasibility, change of behavior/attitude, and suggestions for future sessions. Conclusions: Dementia awareness course was a feasible online intervention to improve dementia awareness among family caregivers across countries. It offers a standardized yet flexible methodology, with promising outcomes that need to be evaluated in a full randomized controlled trial.",

Here, we assessed the effects of COVID-19 restrictions on the activities of daily living (ADL) and disease severity in patients by comparing them to a control group. Methods: We examined the impact on ADL, evaluated using disability assessment for dementia (DAD), and disease severity, evaluated using the ABC dementia scale, in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. We conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis of a double-blinded, noninferiority study of donepezil 27.5 mg patches and donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg tablets (JapicCTI-194582). After showing the noninferiority of both treatments, we combined the data from both groups for analysis. Results: The subpopulation of the per-protocol set grouped by completing the double-blinded evaluation before and on/after the mild lockdown was balanced (n=136 and n=120). Patient demographics were similar between the subgroups. The decline in the DAD and ABC dementia scale scores [least-squares mean (SE)] was ameliorated by social restriction [−3.810 (0.743) and −1.871 (0.697) and −1.147 (0.285) and −0.419 (0.267), respectively (not significant)].

Novel methodological approaches, such as causal decomposition, facilitate the assessment of contributors to health inequities through hypothetical interventions on mediating risk factors. Methods: Using harmonized cohorts (Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse Life Experiences Study; Study of Healthy Aging in African Americans) and a ratio of mediator probability weights decomposition approach, we quantified disparities in late-life cognitive test scores (semantic memory, executive function, and verbal memory z -scores) across high versus low parental education, and evaluated whether socioeconomic disparities in late-life cognitive test scores would change if the corresponding disparity in midlife hypertension were eliminated. Results: We observed substantial disparities across levels of parental education in late-life cognitive test scores (eg, =−0.72 95% CI: −0.84 to −0.60 for semantic memory). Hypothetical intervention on midlife hypertension did not substantially reduce disparities in any cognitive domain. Patterns were similar when stratified by race.

Our study included 3038 participants from 5 ongoing community-based longitudinal studies of aging and dementia at the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center. Annual evaluation included medical history, medications, collection of blood specimens, and neuropsychological testing. We created 2 time-varying variables: one for the period of persistently elevated A1C starting at the first of 2 consecutive A1C levels ≥6.5%, and another for participants’ diabetes status. Using separate mixed effect models, persistently elevated A1C was associated with higher levels of global cognition (estimate = 0.045; P = 0.03) and specifically with episodic memory (estimate = 0.082; P &lt; 0.01). Further, persistently elevated A1C was related to a faster decline in perceptual speed (estimate = −0.014; P &lt; 0.01). Persons with diabetes who had elevated A1C drove this finding (estimate = −0.02; P &lt; 0.01). Our findings suggest a differential effect of sustained hyperglycemia by cognitive domain.",

Results revealed statistically significant differences in aMCI and matched healthy controls regarding their DGI money subscale scores, with lower delay of gratification in aMCI. Correlations between brain volumes and delay of gratification reports at all 3 time points support the importance mainly of the left and right medial frontal cortices.

This study leveraged Twitter data to analyze public perceptions related to genetic testing for dementia. Methods: English tweets from January 1, 2010 to April 1, 2023, containing relevant terms, were extracted from Twitter API. A Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model was used with Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify individual and organizational users. BERT-based topic modeling was applied to identify the themes for relevant source tweets. Topic coherence was assessed through manual inspection, complemented by the Silhouette Coefficient. Manual thematic analysis, following Braun and Clarke’s approach, refined the topics and themes. Results: The analysis of 3045 original/source tweets identified 9 topics (Silhouette Coefficient=0.19), categorized into 3 main themes: (1) opinions on the appropriateness of genetic testing in dementia diagnosis; (2) discussion on the psychosocial impact; (3) discussion on genetic testing’s role in Alzheimer’s disease treatment and prevention. Theme 1 comprised 90.6% of source tweets, demonstrating prevailing contentions. Tweets in theme 2 were increasingly contributed by organization users over time and included tweets containing misinformation about genetic testing in children. Tweets in theme 3 were increasingly contributed by individual users, possibly suggesting rising public interest in the treatment and prevention of dementia. Conclusion: The study highlighted limited public understanding of the nondeterministic nature of genetic testing for dementia, with concerns about unsupervised direct-to-consumer genetic test marketing, emphasizing the need to counter misinformation and raise public awareness.",

Method: We conducted a cross-sectional evaluation of 126 participants. Memory and metamemory were assessed in each group and compared using a memory test combined with a prediction task administered before and after exposure to the scale. Results: Individuals with dementia presented impaired metamemory functioning in both short- and long-term memory evaluations. There was a general disconnect between perceived and actual performance across both groups, albeit to a lesser extent in the control group. In the control group, we found impaired metamemory when evaluating short-term memory. However, no alterations in metamemory were observed regarding long-term memory after this group had been exposed to the task. Regression analysis revealed that only awareness influenced metamemory when associated with short-term memory. Conclusions: Individuals with dementia tend to present impaired metamemory functioning, and awareness of disease appears to be a factor that can influence this impairment.",

Results: Relative to the comparison group, there were significant reductions in intervention group delirium ( P =0.001), accidents/injuries ( P =0.007), treatment for injuries ( P =0.007), psychotropic medicines ( P =0.030) and hospital readmission within 30 days ( P =0.002). After adjusting for the longer length of stay of the intervention subgroup who contracted COVID-19 (n=10), there were no group differences in length of stay ( P =0.83). Per participant service costs for comparison and intervention groups were AU$34,870 and AU$33,969, respectively, equating to a per-participant cost saving of AU$914 ( P &lt;0.0001). Conclusion: Investment in person-centered care education of direct care staff is warranted from both clinical and economic perspectives.",

    "abstract": "Background: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy, humoral immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of AADvac1 an active tau-targeted immunotherapy in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) confirmed by amyloid and tau pathology. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and CENTRAL from inception to March 2025 for randomized placebo-controlled trials assessing AADvac1 in AD. Eligible studies included adult patients with biomarker-confirmed AD. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effects models. Results: Five trials (n=667) were included, of which 391 received AADvac1 and 276 received placebo. Pooled analyses showed a robust IgG response (IgG seroconversion rate: 99%, 95% CI: 95%-100%) with predominance of IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses. AADvac1 did not improve MMSE (MD: –0.49; 95% CI: –2.40 to 1.41) but showed trends favoring improvement in ADAS-Cog11 and verbal fluency. The vaccine was well tolerated, with injection site reactions being the most frequent adverse event. No increased risk of serious infections, cerebral edema, or mortality was observed. Conclusions: AADvac1 demonstrates robust immunogenicity and an acceptable safety profile in early-phase trials. Cognitive benefits remain inconclusive. Larger, long-term trials are needed to confirm its clinical efficacy and long-term safety in AD.",

    "abstract": "Lecanemab is the first disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) approved in China. However, the factors affecting patient and caregiver willingness to adopt this novel treatment have not been assessed yet. To investigate the factors influencing both treatment willingness and willingness-to-pay for lecanemab among Chinese AD patients and their caregivers. We surveyed 195 AD patients and their caregivers using structured questionnaires assessing key factors influencing treatment willingness, including efficacy (Wefficacy), adverse effects (Wadverse), inconvenience (Winconvenience), cost (Wcost), overall willingness to treat (Wtreat), and amount willing to pay (Wamount). Additional variables included income, cognitive and functional assessments, caregiver burden (ZBI), health status (HS), education levels (patient/caregiver: edu, edu.c), psychiatric symptoms (PSY), and satisfaction with conventional treatments (effect). Network analysis mapped variable inter-relationships. Wtreat showed a strong direct association with Wcost (0.99). Wefficacy and Winconvenience indirectly influenced Wtreat through Wcost (Wefficacy-Winconvenience: 1.5, Winconvenience-Wcost: 1.12, Wcost-Wtreat: 0.99). Income (0.48) and effect (0.51) directly impacted Wtreat. Edu, edu.c, CDR, PSY, ZBI, and HS were indirectly correlated with Wtreat. Wamount was directly associated with Wtreat (0.31), Wcost (0.68), and Wadverse (0.16). Wefficacy and Winconvenience indirectly influenced Wamount through Wcost (Wefficacy- Winconvenience: 1.5, Winconvenience-Wcost: 1.12, Wcost-Wamount: 0.68). Network stability tests (CS >0.50) confirmed robustness. This study demonstrates that reducing payment barriers has a greater impact on real-world adoption of innovative therapies than clinical efficacy alone. Addressing financial constraints also enhances patients' willingness to pay. These findings provide evidence-based insights for developing patient-centered clinical decision pathways.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Previous research has shown that exercise can produce cognitive benefits through neuroplastic mechanisms in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study builds on prior research by identifying biomarkers of neurological-related proteins that mediate improvement in processing speed in different exercise environments, water-based and land-based, in older adults with MCI. Methods: Plasma protein levels were measured using SomaScan’s Neuroscience panel, which includes 1316 analytes. Processing speed was measured using well-validated neuropsychological measures, including the Trail Making Test Trails A (TMT-A), the Stroop Color (SC) and Word (SW) trials, and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). Primary analyses consisted of linear mixed effects models to determine the impact of exercise-induced proteomic changes on processing speed measures. Results: After water-based exercise, KIF3C and TBX3 were found to mediate improvement in SC, a rapid automatic color-naming task. By contrast, after land-based exercise, none of the proteins analyzed were found to mediate improvement in processing speed. Conclusions: These findings support the continued exploration of water-based exercise as a cognitive intervention for older MCI adults. In addition, these results suggest differences in underlying neuroplasticity-related mechanisms in land-based and water-based exercise.",

This study investigated the association between PA and cognitive performance using self-reported and objectively measured PA and compared if differences between measures were associated with cognitive performance. Methods: We used data from the 2017 to 19 wave of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health. PA was self-reported using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and evaluated objectively with a triaxial accelerometer. The discrepancy between self-reported and objectively measured PA was calculated as the difference between the two measures. Cognitive assessment evaluated memory, verbal fluency, and executive function. Linear regression evaluated the associations of self-reported, objectively measured, and the difference between these two measures with cognitive performance. Results: In 8873 participants (56% women, 41% Black/Mixed race, and 58% college educated), the mean self-reported and objectively measured time engaged in PA was 2.7 hours/week and 5.6 hours/week, respectively. There was no association of self-reported or objectively measured PA with cognitive performance. There was no association of under-reporting or over-reporting of PA with cognitive performance.

    "abstract": "Background: Accumulating evidence suggests that the incidence of cancer and dementia are inversely associated. Bias does not appear to fully account for the relationship, but causal explanations have not been adequately investigated. We thus considered a possible inverse shared genetic basis. Methods: We constructed polygenic risk scores for cancer (PRS cancer ) and Alzheimer disease (PRS AD ) in European ancestry UK Biobank (UKB) and Health and Retirement Study (HRS) participants aged 60 years or older. Linear mixed-effects models evaluated associations of PRS cancer with cognition, and logistic regression evaluated associations of PRS AD with cancer. Results: In UKB, PRS cancer was nominally associated with improved fluid intelligence ( β : 0.12, 95% CI: 0.01-0.22). Twelve variants in PRS cancer , including 7 in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex, were positively associated with fluid intelligence, and 7 were inversely associated ( P &lt;5.8×10 -5 ). PRS cancer and its contributing variants were not associated with cognitive outcomes in HRS. PRS AD was not associated with cancer risk in either study cohort. Discussion: Though not conclusive, the direction of the association between PRS cancer and fluid intelligence was consistent with our a priori hypothesis that cancer risk variants would decrease cognitive decline. The association pattern with HLA-related variants suggests potential relevance of immune surveillance for the inverse association between dementia and cancer.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) affects several abilities that are crucial to automobile driving and can thereby increase the risk for a crash. The specific driver safety errors that lead up to crashes in this driver population, however, remain largely unknown. We developed a graphical means for dissecting these safety-related behaviors for application to car crashes of AD drivers. These crashes occurred in collision avoidance scenarios implemented on the Iowa Driving Simulator. Crash plots were produced by \"rewinding\" the data stream, then graphing the vehicle speed, path, steering wheel position, pedal positions, and driver gaze up to the very moment of impact. In this way, we were able to display in detail the patterns of vehicle and driver control to determine exactly how a crash occurred. Several different types of antecedent safety errors were noted, ranging from responding inappropriately with the hand and foot controls to not responding at all. In this paper we focus on the performance of a single impaired driver to demonstrate our technique and findings. Understanding the \"anatomy\" of crashes in cognitively disabled drivers with AD can help guide future efforts at injury prevention and control.",

Patients with mild to moderate dementia were randomly assigned to placebo, eptastigmine 10 mg three times a day (t.i.d.), or eptastigmine 15 mg t.i.d. over 25 weeks. The Alzheimer Disease Assessment Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) and the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus (CIBIC-Plus) were the primary outcome measures for efficacy. Twenty-six centers recruited 320 patients: 106 on placebo, 105 on eptastigmine 10 mg t.i.d., and 109 on eptastigmine 15 mg t.i.d. Six patients on placebo (6%), 18 patients on eptastigmine 10 mg t.i.d. (17%), and 10 patients on eptastigmine 15 mg t.i.d. (9%) discontinued study treatment. The intent-to-treat analysis on 315 patients showed a statistically significant (p = 0.047) difference of 2.0 points on ADAS-Cog between the placebo and the eptastigmine 15 mg t.i.d. group at the end of treatment. Patients in the 10 mg t.i.d. group performed better than did placebo-treated patients on the Spontaneous Behavior Interview (SBI) total scores (p = 0.015) and on the Activities of Daily Living (ADL, p = 0.043) and Behavioral Problems (BP, p = 0.028) subscales. The differences in favor of the eptastigmine groups on the CIBIC-Plus did not reach statistical significance. In a post hoc subgroup analysis by staging, the effect size of eptastigmine was found to be greater in the most severely impaired patients (Global Deterioration Scale rating of 4 and 5 at screening) reaching statistical significance in both ADAS-Cog (p = 0.007) and CIBIC-Plus (p = 0.038). In this patient subgroup (n = 222), there was also a significant effect of eptastigmine on SBI (p = 0.019). The drug was generally well tolerated, with 8% of patients withdrawing due to adverse events versus 5% on placebo. Adverse events were recorded in 35 patients (33%) on placebo compared with 41 (39%) on eptastigmine 10 mg t.i.d. and 38 (35%) on eptastigmine 15 mg t.i.d. This study shows that eptastigmine doses up to 15 mg t.i.d. for 25 weeks are well tolerated. The drug positively affects cognitive performance of Alzheimer patients. This effect appears greater in more severely impaired patients and also impacts on their behavioral performance.",

Participants were videotaped during their pre-and posttest counseling sessions, as well as when the results were given. Half of these were then interviewed in their homes. Changes that accompanied the receipt of decreased risk suggested that counseling as well as the genetic information led the participants through a rite of passage. The most significant changes seemed to be in relation to other family members. Application to persons at risk for AD needs to be qualified, since persons at risk for AD will not usually have as well developed a sense of \"family risk,\" and are less likely to receive as definite a reduced risk. In diagnostic testing for AD, a substitute decision-maker will often be involved. An unavoidable result is that some of the related substitute decision-makers will receive results which may have, or be mistaken to have, predictive value. Substitute decision-makers must therefore be included in genetic counseling, and the psychosocial effects of their participation must be evaluated.",

Because abnormal glucose metabolism has been reported in both in vivo and in vitro studies of the brain, we examined glucose and glutamine oxidation and lactate production in cultured skin fibroblasts from nine patients with familial AD, 19 with sporadic AD, and 20 age-matched controls. The production of CO2 from glucose and glutamine was significantly lower in both groups of Alzheimer fibroblasts compared to controls after 10 min or 1, 2, and 4 h of incubation. The reduction in CO2 production was most evident after 1 h of incubation with either (U-4C)-glucose or (U-4C)-glutamine. Lactate concentration was comparable in all groups at any time of incubation. These findings suggest that processes that require mitochondrial function as glucose or glutamine oxidation are altered in AD and provide evidence that complex metabolic differences are expressed in cultured nonneuronal cells from Alzheimer patients.",

To determine the occurrence of cancer in Alzheimer patients as well as in non-Alzheimer elderly controls, we examined autopsy reports of 575 control and 71 Alzheimer cases aged 50–100 years for histologic evidence of cancer. We compared expected rates of cancers calculated from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Result (SEER) Program data to rates observed at autopsy using a chi-squared test. To determine whether there was an association between the occurrence of cancer and Alzheimer disease, we compared rates for all cancer and three specific cancers in Alzheimer and control patients using an odds ratio test. We found from fourfold to 98-fold more cancer in Alzheimer patients and controls than that expected from SEER data. There was no statistical difference in the autopsy incidence of total, lung, or prostate cancer between Alzheimer patients and controls. However, the occurrence of pancreatic cancer was 6.7-fold higher in Alzheimer patients than in control subjects. Controlling for multiple comparisons, the odds ratio for pancreatic cancer in Alzheimer's disease was significantly higher than in controls (p < 0.001). Our results indicate that cancer occurs more frequently than expected in both Alzheimer patients and control subjects. In addition, there may be an association between the occurrence of certain cancers and Alzheimer's disease.",

Recently, a polymorphic triplet (CGG) in the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDL-R) gene, coding for a receptor binding only apoE-containing lipoproteins, was associated with AD in a Japanese population but not in Caucasian American populations. We explored this association and the potential interaction with the APOE polymorphism in a Caucasian sample of sporadic AD and control subjects of similar ages of European origin. The allelic distribution of the VLDLR polymorphism differed significantly between Japanese and Caucasian populations (p < 0.0001). However, in our population, the presence of at least one VLDL-R 5 repeat allele increased significantly (p < 0.0003) the probability to develop AD after 65 years of age in APOE ε4 allele bearers.",

    "abstract": "Summary: The aim of the present study was to determine the longitudinal course of behavioral disturbances and to examine whether these disturbances are stage dependent during the course of Alzheimer disease (AD). One hundred seven community-dwelling patients with probable AD were assessed up to six times annually by using a validated and reliable rating scale, the Troublesome Behavior Scale, for assessing the frequencies of behavioral disturbances. The subjects were divided into three groups according to their baseline global function as assessed by the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR; 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). At the end of the 5-year observation period, 31 subjects were still active participants, 52 had died, 20 lived in institutions, and 4 had stopped participating. The patterns of their behavioral disturbance changes depended to a considerable extent on the baseline severity of the illness. The behavioral disturbance frequencies generally peaked at the CDR 2 stage and followed a downward trend thereafter. Considerable individual variations in the disturbance frequencies during the course of the illness were observed. Knowing the behavioral course of AD will enable clinicians to better counse1 families and appraise the results of treatments for behavioral symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Age-related memory impairment, a cognitive decline not clearly related to any gross pathology, is progressive and widespread in the population, although not universal. While the mechanisms of learning and memory remain incompletely understood, the study of their molecular mechanisms is already yielding promising approaches toward therapy for such \"normal\" declines in the efficiency of learning. This review presents the rationale and results for two such approaches. One approach, partial inhibition of the type IV cAMP specific phosphodiesterase, appears to act indirectly. Although little evidence supports an age-related decline in this system, considerable evidence indicates that this approach can facilitate the transition from short-term to long-term memory and thus counterbalance defects in long-term memory, which may be due to other causes. A second approach, inhibition of l-type voltage gated calcium channels (LVGCCs) may be a specific corrective for a molecular pathology of aging, as substantial evidence indicates that an ongoing increase occurs throughout the lifespan in the density of these channels in hippocampal pyramidal cells, with a concomitant reduction in cellular excitability. Because LVGCCs are also crucial to extinction, a paradigm of inhibitory learning, age-related memory impairment may be an unfortunate side effect of a developmental process necessary to the maturation of the ability to suppress inappropriate behavior, an interpretation consistent with the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging.",

The biochemical basis for Alzheimer disease is not completely understood, but both positron-emission tomography and single-photon-emission computed tomography provide insights into the in vivo biochemistry associated with this disease. Both techniques show characteristic brain abnormalities, which consist of reductions in temporal–parietal metabolism that progress in severity and extent as the disease itself shows clinical progression.

Since neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques, a hallmark of AD, are also present in older patients with Down syndrome (DS), a close relationship between the two diseases has been suggested. IgG type of brain reactive antibodies (BRAs) are present in a majority of patients with AD but such studies have not been carried out in adult patients with DS. The present study was carried out to test the hypothesis that if the brain changes in older patients with DS and patients with AD are identical, the occurrence and specificity of BRAs should be similar in both diseases. The frequency of BRAs was studied in sera obtained from 21 patients with AD, 26 older patients with DS, and 20 normal control subjects using electroblots prepared from rat spinal cord proteins. Circulating BRAs were found in 57% of patients with AD, 81% of patients with DS, and 30% of normal controls. However, the pattern of BRA reactivity was different in AD and DS. In AD, antibodies reacted with the 200-kDa subunit of neurofilament triplet singly or in combination with the 150-kDa, 70-kDa or with the associated 62-kDa protein. In DS, BRAs always reacted with the 70-kDa protein, usually in combination with the 200-kDa subunit and, less frequently, in association with the other subunits. No specific pattern of antibody activity was evident in the control group.",

In AD the number of neurons were reduced to 97%, 79%, 83% and 78% of the control values from the medial to lateral SN respectively.

The number of lateral neurons showed a negative correlation with the severity of rigidity and hypokinesia, whereas tremor had a positive correlation.

A similar effect was found in neuronal nicotinic ACh receptors (alpha4beta2 and alpha7). In contrast, the other nootropic agents such as piracetam and aniracetam had no potentiating action on the receptors. A sustained enhancement in the activity of nicotinic ACh receptors induced by nefiracetam caused a marked increase in the glutamate release, leading to a long-term potentiation-like facilitation of hippocampal synaptic transmissions. One of the consistent neuropathologic features of the Alzheimer brain is a loss of nicotinic ACh receptors. This fact, together with the results of our study, raises the possibility that the loss of nicotinic ACh receptors may be a key factor in the decline of cognitive function observed in Alzheimer disease and that agents targeting neuronal nicotinic ACh receptors like nefiracetam could, therefore, be of great therapeutic importance.",

Fifty-two probable AD patients were recruited for the study. Twenty-seven VaD patients and 35 age-matched normal older adults (NC) were included as controls. All subjects underwent a battery of standardized neuropsychological tests. The MRI-based quantification technique was used to measure the volumes and T2 relaxation time (T2) of medial temporal lobe structures. Stepwise discriminant analyses showed cognitive indicators had a sensitivity ranging from 82% to 100% and specificity from 82% to 97% for differentiating AD from non-AD cases (VaD and normal controls), and the quantitative MRI-based measurements of medial temporal lobe structures correctly classified AD cases from non-AD cases with sensitivity from 80% to 96% and specificity from 83% to 97%. ROC curve analyses showed that the combination of cognitive and MRI measurements slightly increased the diagnostic accuracy of AD. The results suggest that both cognitive indicators and MRI-based medial temporal lobe measurements may be useful in differentiating AD from VaD and normal older adults. The combination of these possible indicators is promising in the early diagnosis of AD.",

In developing animal models of AD, the authors and others have been able to reproduce extracellular amyloid pathology in the brains of mice by expressing mutant amyloid precursor proteins (APP). The co-expression of APP with mutant presenilin leads to a dramatic acceleration in Aβ deposition, leading to very high amyloid burdens in mice. In the current study, the authors have examined whether the brains of mice with high burdens of amyloid deposition also contain aggregated forms of tau, using a cellulose acetate filter trap assay. Although discrete accumulations of phosphorylated tau immunoreactivity were apparent in neurites proximal to cored deposits of Aβ, little if any of this tau was in a SDS-resistant state of aggregation. By contrast, the brains of AD patients contained large amounts of aggregated tau. Overall, this study demonstrates that, in mice, deposition of Aβ does not cause endogenous tau to aggregate.",

The Dementia Severity Scale is designed to measure deficits in activities of daily living (ADL), behavioral disturbances, and the caregiver's perception of the patient's current cognitive abilities.Community dwelling caregiver/patient dyads were recruited from 12 clinical sites. Patients had a primary dementia diagnosis for at least one year. In this cross-sectional study, caregivers were administered the Dementia Severity Scale, the Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD), the Progressive Deterioration Scale (PDS), and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Patients were administered the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the QOL-AD. To evaluate test-retest reliability, 25% of caregivers were randomized to a second visit.One hundred eighty-three caregiver/patient dyads were recruited. Mean caregiver age was 67.5; mean patient age was 78.8; 93% of patients had probable Alzheimer disease. Eighty-eight (48.1%) patients were male. Exploratory factor analysis established 6 subscales (Activities of Daily Living [ADL], Instrumental ADL [IADL], Communication, Agitation, Memory, and Disorganized Thinking). Cronbach's alphas ranged from 0.82 to 0.90 for the 6 subscales. Test-retest reliability was good with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.79 to 0.89. DSS subscales were moderately-to-highly correlated with the QOL-AD, NPI, MMSE, and PDS. Subscales significantly discriminated among severity levels of dementia, identified by both physician ratings and MMSE scores.The Dementia Severity Scale demonstrated excellent psychometric properties and appears to be useful both in clinical practice and research endeavors.

    "abstract": "In patients with dementias including Alzheimer disease (AD), elevated blood concentrations of homocysteine are common, often going along with low normal folate and vitamin B12. Immune activation leading to oxidative stress also seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. To find out a possible relationship between immune activation and the development of moderate hyperhomocysteinemia, we determined serum concentrations of homocysteine, folate, vitamin B12 and immune activation markers 75 kD soluble TNF receptor (sTNF-R75) and neopterin in 38 patients with clinically diagnosed AD. A subgroup of patients (45%) presented with increased homocysteine concentrations in comparison to reference ranges in healthy controls of similar age. Also, concentrations of immune activation markers were elevated in a significant proportion of patients. In 17 patients with moderate hyperhomocysteinemia, concentrations of neopterin were higher than in those with lower homocysteine (p < 0.001). Homocysteine correlated with folate (rs= −0.43; p < 0.01) and neopterin (rs= 0.506; p < 0.001). The data suggest that immune activation and concomitant production of reactive oxygen species in patients with AD could be involved in the development of hyperhomocysteinemia via an enhanced decomposition of folate.",

    "abstract": "Recruitment and retention of African Americans into Alzheimer disease (AD) research studies poses challenges owing to long-standing socio-economic and cultural differences, pragmatic difficulties in reaching the African American population, and a legacy of distrust of medical research. In this study, we report on our efforts to use live theater to educate African Americans about AD research and to increase minority participation in it. We describe our experiences at the University Memory and Aging Center (Cleveland, OH) in commissioning, writing, and producing several theater productions focused on themes related to African Americans and their experiences dealing with family members with AD. Analysis of recruitment data, gathered before and after one of our productions, indicated that minority enrollment into our Center's Research Registry increased after the play. Survey data, gathered before and after production of a different play, indicated that viewing this piece increased knowledge about: (1) the symptoms of AD; (2) the fact that memory loss is not a part of normal aging; and (3) the greater prevalence of AD among African Americans. Also, after viewing this production, more audience members: (1) reported knowing how to become involved in research; (2) felt comfortable involving family members in research; and (3) would recommend research to others. We conclude that live theater that dramatizes the experiences of a family living with a person with AD can increase knowledge about AD, improve attitudes about taking part in research, and lead to greater participation in AD research studies. An explanatory model is offered to account for our findings.",

We also assessed their caregivers' awareness of their abilities. Overall, 44% of the patients did not demonstrate how to call for help correctly if they had no written telephone number to call, and 18% did not when they had a written number. There was an association between the abilities of the patients and their Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, with the patients with the lowest scores having the most difficulty (P < 0.0001). Surprisingly, 21% of those with MMSE scores 26-30 did not use the telephone correctly when they had no written number. Of the caregivers, 31% were incorrect in predicting their patients' abilities for the first task, and 11% were incorrect in predicting the second task. We conclude that AD patients lose their ability to use the telephone to call for help as their illness progresses. Furthermore, many caregivers are unaware of their patients' impairment. These findings highlight safety concerns in AD and suggest that caregivers could benefit from education about potential patient losses.",

    "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the feasibility of longitudinal assessment and the psychometric properties of both established and new outcome measures used in clinical trials of patients with dementia in a cohort of Spanish-speaking elders in the United States. Methods This is a prospectively collected multicenter study comparing patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) (N=77) and elderly controls (N=17) who are primary Spanish speakers. Spanish-speaking individuals with AD (SSI AD) were selected to represent predefined categories of impairment as determined by a Mini-Mental State Examination score. Controls were selected to approximately match by age and education (SSI C). Subjects were administered a series of Spanish translations of established outcome measures (Mini-Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating, Geriatric Dementia Scale), and Functional Assessment Staging (FAST)] and new outcome measures developed for United States in clinical trials to assess cognition, function, behavioral disturbance, and clinical global change. Half of the subjects were assessed at 1 and 2 months to evaluate reliability; all subjects were assessed at 6 and 12 months. Comparisons were made between patients and controls and between the Spanish-speaking cohort and a similar English-speaking cohort. Results The 12-month completion rate was 77%, with a trend toward greater impairment in those with full retention. Both established and new measures demonstrated good internal consistency and test-retest reliability in this cohort. All but one measure of cognition demonstrated excellent discriminability between AD subjects and controls. The SSI AD cohort declined significantly on measures of cognition, function, and clinical global change over the 12-month assessment period. The SSI AD and English AD (ESI AD) cohorts declined equivalently on the most common outcomes in clinical trials of AD (delayed recall, clinical global change). Likewise, the most common behavioral changes were also similar in the ESI and SSI groups. However, the annual change was lower in SSI AD than in the ESI AD on several other measures of cognition and function. Conclusions These results support the recruitment of Spanish-speaking patients and the use of Spanish language translations for use in the clinical trials for AD.",

Those with symptoms of memory loss and impaired performance on memory tests are at high risk of progression to Alzheimer disease. The relative importance of different aspects of the clinical history in predicting cognitive impairment is uncertain. Methods Fifty-six patients with symptoms of memory loss were recruited from the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. A clinician recorded type and duration of memory symptoms as perceived by the patient and their informant, and use of memory aids. All patients subsequently underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychologic testing. Findings (i) Informant, but not patient, ratings of memory were associated with performance on tests of memory function and with hippocampal size on MRI. (ii) Decreased use of memory aids and shorter duration of memory symptoms were more common in those with memory impairment. Interpretation In a clinical setting, information gathered from the history was associated with cognitive impairment on memory testing and brain appearances on MRI. The history from a close informant is particularly important being more strongly predictive of cognitive impairment (P=0.0002) than subjective symptoms, use of memory aids or duration of symptoms.",

However, a better understanding of their operational specificities may enhance the CBU and APU synergies. Objectives To describe one of the first CBU experiments, with regard to preexisting BPSD management in an APU in the same geriatric hospital. Participants A total of 129 patients with BPSD, 35 from the CBU and 94 admitted to the APU before opening the colocated CBU. Results Patients from the CBU often showed comorbidities and a lower nutritional status, but these conditions were more frequent in the APU (P≤10−4). Severe dementia, night time and aberrant motor behavior, and agitation were more frequent in the CBU (P≤0.0015). In both the units, about 80% of patients were improved without increased use of psychotropic medications and there was a high discharge rate back home of about 30%. Conclusions These findings that are still preliminary support a particular role for the CBU for elderly patients showing the most advanced dementia and disruptive BPSD. Colocated APU and CBU may allow for more effective integration of medical and psychiatric care in elderly patients with BPSD with frequent comorbidities.",

The presence of the apolipoprotein ε4 allele, the only confirmed genetic risk factor for late-onset AD (LOAD), is neither sufficient nor necessary to explain all occurrences of the disease. Aberrant expression of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) gene has been demonstrated in degenerating neurons and glial cells in brains with AD. Molecular epidemiologic studies have presented contradictory results concerning a potential role of NOS3 gene G894T polymorphism in AD. To define a possible association of this polymorphism with LOAD in an Iranian population, we conducted a case-control study including a clinically well-defined group of 100 LOAD patients and 100 age-matched controls. G894T polymorphism in NOS3 gene was determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms assay. Chi-square analysis showed a significantly increased number of individuals with the G/G genotype in AD patients compared with controls (P<0.05). These results demonstrate an association between G894T polymorphism and LOAD in an Iranian sample and the G/G genotype seems to have some effects in the development of AD either alone or through interaction with other risk factors.",

The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between inflammatory aspects of diet and incident AD risk. About 2258 nondemented elderly (age ≥ 65) in New York who provided dietary information at baseline were followed-up prospectively for AD development. We examined the composite total Inflammation Factor Rating (tIFR), as a measure of inflammatory impact of foods, in relation with (i) serum level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and (ii) risk of incident AD using Cox proportional hazard model. The tIFR was not associated with serum hsCRP level. After an average of 4.0 years of follow-up, 262 participants developed incident AD. The tIFR was not associated with AD risk: compared with the lowest tertile of tIFR (most proinflammatory), hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for the highest tertile (most anti-inflammatory) was 0.97 (0.69-1.35) (P-for-trend=0.71), in the adjusted model. We conclude that tIFR might not be a biologically relevant measure of the inflammatory impact of the diet. In addition, although it remains possible that tIFR might be related with some other aspects of inflammation not captured by hsCRP, lack of association with AD risk suggests its limited clinical utility.",

    "abstract": "Little is known regarding factors associated with soluble amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) concentrations in humans at late midlife, when Aβ is likely most critical to Alzheimer disease pathogenesis. We examined the association between insulin, insulin-related factors, and plasma Aβ at late midlife. Plasma Aβ42, Aβ40, fasting insulin, and c-peptide were measured in 468 women without diabetes, aged 59 to 69 years (median 63 y). Before blood draw, participants reported body mass index, waist circumference, physical activity, alcohol intake, hypertension, and diabetes family history. Linear regression was used to calculate age-adjusted mean differences in Aβ42 to Aβ40 ratio, and Aβ42 levels, by insulin and insulin-related factors. The ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40 was statistically significantly lower in women with family history of diabetes, and Aβ42 was significantly lower with less physical activity, greater waist circumference, hypertension, and family history of diabetes (P<0.05 for all). Aβ42 to Aβ40 ratio, and Aβ42 levels, appeared lower with higher c-peptide levels (P trend=0.07 and 0.06, respectively), although these were not statistically significant. In summary, insulin-related factors appear associated with lower plasma Aβ42 to Aβ40 ratio, and Aβ42, at late midlife, consistent with increased brain sequestration of Aβ42 (relative to Aβ40), suggesting insulin merits focus in strategies to prevent dementia.",

    "abstract": "Care plans are intended to improve the independence and functioning of patients with cognitive dysfunction and support the caregivers involved. They are an integral part of the Belgian reimbursement procedure for cholinesterase inhibitors. This nationwide, multicenter, observational study examined the content and implementation of the care plan along with patient satisfaction in community-dwelling patients newly diagnosed with Alzheimer disease in Belgium. The patients' opinion of their quality of life was measured using Anamnestic Comparative Self-Assessment (ACSA) scale. A total of 720 participants (453 female) were enrolled with 86.0% (619/719) living at home alone or with their spouse/partner. Cognitive problems (627/717, 87.4%) were the main reason for initiation of the consultation. Most patients had a caregiver (646/719, 89.8%): generally the spouse/partner (351/646, 54.3%) or a child (232/646, 35.9%). A total of 511 patients (71.0%) were prescribed a cholinesterase inhibitor after the initial consultation. A total of 236 care plans were advised with 169 (71.6%) realized and 157 of these (92.9%) considered adequate. Most patients were satisfied with the help received in the care plan (service satisfaction range, 80.0% to 98.6% of patients). Quality of life as rated by the patient significantly increased between baseline (average ACSA score: 5.2±2.4) and follow-up (5.8±2.1). The use of care plans appears to improve management of care for Alzheimer disease patients.",

The Mini-Mental State Examination, Digit Symbol subtest (DigSm) of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised, and Trail-Making Test A were administered for 80 patients with AD to assess global function, attention, and executive function, respectively. The same tests and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale were conducted after treatment with oral donepezil (5 mg/d) for 6 months (study 1). [C]-Donepezil positron emission tomography examinations were conducted before and after treatment for 30 randomly selected patients. The distribution volume (DV), which indicates the density of donepezil-binding sites, was calculated using Logan graphical analysis (study 2). In study 1, 35 patients were identified as responders based on the CGI and Mini-Mental State Examination changes. These patients had higher baseline DigSm scores compared with nonresponders. In study 2, 15 patients were responders. DigSm correlated with DV at baseline. DV at baseline and %DV change in responders were higher than in nonresponders, and these variables correlated with ΔDigSm and CGI scores. Higher baseline attention may predict responsiveness to donepezil in patients with AD, and higher acetylcholinesterase levels result in a greater clinical effect.",

    "abstract": "Although barriers to research participation present challenges for researchers trying to recruit participants, community-based organizations typically have a relationship with and access to potential participants, but often lack information about local studies recruiting participants and/or specifics about studies, how to describe them and how to refer their clients to a study. Therefore, a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR)model of collaboration may be a mutually advantageous option for recruiting participants to Alzheimer disease research. The broad goal of this study was to assess whether this void could be bridged and relationships developed between the Alzheimer's Association of Greater Indiana and researchers at the Indiana Alzheimer Disease Center, and improve flow of information to increase research participation to any or all of 4 projects recruiting research participants at the time. Of the 257 Helpline callers who received information about the 4 local studies recruiting participants, 4 family caregivers called the research coordinators and 2 participants were enrolled into 2 separate studies. One person was interested and had completed and returned initial paperwork but had not yet scheduled a screening visit. The National Cell Repository for Alzheimer Disease received 0 calls (participation in National Cell Repository for Alzheimer Disease was 1 of the 4 projects offered to potential participants). Active CBPR is a good goal to strive toward. Community partners are critical to gain access to potential participants for our research. Despite the low number of recruits to Indiana Alzheimer Disease Center studies, this CBPR project was considered a success. Distributing information about local studies to family members and persons with dementia using the Alzheimer's Association of Greater Indiana Helpline was seen as important by the family members in this study. The Helpline may prove to be an excellent mechanism to do this once revisions are made to improve the efficiency of the methodology and address several limitations of this study. In particular, the Institutional Review Board had approved only the patient/family caregiver call the clinical trial coordinators. We believe if the clinical trial coordinator could call the caregivers with information about studies and projects, recruitment, and retention through the Helpline would be more successful.",

An event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment was conducted while participants discriminated between famous and nonfamous faces. We compared the results of 32 healthy controls [17 ApoE ε4 carriers (E4+); 15 noncarriers (E4-)] with those of 30 patients with aMCI (16 E4+; 14 E4-). Despite comparable task performance, patients with aMCI, E4+ showed significantly less activation in a large cortical network including the left parahippocampal gyrus than patients with aMCI E4-. Furthermore, in the aMCI group, we found significantly reduced activation in the left parahippocampal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex compared with the control group. Our results show that critical regions of the brain show functional decline associated with major risk factors, such as ApoE ε4 allele and neuropsychological signs of aMCI for the development of Alzheimer disease. Importantly, the ApoE genotype seems to influence cortical activation in patients with aMCI and to a lesser degree in healthy controls as well, who are without any cognitive symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Computerized cognitive assessment tools may facilitate early identification of dementia in the primary care setting. We investigated primary care physicians' (PCPs') views on advantages and disadvantages of computerized testing based on their experience with the Computer Assessment of Mild Cognitive Impairment (CAMCI). Over a 2-month period, 259 patients, 65 years and older, from the family practice of 13 PCPs completed the CAMCI. Twelve PCPs participated in an individual interview. Generally, PCPs felt that the relationship between them and their patients helped facilitate cognitive testing; however, they thought available paper tests were time consuming and not sufficiently informative. Despite concerns regarding elderly patients' computer literacy, PCPs noticed high completion rates and that their patients had generally positive experiences completing the CAMCI. PCPs appreciated the time-saving advantage of the CAMCI and the immediately generated report, but thought the report should be shortened to 1 page and that PCPs should receive training in its interpretation. Our results suggest that computerized cognitive tools such as the CAMCI can address PCPs' concerns with cognitive testing in their offices. Recommendations to improve the practicality of computerized testing in primary care were suggested.",

Methods: Twenty-seven individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 26 healthy elderly drivers participated in a driving simulator study.

Results: According to the applied mixed analysis of variance model, the MCI patients presented increased difficulties in estimating their driving performance to a greater extent in the rural environment in comparison with the urban condition.

Frequency of endorsement for sexual disinhibition differed depending upon item wording and nature of the caregiver relationship, including higher endorsement by spouses overall.Inquiring generally about disinhibition may under-identify presence of sexual disinhibition. Lack of standardization may contribute to inconsistent frequency rates and characterization of this problem. More work is needed to better understand and identify sexual disinhibition in dementia.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are both common in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease (AD). Studies have shown that some NPS such as apathy and depression are a key indicator for progression to AD. Methods: We compared Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total score and NPI subdomain score between mild cognitive impairment-converters (MCI-C) and mild cognitive impairment-nonconverters (MCI-NC) longitudinally for 6 years using the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. In addition to the NPI, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were also compared to find out if MMSE scores would differ between different NPI groups. Lastly, a linear regression model was done on MMSE and NPI total score to establish a relationship between MMSE and NPI total score. Results: The results in this study showed that NPI total scores between MCI-C and MCI-NC differed significantly throughout 6 years. MCI-C subjects had a higher mean NPI total score and lower MMSE score compared with MCI-NC subjects. In addition, MMSE scores were significantly different between the 3 groups of NPI total score. Subjects who have a high NPI score have the lowest mean MMSE score, thus demonstrating that NPI scores do indeed affect MMSE scores. Further analyses using a regression model revealed that a unit change in NPI total score lead to 0.1 to 0.3 decrease in MMSE. Discussion: On the basis of the findings, this study showed evidence that increase in NPS burden (reflected by increase in NPI) over time predicts conversion to AD, whereas stability of symptoms (reflected by stable NPI score) favors nonconversion. Further study should investigate the underlying mechanisms that drive both NPS burden and cognitive decline.",

Four microcephaly genes, which regulate brain development in utero and have been suggested to play a role in the evolution of the human brain, were selected as candidate genes that may modulate the risk of AD. We examined the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms tagging common sequence variations in these genes and risk of AD in two case-control samples. We found that the G allele of rs2442607 in microcephalin 1 was associated with an increased risk of AD (under an additive genetic model, P=0.01; odds ratio=3.41; confidence interval, 1.77-6.57). However, this association was not replicated using another case-control sample research participants from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We conclude that the common variations we measured in the 4 microcephaly genes do not affect the risk of AD or that their effect size is small.",

We examined the association between severity of angina pectoris (AP) in mid-life and subsequent cognitive impairment among CHD patients.Severity of AP according to the Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina classification was assessed in a subgroup of people with chronic CHD, who previously participated in a secondary prevention trial. Cognitive performance was evaluated 15±3 years later, using a validated set of computerized cognitive tests (Neurotrax Computerized Cognitive Battery; computing index scores summarizing performance in each cognitive domain and a global cognitive score). We compared the risk of cognitive deficits in participants with AP class >2 to those with AP≤2, adjusting for vascular risk factors, common carotid-intima media thickness (CC-IMT), and presence of carotid plaques.Among 535 participants (mean age at baseline 57.9±6.6 y; 95% males), AP class >2 was associated with subsequent poorer performance on tests of memory and attention compared to those with AP class ≤2 (β=-4.3±1.8; P=0.016 and β=-3.6±1.7; P=0.029, respectively) and with a higher risk of having impairment in these domains [odds ratio (95% confidence interval)=1.83 (1.11-3.02); P=0.019 and 2.36 (1.34-4.16); P=0.003, for memory and attention, respectively]. These results were similar after controlling for vascular risk factors; however, the association of AP with memory domain attenuated after adjustment for CC-IMT or presence of carotid plaques.In people with preexisting CHD, severity of AP is associated with late-life poorer cognitive performance, independent of other vascular risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Symbols and signs have been suggested to improve the orientation of patients suffering from Alzheimer disease (AD). However, there are hardly any studies that confirm whether AD patients benefit from signs or symbols and which symbol characteristics might improve or impede their symbol comprehension. To address these issues, 30 AD patients and 30 matched healthy controls performed a symbol processing task (SPT) with 4 different item categories. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was run to identify impact of different item categories on performance accuracy in both the experimental groups. Moreover, SPT scores were correlated with neuropsychological test scores in a broad range of other cognitive domains. Finally, diagnostic accuracy of the SPT was calculated by a receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis. Results revealed a global symbol processing dysfunction in AD that was associated with semantic memory and executive deficits. Moreover, AD patients showed a disproportional performance decline at SPT items with visual distraction. Finally, the SPT total score showed high sensitivity and specificity in differentiating between AD patients and healthy controls. The present findings suggest that specific symbol features impede symbol processing in AD and argue for a diagnostic benefit of the SPT in neuropsychological assessment.",

    "abstract": "Dementia is an important risk factor for delirium, but the optimal strategy for incorporating cognitive impairment into delirium risk assessment at the time of hospital admission is unknown. We compared 2 informant-based screening tools for dementia and mild cognitive impairment [AD8 and D=(MC)] to the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Mini-cog in predicting hospital-acquired delirium. This prospective cohort study at an academic medical center consisted of 162 medical inpatients over age 50 years without delirium upon admission. Each participant was evaluated using the MMSE, Mini-cog, AD8, and D=(MC) upon admission and was assessed daily for delirium. An MMSE≤24 carried a 5.5 [95% confidence intervals (CI), 2.7-11.1] relative risk for delirium, whereas cognitive impairment detected by the Mini-cog, D=(MC), or AD8 carried a 2-fold risk. Adding the D=(MC) to the MMSE increased the sensitivity for predicting delirium from 52% (range, 32% to 73%) for the MMSE alone to 65% (range, 46% to 85%) if either test was positive. If both were positive, specificity was maximized at 97% (range, 94% to 100%), but sensitivity was 17% (range, 2% to 33%). The MMSE and Mini-cog identify a large proportion of patients at risk for hospital-acquired delirium, but the combination of performance-based and an informant-based screens may maximize specificity and sensitivity.",

Analysis of online search engines' reports of missing PWD may show patterns in the data of this relatively common event and the broad patterns relevant to mortality risk factors.We searched Google news for PWD reported missing for 2015. Demographics, personal details, and outcomes were recorded.Of 673 cases, 67 were found deceased, 525 alive, and the remainder had unknown outcomes. Mortality did not differ significantly by race/ethnicity for cases with known outcomes, but cases with unknown outcomes were significantly overrepresented among non-Caucasians (P<0.001; analysis of variance). Duration missing predicted mortality (P<0.001; χ(2)), and mortality was lower if a photograph was provided (P<0.05; χ(2)). Five states had no reports and some appeared to have fewer reports that would be expected based on estimates of dementia prevalence.Duration missing was the strongest predictor of mortality. Likelihood of mortality was not predicted by use of missing person alerts, and this may be a consequence of inconsistent reporting and follow-up of cases across states. Prevalence and mortality may likewise be underestimated because of the variability in usage and reporting of relevant search terms and definitions. Online resources and social media can provide information about trends and outcomes related to missing persons with dementia, but greater consistency is needed in definitions, searching, and reporting.",

Methods: We addressed this issue by inviting patients with AD and healthy control participants to retrieve autobiographical memories and analyzed them with regard to specificity, subjective experience (ie, time travel, emotion, and visual imagery), and retrieval time. Results: Analyses demonstrated no significant differences between women and men with AD with regard to autobiographical specificity, time travel, visual imagery, or retrieval time. However, the higher emotional value was attributed to memories by women with AD than by men with AD. Discussion: AD seems to equally affect the ability of women and men with AD to construct specific autobiographical memories, to mentally travel in time to relive these memories, to construct mental visual images during memory retrieval, and to organize and monitor search processes, as the latter are mirrored by retrieval time. However, women with AD seem to attribute greater emotional value to autobiographical memories than men with AD.",

    "abstract": "Brain donation is a critical part of advancing research addressing Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD). Studies on ADRD with an option for brain donation are reliant on family members to fulfill the research participant's plan for brain donation. Thus, family members play a pivotal role in increasing brain donation rates, particularly among under-represented groups.This study examines knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about brain donation for research among Latinos. Latino men (N=4) and Latina women (N=11) 18 years of age or older with a parental figure age 65 years and over were invited to participate in a focus group.Data analyses revealed 3 themes. Two themes focused on factors influencing a family's willingness to support brain donation: (a) social and cultural contexts, and (b) lack of knowledge and information about the brain donation process. The last theme provided recommendations for engaging older Latino adults in ADRD research and brain donation.Results suggest being inclusive of family members during all stages of the research process, from recruitment to dissemination. In addition, addressing information gaps among Latinos about the process and benefits of brain donation may help mitigate mistrust and misperceptions and increase participation rates in brain donation.",

Blood-based biomarker analysis of inflammatory markers indicative of dementia could serve as a minimally invasive and easy-to-administer diagnostic tool in primary care.The authors quantified 6 markers (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, insulin-like growth factor 1, vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta type 1, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and interleukin-18) in blood serum of 68 healthy blood donors (controls), 42 patients with AD at the dementia stage, 55 patients with AD at the stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI-AD), and 25 patients with MCI non-AD. All patients have been fully characterized, including AD biomarker analyses in cerebrospinal fluid. Data were analyzed in an algorithm that was trained, validated, and then used for dichotomous classification of unknown data into data sets suspicious and not suspicious of AD.Using this algorithm, 47 of 55 MCI-AD (85.5%) and 20 of 25 MCI non-AD (80%) cases were classified as suspicious of AD.This panel of 6 markers in blood serum may indicate underlying neurodegenerative processes in patients with AD at the MCI stage. The authors assume that a deranged equilibrium of neuroprotective and inflammatory processes is an overall major cause for neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Background: Alongside Alzheimer disease pathology, cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) contributes to the differential progression rates from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. Hence, identification of specific type of CSVD lesions that influence progression is needed. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of silent CSVD in the progression from MCI to dementia and if confluent white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) pose a higher risk for progression in the clinical setting. Methods: Patients with MCI with baseline magnetic resonance imaging and longitudinal follow-up were evaluated. WMH were quantified using visual scoring at baseline (all subjects) and at end of study period (subgroup). Influences of baseline total WMH, baseline confluent WMH, and increase of WMH on progression from MCI to dementia were analyzed. Results: A total of 200 patients with a mean age of 67.9 (SD 8.7) years were evaluated. Progression to dementia was significantly higher among patients with MCI with confluent WMH (55.7% vs. 32.3%; P &lt;0.001). The odds ratio of a patient with confluent WMH progressing to dementia was 2.66. The annual decline in Mini Mental State Examination was significantly higher in those with confluent WMH lesions (−1.60 vs. −1.20; P =0.010). In the subgroup with follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (n=70), patients who demonstrated an increase in WMH had greater decline in annual Mini Mental State Examination scores (−1.79 vs. −0.59; P =0.054). Conclusion: Confluent WMH lesions in MCI are associated with higher rates of progression to dementia.",

Here, we assess the interaction between APOE4 and vascular risk on cerebrovascular dysfunction and brain pathology. Methods: This is an observational study of cognitively normal older adults, which included positron emission tomography imaging and vascular risk factors. We measured beat-to-beat blood pressure and middle cerebral artery velocity at rest and during moderate-intensity exercise. Cerebrovascular measures included cerebrovascular conductance index and the cerebrovascular response to exercise. Results: There was a significant interaction between resting cerebrovascular conductance index and APOE4 carrier status on β-amyloid deposition ( P =0.026), with poor conductance in the cerebrovasculature associated with elevated β-amyloid for the APOE4 carriers only. There was a significant interaction between non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and APOE4 carrier status ( P =0.014), with elevated non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol predicting a blunted cerebrovascular response to exercise in APOE4 carriers and the opposite relationship in noncarriers. Conclusions: Both cerebral and peripheral vascular risk factors are preferentially associated with brain pathology in APOE4 carriers. These findings provide insight into pathogenic vascular risk mechanisms and target strategies to potentially delay AD onset.",

Research suggests they are at higher risk for developing dementia. It is important to know about AA adults’ beliefs about, and knowledge of, dementia; and how these beliefs and knowledge impact participation in dementia research. Methods: Four focus groups were completed with 51 older AA adults (76.5% female; mean age=68) in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to examine understanding of dementia and barriers influencing willingness to participate in a clinical trial on dementia risk reduction. Findings: Participants exhibited awareness of several risk and protective factors related to dementia, including family history of dementia, lack of cognitive engagement, and sedentary lifestyles. They were willing to participate in interventions to lower the risk of developing dementia. Barriers to participation included invasive procedures, pharmaceutical interventions, mistrust of investigators, inadequate compensation, and long study duration. Discussion: Given the high relevance of dementia research to older AAs, their knowledge of dementia, and their willingness to participate in dementia research once barriers are addressed, it is imperative to continue to identify and remediate factors contributing to the poor representation of AAs in dementia research.",

A significant difference in PFC activity between the groups was observed during the verbal fluency test. Moreover, the PFC activity during the verbal fluency test significantly correlated with the existing cognitive screening tool score.

Design: This secondary qualitative analysis included focus groups and semistructured interviews. Thematic analysis was used to reveal the main discourses and stigmatic language used regarding dementia and people with dementia. Setting: Israeli and German stakeholders. Participants: Forty-four Israeli and 44 German participants: 28 people with MND, 20 family members of people with MND, and 40 family caregivers of people with Alzheimer’s disease. Results: Two main discourses were identified: the tragedy and the biomedical discourse. The tragedy discourse included several subthemes: “Dementia as the worst-case scenario,” “Nothing can be done about dementia,” and “People with dementia are not human.” The biomedical discourse stressed pathologic aspects of the condition. Similarities and differences were found between Israeli and German participants. Conclusions: The study indicates that, despite culture and language differences, the use of stigmatic discourse and stigmatizing language is common among people with close exposure to dementia in Israel and Germany. Efforts should be increased to develop a person-centered and dementia-friendly language.",

Therefore, there may be cases of undiagnosed DLB without suggestive biomarkers of DLB. We describe the case of a 63-year-old woman who was initially diagnosed as having AD and later diagnosed with DLB based on suggestive biomarkers of DLB. In this case, transient sleep talking with physical movements for several days led to the assessment of suggestive biomarkers for DLB in the absence of the core clinical features of DLB. For clinicians, diagnosing DLB in patients with AD-type pathology is challenging. However, the application of biomarkers suggestive of DLB to all patients with dementia is not realistic. To overcome the difficulties of clinical diagnosis of DLB, further research is needed regarding strategies for the application of suggestive biomarkers for DLB to appropriately diagnose DLB.",

Results: Participants’ mean age was 78.4, 61.4% were females, 16.2% were Hispanic, 17.1% Asian, 15.8% were non-Hispanic black, and 72.6% CDR = 0. Participant satisfaction was high [14.1 ± 1.4 (out of 15)] but was lower among those with depression. CRC satisfaction was high [16.9 ± 1.8 (out of 18)] but was lower concerning the ability to explain the test battery and interact with participants with CDR = 0.5. Conclusion: Telephone research assessments provide flexibility in a hybrid model. They offer equitable access to research participation for those who do not use computer technology and may promote the retention of diverse elderly research participants.",

Methods: We sought a diverse sample of older adults from a small-town area for a longitudinal aging study. We employed an intensive community engagement approach encompassing a range of recruitment strategies. Results: Over 4 years a steady trickle of individuals, 66% self-identifying as Black, signed up for study information; the proportion of those who eventually enroll in the study has been rising each year, from 68% to 94%. Community events, word-of-mouth referrals, and mailed postcards brought in the most contacts. The highest percentage of contacts who ultimately enrolled were from postcards, flyers, and word-of-mouth. Significantly more word-of-mouth referrals were endorsed by Black individuals than White and by Black men than other race/sex groups. Conclusions: We have had some success in building relationships and trust with the local community, enrolling Black study participants in a proportion equal to their representation in the target community using a variety of recruitment methods. Patience, immersion in the community, and partnerships with key community members alongside traditional advertisements, and the utilization of study participants as recruiters are critical to designing optimal, targeted, recruitment strategies.",

One promising early detection method is the use of instrumented assessment to identify subtle motor declines associated with ADRD. This pilot study sought to establish the feasibility of building a machine learning model to identify individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using motor function data obtained from an inexpensive, portable device. Methods: Our novel, multimodal motor function assessment platform integrates a depth camera, forceplate, and interface board. Healthy older adults (n=28) and older adults with MCI (n=19) were assessed during static balance, gait, and sit-to-stand activities in both single- and dual-task conditions. Three machine learning models (ie, support vector machine, decision trees, and logistic regression) were trained and tested with the goal of classification of MCI. Results: Our best model was decision trees, which demonstrated an accuracy of 83%, a sensitivity of 0.83, a specificity of 1.00, and an F1 score of 0.83. The top features were extracted and ranked on importance. Discussion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of building a machine learning model capable of identifying individuals with mild cognitive impairment using motor function data obtained with a portable, inexpensive, multimodal device.",

The ADCS is committed to recruiting and following minority patients in clinical trials. At present, a serious impediment to recruiting non-English-speaking minorities is the lack of instruments with adequate translation. Because Spanish is the second most commonly spoken language in the United States and because persons of Hispanic origin represent approximately 10% of the population, we conducted an instrument development protocol for Spanish-speaking patients. Evaluating treatment efficacy in Spanish-speaking AD patients requires the development of assessments that are comparable to those used for English-speaking participants in clinical trials. The ADCS Instrument Development Project evaluated the sensitivity, reliability, and validity of new or improved measures in each of five assessment domains: (a) cognition (immediate and delayed memory, praxis, attention, and executive function); (b) clinical global change; (c) activities of daily living; (d) behavioral symptoms (agitation and other noncognitive symptoms); and (e) cognition in severely impaired patients. These new treatment efficacy instruments were translated for Spanish speakers and a Spanish Instrument Study was conducted in parallel with the English version of the study. This report describes instrument translation, entry criteria, and recruitment procedures. In addition, the demographic and clinical characteristics of the cohort at baseline are presented and compared to the English-speaking cohort. Implications for the development of comparably sensitive Spanish language instruments are discussed.",

To elucidate the mechanism underlying abnormal VEPs, we investigated the relationship between pattern-reversal VEPs elicited by large checks and mental functions in PD patients (n = 32), as compared with VEPs of age-matched control subjects (n = 22). The PD patients were divided into two groups: PD without dementia (nD-PD; n = 21) and PD with dementia (D-PD; n = 11). All patients but five of the nD-PD patients were being treated with anti-parkinsonian drugs. The D-PD patients showed significantly prolonged P100 latencies compared with both the nD-PD patients and controls (p < 0.01 and p < 0.01, respectively). The PD patients treated with levodopa had significantly longer P100 latencies than the other PD patients. In PD patients, the P100 latency correlated significantly with illness duration (p < 0.05). There was also a significant negative correlation with P100 latency and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (p < 0.05). The MMSE score did not correlate with illness duration in PD patients. These findings suggest that the VEPs abnormality elicited by large checks is related to dementia independent of progression of the illness, and that a nondopaminergic neurotransmitter system may play a role in the development of VEPs delay elicited by large checks.",

Presented are the results of a survey of researchers at the 15 federally funded Alzheimer Disease Research Centers concerning the ethical issues for subjects with AD participating in research. Experiences from 99 projects are assessed. Major findings include a significant lack of uniformity on the assessment of competency of subjects to consent to research, proxy informed consent overwhelmingly provided informally by family members, no wide use of durable powers of attorney and guardians, perception by the investigators that most projects present only minimal risks to the subjects, and Institutional Review Boards not being viewed by the investigators as preventing or inhibiting the advancement of AD research. It is recommended that research is needed to develop greater clarity in assessment of capacity of subjects to provide informed consent, that ethical and legal empowerment of family members to provide proxy consent be sustained, and that the issue of risk/benefit ratios for AD participants in research be reevaluated in the light of potentially greater risks to subjects.",

    "abstract": "Summary: To evaluate an objective method for individually assessing Alzheimer patients for cognitive benefits from acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, we conducted a secondary analysis of data from 234 subjects enrolled in a 30-week efficacy trial of tacrine hydrochloride. We determined which patients showed treatment-related improvement on the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale—Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) and the Mini- Mental State Examination (MMSE). Four weeks after administration of the maximum dose, 14% showed significant improvement from baseline in their ADAS-Cog scores, and 30.6% showed significant improvement in their MMSE scores. Examination of response patterns over time revealed that 65% of patients showed no improvement in MMSE scores during the 120-160-mg phases of the trial, whereas 18% showed consistent improvement in MMSE scores during that time. Three percent of patients showed improvement in their MMSE scores only for the 160-mg assessment. How the methodology from this study can be generalized to other Alzheimer patients is discussed. We calculated prediction intervals to document the magnitude of fluctuation in performance that is normal for Alzheimer patients similar to those in this study. Patients who change more than the limit specified by the prediction interval have statistically significantly improved performance. We determined that an improvement on the MMSE of three or more points across a time period of 6 weeks marks statistically significant change for an individual. For intervals between 6 and 16 weeks, improvement of four or more points on the MMSE is statistically significant. The results indicate that monitoring individual patients for statistically significant improvements in cognitive functioning is feasible, sensitive to drug-related changes in performance, and could facilitate drug monitoring in patients.",

Sixty-nine patients died; 43% (n = 30) underwent autopsy, and 57% (n = 39) did not. Race (no black patients were autopsied), age of disease onset, age of presentation to the clinic, age of death, and interval between last clinic contact and death (significantly less for nonautopsied patients) were found to differ between the two groups. However, clinical diagnosis of dementia was similar in the two groups. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed in 84% of autopsied patients. These results suggest that there are no major differences between clinical diagnoses for autopsied and nonautopsied patients and that the frequency of occurrence of various dementias obtained through autopsied series are representative of the demented population.",

Recent studies have shown, however, that there may be significant interrater variability in the quantitation of these histopathologic lesions. In the present two-center study, interrater reliability and test-retest reliability for plaque and tangle counts were examined when histologic staining and sampling were controlled. We report similar levels of reliability for plaque and tangle counts in 35 cases of AD, nine normal elderly controls and six non-AD dementias: Pearson correlations for interrater reliability ranged from 0.68 to 0.88, and from 0.97 to 0.99 for test-retest reliability. Using quantitative cut-points, concordance between laboratories for experimental diagnoses of AD versus non-AD made on the basis of these lesion counts ranged from 84 to 92% (kappa scores: 0.69-0.84). The agreement between these experimental diagnoses and the clinicopathologic diagnoses of record ranged from 74 to 86% (kappa scores: 0.50-0.71). Thus, under optimal conditions, a moderate to substantial degree of interrater reliability can be attained in the pathologic diagnosis of AD.",

The early clinical trials of the cholinesterase inhibitor tacrine were primarily small, short-term crossover studies. With the exception of one study reporting dramatic results, most early studies concluded that tacrine had modest therapeutic effects. Because of the variety of study designs and outcomes measures, these results were unreliable indicators of overall efficacy. Tacrine's efficacy has recently been confirmed in several large-scale trials, in which data from more than 1,000 patients were analyzed. Tacrine patients showed statistically significant differences on several cognitive assessments (primarily the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale), as well as significant differences on functional measures and in clinician and family ratings in some studies. Modest but clinically significant beneficial effects were seen in approximately 26–55% of tacrine-treated patients in these trials.",

    "abstract": "Pathophysiotogic processes common to both vascular (multi-infarct) dementia and dementia of the Alzheimer type may include microglial activation with resultant generation of inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic free radicals, decreased secretion of nerve growth factor by astrocytes, excess release of glutamate with associated neurotoxicity, and loss: of cholinergic neurons. The functional benefits and neuroprotective effects of propentofylline (PPF)stem from its interference with these overlapping pathways of neurodegeneration. The clinical pharmacology and safety of PPF were studied in a number of phase I studies in healthy young and elderly adults and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. These studies have shown that PPF 300 mg t.i.d. is safe and well tolerated when taken on an empty stomach 1 h before meals. In a randomized, double-blind phase II study involving 190 elderly subjects with clinically and psychometrically documented mild to moderate dementia, 12 weeks of PPF therapy produced significantly greater improvements than placebo in Gottfries-Brane-Steen (GBS) scores, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, and Clinical Global Impression (CGI), ratings. A subsequent phase II study using positron emission tomography (PET) revealed that cortical glucose metabolism improved significantly in patients with vascular dementia after 12 weeks of PPF treatment but deteriorated significantly with placebo. A third phase 11 study, which enrolled patients with Alzheimer-type dementia, demonstrated that PPF significantly enhanced functional reserve, as reflected by increases in regional cerebral glucose metabolism after stimulation with a verbal memory task. In contrast, patients randomized to placebo exhibited a significant decline in functional activation and significant worsening in their MMSE scores over the course of this 12-week study. Propentofylline proved to be safe, well tolerated, and free of severe side effects in all three of these phase II trials. Phase I trial results suggest that significant food interactions occur with PPF, indicating that the drug should be taken on an empty stomach 1 h before meals. Phase II trial results indicate that PPF yields clinically measurable improvements in the symptoms of dementia and prevents loss of stimulation-related increases in glucose metabolism over a treatment period of 3 months. Whether these results indicate that PPF can slow the progression of dementia can be determined only by long-term trials specifically designed to determine the drug's effect on disease progression.",

    "abstract": "During the 15-year period 1968-1982, a total of 329 patients dying of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) were identified in continental France. Annual mortality rates stabilized at 0.5 to 0.6 cases per million (1.1 to 1.2 cases per million in Paris). Six percent of cases were familial. Although the frequency of CJD was related to population density, no contacts could be established among the great majority of patients. No association with socioeconomic factors, preceding trauma or surgery (excepting one iatrogenic neurosurgical case), or exposure to animal sources of infection was identified. Evidence from this and other epidemiologic studies suggests that CJD is a minimally contagious disease that may be principally acquired in early life from presymptomatic patients, asymptomatic carriers, or chance contamination by environmental sources. It is possible that CJD could also occur sporadically as a noncontagious disease by a mechanism akin to oncogenes in carcinogenesis.",

This paper describes the study methods for identifying subjects with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and the validation of these methods. The MMCS cohort was established by identifying subjects at risk for dementia in three previous studies of randomly ascertained samples. Neuropsychologic test score criteria were established to identify MMCS subjects with dementia or MCI. These criteria were validated using a fourth community-based sample of at-risk elders in which dementia was identified by a clinical adjudication panel. Of the 498 MMCS subjects, 70% had dementia and 27% had MCI by the MMCS criteria. In the validation sample, the MMCS dementia classification method was in agreement with the clinical adjudication panel for 81% of cases (kappa = 0.62, 95% confidence interval = 0.45–0.78). The methods used in the MMCS are efficient and reasonably valid for establishing a cohort of subjects to investigate how dementia is assessed, diagnosed, and treated in the community.",

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of subcortical lacunar infarcts on brain structure in patients with AD. Semi-automated tissue segmentation and volumetry of magnetic resonance imaging data were performed in 38 AD patients without lacunes (AD−L), 24 AD patients with subcortical lacunes (AD+L), and 40 age-matched cognitively healthy subjects without lacunes. The following tissue volumes were quantified, expressed as percentage of total intracranial volume: ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), sulcal CSF, cortical gray matter (GM), subcortical GM, white matter (WM), white matter signal hyperintensities (WMSH), lacunes, and hippocampus. There was no difference in the Mini-Mental State Examination between the two AD groups. AD+L patients compared with AD−L subjects had significantly greater volumes of WMSH and ventricular CSF spaces (as expected) but smaller sulcal CSF spaces and no significant increase in cortical GM atrophy (both unexpected). In the AD groups, ventricular CSF correlated inversely with cortical GM but not with WM; sulcal CSF correlated inversely with cortical GM and WM. Cognitive impairment was associated with sulcal CSF volume but not with volumes of WMSH or lacunes. In conclusion, the presence of subcortical lacunes in those with AD is associated with more WM lesions and ventriculomegaly but not with cortical atrophy.",

In PHF+ neurons, the level of poly(A)+ mRNA was approximately two-thirds that in similar-sized PHF-neurons in either AD or AMC.

After 1 year of availability, the data gathered by the system suggests that the majority of the callers remained in the system long enough to, at minimum, listen to educational information. The system received calls from both those concerned about themselves and those concerned about another person. The screening portions of the system received significant use, and most individuals receiving positive screens continued to explore the interactive voice response system, suggesting they sought additional information. Overall, the 1-year results support the need for accessible and anonymous resources for individuals concerned about dementia.",

The aim of the present study was to explore thyroid function in patients with AD before and after acetylcholinesterase inhibition treatment to possibly identify variances in response. Thyroid function tests were evaluated in 28 AD patients and 24 age and sex-matched controls. Nineteen of the patients were reevaluated after (4 mo) treatment with donepezil. Serum thyrotropin (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), the free fractions (fT3, fT4) and thyroid autoantibodies were determined using standard methods. All subjects were clinically euthyroid. Patients presented with higher fT4 and anti-thyroperoxidase levels, as compared with the controls. Significant reduction in T4, fT3, fT4, and anti-thyroperoxidase levels were observed 4 months after treatment. Responders had higher T4 and fT4, than nonresponders, followed by significant reductions after treatment. The above, within the normal range alterations, may represent a direct effect on hormone release from the thyroid gland and/or increased conversion of T4 to T3 within the brain. Higher T4 and fT4 levels before treatment might predict a favorable response to donepezil treatment.",

    "abstract": "Background There is an urgent need for the development of inexpensive, reliable, and valid instruments that can be used in large-scale primary prevention trials of compounds aimed at ameliorating progression from normal aging to mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer disease. The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study launched a Prevention Instrument Project to develop such methodologies. Behavioral changes are common in diseases causing dementia and may occur prior to a point when cognitive changes are sufficiently severe to allow diagnosis of a dementia syndrome. Experimental behavioral measures were included in the protocol to examine this hypothesis. Methods Six hundred forty-four individuals with CDR 0 or 0.5 were randomly assigned to receive a brief in-clinic behavioral assessment or telephonic administration of the same assessment. The questions were asked to the individual and their research partner. The Prevention Instrument Project included behavioral measures of depression, anxiety, irritability, and apathy. Results All measures demonstrated acceptable test-retest reliability at 3-month intervals except for the single-item depression screen by the subjects' research partner. Behavioral changes are significantly more common among patients with Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores of 0.5 compared with CDR scores of 0. Behavioral alterations including irritability, anxiety, and apathy are more common among ethnic minorities than among the White population. Depression, irritability, anxiety, and apathy are significantly correlated with each other. Conclusions Behavioral changes are common among those with mild degrees of cognitive compromise (CDR 0.5). Telephonic assessment of behavioral changes is feasible. The predictive value of these alterations for progression to Alzheimer disease or other dementias will be assessed longitudinally.",

Reflections on the process that achieved the virtual eradication of general paralysis of the insane may be important in developing approaches to manage Alzheimer disease, today's most prevalent type of dementia. Both for general paralysis of the insane and Alzheimer disease, it took time for them to be recognized as frequent causes of dementia. The hypothesis of the syphilitic origin of general paralysis of the insane instigated heated debates during the 19th century, even surpassing those between proponents of the amyloid cascade versus the tau protein hypotheses for Alzheimer disease. The results of the management of general paralysis of the insane warrant special reflection. Penicillin therapy arrests the disease, but many patients did not regain their previous cognitive performance. The treatment, to be completely efficient, must be accomplished in the phase of early syphilis or in the latent period, thereby preventing the evolution to general paralysis of the insane. The same probably will be true for Alzheimer disease-to be completely successful, treatment should be given before the disease has begun to damage the brain.",

    "abstract": "This study identifies predictors of placement or death in a large ethnically/racially diverse sample of moderately impaired Alzheimer disease patients residing in the community. Patients and caregivers were followed for 18 months with 4 assessments at 6-month intervals. Multinomial regression was used to identify caregiver and patient baseline characteristics and changes over time as predictors of patient placement in a long-term care facility (n=180), patient death (not preceded by placement, n=187), or remaining in the community at home (n=583). Our findings reveal important differences between death and placement when compared with continued home care. Both death and placement are significantly associated with increased activities of daily living limitations (Exp(B)=1.285, P=0.017; Exp(B)=0.1.202, P=0.038, for death and placement, compared with home care, respectively), having a nonspouse caregiver [Exp(B)=0.325, P=0.026; Exp(B)=0.386, P=0.050, for death and placement, respectively], and being a male patient [Exp(B)=0.367, P=0.003; Exp(B)=0.439, P=0.016, for death and placement, respectively]. Death and placement differ with respect to health service use, race, and group assignment. Whites are more likely to be placed rather than remain at home when compared with African American [Ex(B)=0.520, P=0.028] or Hispanic [Exp(B)=0.338, P<0.005] patients, whereas being assigned to the control condition as opposed to active treatment [Exp(B)=0.515, P=0.008], having a male caregiver [Exp(B)=0.482, P=0.043], and increasing patient health service use [Exp(B)=1.105, P=0.015] are associated with increased mortality. Placed and deceased patients are further differentiated from each other by the fact that caregivers of placed patients report an increase in being bothered by memory problems when compared with caregivers of deceased patients [Exp(B)=0.577, P=0.006]. Patients who are placed, died, or remain at home have unique trajectories, which vary as a function of the reference group used for comparison. Increasing bother with memory problems is uniquely associated with placement relative to death while increasing health service use in the form of physician contacts and nurses visits is uniquely associated with death among community residing Alzheimer disease patients.",

    "abstract": "Research advance directives are a proposed mechanism for ensuring that decisions with regard to research participation adhere to preferences voiced by persons with Alzheimer disease (AD) before losing decisional capacity. Although this approach rests on the assumption that preferences with regard to research participation are consistent over time, little is known about the stability of such preferences. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the temporal stability of older adults' receptiveness to participation in clinical trials, neuroimaging studies, and psychosocial investigations on AD. One hundred and four participants in the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer Disease Research Center were annually surveyed with regard to their willingness to be contacted with regard to clinical drug trials, neuroimaging studies, and psychosocial research for which they might be eligible. Receptiveness to contact with regard to AD research was compared at 2 time points, 1 year apart. At baseline, most respondents were willing to be contacted with regard to their eligibility for drug trials, imaging studies, and psychosocial research. Thirty-seven percent of respondents voiced a different set of preferences at year 2 as compared with year 1. Differences included both increased and decreased willingness to be contacted. Neither stability of preferences nor direction of change (more vs. less willing) varied by diagnostic group. Bivariate analyses revealed that participation in at least 1 ancillary research study was associated with an overall increase in willingness to be contacted. We conclude that a significant proportion of research-friendly individuals voice different sets of preferences with regard to the possibility of research participation when queried at different points in time. Amenability to participating in clinical research on AD is a relatively dynamic personal attribute that may be influenced by personal experience with research participation. This finding has relevance for the policy debate around research advance directives, an approach which assumes that preferences with regard to research participation are consistent over time.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, characterized by an increased deposition of β-amyloid (Abeta) within the central nervous system, leading to neuronal death. The availability of effective models, in which confirming novel pathogenic hypotheses and developing therapeutic targets, represents a very important goal for the field of AD. Fibroblasts from these patients may be relevant models in which addressing these issues, as they display biochemical alterations mirroring SNC ones. In this work, fibroblasts obtained from controls were studied after exposure to nonfibrillar Abeta 1-42, showing decreased glutamate uptake, similar to that observed in AD cells, in absence of transporters modifications. Nonfibrillar Abeta 1-42 was able to induce in control cells mitochondrial alterations and p38-phosphorylation, mirroring similar alterations found in AD fibroblasts. Under our experimental conditions, this treatment induced neither apoptosis nor necrosis. To investigate a putative role of p38-modulation in mediating nonfibrillar Abeta 1-42 toxicity, fibroblasts from controls were pretreated with retinoic-acid, and SB203580, a p38-inhibitor. These pretreatments prevented both p38-phosphorylation and glutamate uptake inhibition. Our results suggest that nonfibrillar Abeta 1-42 downregulates glutamate transporters activity interfering with p38-activation and mitochondrial stress. Thus, modulating complex kinase signaling pathway might represent a future therapeutic target in AD.",

Sixty-four subjects (23 mild probable AD, 20 amnestic MCI, and 21 age-matched normal controls) who did not have visible WM lesion burden were analyzed. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity were measured in normal-appearing WM (NAWM) using DTI with 64 encoding directions. The results were correlated with the scores of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Cognitive Ability Screening Instrument (CASI). Statistical analysis showed the FA value in parietal WM was significantly lower in MCI compared to NC (P<0.001), and further decreased in AD compared to MCI (P=0.005). The lower FA and elevated mean diffusivity values were found in temporal WM, frontal WM, parahippocampal and posterior cingulate fibers of AD group compared to MCI and NC (all P<0.01). Canonical correlation analysis showed that the parietal FA values measured from all subjects were significantly correlated with the scores of CASI and MMSE (P<0.01). The results indicated that DTI can detect microstructural WM abnormalities in AD and amnestic MCI, and the measures were correlated with cognitive performance. In MCI, the abnormality was found to be limited within the parietal WM; and in AD a more widespread alteration was found in other brain regions as well.",

    "abstract": "Understanding contributions of different brain pathologies to domain-specific cognitive trajectories in the oldest old is crucial to guide future intervention studies.Two-hundred-twenty Oregon Alzheimer's Disease Center research participants who were cognitively intact at entry were followed on average for 7.3 years with annual neuropsychological testing until death (mean age, 93.7 y) and autopsy. Mixed effects models examined the relationship between trajectories in memory, verbal fluency, and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and pathology (neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, gross infarcts, hippocampal sclerosis, Lewy bodies, APOE genotype, age at death, and years of education). The association between the MMSE trajectory and pathologic variables were examined using a Poisson model with MMSE errors as outcomes given the nonlinear distribution of MMSE scores.Memory trajectory was associated with the APOε4 allele (P=0.006). Verbal fluency trajectory was associated with gross infarcts (P=0.008). MMSE trajectory was associated with high Braak scores (P=0.03), gross infarcts (P<0.0001), hippocampal sclerosis (P=0.003), moderate neuritic plaques (P=0.04), and the APOε4 allele (P=0.02).The association between trajectory of decline in global cognitive scores and multiple brain pathologies highlights the importance of accounting for comorbid pathologies in therapeutic trials aimed at one specific pathology in the oldest old. Only the APOε4 allele showed an association with memory decline, despite accounting for Alzheimer's disease pathology, suggesting that APOE may be involved in mechanisms beyond amyloid metabolism in its role in memory. Further studies are needed to examine the role of APOE in brain aging.",

Annual counts of all-cause and disease-specific HCU in each of the 3 years preceding ADRD diagnosis were regressed on ADRD subtypes with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as the reference group, year, and other variables.HCU increased over time, was highest in the outpatient setting, and varied by ADRD subtype. Compared with MCI, highest HCU was observed in vascular and nonspecific dementia. Compared with MCI, most subtypes had elevated disease-specific HCU.Variation in HCU by ADRD subtype points to different pathways to diagnosis and patterns of use.",

However, little is known about muscle tone in early dementia, and the eventual relation between muscle tone abnormalities and changes in fine and gross motor function. Methods: Three groups of participants were included in the study: healthy controls (n=60), participants with mild dementia (MiD) (n=31), and participants with moderate dementia (n=31). Measurements of fine motricity (Purdue pegboard test), balance and gait (Dynaport Hybrid), the presence of paratonia (PAI), and muscle tone measurements (MyotonPRO) were performed. Results: Paratonia was present in 42% of participants with MiD and in 58% of participants with moderate dementia. Participants with paratonia had lower Purdue Pegboard scores ( P &lt;0.001), lower balance coordination in semitandem stance ( P &lt;0.001), lower walking speed at a fast pace ( P =0.001), and lower step regularity at normal ( P =0.025) and fast ( P &lt;0.001) pace. Conclusions: Paratonia is already present in participants with MiD and is associated with a decline in both fine and gross motor performance. Early detection of paratonia might be helpful to detect persons at higher risk of motor deterioration and falls.",

We clinically evaluated 3 patients with LPA, in comparison with age-matched and severity-matched patients with typical amnestic AD, using florbetapir amyloid neuroimaging. The fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scans of LPA patients revealed focal hypometabolism in the left temporoparietal areas, and the florbetapir scans were diffusely positive for the presence of amyloid deposition. The florbetapir scans did not differ in distribution between patients with LPA and those with typical amnestic AD. Clinical amyloid imaging, although lacking localizing value, is a major advance in the assessment of early-onset and nonamnestic patients for the presence of β-amyloid Alzheimer pathology.",

In total, 192 participants diagnosed with dementia and their informants were independently asked whether or not the participant demonstrated cognitive symptoms of dementia related to memory and word-finding. Participant self-awareness was measured as the discrepancy between participant and caregiver report of these symptoms. Annual Medicare home health benefit use data was obtained from Medicare claims matched by year to the Predictors study visit.Participants that used home health services had lower awareness scores than those who did not. Awareness remained independently associated with home health use in a logistic regression adjusted for age, gender, education, caregiver relationship, global cognition, dementia subtype, and medical comorbidities.Reduced self-awareness of memory deficits in individuals with dementia is associated with more frequent use of Medicare home health services. The disproportionate use of in-home assistance as a function of awareness level may reflect dangers faced by patients, and challenges faced by caregivers, when patients have limited awareness of their memory deficits. Current results have implications for clinical care, caregiver education, and models of health care utilization.",

However, no well-validated instrument currently exists to measure knowledge about FTD. In this study, we used systematic scale development procedures to create a scale to measure knowledge of FTD based on a contemporary understanding of the disease.Standard scale development methods were used to create items and evaluate their psychometric properties. A total of 72 health care professionals and 102 caregivers of people with FTD responded to items measuring FTD knowledge, general dementia knowledge, crystallized intelligence, experience with FTD, and demographic information.The Frontotemporal Dementia Knowledge Scale (FTDKS) contains 18 items that cover key, basic knowledge about FTD in the domains of risk factors, symptoms, course, caregiving, and treatment. The scale uses a 4-point True/False format with a Don't Know option and takes ∼5 minutes to complete. In the current sample the FTDKS had good psychometric properties in terms of reliability and validity.The FTDKS can be used with health care professionals and caregivers of people with FTD to assess their knowledge about the disease. The scale may be useful to evaluate knowledge in clinical care and educational program contexts.",

Methods: We evaluated 695 individuals with T1D aged 60 years or above who participated in the baseline assessment of the Study of Longevity in Diabetes (SOLID), which captured subjective sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and global and domain-specific (language, executive function, episodic memory, and simple attention) cognitive function. Multivariable linear regressions estimated the associations between sleep quality quartiles and overall and domain-specific cognitive function adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, depressive symptoms, and severe hypoglycemic episodes. Sensitivity analyses examined the associations between aspects of sleep quality and global cognitive function. Results: The worst sleep quality quartile was associated with lower global cognition (β=−0.08; 95% confidence interval: −0.17, −0.01) and lower executive function (β=−0.17, 95% confidence interval: −0.30, −0.03) compared with the best quartile of sleep quality adjusting for demographics and comorbidities. Sleep quality was not associated with language, episodic memory, or simple attention. Sleep medications and daytime dysfunction were most strongly associated with global cognition. Conclusion: Our results suggest that sleep quality may be a modifiable risk factor for global cognitive function and executive function among elderly individuals with T1D.",

This study aimed to determine the cut-off score ranges for mild, moderate, and severe AD. Methods: The HK-MoCA score was matched against the Clinical Dementia Rating on 155 patients with AD. Investigators performing the HK-MoCA and Clinical Dementia Rating were blinded to each other. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was used to determine the cut-off scores between different stages of AD (mild, moderate, and severe stage). A secondary analysis with adjustments for age and education received were also performed. Result: The cut-off score in HK-MoCA was ≤4 for those with severe AD (sensitivity 84.4%, specificity 91.9%, area under curve=0.92, P &lt;0.001) and 5 to 9 for those with moderate AD (sensitivity 86.3%, specificity of 93.3%, area under curve=0.953, P &lt;0.001). With adjustments for age and education, the cut-off score for moderate AD was adjusted to 5 to 8, whereas the cut-off score for severe AD remained unchanged. Conclusions: The severity of AD could be delineated using the HK-MoCA for the Cantonese-speaking population in Hong Kong, and the effect of education on the cut-off score needs further investigation.",

Approximately 70% of AD risk is attributed to genetic risk factors, including variants in amyloid precursor protein ( APP ), presenilin 1 ( PSEN1 ), and presenilin 2 ( PSEN2 ) genes. Several studies have revealed a considerable number of candidate loci and genes for AD among different ethnic populations. However, the outcomes of these studies have been inconsistent. In this study, we aimed to investigate the spectrum of variants that are associated with the onset and development of AD among 22 Arab countries. Methodology: We systematically searched 4 literature databases (Science Direct, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science) from the date of inception until July 2020 using various search terms to obtain all the reported genetic data on Arab AD cases. Results: In total, 18 studies were included, comprising a total of 2173 individuals, of whom 888 were clinically diagnosed AD patients and were genetically tested for genes and variants associated with AD. A total of 27 variants in 8 genes were found to be associated with AD. Of these variants, 17 were unique to the Arab population and 10 were shared with other ethnic groups. Conclusions: There is a dearth of studies on the genetics of AD in the Arab world. There seems to be distinctive genetic and clinical susceptibility profiles for Arab patients with AD.",

Fifteen people with AD and 15 age-matched/sex-matched healthy individuals (control group) participated in this study. Clinical assessment of both groups was performed by a neuropsychiatrist. Spatial-temporal parameters of 5 trials of unobstructed walking and 5 trials of obstacle crossing during walking (approach and crossing phases) were measured using a 3-dimensional optoelectronic system. The results indicated that individuals with AD showed higher variability in the approach phase for stride length and the horizontal distance from their trailing limb foot to the obstacle. However, their gait variability in the crossing phase was similar to the control group. In addition, the individuals with AD were found to walk slowly and with a short stride length in both conditions. In conclusion, individuals with AD had increased gait variability while approaching an obstacle during walking, indicating a deficit in planning to avoid obstacles that could be related to cognitive disorders. However, gait variability during the crossing phase may not be indicative of cognitive disorders in AD.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Atherosclerosis has been shown to impact cognitive impairment, with most of the evidence originating from European, African, or East Asian populations that have employed carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) as a biomarker for atherosclerosis. Vascular disease is related to dementia/cognitive decline. There is no community-based study from India that has looked at the association of cIMT with cognitive performance. Methods: In this cross-sectional study between December 2014 and 2019, we recruited 7505 persons [(mean age 64.6 (9.2) y) and 50.9% women] from a community-dwelling population in New Delhi. These persons underwent carotid ultrasound to quantify cIMT and a cognitive test battery that tapped into memory, processing speed, and executive function. We also computed the general cognitive factor (g-factor), which was identified as the first unrotated component of the principal component analysis and explained 37.4% of all variances in the cognitive tests. We constructed multivariate linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, education, and cardiovascular risk factors. Additional adjustment was made for depression, anxiety, and psychosocial support in the final model. Results: We found a significant association of higher cIMT with worse performance in general cognition (β=−0. 01(95% CI: −0.01; −0.01); P &lt;0.001), processing speed (β=−0.20; 95% CI: −0.34; −0.07); P =0.003), memory (β=−0.29; 95% CI: −0.53; −0.05); P =0.016), and executive function (β=−0.54; 95% CI: −0.75; −0.33); P =&lt;0.001). There was no statistically significant association of cIMT with Mini-Mental Status Examination score (β=0.02; 95% CI: −0.34; 0.40; 0.89). Conclusion: The cross-sectional study found significant associations of increased cIMT with worse performance in global cognition, information processing, memory, and executive function.",

Purpose: Using the survey-adapted Montreal Cognitive Assessment instrument (MoCA-SA), we assess how age, sex, race, and education shape these relationships. Methods: We first used cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling to empirically derive distinct cognitive domains from the MoCA-SA as it is unclear whether the MoCA-SA can be disaggregated into cognitive domains. We then used ordinal logistic regression to test whether these empirically derived cognitive domains were associated with odor identification and how sociodemographic variables modified these relationships. Study Population: Nationally representative sample of community-dwelling US older adults. Results: We identified 5 out of the 6 theoretical cognitive domains, with the language domain unable to be identified. Odor identification was associated with episodic memory, visuospatial ability, and executive function. Stratified analyses by sociodemographic variables reveal that the associations between some of the cognitive domains and odor identification varied by age, sex, or race, but not by education. Conclusions: These results suggest that (1) the MoCA-SA can be used to identify cognitive domains in survey research and (2) the performance of smell tests as a screener for cognitive decline may potentially be weaker in certain subpopulations.",

Methods: Caregivers were recruited through an online panel provider in the Netherlands. The survey used validated instruments, including iMTA Valuation of Informal Care Questionnaire, CarerQoL, and EQ-5D-5L. Results: One hundred two caregivers participated. PwADs received, on average, 26 hours of informal care per week. Informal care costs were higher for community-dwelling PwADs compared with institutionalized PwADs (€480 and €278, respectively). On the EQ-5D-5L, caregivers scored on average 0.797, reflecting a utility decrement of 0.065 compared with an age-matched population. Proxy-rated utility scores for PwADs decreased with increasing disease severity (0.455, 0.314, and 0.212 for mild, moderate, and severe AD, respectively). Institutionalised PwADs had lower utility scores than community-dwelling PwADs (0.590 vs. 0.421).

Conclusion: The burden of AD extends to caregivers in terms of HRQoL and time investment, regardless of the disease severity of the target population.

Research addressing such disparities must shift toward the earliest clinical manifestations of AD to optimize diagnosis, intervention and care planning. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), a risk state for AD, provides an important context in which to examine sociodemographic-related disparities in HS. Participants and Methods: One hundred sixty-seven cognitively healthy older adults (M age =73, M education =16) (26.4% Black, Asian, or “Other”) completed SCD questionnaire, HS questions, and mood measures (depression and anxiety). Binary logistic adjusted regressions examined: (a) the association between SCD and HS; and (b) the extent to which education moderated the relationship between SCD and HS. SCD [b = 0.06, SE=0.13, P &lt;0.001, odds ratio=1.06, 95% CI (1.03, 1.08)] and education [b=0.32, SE=0.09, P &lt;0.001, odds ratio=1.37, 95% CI (1.15, 1.64)] were independently associated with HS, with significant interaction between education and SCD on HS [b=0.2, SE=0.01, P =0.01, odds ratio=1.02, 95% CI (1.00, 1.03)]. Conclusions: Findings elucidate the importance of tailoring SCD-related psychoeducational resources depending on educational background as a preliminary stepping-stone in encouraging HS among older adults who may be at particular risk for developing dementia.",

Although most individuals with aMCI have clinically normal scores on this test, several studies have shown that aMCI individuals’ performance is significantly lower than that of cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals. The aim of this meta-analysis was to characterize the effect size of animal fluency performance differences between aMCI and CU individuals. Literature search with search terms used were: “animal fluency and mild cognitive impairment,” “semantic fluency and mild cognitive impairment,” “category fluency and mild cognitive impairment.” Both the standardized mean difference and the raw mean difference were derived from random effects analyses. Demographically adjusted z-scores for animal fluency performance for the aMCI groups were obtained to determine normative performance. Nineteen studies were included in the analysis. The standardized mean difference for animal fluency performance between CU and aMCI was 0.89 (95% confidence interval: [0.73; 1.04], P &lt;0.001), I 2 =70.3% [52.7%; 81.4%], which reflects a large effect size with moderate heterogeneity. The raw mean difference was −4.08 [−4.75; −3.38], P &lt;0.001. The mean animal fluency z-score for aMCI groups was in the Low Average range (z=−0.77). This study found a substantial difference in animal fluency performance between aMCI and CU individuals. The aMCI groups’ normative performance did not fall into the impaired range, indicating that there are important subclinical differences in animal fluency performance that may inform the design of cognitive end points for Alzheimer’s disease prevention trials.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: People with dementia (PWD) are one of the fastest-growing clinical populations for speech-language pathologists. Self-reported quality of life (QoL) assessments are critical patient-reported outcome measures that align with person-centered care principles. However, proxy-reporting is most often used due to assumptions that PWD cannot provide reliable self-report. Visual analog scales (VASs) have been successfully used with people with expressive and cognitive deficits to measure subjective constructs such as QoL, mood, and pain. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the feasibility and reliability of a VAS QoL assessment tool. Methods: Twenty older adults free of cognitive impairment were assessed using the quality of life in Alzheimer’s disease (QoL-AD) and the QoL-AD in combination with a VAS (VAS QoL-AD). The construct validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability of the VAS QoL-AD were assessed by performing both assessments twice, 4 weeks apart. Results: Significant correlations between the overall VAS QoL-AD and the QoL-AD scale ratings, between most of the QoL-AD and VAS QoL-AD subtests, and between the first and second assessment scores were observed. Conclusions: Results indicated strong construct validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability of the VAS QoL-AD in people without dementia. These results warrant further research into the development of a dementia-specific, self-reported VAS QoL scale for PWD.",

Fibrohyalinosis and fibrinoid necrosis with segmental arterial disorganization are the two cardinal features of arteriopathy in the subcortical structures. From the viewpoint of neuropathological changes in VaD, notes were made of the areas that need to be explored in future studies and revised clinical criteria for VaD were proposed.",

    "abstract": "Decline in functional abilities is a major component of the dementia syndrome. The definition of dementia in the International Classification of Diseases (10th rev.) requires a cognitive impairment sufficient to impair personal activities of daily living (ADL). The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) also requires cognitive deficits sufficiently severe to cause impairment in occupational or social functioning and must represent a decline from a higher level of functioning. However, the term disability is more appropriate than impairment to describe a loss in activities, as opposed to a loss of elementary functions, and is consistent with World Health Organization definitions of impairment, disability, and handicap. There is no doubt that ADL outcomes are required in therapeutic drug studies on vascular dementia, and there is a good rationale and some evidence for the use of ADL scales developed for therapeutic research in Alzheimer disease, favoring scales devoid of items sensitive to physical disabilities. Similarly, ADL-related clinical milestones could be used for longer-term studies aiming predominantly at slowing progression of disease in both early and later stages of dementia. Slower decline in ADL and delay in reaching ADL-related clinical milestones should be considered as valid outcomes by regulatory bodies in the process of dementia drug approval.",

    "abstract": "Summary The relationship between Alzheimer disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (senile dementia Lewy body type, or SDLT) and dementia in Parkinson's disease is unclear. AD pathology is characterised by both amyloid deposition and abnormal phosphorylation of tau in paired helical filaments (PHF-$tU). In AD, abnormally phosphorylated PHF-$tU is present in neurofibrillary tangles, in neuritic processes of senile plaques, and also in neuropil threads dispersed throughout the cerebral cortex. Cortical homogenates from 12 cases each of AD and SDLT, 13 cases of Parkinson's disease, and 11 normal controls were examined by Western blot analysis with antibodies that detect PHF-$tU. No PHF-$tU was found in Parkinson's disease or control cortex. No PHF-$tU was found in SDLT cases without histological evidence of tangles. PHF-$tU was detectable in SDLT cases with a low density of tangles, and large amounts of PHF-$tU were present in AD cases. This study demonstrates that abnormally phosphorylated PHF-$tU is only present where tangles are found and not in SDLT cases without tangles or with only occasional tangles. It is concluded that Lewy body dementias are distinct at a molecular level from AD.",

    "abstract": "Ameboid microglia are activated macrophages in the developing brain. With age, these cells undergo gradual transformation into the adult form, known as ramified or resting microglia. In response to neuronal insults, microglia change their morphology and immunophenotype and proliferate to become full-blown brain macrophages. Microglia release a battery of neurotoxic substances. Responses to neuronal damage occur at various intervals after the insult, suggesting that microglia may be an attractive target for pharmacologic intervention. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients contains antibodies that recognize activated microglia in the developing rat and in the ischemic gerbil brain. These results suggest that AD shares common mechanisms related to the activation of microglia with both these experimental models. In vitro, the xanthine derivative propentofylline (PPF) depresses the production of reactive oxygen intermediates produced by macrophages. To appreciate in vivo interactions of PPF, two models were employed: developing rats and adult gerbils exposed to ischemia. Newborn rats were administered PPF (10 mg/kg) for 7 days. Gerbils were exposed to 5 min of transient forebrain ischemia and received PPF (10 mg/kg) 24 h later until the day before sacrifice. Animals were sacrificed at 7 or 14 days after reperfusion. Brains were processed for immunocytochemistry. Reactive microglia were visualized with monoclonal antibodies OX 18 and OX42 or AD-CSF microglia antibodies. In the case of ischemia, an antibody against the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (residues 676–695) was included. Newborn rats receiving PPF for 7 days displayed a dramatic reduction in the number of activated microglia compared with untreated littermates. Ischemic control in gerbils showed complete nerve death, accumulations of APP, and enhanced microglial reactivity. In gerbils receiving PPF, APP accumulation was absent or very slight, and activated microglia were downregu-lated. The ability of PPF to interfere with activated microglia suggests that this agent may be useful for slowing progressive nerve cell death associated with AD, which is considered to be largely influenced by pathologic glial reactions.",

The clinical picture of vascular dementia varies, and the role of functional brain imaging of cerebral blood flow and metabolism would be expected to be different among subtypes of vascular dementia. The role and value of functional brain imaging is limited for cortical infarcts; it is very valuable in assessing the impact on cortical function for small subcortical infarcts; and it is probably useful for evaluating white matter lesions, but this needs to be determined in further studies. At least in research of vascular dementia, functional brain imaging criteria should be included for proper patient selection.

Furthermore, variables were examined that could be associated with certain types of symptom patterns or could be predictors of change of these patterns. Forty-eight patients with the clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer disease were included in this study and were assessed weekly over a 3-week period. Noncognitive symptoms were rated according to the Behavioral Abnormalities in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale and the Dementia Mood Assessment Scale and to a set of items that specifically assess misidentifications. By means of principal component factor analysis different noncognitive symptom patterns were obtained, yielding a four-factor solution. They mapped onto rational domains with respect to clinical experience: depression, apathy, psychotic symptoms/aggression, and misidentifications/agitation. Demographic and clinical variables were not associated with the factor solutions and did not predict change of the factor values. The results demonstrate that in Alzheimer disease there are distinct noncognitive symptom patterns that hold at least short-term prospective stability. None of the examined clinical variables, such as age at entry, the status of the patients (outpatient or inpatient), or dementia severity, exerted substantial influence on the noncognitive symptom patterns. Further investigations should concentrate on the pathological and prognostic correlates of noncognitive symptom patterns in Alzheimer disease.",

We conducted a pilot study of physostigmine plus oral yohimbine challenge in AD. Ten patients were enrolled in a 12-day double-blind protocol. Each patient received placebo q2h while awake for 5 days, followed by physostigmine 2 mg q2h while awake for 7 days. During each of these drug conditions, yohimbine challenges were administered at oral doses of 10 and 20 mg in a placebo-controlled manner. There was no significant improvement in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale test performance for six patients for whom complete cognitive data were obtained for the 6 challenge days. Nine patients tolerated the protocol with no clinically significant changes in blood pressure, pulse, or electrocardiogram (ECG), and no cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or autonomic toxicity. One patient complained of chest discomfort associated with tachycardia, a modest rise in blood pressure, and had t-wave inversion in a single precordial lead. These signs and symptoms resolved within a few hours. Serial ECG tracings and cardiac enzymes revealed no evidence of myocardial injury. This pilot study did not reveal major cognitive improvement with this regimen, but underscores the importance of careful cardiovascular monitoring during future combined cholinergic-noradrenergic therapies in AD.",

Of particular importance to clinicians and researchers studying dementia is determining whether a patient has the capacity to provide informed consent to treatment and medical research. No widely accepted standardized instruments exist for competency assessment, nor has competency assessment training been available to physicians. As a result, physician competency assessment has been a subjective and even idiosyncratic process. Recent studies have suggested that physicians have difficulty assessing capacity to consent in older adults and frequently disagree in their competency judgments. Accordingly, one important goal for advancing ethical and legal research in AD will involve the development of standardized approaches to determining patient capacity to give consent. This article reports the findings of recent empirical studies of competency determination in AD, focusing on work in the areas of physician competency assessment, development of standardized assessment instruments, and neuropsychological modeling of competency loss. Future directions for research in these three areas are identified.",

This retrospective cohort investigation was conducted on a dementia special care unit of a Department of Veterans Affairs facility, with more than 75% of residents clinically diagnosed with dementia of the Alzheimer type. One hundred five residents residing in the facility during February 1995 were included as subjects. A cluster of deaths occurred, triggering the investigation. Ultimately, 21 deaths (three times greater than any previous month in the past 5 years) occurred during the 1-month period. Measures included the presence of clinical influenza-like illness based on signs, serology, and autopsy results. Of the 105 residents, 45 (42.8%) met the clinical definition for influenza-like illness. Eight autopsies were performed, and the causes of death consisting of bronchopneumonia in seven and aspiration pneumonia in one were compatible with influenza. There were no differences among those who died from those who lived with regards to age, race, gender, clinical influenza-like illness, vaccination status, diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, or duration of dementia (all p ≥ 0.2). However, those who died were at a higher risk of dying due to a greater number of coexisting conditions (p < 0.01). Also, overall the groups differed in Mini-Mental State Examination and Bedford Alzheimer Nursing Scale scores with those who died being more impaired (p < 0.01). Thus, the presentation of influenza-like illness can be subtle in onset, underappreciated in this population, and not recognized until excess mortality, which affects the most frail, is noted. Care providers need to be vigilant during the winter months for the presence of influenza.",

Five of the family members were mutation carriers; eight were not carriers. Two carriers were younger than 40 years of age and had no evidence of cognitive dysfunction or structural or functional brain changes. One carrier with 4 years to expected disease onset showed poor performance in episodic memory tests and also slightly low temporal lobe CBF, although there were no clearly abnormal findings. One carrier with mild Alzheimer disease (AD) had no clear structural brain changes, although CBF measurements showed clear reduction of temporal lobe CBF. One carrier with severe AD had both temporal lobe atrophy and CBF reduction. This indicates that in carriers of the APP 670/671 mutation, reduction of regional CBF is more severe than regional atrophy. The clearest change related to development of clinical AD was a reduction of CBF in the basal and lateral temporal lobes. Further longitudinal studies of these subjects are needed to confirm these preliminary findings, which might provide important data regarding early brain changes in AD.",

Results, limited to the 48-week clinical trial duration, indicated that propentofylline improved health outcomes of persons with dementia as statistically significant treatment effects were found. However, although an incremental cost for the propentofylline intervention was incurred from the Ministry of Health perspective, home care and, to a larger extent, caregiver costs were reduced. Savings in these areas may have partially offset annual treatment medication costs because a non-statistically significant cost difference was observed from a societal perspective.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated a new guideline, in the form of a \"checklist of considerations,\" to support end-of-life decision making in the treatment of demented patients with pneumonia. Questionnaires were sent to nursing home physicians (NHPs) in The Netherlands at three times: before implementation of the checklist (concerning 91 individual patients), during use of the checklist (concerning another 107 individual patients), and after data collection (concerning the targeted patient category of demented nursing home patients with pneumonia as a whole). In the last questionnaire, one NHP from each nursing home (n = 55 NHPs) gave his or her general opinion about the checklist. We measured the usefulness of the checklist in supporting decision making and its frequency of actual use. The NHPs accepted the contents of the checklist for use in the targeted patient category. It was used in 46% of the incident cases of pneumonia. The checklist was considered more useful in supporting decision making for the targeted patient category (85% of the NHPs) than for the individual patient (47%). Possible explanations for this discrepancy in \"usefulness\" include the difference in the nature of the outcome measures and the fact that the checklist was used more frequently for the \"easier cases.\" Information on individual patient level, patient category level, and nursing home and NHP characteristics is used to suggest checklist improvements.",

The patients with DAT showed significant behavioral and cognitive but not physiologic changes at a lower scopolamine dose (0.25 mg) than did the normal elderly controls. Cognitive tests of new learning and semantic knowledge revealed significant impairments at the 0.25-mg scopolamine dose in the patients with DAT, while the responses of the control population were essentially unchanged. Behaviorally, mild euphoria, motor incoordination, and hostility occurred in the patients with DAT but not the controls at the 0.25-mg dose. These differences were unrelated to peripheral physiologic changes produced by the different scopolamine doses. These results indicate that central nervous system functions such as cognition and certain elements of behavior are more sensitive to temporary cholinergic blockade In patients with DAT than in normal age-matched controls. We review implications concerning the status of central cholinergic function in patients with DAT in light of neuropathologically demonstrated cholinergic system lesions in DAT.",

Evidence regarding dietary and supplemental intake of vitamins E, C, and folate, and studies of alcohol and wine intake are also reviewed. At present, there is insufficient evidence to make public health recommendations, but these studies can provide potentially important clues and new avenues for clinical and laboratory research.",

Dementia was assessed from the subject medical records on the basis of the criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. Serum from a blood draw performed in 1994 was assayed for total and bioavailable T. Twenty-one men developed dementia over 1186 person-years of follow-up. The cumulative incidence of dementia was 14.7% in men with total T <410 ng/mL (median) and 8.0% in men with higher levels [≥410 ng/mL; age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=2.09; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.76, 5.75]. Similarly, the cumulative incidence of dementia was 18.8% in men with bioavailable T <12 ng/mL (median) and 2.2% in men with bioavailable T ≥12 ng/mL; age-adjusted HR=1.22 (95% CI=0.38, 3.87). These findings do not demonstrate a significant association between T levels and dementia. However, they suggest a need for further investigation of these potential associations.",

In 1998, an international consortium of investigators focusing on this disease entity met and agreed upon the classification of 3 subtypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, using regional atrophy to distinguish them. These are: a frontally predominant form called frontotemporal dementia, a temporally predominant form called semantic dementia, and a left-frontally predominant syndrome, called progressive nonfluent aphasia. With the rise of genetic and neuropathologic findings, however, the usefulness of this subtype classification has been called into question. This paper discusses the major pertinent findings, and the implications of classifying the disease on the basis of atrophy versus genetic or molecular mechanisms.",

The high prevalence of atherosclerosis and associated risk factors in American Indians makes them ideal subjects to test this association. We compared frequency of history of hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetes, and high cholesterol in 34 American Indians with AD with 34 age-matched American Indian controls, and 34 age-matched whites with probable AD. We also measured waist size, height, and weight, and acquired blood for determination of plasma homocysteine and apolipoprotein E genotype. The 3 groups did not differ significantly in age or sex. History of hypertension and diabetes was significantly more common among American Indian AD patients than Indian controls or whites with AD. The 3 groups did not differ in history of stroke or myocardial infarction. Body mass index was significantly greater in both Indian groups than the white AD group. Plasma homocysteine levels were greater, but not significantly so, in the Indian AD than the Indian control group. Thus, there is preliminary evidence of a modest association between history of hypertension and diabetes and AD in a small sample of American Indians. This suggests that changes in lifestyle factors could influence the expression of AD in American Indians.",

In this study, we screened a group of 51 FTLD patients for PGRN mutations and identified a novel exon 6 splice donor site deletion (IVS6+5_8delGTGA) in 2 unrelated patients. This mutation displayed an altered splicing pattern generating 2 aberrant transcripts and causing frameshifts of the coding sequence, premature termination codons, and a near absence of PGRN mRNA from the mutated alleles most likely through nonsense-mediated decay. The subsequent PGRN haploinsufficiency is consistent with previously described PGRN mutations. We present a molecular characterization of the IVS6+5_8delGTGA mutation and also describe clinical and neuropathologic features from the 2 patients carrying this PGRN mutation. From the screening of these 51 FTLD patients, we could also identify the earlier reported mutation Gln130fs, and several coding sequence variants that are most likely nonpathogenic.",

    "abstract": "It has been shown that patients with poor health literacy generally do not fare as well from a health perspective because they lack understanding of health information and are unaware of the steps involved in preventative health care. There are also unique issues with regard to the recruitment of minority participants into research. The National African American Alzheimer Disease Health Literacy Program was a research project whose purpose was to increase the health literacy of African American adults by providing objective scientific and educational information to the African American community of patients, families, and caregivers about dementia and Alzheimer disease. The target audience was the African American communities of Chicago, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Newark, and Washington D.C. Reaching into these communities for participants was challenging for a variety of reasons and provided insight into potential strategies for working with the population of elderly African Americans. This article discusses the successes and challenges of the work conducted in Indianapolis.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the longitudinal relationship between patient characteristics and use of 4 drug classes (antihypertensives, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and hormones) that showed significant changes in use rates over time in patients with Alzheimer disease. Patient/caregiver-reported prescription medication usage was categorized by drug class for 201 patients from the Predictors Study. Patient characteristics included use of cholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine, function, cognition, living situation, baseline age, and sex. Assessment interval, year of study entry, and site were controlled for. Before adjusting for covariates, useage increased for antihypertensives (47.8% to 62.2%), antipsychotics (3.5% to 27.0%), and antidepressants (32.3% to 40.5%); use of hormones decreased (19.4% to 5.4%). After controlling for patient characteristics, effects of time on the use of antidepressants were no longer significant. Antihypertensive use was associated with poorer functioning, concurrent use of memantine, and older age. Antipsychotic use was associated with poorer functioning and poorer cognition. Antidepressant use was associated with younger age, poorer functioning, and concurrent use of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. Hormone use was associated with being female and younger age. Findings suggest accurate modeling of the Alzheimer disease treatment paradigm for certain subgroups of patients should include antihypertensives and antipsychotics in addition to cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine.",

    "abstract": "To develop a practical informant-based screening tool that reliably identifies patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, we analyzed data from a sample of patients and normal controls seen in a memory clinic. All patients were evaluated with the Clinical Dementia Rating scale. Individual Clinical Dementia Rating responses were dichotomized and entered into a forward stepwise multivariable logistic regression model. Four independent predictors of MCI and dementia thus identified were combined into a prediction rule that was validated in a separate cohort drawn from the same clinic. Using a cut point of 2 or more positive responses to the 4 questions, the final prediction rule had sensitivity of 95% (95% confidence interval (CI): 92-97%) for MCI or dementia, and a specificity of 91% (95% CI: 86-95%). When applied to the validation cohort, the sensitivity for MCI or dementia was 96% (95% CI: 94-98%), and the specificity was 96% (95% CI: 92-98%). Using both cohorts, the positive likelihood ratio for MCI or dementia was 15.6 (95% CI: 14.0-17.3) and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.05 (95% CI: 0.04-0.07). This tool has the potential to identify patients who warrant further cognitive evaluation in busy outpatient or emergency department settings.",

Cognitive performance was assessed using the Mindstreams computerized battery. Measures of overall battery performance and in specific cognitive domains were obtained, and a score of ≤85 (1 SD below the mean) was defined as cognitive impairment overall and in a specific domain. We compared the risk of cognitive impairment and means of cognitive scores by quartiles of height.Among 536 patients, 23.2% were cognitively impaired. After controlling for potential risk factors and correcting for multiple comparisons, odds ratios for impairment in the visual-spatial domain decreased with increasing height quartiles (P for trend =0.018), and odds ratio (95% confidence interval) associated with being at the top versus the bottom quartile was 0.40 (0.18-0.88). An increment of 1 SD of height was associated with a higher global score (β=1.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.73-4.49; P=0.004) and with higher executive function, attention, and visual-spatial scores.Among our sample of coronary heart disease patients, a higher stature is associated with a lower risk of impairment in the visual-spatial function and with better cognitive performance.",

One hundred persons with mild-to-moderate dementia (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, 4th edition) were recruited and interviewed at 5 Spanish centers to obtain sociodemographic information, health perceptions, depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale 15-item version), functional ability (Barthel Index), dementia severity (Mini-Mental State Examination), specific QoL (CBS), and generic QoL (World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF version). Analysis was carried out using classical psychometric methods. Internal consistency reliability for the CBS was good (0.87). A priori hypotheses about the relationship between CBS and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF version psychological domain and Geriatric Depression Scale 15-item version were confirmed, indicating good construct validity. Regarding contrasting groups’ differences, CBS scores significantly differentiated between healthy and unhealthy and depressed and nondepressed participants but not between those with mild and moderate dementia. The exploratory factor analysis showed a 5-factor solution, which accounted for 63.9% of the total variance of CBS. This study is the first to report the factor structure of the CBS. These results indicate that CBS is a useful tool in assessing persons with dementia. Replication of these results with larger samples is advised. The Spanish version of the CBS is reliable and valid in persons with mild/moderate dementia who are living at home and with a known caregiver.",

Intakes were divided into 3 time categories: period 1 (1992 to 1996), period 2 (1997 to 2002), and period 3 (2003 to 2008). Diagnoses included the following: Alzheimer disease (73%), vascular dementia (13%), mixed dementia (9%), mild cognitive impairment (2%), and other dementias (4%).Over the 3 assessment periods, persons increasingly presented at an earlier stage of illness with significantly higher levels of cognition and functioning, and a declining prevalence of psychotic symptoms and agitation. Blacks had a more advanced stage of illness, lower cognitive scores, and a greater prevalence of psychotic symptoms than whites in period 1, but not during the other time periods. There were no racial differences in functioning, agitation, or depression.Over the period 1992 to 2008, patients were increasingly more likely to present with early stages of dementia and fewer symptoms of psychoses and agitation, and racial differences in illness severity and neuropsychiatric symptoms disappeared. If our sample reflects trends in the United States, then it suggests that more persons will be in care for longer periods of time, previous research findings derived from dementia centers must be considered historically specific, and clinicians must be prepared to work with persons with milder forms of neurocognitive disorders.",

The Dependence Scale (DS), a measure of care-assistance required, was used to estimate costs of care and quality of life of patients with AD categorized into 6 dependence stages based upon the summated item scores of the DS. Data were derived from a 3-year, noninterventional study of 132 patients with probable AD (ages, 50 to 85 y) and caregiver dyads. We investigated the association between DS scores and health care costs, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), caregiver burden and estimated annual costs and HRQoL for 6 dependence stages in adjusted models. DS scores were significant predictors of health care costs, HRQoL, and caregiver burden. The estimated annual health care costs and a measure of HRQoL (EuroQoL-5D) ranged from $11,418 and 1.00 for those at very mild dependence stage to $101,715 and 0.26 for those at very severe dependence stage. DS scores classified into 6 dependence stages provides a useful method to estimate unique levels of care-associated costs and health utilities for pharmacoeconomic evaluations of new treatments for AD.",

In a population-based cohort of individuals aged 65+ years, we examined patterns of change in frequency of engagement in total cognitive activity (TCA), higher cognitive activity (HCA), and frequent cognitive activity (FCA) based on the Florida Cognitive Activities Scale over an average of 3.62 years, and whether these patterns were associated with incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI) during this same period. Among 867 cognitively normal participants, 129 (15%) progressed to MCI. Latent class trajectory modeling identified high and stable, slowly, and quickly declining patterns for TCA; high and stable, slowly declining, and slowing increasing patterns for FCA; and high and stable, and slowly declining patterns for HCA. Separate, adjusted Cox proportional hazard models, revealed that compared with the high, stable pattern, both slow decline [hazard ratio (HR), 2.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.5-4.0] and quick decline (HR, 11.0; 95% CI, 6.3-19.2) in TCA, and slow decline in the FCA (HR, 8.7; 95% CI, 5.3-14.3) and HCA (HR, 3.4; 95% CI, 2.0-5.6) subscales increased risk for incident MCI. Maintaining engagement in cognitive activities may be protective against progression to MCI, alternatively, declining engagement may be a marker for impending cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Background: Americans’ confidence in science varies based on their political ideology. This ideological divide has potentially important effects on citizens’ engagement with and participation in clinical studies of Alzheimer disease (AD). Methods: A probability sample of 1583 Americans was surveyed about their willingness to participate in longitudinal AD research and about their political attitudes. These survey results were compared with a survey of 382 participants in a longitudinal AD study at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center. Results: Among Americans, more conservative ideology decreases willingness to participate in a hypothetical longitudinal cohort study of AD both directly and through its negative effect on confidence in science. The Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center study participants expressed more liberal ideology and greater confidence in science than Americans in general. Of the survey respondents opposed to participation, over a quarter changed to neutral or positive if the study returned their research results to them. Conclusions and Relevance: Clinical studies of AD are likely biased toward participants who are more liberal and have higher confidence in science than the general population. This recruitment bias may be reduced by lowering the trust demanded of participants through measures such as returning research results to participants.",

    "abstract": "Early onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD) is a neurodegenerative dementing disorder that is relatively rare (<1% of all Alzheimer cases). Various genetic mutations of the presenilin 1 (PSEN1) and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) as well as the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene have been implicated. Mutations of PSEN1 and PSEN2 alter γ-secretase enzyme that cleaves APP resulting in increase in the relative amount of the more amyloidogenic Aβ42 that is produced.1 PSEN2 has been less studied than PSEN1 and fewer mutations are known. Here, we report a case of a 63-year-old woman (at the time of death) with the clinical history consistent with Alzheimer D, an autopsy with brain histopathology supporting Alzheimer disease (AD), congophylic angiopathy, and Lewy Body pathology, and whose medical genetic testing reveals a novel PSEN2 mutation of adenosine replacing cytosine at codon 222, nucleotide position 665 (lysine replacing threonine) that has never been previously reported. This suggests that genetic testing may be useful in older patients with mixed pathology. CASE REPORT The patient was referred to our specialty memory clinic at the age of 58 with a 2-year history of repetitiveness, memory loss, and executive function loss. Magnetic resonance imaging scan at age 58 revealed mild generalized cortical atrophy. She is white with 2 years of postsecondary education. Retirement at age 48 from employment as a manager in telecommunications company was because family finances allowed and not because of cognitive challenges with work. Progressive cognitive decline was evident by the report of deficits in instrumental activities of daily living performance over the past 9 months before her initial consultation in the memory clinic. Word finding and literacy skills were noted to have deteriorated in the preceding 6 months according to her spouse. Examples of functional losses were being slower in processing and carrying out instructions, not knowing how to turn off the stove, and becoming unable to assist in boat docking which was the couple's pastime. She stopped driving a motor vehicle about 6 months before her memory clinic consultation. Her past medical history was relevant for hypercholesterolemia and vitamin D deficiency. She had no surgical history. She had no history of smoking, alcohol, or other drug misuse. Laboratory screening was normal. There was no first-degree family history of presenile dementia. Neurocognitive assessment at the first clinic visit revealed a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 14/30; poor verbal fluency (patient was able to produce only 5 animal names and 1 F-word in 1 min) as well as poor visuospatial and executive skills (Fig. 1). She had fluent speech without semantic deficits. Her neurological examination was pertinent for normal muscle tone and power, mild ideomotor apraxia on performing commands for motor tasks with no suggestion of cerebellar dysfunction, normal gait, no frontal release signs. Her speech was fluent with obvious word finding difficulties but with no phonemic or semantic paraphrasic errors. Her general physical examination was unremarkable without evidence of presenile cataracts. She had normal hearing. There was no evidence of depression or psychotic symptoms.FIGURE 1: Visuospatial and executive function testing at age 58.At the time of the initial assessment, her mother was deceased at age 79 after a hip fracture with a history long-term smoking and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Her family believes that there is possible German and Danish descent on her father's side. Her father was alive and well at age 80 at the time of her presentation with a history coronary artery disease. He is still alive and well with no functional or cognitive concerns at age 87 at the time of writing this report. Her paternal grandfather died at approximately age 33 of appendicitis with her paternal grandmother living with mild memory loss but without known dementia or motor symptoms until age 76, dying after complications of abdominal surgery. Her paternal uncle was diagnosed with Parkinson disease in his 40s and died at age 58. Her maternal grandmother was reported to be functionally intact, but mildly forgetful at the time of her death at age 89. The maternal grandfather had multiple myocardial infarctions and died of congestive heart failure at age 75. She was the eldest of 4 siblings (ages 44 to 56 at the time of presentation); none had cognitive problems. She had no children. Because of her young age and clinical presentation with no personality changes, language or motor change, nor fluctuations, EOAD was the most likely clinical diagnosis. As visuospatial challenges were marked at her first visit and poor depth perception developing over time, posterior cortical variant of AD was also on the differential as was atypical presentation of frontotemporal dementias. Without fluctuations, Parkinsonism, falls, hallucinations, or altered attention, Lewy Body dementia was deemed unlikely. After treatment with a cholinesterase inhibitor, her MMSE improved to 18/30, tested 15 months later with stability in function. Verbal fluency improved marginally with 7 animals and 3 F-words. After an additional 18 months, function and cognition declined (MMSE=13/30) so memantine was added. The stabilizing response to the cholinesterase inhibitor added some degree of confidence to the EOAD diagnosis. In the subsequent 4 years, she continued to decline in cognition and function such that admission to a care facility was required with associated total dependence for basic activities of daily living. Noted by family before transfer to the long-term care facility were episodic possible hallucinations. It was challenging to know if what was described was misinterpretation of objects in view or a true hallucination. During this time, she developed muscle rigidity, motor apraxias, worsening perceptual, and language skills and became dependent for all activities of daily livings. At the fourth year of treatment, occasional myoclonus was noted. She was a 1 person assist for walking because of increased risk of falls. After 1 year in the care home, she was admitted to the acute care hospital in respiratory distress. CT brain imaging during that admission revealed marked generalized global cortical atrophy and marked hippocampal atrophy (Fig. 2). She died at age 63 of pneumonia. An autopsy was performed confirming the cause of death and her diagnosis of AD, showing numerous plaques and tangles with congophilic amyloid angiopathy. In addition, there was prominent Lewy Body pathology noted in the amygdala.FIGURE 2: Coronal view, computed tomographic image, patient age 63, showing significant generalized atrophy and dramatic hippocampal atrophy.Three years before her death informed consent was obtained from the patient and family to perform medical genetic testing for EOAD. The standard panel offered by the laboratory was selected and included PSEN1, PSEN2, APP, and apoE analysis. Tests related to genes related to frontotemporal dementia were not requested based on clinical presentation and clinical judgement. This was carried out with blood samples and not cerebrospinal fluid because of patient, family, and health provider preference. The results revealed a novel PSEN2 mutation with an adenosine replacing cytosine at nucleotide position 665, codon 222 [amino acid substation of lysine for threonine at position 221 (L221T)]. This PSEN2 variant was noted to be novel to the laboratory's database, noting that models predicted that this variant is likely pathogenic. The other notable potentially significant genetic finding is the apoliprotein E genotype was Є3/4. DISCUSSION β-amyloid (Aβ) is a 38 to 43 amino acid peptide that aggregates in AD forming toxic soluble oligomers and insoluble amyloid fibrils which form plaques. Aβ is produced by the cleavage of the APP first by an α-secretase, which produces a 99 amino acid C-terminal fragment of APP, and then at a variable \"gamma\" position by the γ-secretase which releases the Aβ peptide itself. It is this second γ-cleavage which determines the length and therefore the pathogenicity of the Aβ peptides, with 42 amino acid form of Aβ having a high propensity to aggregate and being more toxic. The γ-secretase is composed of at least 4 proteins, mAph1, PEN2, nicastrin, and presenilin. Of these proteins, presenilin has 2 distinct isoforms (PSEN1 and PSEN2), which contain the catalytic site responsible for the γ-cleavage. PSEN mutants are the most common genetic cause of AD with 247 mutations described in PSEN1 and 48 mutations described in PSEN2 (Alzgene database; www.alzforum.org/mutations). PSEN2 mutations are reported to be associated with AD of both early onset and variable age onset as well as with other neurodegenerative disorders such as Lewy Body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson dementia, and posterior cortical atrophy.2–4 In addition, PSEN2 has associations with breast cancer and dilated cardiomyopathy.3 PSEN2 mutants are believed to alter the γ-secretase cleavage of APP increasing the relative amount of the more toxic Aβ42. The mean age of onset in PSEN2 mutations, is 55.3 years but the range of onset is surprisingly wide, spanning 39 to 83 years. Over 52% of cases are over 60 years. All cases have extensive amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangles, and many have extensive alpha-synuclein pathology as well.5 In considering the novelty of this reported PSEN2 mutation, a literature search of Medline, the Alzgene genetic database of PSEN2 and the Alzheimer Disease and Frontotemporal Dementia Mutation Databases (AD&FTMD) were completed (www.molgen.vib-ua.be/ADMutations). The mutation presented here (L221T) has never been described before. Although this mutation has not been described, we believe that it is highly likely to be pathogenic. This mutation is not conservative, as it replaces a lysine residue which is positively charged with threonine which is an uncharged polar, hydrophilic amino acid. The mutation itself occurs in a small cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domain 4 and 5, which is conserved in the PSEN1 gene, and in PSEN2 is highly conserved across vertebrates, including birds and zebrafish all the way to Caenorhabditis elegans, but differs in Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) (Fig. 3). We examined this mutation using several computer algorithms which examine the likelihood that a mutation will not be tolerated. Both SIFT (http://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg) and PolyPhen-2.2.2 (HumVar) (www.bork.embl-heidelberg.de/PolyPhen) predicts that this variant is pathogenic. Interestingly, it is noted that PSEN1 mutations after amino acid 200 develop amyloid angiopathy.5,7FIGURE 3: PSEN2 sequence showing that lysine at position 221 is evolutionarily conserved. A 30 amino acid span of PSEN2 (Homo sapiens) is shown covering K221, which is shown in red. Amino acids which differ for are highlighted. Sequences shown are PSEN1 and PSEN2 (from H. sapiens), Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee), Macaca mullatta (Rhesus Macaque monkey), Mus musculus (mouse), Gallus gallus (chicken), Caenorhabditis elegans, Danio rerio (zebrafish), Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophila; fruit fly). *Amino acids are identical across all samples; \":\" conservative mutations with input sequence. Alignment performed using the tool MUSCLE.6 PSEN indicates presenilin.This patient also had an additional risk factor for AD, being a heterozygote for the apoЄ4 allele. Among other mechanisms, its presence reduces clearance of Aβ42 from the brain and increases glial activation.8 Although the apoЄ4 allele is known to lower the age of onset of dementia in late onset AD, it has not been clearly shown to influence age of onset of EOAD in a limited case series.9 It should be noted that heterozygote state may have contributed to an acceleration of her course given the known metabolism of apoЄ4 and its association with accelerated cerebral amyloid and known reduction in age of onset.10 Given that there is no definite family history of autosomal dominant early onset dementia, it is likely that her PSEN2 mutation was a new random event. With the unusually wide age of onset it is conceivable that one of her parents could still harbor this PSEN2 mutation. The patient's father, however, is currently 87 and living independently at the time of writing this manuscript, making him highly unlikely to be an EOAD carrier. Nonpaternity is an alternate explanation for the lack of known first-degree relative with EOAD; however, this is deemed unlikely by the family member who provided the supplemental history. Her mother died at age 79, so she could conceivably carry our mutation but we do not have access to this genetic material. Without extensive testing of many family members it would be impossible to speculate about autosomal recessive form of gene expression. In addition, the genetic testing requested was limited to presenilins, APP, and apoE mutations. Danish heritage may add Familial Danish dementia as a remote consideration; however, Familial Danish dementia has a much different clinical presentation with long tract signs, cerebellar dysfunction, onset in the fourth decade as well as hearing loss and cataracts at a young age.11 This disease has high autosomal dominant penetration which also makes it less likely in the patient's context. This specific gene (chromosome 13) was not tested. The autopsy findings do not support this possibility. There are reports of Familial AD pedigrees in Germany, including a Volga pedigree with PSEN141I mutation in exon 5, but this is clearly separate from our mutation which is in exon 7. Our mutation was also not observed in a recent cohort of 23 German individuals with EOAD which underwent whole genome sequencing, but did find 2 carriers of the Volga pedigree. It is also possible that both the PSEN2 mutation and the ApoE genotype contributed to her disease and early onset presentation. This case illustrates the multiple pathology types which occur in individuals bearing PSEN2 mutations, and highlights the later ages in which patients can present with PSEN2 mutations.12",

Here we present a clinicopathologic series of false-positive DLB cases. Patients were enrolled retrospectively from the Netherlands Brain Bank when they met the clinical criteria of probable DLB, but with a pathologic diagnosis other than DLB or Parkinson’s disease dementia. Twenty-two false-positive cases were selected. Alzheimer disease with or without copathology was the most common (64%) pathologic diagnosis. Other pathologic diagnoses, such as frontotemporal dementia, multiple-system atrophy, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and autoimmune encephalitis, were also encountered. Atypical clinical signs for DLB were present in almost half of the cases and could be a trigger to consider other diagnoses than DLB. Additional diagnostic examinations, feedback of pathologic diagnosis, and the creation of a set of clinical features that are indicative of other conditions, could reduce the amount of false-positive DLB cases.",

Moreover, the frequency of circulating progenitor cells (CPCs) and the blood concentration of vascular/inflammatory markers were evaluated. Materials and Methods: We recruited 35 AD subjects and 17 age-matched, sex-matched, and education-matched healthy control subjects. Cerebral vasomotor reactivity was assessed by means of the TCD-based breath-holding index test (BHI). The level of CPCs was evaluated by means of flow cytometry from venous blood samples, while blood vascular/inflammatory markers were measured by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Both cerebral assay blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCAFV) and BHI values were significantly lower in AD subjects than in healthy controls ( P &lt;0.05). A positive trend was found between MCAFV and BHI values and Mini-Mental State Evaluation (MMSE) scores. Moreover, the hematopoietic progenitor cells’ count was found to be lower in patients with AD than in controls ( P &lt;0.05). Finally, a significantly higher expression of the plasma chemokine CCL-2 was observed in AD patients than in healthy controls. Conclusions: Our results confirm that cerebral hemodynamic deterioration may be a critical marker of cognitive decline. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of circulating CPCs and chemokines as potential contributors to neurovascular dysfunction.",

Nonparametric between×within subjects analyses were conducted to examine the impact of different symbol categories on performance accuracy in all experimental groups. Results: Analyses revealed a higher symbol comprehension accuracy in healthy seniors than in MDD, MCI, and ADD patients, with the lowest accuracy rates shown by ADD patients. Although the type of symbol hardly affected performance accuracy in healthy seniors and MDD patients, different symbol categories influenced the performance of MCI and ADD patients significantly. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that symbols with distracting features impede symbol comprehension in ADD and MCI. Symbols with visual cues, by contrast, facilitate symbol comprehension in ADD and may even be advantageous over standardized symbols used in public life.",

Classification accuracy can be low when the prevalence of CI is either high or low in a clinical sample. A more robust result can be expected when avoiding the range of test scores within which most classification errors are expected, with adequate predictive values for more clinical settings. Methods: The classification methods have been applied to the MoCA data of 5019 patients in the Uniform Data Set of the University of Washington’s National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center, to which 30 Alzheimer Disease Centers (ADCs) contributed. Results: The ADCs show sample prevalence of CI varying from 0.22 to 0.87. Applying an optimal cutoff score of 23, the MoCA showed for only 3 of 30 ADCs both a positive predictive value (PPV) and a negative predictive value (NPV) ≥0.8, and in 18 cases, a PPV ≥0.8 and for 13 an NPV ≥0.8. Overall, the test scores between 22 and 25 have low odds of true against false decisions of 1.14 and contains 55.3% of all errors when applying the optimal dichotomous cut-point. Excluding the range 22 to 25 offers higher classification accuracies for the samples of the individual ADCs. Sixteen of 30 ADCs showed both NPV and PPV ≥0.8, 25 show a PPV ≥0.8, and 21 show an NPV ≥0.8. Conclusion: In comparison to a dichotomous threshold, considering the most error-prone test scores as uncertain enables a classification that offers adequate classification accuracies in a larger number of clinical settings.",

Algorithm-based scores, such as the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) dementia risk score, and the Framingham general cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk score, have been used to determine future risk for the development of cognitive decline and dementia. We evaluated the association between neuroimaging and cognitive measures with the 2 risk scores in middle-aged, cognitively intact adults (49±6 y). Methods: In a cohort of 132 participants collected in 2014, magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine measures of cortical thickness in a priori regions of interest and a neuropsychological battery to assess memory and executive function. Results: The CAIDE dementia risk score was significantly and inversely associated with the cortical thickness of the parahippocampal ( r =−0.266; P =0.002) and superior frontal gyrus ( r =−0.261; P =0.002) despite a considerable percentage of individuals (99.3%) at low risk for CVD. There was a significant negative association between CAIDE and memory ( r =−0.251; P =0.003). Framingham general CVD score was not associated with brain structure or cognitive function. Conclusions: These results indicate that the CAIDE dementia risk score is associated with cortical thickness and cognitive function at midlife in a low-risk population. These data provide insight into subclinical structural and functional changes occurring during midlife associated with future risk for the development of dementia.",

Methods: In an exploratory study of data from a population-based cohort, 1254 participants aged 65+ years were followed for 10 years for incident MCI. The main effect of baseline total minutes of exercise per week (0 vs. 1 to 149 vs. 150+), and its interaction with several vascular factors, on risk for incident MCI was examined using Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusting for demographics. Results: Compared with no exercise, 1 to 149 minutes [hazard ratio (HR)=0.90; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.69-1.16] and 150 or more minutes per week (HR=0.84; 95% CI, 0.66-1.07) of exercise lowered risk for incident MCI in a dose-dependent manner. The majority of interactions were not statistically significant, but risk reduction effect sizes of &lt;0.75 suggested that exercise may have stronger effects among those without high cholesterol, never smoking, and not currently consuming alcohol; also, those with arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. Overall, there was a pattern of exercise being associated with lower MCI risk among those without vascular factors. Conclusions: Spending more time engaging in exercise each week may offer protection against MCI in late life, with some variation among those with different vascular conditions and risk factors. Our findings may help target subgroups for exercise recommendations and interventions, and also generate hypotheses to test regarding underlying mechanisms.",

APOE can be used as an enrichment strategy or inclusion criterion for AD prevention trials. Personal genomics companies market direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic tests, including APOE. We assessed DTC APOE testing usage among enrollees of the University of California Irvine Consent-to-Contact Registry, an online recruitment registry, and attitudes toward using this information in clinical trial recruitment. Methods: We emailed links to an electronic survey to registry enrollees age 50 years or older.

Logistic regression models assessed relationships between DTC testing usage and demographic characteristics, and with willingness to share results to assist trial recruitment. Results: Among 1312 responders (57% response rate), few (7%) had used DTC testing for APOE. Non-Hispanic Asian enrollees were 93% less likely to have used DTC testing, compared with non-Hispanic Whites [95% confidence interval: (0.01, 0.67)]. Willingness to share APOE information for study recruitment was &gt;90% for both users and nonusers.

    "abstract": "Rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) is a clinical syndrome developing in <1 to 2 years. Recent progress in RPD evaluation is significant, so RPD's prevalence may change over time. The aim of our new case series was to estimate the relative frequency of RPDs' causative entities, considering the recent advances in RPDs' diagnosis, and compare the results with those of our previous report.We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 47 patients who were referred to Attikon University Hospital during a 5-year period for a suspected RPD.Neurodegenerative diseases were the most frequent causes (38%), followed by prion disease (19%) and autoimmune encephalopathy (AE, 17%). AE cases were by far more common than in our previous report, while other than AE secondary causes were significantly decreased. Mean time to dementia was 9 months in neurodegenerative diseases and 5 months in non-neurodegenerative. Main clinical findings across all patients were memory impairment (66%) and behavioral-emotional disturbances (48%).Neurodegenerative diseases are common causes of RPD and have a slower evolution than non-neurodegenerative. Diagnostic novelties enabled the recognition of AE, whereas more common secondary causes are probably now diagnosed in primary settings since the recognition of RPD as distinct clinical entity is continually increasing.",

Some patients report functional complaints long after recovery from coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), which include fatigue, breathlessness, heart palpitations, loss or alteration of taste and smell, and problems with attention, memory, and cognition. However, the long-term complications for those patients who had severe symptoms and prolonged hypoxia during their course of their hospital stay is still unknown. We report 2 patients with confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19 who experienced prolonged infection and developed rapid progressive dementia following COVID-19 pneumonia after a follow-up period of 5 to 10 months. As these cases may become more prevalent over time, we should learn to recognize the early signs of long-term COVID-19 complications in those who are especially vulnerable to neurocognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Aim: The aim of this study is to check the ability of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer disease (CSF-BMK-AD) to make a discrimination checklist within a healthy group, according to their cognitive development at 2 years of obtaining the sample. Materials and Methods: Between 2008 and 2010, 67 subjects without cognitive or behavioral disorders were included as a control group in a study on CSF-AD-BMK. Neuropsychological assessment at baseline and at follow-up had been carried out 2 years later. CSF was obtained at the inclusion. It was analyzed by Innotest reagents to measure amyloid-β (Aβ1-42), total-τ (T-τ), and phosphorylated τ181 (P-τ181p) protein levels, as well as T-τ/Aβ1-42 and P-τ181p/Aβ1-42 ratios. Results: Two years after inclusion, 28 subjects were not able to be checked for cognitive evolution. Of those who were seen for follow-up (n=39), 29 were cognitively stable and 10 showed cognitive impairment. We found significant differences in Aβ1-42 protein level (820 vs. 1359 pg/mL, P<0.003), in the T-τ/Aβ1-42 ratio (0.40 vs. 0.19, P<0.009), and in the P-τ181p/Aβ1-42 ratio (0.09 vs. 0.04, P<0.003) when both groups were compared. Conclusions: CSF-BMK-AD are able to discriminate between subjects in a group initially asymptomatic depending on their cognitive evolution at the 2 years’ follow-up. These results are consistent with the decrease of CSF Aβ1-42 protein levels as the first finding in preclinical AD showed.",

Subjects included 180 patient-caregiver dyads who are enrolled in a clinical trial testing the impact of an occupational therapy intervention plus guideline-level care to delay functional decline among older adults with AD. The primary caregiver-reported measure is the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Group Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL). Performance-based measures include the Short Physical Performance Battery and the Short Portable Sarcopenia Measure. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models were used to determine the associations of each physical performance measure with ADCS-ADL, adjusting for cognition function and other covariates. We found significant correlations between caregiver reports and observed performance-based measures across all levels of cognitive function, with patients in the lowest cognitive group showing the highest correlation. These findings support the use of proxy reports to assess physical function among older adults with AD.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study described and evaluated the rapid recruitment of elderly Chinese into clinical research at the Mount Sinai Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (MSADRC). Design and Methods: Methods of publicizing the study included lectures to local senior centers/churches and publications in local Chinese newspapers. The amount of time and success of these methods were evaluated. A “go to them” model of evaluation was used to enable participants to complete the study visit at locations where they were comfortable. Results: From January to December 2015, we recruited 98 participants aged 65 years or older who primarily speak Mandarin/Cantonese and reside in New York. The mean age and years of education was 73.93±6.34 and 12.79±4.58, respectively. The majority of participants were female (65.3%) and primarily Mandarin speaking (53.1%). Of all enrollees, 54.1% were recruited from community lectures, 29.6% through newspapers, 10.2% through word of mouth, and 6.1% from our clinical services. About 40.8% of participants underwent evaluations at the MSADRC, 44.9% at local senior centers/churches, and 14.3% at home. Implications: Given that the majority of our participants had low English proficiency, the use of bilingual recruiters probably allowed us to overcome the language barrier, facilitating recruitment. Our “go to them” model of evaluation is another important factor contributing to our successful recruitment.",

We surveyed 315 clinicians, assigning each a vignette describing a hypothetical patient with symptoms of unexplained mild cognitive impairment, possible Alzheimer disease (AD), or young-onset dementia. Vignettes reported \"positive,\" \"negative,\" or no β-amyloid imaging information. We assessed imaging's influence on diagnosis (AD contribution to symptoms), diagnostic confidence, and patient management. Compared with clinicians receiving no imaging, clinicians given positive imaging results more often attributed symptoms to AD [odds ratio (OR)=5.91; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.25-27.97]; clinicians given negative imaging were less likely (OR=0.10; 95% CI, 0.04-0.21). Clinicians identifying AD as contributing to symptoms more often recommended acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) (OR=18.59; 95% CI, 6.86-50.36) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists (OR=3.63; 95% CI, 1.78-7.39). We found that negative imaging reduced AChEI recommendations. Positive imaging reduced recommendation of β-amyloid imaging for future patients. In conclusion, β-amyloid imaging can influence diagnosis, prescriptions, and patient management.",

    "abstract": "Background: Research on Alzheimer disease and related dementias is increasingly focused on preventative strategies to target modifiable risk factors (eg, exercise, diet, cognitive stimulation) to reduce risk of cognitive decline, though it remains difficult for adults to adopt and maintain these behaviors on their own. Methods/Participants: In this survey study, we examined knowledge about modifiable risk factors for dementia, engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors, and associated barriers/facilitators in an Alzheimer disease prevention registry of at-risk, cognitively normal adults (n=135: 77% female; 96% Caucasian and non-Hispanic; mean age=66.1; 79% with family history of dementia; 46% with subjective memory decline). Results: Participants reported high levels of engagement in exercise (mean 3.4 d/wk), a healthy diet (60% with a healthy/balanced diet), and cognitive stimulation (52% engaging in cognitive stimulation 3 to 7 d/wk), and most (56% to 57%) reported moderate to high knowledge about dementia and modifiable risk factors. Family history of dementia was associated with greater knowledge of risk factors for dementia ( P =0.017), but not with knowledge of lifestyle recommendations to reduce risk ( P =0.85). Most participants (63%) reported a preference for walking/running over other types of aerobic exercise. On average, participants reported that they would be willing to increase healthy lifestyle behaviors to achieve “moderate” risk reduction for dementia (∼21% to 23%, on a scale from 0% to 40%, reflecting mildly to substantially reduced risk). Conclusion: Results broaden our understanding of current habits and willingness to engage in healthy lifestyle behaviors, which may inform individualized lifestyle interventions and/or design of prevention trials, particularly among at-risk adults with subjective or mild cognitive concerns, who may be especially motivated and able to engage in lifestyle interventions, to optimize brain health and reduce risk of cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Atypical Parkinsonian syndromes (APS) encompass a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and corticobasal syndrome (CBS). The effects of the Apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) gene on APS clinical features are controversial and understudied in several populations. We aimed to explore the influence of APOE genotype on clinical features in an APS Tunisian cohort. Methods: We included clinically diagnosed APS patients genotyped for APOE , and analyzed the clinical and APOE genotype associations. Results: A total of 328 APS patients were included, comprising 184 DLB, 58 PSP, 49 MSA, and 37 CBS. Significant differences in initial Mini-Mental State Examination and Frontal Assessment Battery scores according to APOE genotypes ( P =0.05 and 0.0048) were found. Executive dysfunction ( P =0.026) disorientation ( P =0.025), and hallucinations ( P &lt;0.001) were more pronounced among APOE -ɛ4 carriers particularly in DLB. Memory disorders were also correlated to APOE -ɛ4 allele ( P =0.048) and were more frequent among DLB and PSP carriers. Depression was associated to APOE- ε4 ( P =0.042), more markedly in APOE- ε4-CBS and MSA carriers. Conclusions: Our findings suggested a role of APOE -ε4 in defining a more altered cognitive phenotype with variable degrees across subgroups in APS patients, especially in DLB carriers. This effect mainly concerned executive, memory and orientation functions as well as hallucinations.",

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the relationship between decision-making capacity and the different domains of awareness and the relationship between decision-making capacity and the cognitive and clinical impairment of the PwAD. Using a cross-sectional design, we included 121 PwAD and their caregivers. Awareness was assessed across domains, including cognitive functioning and health condition, functional activity impairments, emotional state, social functioning, and interpersonal relationships. The MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Treatment was adopted to gather information about decision-making abilities. We found that decision-making capacity is related to the cognitive and functional domains of awareness and relatively independent of the emotional functioning and the relationship domains. Our finding highlighted that PwAD who are unaware of the disease or the cognitive and functional impairments might be unlikely to appreciate the personal benefits of a proposed health treatment or to understand and judge the personal consequences of a decision accurately.",

However, there has been a paucity of studies that measured their effect on social engagement. This proof-of-concept study evaluates efficacy of the Musical Bridges to Memory (MBM) intervention on PWD’s social engagement, behavioral symptoms, and associated caregiver distress. Methods: Twenty-nine PWDs and caregivers (8 control dyads, 21 intervention) participated in this dyadically designed, prospective, blinded, 12-week controlled interventional study. The intervention consisted of weekly MBM sessions, led by board-certified music therapists and performers, including caregiver training, live performances, and social breakout groups. Outcomes were measured by the Verbal and Nonverbal Interaction Scale for Care Receivers (VNVIS-CR) to code interactions between PWDs and caregivers for verbal and nonverbal sociable and unsociable behaviors. Symptom severity and caregiver distress were measured using Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Results: Nonverbal sociable interactions significantly increased ( P =0.012) in those who completed the MBM program as compared with a decrease observed in the control group. Family/caregiver distress associated with PWDs neuropsychiatric symptoms showed significant improvement in the experimental group as compared with controls ( P =0.045). Conclusions: This study provides proof-of-concept that MBM improves nonverbal sociable content of PWDs interactions and reduces caregivers’ distress.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between Alzheimer disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (senile dementia Lewy body type, or SDLT) and dementia in Parkinson's disease is unclear. AD pathology is characterised by both amyloid deposition and abnormal phosphorylation of tau in paired helical filaments (PHF-tau). In AD, abnormally phosphorylated PHF-tau is present in neurofibrillary tangles, in neuritic processes of senile plaques, and also in neuropil threads dispersed throughout the cerebral cortex. Cortical homogenates from 12 cases each of AD and SDLT, 13 cases of Parkinson's disease, and 11 normal controls were examined by Western blot analysis with antibodies that detect PHF-tau. No PHF-tau was found in Parkinson's disease or control cortex. No PHF-tau was found in SDLT cases without histological evidence of tangles. PHF-tau was detectable in SDLT cases with a low density of tangles, and large amounts of PHF-tau were present in AD cases. This study demonstrates that abnormally phosphorylated PHF-tau is only present where tangles are found and not in SDLT cases without tangles or with only occasional tangles. It is concluded that Lewy body dementias are distinct at a molecular level from AD.",

Various methods such as respite services and day care as well as counseling and support groups have been shown to reduce caregiver stress and burnout. Moreover, there are many areas in which the informed, trained caregiver can contribute positively to, and even lead, the interdisciplinary ongoing care of AD patients. For example, the caregiver can help with memory aids, behavioral interventions, the maintenance of exercise and nutrition, healthcare proxies and housing arrangements, decisions about intensity of treatment, and the timely implementation of palliative care approaches. Caregivers skilled in such matters will increase the quality of life of the AD patient and reduce their dependency. Many support services and educational activities are known to help caregivers and their patients, yet their availability is variable, and it is unclear whose responsibility it is to organize and finance them.",

The intent of $5.1 million, 4-year (1988-1992) program was to demonstrate that nonprofit day centers could provide financially viable programs and services needed by people with dementia and their caregivers. Seventeen grantees in 13 states, representing 21 different organizations and operating 24 day centers, participated in the project throughout the entire 4 years. The DCRSP has provided the first overview of dementia-specific day programs in the United States, with specific insight as to who is being served (e.g., participant and caregiver characteristics), types of assistance needed in relation to activities of daily living, and the most common behavior problems being exhibited. In addition, results of the 4-year project support the fact that community-based day centers can effectively care for people with dementia, a demand for these services does exist, and families consider these services of sufficient value that they are willing to pay for them out-of-pocket. Results also show that nonprofit day centers can become financially viable programs if attention is given to factors such as providing consumer-responsive services, charging what services actually cost, and having a high level of community visibility. The net result is increased net operating revenue with improved financial performance and enhanced long-term stability.",

The ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene on chromosome 19 is a susceptibility factor for AD, and in a small number of AD families, dominant mutations with high penetrance are operating in genes on chromosomes 1, 14 and 21. However, the disease in many familial AD cases cannot be explained by these genes; thus, other genetic factors involved in the etiology of AD should exist. Recently, an association between the cytochrome P450 2D6B (CYP2D6B) allele and the Lewy body variant of AD was reported. In the present study, 54 unrelated Swedish familial AD patients and 56 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were studied with respect to the two genetic polymorphisms of oxidative drug metabolism, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. No significant association was found between the defect CYP2D6A and -B or CYP2C19m 1 and -m2 alleles and familial AD patients, with the exception of a lower frequency of CYP2D6B in the male AD cases.",

During the Middle Ages, the main contribution was by Roger Bacon in 1290. The first textbook of neurology, De cerebri morbis, by Jaso de Pratis (1549), included a chapter on dementia (“De memoriae detrimento”). In the 17th century, Thomas Willis recognized intellectual loss with aging. In the 19th century, Philippe Pinel removed chains from the mentally ill; his student Esquirol wrote the first modern classification of mental disease, including senile dementia. In 1860, Morel recognized brain atrophy with aging. The modern history of vascular dementia began in 1896, when Emil Kraepelin in his textbook Psychiatrie included “arteriosclerotic dementia” among the senile dementias, following the ideas of Otto Binswanger and Alois Alzheimer, who had differentiated clinically and pathologically arteriosclerotic brain lesions from senile dementia and from neurosyphilitic general paresis of the insane.

Methods Patients were stratified by age and by the presence of one or more ε4 alleles at the APOE locus, then randomized to receive nizatidine 75 mg (Axid AR™, Whitehall Robins) or a matching placebo tablet twice daily. Cognitive outcomes were assessed at baseline, six, and twelve months after enrollment using tests from the CERAD battery and additional measures of visuospatial memory, verbal memory, and verbal fluency. Results Subjects showed significant declines in language, fluency, and praxis but most measures of memory had already \"bottomed out.\" Intention-to-treat and compliance-based analyses showed no effect of nizatidine on any of the cognitive outcome measures over the one-year study interval.

    "abstract": "The incubation period of scrapie, its degenerative neuropathology and the replication of its causal unconventional virus are all tightly controlled parameters of the experimental disease in mice. Each parameter can vary depending on the strain and dose of virus, on the route of infection, and on the host genotype. Exposure to whole-body gamma-irradiation from Caesium 137 has no effect on the progress or development of the disease, based on the three independent indices of incubation period, neuropathology, or infectibility by high or low doses of virus. These results are based on an extensive series of experiments in many mouse strains and are consistent using different strains (ME7, 22A, 79A, 87V) and doses of virus, routes of infection, timing and dose of radiation (3-15 Gy) administered as single or fractionated exposures with or without bone-marrow (b.m.) replacement therapy. Levels of infection in the spleen are unaltered after lethal whole-body irradiation of the scrapie-infected host, despite several-fold reductions in tissue mass due to the loss of proliferating myeloid and lymphoid precursor cells and their progeny. Contrary to our earlier suggestion, scrapie infection with the 22A virus does not reduce the effectiveness of post-exposure bone-marrow replacements to recolonise an infected host after repeated ionising radiation totalling 15Gy. This work narrows the search for the candidate cells and biosynthetic systems which replicate the virus in the lymphoreticular and central nervous systems. Many programmed cellular events are radiation sensitive but protein synthesis is extremely radioresistant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

There has been little discussion of maximal potential risk at a time when studies may be becoming increasingly invasive and risky. Proxy consent under such circumstances merits more thorough defense.

Descriptive epidemiology is concerned with describing the distribution of disease by person, place, and time. It is useful for hypothesis generation, but not generally for hypothesis testing. Observational analytic epidemiology focuses on identifying putative causes for an illness. Although its primary mission is hypothesis testing, it can lead to new hypotheses as well. Finally, experimental analytic epidemiology or clinical trials can provide rigorous tests of presumed causal associations. The strengths and limitations of various designs as they apply to determining causal associations in studies of AD and dementia are reviewed. Over the past 60 years, the epidemiologic study of dementia has evolved from basic descriptive studies of prevalence and incidence to case-control and cohort studies and finally to the first clinical trials to prevent AD.",

RRA practice involves many more factors beyond cultural considerations to be highlighted here. However, it is the cultural dimension where much is at stake, where there is the least comprehensive framework, and where the most ambiguity exists relative to RRA practice. The discussion proceeds on three premises. First, a composite, culturally attuned RRA working model can be assembled from the current literature. Second, culturally speaking, recruitment, retention, and adherence are essentially linked processes. Although each of the components of RRA practice has its own unique set of tasks, culture permeates them all. Third, any RRA practice model that emerges must be tailored to the communities, the specific target populations, and the programmatic circumstances to which the effort is attached.",

    "abstract": "The validity and reliability of clinic-based and telephone-based versions of a 4 word delayed recall test were evaluated in nondemented elderly individuals (n=644) participating in a simulated primary prevention clinical trial. There was no significant difference in the average scores achieved by participants tested in clinic (mean=3.40) or by telephone (mean=3.47) and the 2 groups had similar distributions of scores. Delayed recall scores were significantly, but weakly, correlated with scores on a rigorous verbal memory task, were lower in participants in Clinical Dementia Rating stage 0.5 than in those in Clinical Dementia Rating stage 0, and were lower in those with subjective memory complaints than in those without complaints. There was only fair correspondence between scores achieved at initial testing and 3 months later for both versions of the test. There were no differences in the average scores achieved by men or women, those older (age 80 to 93) or younger (age 75 to 79) than age 80, or those with white or nonwhite ethnicity. Participants with low education scored significantly lower than those with high education. Results suggest that clinic-based and telephone-based versions of the Four Word Delayed Recall Test are valid and reliable and can be used to screen for possible memory deficits in elderly individuals. However, the psychometric properties of the test are relatively weak and do not support the general use of the test for clinical and research purposes if the use of a more rigorous memory test with a wider range of possible scores is feasible.",

The symposium, sponsored by the Wien Center for Alzheimer's Disease and Memory Disorders, Mt Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, Florida; and the Byrd Alzheimer Center and Research Institute in Tampa, Florida, brought together an international group of clinicians and researchers to examine current evidence for developing new criteria for AD and for outlining areas that still require clarification. Neuropathologic, neuroimaging, epidemiologic, and clinical perspectives were presented and discussed, as well as the impact of ethnic and cultural differences. As became evident, each perspective introduces different challenges in terms of selecting the appropriate assessment tools; determining when, where, and by whom the diagnosis should be given; and deciding whether multiple sets of criteria are needed for use in different settings, for example, research versus primary care practices. As was intended, the symposium delivered no consensus; however, there was substantial support for the idea that AD can and probably should be diagnosed before the onset of dementia, particularly as new interventions become available.",

To provide direction for future research and generate suggestions to assist in the development of a valid and reliable functional communication scale for the needs of AD clinical trials, we have included not only functional communication scales, but also related concepts that give thought-provoking impulses for the development of a functional communication scale. As outcome measures for AD clinical trials, the 6 identified papers use 6 different scales, for functional communication and for related concepts. All of the scales appear to have questionable psychometric properties, but still provide a promising basis for the creation of a functional communication scale. We conclude with concrete suggestions on how to combine the advantages of the existing scales for future research aimed at developing a valid and reliable functional communication scale for the needs of AD clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) is a complex genetic disorder. Although genes involved in early-onset forms were discovered more than a decade ago, LOAD research has only been able to point out small effect loci, with the exception of APOE. We mapped the gene predisposing to LOAD in an extended inbred family coming from a genetically isolated region (24 sampled individuals, 12 of whom are affected), completing a genome-wide screen with an Affymetrix10 K single nucleotide polymorphism microarray. Genotyping results were evaluated under model-dependent (dominant and recessive) and model-free analysis. We obtained a maximum nonparametric linkage score of 3.24 (P=0.00006) on chromosome 8p22-p21.2. The same genomic position also yielded the highest multipoint heterogeneity LOD (HLOD) under a recessive model (HLOD=3.04). When we compared the results of the model-dependent analysis, a higher score was obtained in the recessive model (3.04) than in the dominant model (1.0). This is a new locus identified in LOAD, in chromosome 8p22-p21.2 and encompassing several candidate genes, among them CLU and PPP3CC that were excluded by sequencing. The finding of a recessive model of inheritance, consistent with the assumption of inbreeding as a morbidity factor in this population, supports the notion of a role of recessive genes in LOAD.",

    "abstract": "The principal hypothesis for pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) is the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which emphasizes an imbalance between production and clearance of β-amyloid (Aβ) in the brain. Insulin has important effects on the regulation of the Aβ level in the brain, modulating both Aβ production and clearance. An optimal brain insulin level promotes Aβ clearance, which may play protective roles against AD. A functional human leptin receptor gene (LEPR) polymorphism, a glutamine to an arginine substitution at codon 223 (Gln223Arg), has been associated with insulin resistance capacity and an altered leptin-binding activity. The LEPR Gln223Arg polymorphism may thus play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. In this study, we examined the association between the LEPR Gln223Arg polymorphism and late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) in a Japanese population. Our sample includes 49 patients with LOAD and 134 normal controls. Our preliminary data showed no significant association between the LEPR Gln223Arg polymorphism and LOAD (genotype distribution: χ2=0.11, df=2, P=0.945; allele frequency: χ2=0.058, df=1, P=0.81, odds ratio=1.08, 95% confidence interval=0.59 to 2.03). Our results suggest that the LEPR polymorphism may not play a major role in the development of LOAD.",

As this information rarely exists, clinicians must rely on instruments especially designed for estimation of premorbid abilities. No such instrument was available in Portugal until the development of the TeLPI, an irregular words oral reading test. This study aims to examine TeLPI's validity as a measure of premorbid ability in the spectrum of aging cognitive decline, from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD), by the analysis of its stability in normal versus impaired samples. A total of 104 patients, classified into 2 clinical groups, MCI (n=53) and probable mild to moderate AD (n=51), were compared with a group of cognitively healthy controls (C_MCI: n=53; C_AD: n=51) and matched for sex, age, education, and residence. As expected, the Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment results were significantly different between the groups (AD<MCI<controls), reflecting the severity of cognitive impairment. TeLPI median scores of controls, MCI, and probable AD patients were comparable after correcting for years of education, revealing no significant effect of cognitive impairment on TeLPI performance, and suggesting its validity for estimating premorbid intelligence in subjects with cognitive decline and dementia.",

Our aim was to describe clinical and ancillary study findings in patients with RPD and evaluate their diagnostic performance for the identification of nonchronic neurodegenerative rapidly progressive dementia (ncnRPD). Methods: We reviewed clinical records and ancillary methods of patients evaluated for RPD at our institution in Buenos Aires, Argentina from 2011 to 2017. We compared findings between chronic neurodegenerative RPD and ncnRPD and evaluated the diagnostic metrics using receiver operating characteristic curves. Results: We included 104 patients with RPD, 29 of whom were chronic neurodegenerative RPD and 75 of whom were ncnRPD. The 6-month time to dementia cutpoint had a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 100% for ncnRPD, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.965 (95% confidence interval=0.935-0.99; P &lt;0.001). A decision tree that included time to dementia, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis identified ncnRPD patients with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 79%, positive predictive value of 93%, and negative predictive value of 100% overall. Discussion: RPD is a clinical syndrome that comprises different diagnoses, many of them for treatable diseases. Using the time to dementia, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis when triaging these patients could help identify those diseases that need to be studied more aggressively.",

A total of 1021 older AA adults without missing data met the criteria. Results: A total of 258 participants reported a SMC. SMCs were more likely with lower scores on measures of episodic memory and processing; however, SMCs were also more likely with higher scores on a measure of working memory. Working memory appeared to mediate reporting of SMC among participants with lower episodic memory scores. Discussion: These findings demonstrate that SMCs are associated with lower scores on objective neuropsychological measures among older AAs. Additional work is needed to determine whether SMCs are further associated with a risk for clinical transition to mild cognitive impairment or dementia among AA older adults.",

All 26 sCJD patients received brain magnetic resonance imaging scan, cerebrospinal fluid 14-3-3 protein detection, electroencephalogram, and PRNP gene screening. The codon 129 polymorphism were all homozygous MM in 26 sCJD patients. The main onset symptoms of sCJD patients were rapidly progressive dementia, visual impairment, and cerebellar ataxia. At the time of diagnosis, the incidence of myoclonus and akinetic mutism were relatively low (&lt;50%). For auxiliary examinations, the positive rate of the typical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities, cerebrospinal fluid 14-3-3 protein, and electroencephalogram-periodic sharp wave complex was 96%, 64%, and 50%, respectively. As MM genotype is dominant and brain MRI is sensitive, brain MRI seems to play a major role in diagnosis of sCJD in Chinese.",

Methods: The study included 2513 men (mean age of 73.1 y) enrolled in the MCSA. A history of prostate cancer, ADT use, and length of ADT exposure before their first MCSA visit was abstracted using the Rochester Epidemiology Project medical records-linkage system. MCI was diagnosed at the baseline visit. Logistic regression was used to determine whether prostate cancer and ADT use was associated with odds of MCI. Results: Of the 2513 participants, 349 (13.9%) had a history of prostate cancer; among whom 99 (28.3%) were treated with ADT before MCSA enrollment. There were 382 (15.2%) with a diagnosis of MCI. In the univariate logistic regression models, prostate cancer (odds ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.00), and ADT exposure (odds ratio, 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.96-2.58) were associated with higher odds of MCI. These associations were greatly attenuated and not significant in multivariable models. Conclusions: Neither a diagnosis of prostate cancer nor ADT use was associated with odds of MCI in this cross-sectional population-based study.",

This study quantitatively characterizes cognitive decline rates in MCI and tests whether volumetric data from baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can predict accelerated cognitive decline. Methods: The authors retrospectively examined Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data to obtain serial Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) scores, diagnoses, and the following baseline MRI volumes: total intracranial volume, whole-brain and ventricular volumes, and volumes of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, fusiform gyrus, and medial temporal lobe. Subjects with &lt;24 months or &lt;4 measurements of MMSE data were excluded. Predictive modeling of fast cognitive decline (defined as &gt;0.6/year) from baseline volumetric data was performed on subjects with MCI using a single hidden layer neural network. Results: Among 698 baseline MCI subjects, the median annual decline in the MMSE score was 1.3 for converters to dementia versus 0.11 for stable MCI ( P &lt;0.001). A 0.6/year threshold captured dementia conversion with 82% accuracy (sensitivity 79%, specificity 85%, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.88). Regional volumes on baseline MRI predicted fast cognitive decline with a test accuracy of 71%. Discussion: An MMSE score decrease of &gt;0.6/year is associated with MCI-to-dementia conversion and can be predicted from baseline MRI.",

This study examined the cognitive performance of 181 participants from various MCI subgroups, a group of mildly impaired individuals with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and a group of individuals with subjective memory impairment on various semantic memory tasks. The aMCI-single domain (aMCI-sd) group displayed poor performance on a semantic memory task requiring relatively higher degrees of effortful retrieval, and participants in the aMCI-multiple domain (aMCI-md) group, who also suffered with mild executive dysfunction displayed poor performance on all semantic memory tasks, similar to the DAT group. The nonamnestic MCI (non-a-MCI)-single domain group displayed normal performance across all semantic tasks, whereas the non-a-MCI-multiple domain group displayed a pattern similar to that of the aMCI-sd group. aMCI-sd patients who displayed poor performance on the semantic memory task had higher risk of conversion to DAT, whereas poor performance on tasks requiring relatively less effortful retrieval was associated with higher risk of conversion in the aMCI-md group. Thus, executive function may relate to deterioration of semantic memory retrieval processes. Such patterns of semantic memory impairment could be valuable for characterization of cognitive differences among MCI patients.",

Even high positive predictive values, however, cannot be guaranteed even by tests with high sensitivity and specificity when disease prevalence is low. If we regard the clinical criteria for aMCI as a test for predicting aMCI due to AD, the positive predictive value of the criteria will be low by definition in young patients with aMCI (age below 65 years) because of the low prevalence of AD in this age group. To test this hypothesis, we compared CSF biomarkers for AD between young (age below 65 years) and old (age 65 years or older) age groups of normal cognition, aMCI, and AD of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Using these biomarkers, we observed that the prevalence of aMCI due to AD differed significantly between the young and the old. For example, only 28.2% young aMCI, but 63.2% old aMCI, had abnormal CSF amyloid measures consistent with AD pathology. As posited, the presence of aMCI due to AD was lower in young aMCI than in old aMCI. Given that the likelihood of aMCI due to AD is reduced in younger subjects, more attention to and evaluation of alternative diagnoses need to be considered in this group.",

This study aimed at investigating such relationships along AD evolution by means of the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD).Consecutive pairs of AD outpatients and their primary informal caregivers were enrolled. Patients were evaluated by means of the Mini Mental State Examination and neuropsychological tests. A clinician completed the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale to stage dementia severity and interviewed the caregivers to complete the Neuropsychiatric Inventory to assess behavioral disturbances and the DAD to evaluate patients' functional competence.A total of 158 dyads were enrolled; the Mini Mental State Examination score was used to stratify patients into 4 groups (>24; 20 to 23.9; 10 to 19.9; <10) that were compared. The statistical analysis revealed that all the cognitive domains were positively related to functional independence, but only logical and executive functions seemed to predict autonomy. An intergroup comparison did not show significant differences in the DAD subscales measuring initiation, planning and organization, and performance. The role of education emerged, confirming the relevance of cognitive reserve.As the field moves toward earlier intervention in preclinical AD, the detection of early functional changes may drive the definition of trials on prevention or intervention for dementia.",

Bridging studies are late phase I safety/tolerance studies that determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in patients before phase II efficacy studies are initiated, facilitating the transition from phase I to phase II development. Determining the MTD in patients maximizes the potential to detect efficacy by permitting the use of the highest tolerated doses in phase II while providing a good understanding of potential adverse events. Bridging studies should be double-blind, placebo-controlled, inpatient studies conducted in acute-care facilities by clinical personnel who are equipped to handle unexpected contingencies under the oversight of a competent, multidisciplinary review board. Patients should be in good physical health (excluding AD), and a comprehensive informed consent procedure must be instituted. We recommend initially using a fixed-dose panel design with a dose schedule based on the MTD in normal volunteers and later establishing the dose titration MTD.",

As a stimulus for discussion, a hypothetical, illustrative case vignette is presented. A 48-year-old man, concerned about recent memory loss and with a family history of early-onset AD, requested testing for the APP717 Valle mutation, previously identified in his relatives affected with AD. Whether the testing should be undertaken is considered in the context of the current interpretation of potential test results as well as the competency of the individual who requested the test to provide informed consent. Informed consent includes an understanding of the foreseeable risks and benefits associated with disclosure of test results. Although molecular genetic testing in particular individuals, such as the man described herein, could be appropriate, it should not be interpreted to apply in general at this stage to individuals suspected of having AD. In view of a number of caveats, including the genetic heterogeneity of AD, which significantly limits the sensitivity and specificity of the currently available genetic tests, further research and discussion is strongly recommended before widespread introduction of molecular genetic testing for individuals with suspected AD.",

Any reported gait disturbance was considered an abnormal gait. Only cases for which medical records were available documenting the patient's presentation for dementia were included. Cases were excluded if any other pathology was present that may have contributed to the patient's dementia or to a gait disorder, if neuroleptic medication had been used, or if there was a preexisting gait disorder. Clinical dementia severity at time of presentation was graded as mild, moderate, or severe per DSM-IIIR criteria.

The phospholipase C (PLC) isozyme, PLC-α1, was abnormally accumulated in neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), the neuntes surrounding senile plaque cores, and neuropil threads in AD brains. Anti-PLC-α1 antibody marked the same NFT-bearing neurons containing T immunoreactivity. Electron microscopic immunocytochemistry revealed that antigenic determinants unique to PLC-α1 are mainly present intraneuronally on the amorphous granular components of NFT as well as the abnormal filaments. Although the concentration of PLC-α1 protein was significantly higher in the cytosolic fraction of AD cortical tissue than in control brains, the specific activity of PLC-α1 is decreased in AD brains. The amounts of PLC-β1 and -α1 and type β protein kinase C were significantly reduced in the membranous fraction of the AD temporal cortical tissues compared with controls. The PLC-α1 abnormality was also present in nonneuronal tissues as well as the brains of patients with AD. It was revealed that nitric oxide (NO) formation secondary to Ca2 influx by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation leads to modifications of PLC-α1 similar to those seen in AD brains. These results suggest that altered Ca2 homeostasis, occurring as a consequence of aberrant phosphoinositide metabolism, may be related to key features of AD such as neurofibrillary degeneration, aberrant amyloid deposits, and neuronal death.",

In this article, the reliability and validity of the Japanese version of GBS Scale (GBSS-J) in 246 patients with dementia are examined. Two pairs of raters independently rated 20 patients to test inter-rater reliability of the 26 items. Pearson's correlation coefficients indicated good agreement between the raters except for nine items. The validity of the 26 items was examined by comparing them with the Functional Assessment Staging. Physical disability was evaluated by the Rapid Disability Rating Scale. Twenty items of GBSS-J measured the severity of dementia with sufficient validity. In addition, the items of eating, impaired physical activity, impaired wakefulness, and irritability were related to severity of physical disability rather than to dementia by the results from an analysis of variance and covariance. Although internal reliabilities by Cronbach's 03B1 of the three subscales were relatively high except for the subscale of different symptoms common in dementia, a factor analysis of the 26 items raised questions concerning the construct validity of the original four subscales",

Data from Phase III clinical trials have demonstrated that donepezil improves cognition, global function, and activities of daily living. In addition, there were no clinically significant treatment-related effects on vital signs or laboratory values in any trial. Adverse events, when present, were generally mild in intensity, transient, and resolved during continued treatment with donepezil. This favorable safety profile, together with its reported clinical benefits established donepezil as one standard of AD therapy. Vitamin E is one of two anti-oxidant therapies that may help to slow the progression of AD over at least a two-year period. One large-scale clinical trial suggests that it has sufficient benefit and safety to join donepezil as a current standard of AD therapy.",

Forty-two probable AD patients and eight normal controls underwent MR brain scans, neurological examinations, and neuropsychological testing. We computed each subject's corpus callosum width, ventricular size, right and left temporal lobe areas, interuncal distance, and assessed the degree of cortical atrophy. We also estimated the rate of change for Information-Memory-Concentration Test scores and for temporal lobe areas and corpus callosum width. Measures of temporal lobe area and subjective evaluation of temporal lobe atrophy both served to distinguish controls from mild AD cases (p<0.05), whereas only the latter differentiated moderate from severe patients (p<0.05). The rate of change for temporal lobe areas remained constant over different AD stages, whereas those for corpus callosum width and for cognitive impairment were greater for severe cases (p<0.05). Our findings imply that measurements of temporal lobe area and ratings of temporoparietal atrophy can be useful in the diagnosis and staging of AD and suggest that atrophy progressed at different rates in selected ROIs for various stages of AD severity",

We asked whether the AD-type visual profile occurs in Down syndrome (DS) in light of the fact that AD neuropathology is present in DS by age 40. We tested 22 adults with DS and 18 adults with mental retardation of non-DS etiology (MR). DS subjects made more tritanomalous errors on the test of color vision than predicted by chance (p < 0.05), indicating a deficiency in the discrimination of short wavelengths (blue hues) but not more of other types of hue discrimination errors. DS subjects had higher stereoacuity thresholds than MR subjects (p < 0.01) and reduced contrast sensitivity across the frequency range (p < 0.01). Taken together, the results point to AD-like visual deficits in DS. Like classic AD, DS may be associated with pathological changes in the parastriate and peristriate visual cortex. DS performance was not correlated with age, suggesting that in individual subjects, the AD-like visual deficits may present prior to and independent of age-associated dementia.",

    "abstract": "A great deal of secondary, or covariable, information is often collected during the course of large-scale clinical trials. This information typically includes demographic and anthropometric data but often also includes more elaborate laboratory-based measures that might be used to screen for adverse reactions to the preventive agent or treatment being tested. This information can be and often is used to identify individuals or, more likely, subgroups of individuals who appear to respond better (or worse) to the compound of relevance. Such heterogeneity in response is to be expected, since the basic biological constitution of individuals differs widely and since it is well known from simple pharmacokinetic assays that such differences can affect drug responses. Since genes influence the biological constitution of individuals, it is easy to argue that genetic differences between individuals could explain differential responsiveness to certain drugs, as pharmacogeneticists have suggested for years. In this article, it is argued that by collecting relevant genetic data on participants in large-scale clinical trials as though these data merely provided additional covariables, one might not only be in a position to identify responders and nonresponders to the compound being tested but could also be in a position to address fundamental questions about the nature and pathogenesis of the disease for which the compound was designed. Although we exemplify this simple argument by referring to antihypertensive compounds and research, this reference is made merely for reasons of convenience, since there are numerous compounds designed expressly for the prevention and treatment of hypertension, but rather few for Alzheimer disease. It is hoped that by adopting some of the guidelines and principles outlined herein, better and more appropriate compounds for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer disease will be tested and ultimately made available to the patients for whom they work best.",

Subtle personality changes tend to occur early; these include apathy, irritability and inability to pay attention. Later agitation, aggression and disinhibited behaviors may appear. We have utilized the Columbia University Scale for Psychopathology in Alzheimer's Disease to monitor a number of behavioral symptoms in 235 patients with early probable AD. Markov analyses were used to predict the probability of developing or retaining a given symptom at 6-month follow-up. The results show that the symptoms of psychopathology in AD fluctuate with time. Agitation was both the most frequent and persistent symptom, while paranoid delusions and hallucinations were less persistent. Most behavioral disturbances, except paranoid delusions, were associated with greater cognitive impairment. There was no association between depressive features and either cognitive or functional impairment. These results have important implications for the optimal treatment of the psychopathological symptoms of AD.",

Nerve growth factor has a trophic effect on cholinergic neurons and therefore may have some beneficial effects on the cognitive impairment observed in patients with Alzheimer disease. Experimental studies demonstrated that a continuous infusion of nerve growth factor into the cerebroventricle prevents cholinergic neuron atrophy after axotomy or associated with normal aging and ameliorates cognition impairment in these animals. A clinical study in three patients with Alzheimer disease revealed, however, that a long-term intracerebroventricular infusion of nerve growth factor may have certain potentially beneficial effects, but the continuous intracerebroventricular route of administration is also associated with negative side effects that appear to outweigh the positive effects. Several other strategies have been suggested to provide neurotrophic support to cholinergic neurons. In this article, we review the neurotrophic factor strategies for the treatment of Alzheimer disease.",

Human kidney 293T-cells were cotransfected with tau and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) genes or tau and protein kinase B genes. The phosphorylation of tau protein was increased by cotransfection with GSK-3; however, it was decreased by cotransfection with protein kinase B. Human neuroblastoma SY5Y cells were treated with wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, and only transient (after 1 hour) activation of GSK-3 and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein were observed. However, continuous inactivation of protein kinase B was observed, suggesting the involvement of protein kinases other than protein kinase B in the phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK-3 after 3 hours. In cells treated with wortmannin, protein kinase C delta fragments were observed, and the protein kinase C activity increased after 3 hours, whereas treatment of cells with z-DEVD-fmk, an inhibitor of caspase-3, inhibited fragmentation of protein kinase C delta and induced continuous activation of GSK-3. It is suggested that fragmentation of protein kinase C delta during the process of apoptosis results in the phosphorylation and the inactivation of GSK-3. Those data suggest that, in Alzheimer disease, more complicated mechanisms are involved in the process of phosphorylation of tau protein predominantly regulated by P13K pathway.",

    "abstract": "The emerging evidence of ethnic variations in apolipoprotein polymorphism and Alzheimer disease risk shows that one cannot generalize findings based on a single cultural group too broadly (Tang et al., 2001). Presence of one apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele is a stronger risk factor for Alzheimer disease in whites and Asians than in blacks (Farrer et al., 1997). Environmental or genetic cofactors may modulate the effects of epsilon 4 on beta-amyloid metabolism differently in different subpopulations (Shadlen, 1998). Recognizing this, the Alzheimer's Association has extended its goals to strengthen the scientific information base on the interactions of population diversity and Alzheimer disease heterogeneity (NIA, 1998). This new focus is timely since minority elderly are the most rapidly increasing segment of the elderly population (Lilienfeld and Perl, 1994, Brookmeyer et al., 1998). In this article, the authors highlight recent progress in research on Alzheimer disease among culturally diverse populations with a special emphasis on gaps in the knowledge base. The authors recommend four priorities for future Alzheimer disease research: (1) determine whether genetic causative factors interact differently in different populations; (2) reexamine the nature and role of cerebral ischemia and infarction and variations in symptom severity of Alzheimer disease; (3) explore the interaction of genes and environmental influences that are protective against Alzheimer disease; and (4) recruit and enroll ethnically diverse subjects in Alzheimer disease clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Dementia resulting from Alzheimer disease is one of the most prevalent medical problems. Elaborate expert guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer disease do not always take sufficient account of the resources available in general practice. The focus on pure Alzheimer disease can be inappropriate for the large proportion of mixed dementia cases in old age. Because of such guidelines, treatment with modern and effective drugs is often delayed until conservative dementia criteria are satisfied. Criteria for the discontinuation of antidementia drugs are highly questionable. Antidementia drug sales in Germany demonstrate that the majority of prescribers hold on to conservative attitudes and prefer Ginkgo biloba and memantine to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Disappointment after exaggerated expectations and financial restrictions in the health care sector may aggravate current underprescribing of antidementia drugs. Even though contemporary symptomatic treatments for Alzheimer disease are unsatisfactory, modern medicine has been very successful in the early diagnosis and treatment of other potential causes of dementia. Future strategies will include models for the early identification of individuals carrying a high risk of developing cognitive impairment during their lifetime.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative morphometric (stereological) methods have been used to assess the effects of accumulation of neurofibrillary material on the fine structure of pyramidal cells in biopsy specimens of temporal cortex from nine patients with Alzheimer's disease. When compared with non-tangled cells from the same patients, tangled cells show an increase in total area of cytoplasm due to the accumulation of tangle and a reduction in the area of the nucleus; the area proportion of the cell body occupied by total cytoplasm, therefore, increases whereas that of the nucleus decreases. Within the total cytoplasm, nucleolar and mitochondrial areas are maintained, but that of lipofuscin is increased, though all are increased when expressed as a proportion of the useful cytoplasm alone (i.e. total cytoplasmic area minus area occupied by tangle). Measures of the amount of rough endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes are decreased overall in tangled cells, though when related to useful cytoplasm alone such measures approach non-tangled cell values. Measures of smooth endoplasmic reticulum are unaltered throughout. When related to the amount of tangle within cells it was found that the most heavily tangled cells retain 28% of useful cytoplasm, 72% of the nuclear area, 50% of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and 27% of ribosomes present within least tangled and non-tangled cells. By contrast, mitochondrial area is maintained and that of lipofuscin increased. The capacity for protein synthesis in tangled cells appears, therefore, to be progressively decreased with accumulation of tangle, whereas that for oxidative metabolism is maintained and lysosomal activity, perhaps, increased. Neurofibrillary tangle formation and accumulation may, therefore, lead to the eventual death of neurons and be the major cause of nerve cell loss in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Amyloidosis is a disorder of protein conformation leading to aggregation. The term defines a diverse group of proteins normally present in body fluids as soluble precursors that can be deposited as insoluble amyloid fibrils in different tissues producing organ dysfunction and cell death. These fibrils are composed of self-assembled, low molecular weight mass peptides adopting β-pleated sheet structure, the conformation responsible for their physicochemical properties and tinctoreal characteristics. So far, 20 different proteins have been identified as subunits of amyloid fibrils (Westermark et al., 1999). Collectively, they are products of normal genes; however, several amyloid precursors contain abnormal amino acid substitutions that can impose an unusual potential for self-aggregation. The molecular mass of the amyloid peptides is within the 4 to 30-kDa range, with heterogeneity at the amino-and carboxyl-terminal portions found in most amyloid proteins. Increased levels of amyloid precursors, either in the circulation or locally in sites of deposition, are usually the result of overexpression or defective clearance, or both. Of the 20 amyloid proteins identified, few of them are known to cause amyloid deposition in the central nervous system, which in turn results in cognitive deficits, dementia, stroke, cerebellar and extrapyramidal signs, or a combination of them.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) treatment guidelines state that cholinergic agents are not cost-effective in patients with more severe disease. Because many physicians may deem an older patient unlikely to respond to treatment, older AD patients may remain untreated. Galantamine (Reminyl), a novel cholinergic agent, is effective in mild to moderate AD. This post hoc analysis of pooled phase III galantamine clinical trials was designed to assess whether older (≥80 years) and younger (≤79 years) AD patients experience similar benefits with galantamine based on changes in the ADAS-cog and CIBIC-plus. Mean ADAS-cog scores for older patients treated with galantamine 24 mg/day significantly improved versus baseline and versus placebo at month 3. Cognitive improvement was maintained versus placebo at month 6; the ADAS-cog score for placebo patients dropped below baseline at month 6. Change in CIBIC-plus for galantamine was significantly different from placebo at months 5 to 6. Mean ADAS-cog score in older patients taking galantamine for 12 months remained above baseline. The score for patients taking placebo for 6 months before switching to galantamine did not differ significantly from baseline at 12 months but was lower than in patients receiving galantamine for 12 months. Incidence of adverse events in patients > 80 years was similar to that in the overall study population. Galantamine maintained cognitive and global function in patients > 80 years with mild to moderate AD for at least 5 to 6 months and cognitive efficacy for 12 months. Prescribing approved therapies such as galantamine for older patients with AD is recommended.",

However, there is a dearth of studies examining the relation of APOE polymorphism with cognitive functioning among community-dwelling ethnic minority elderly. This study examined the risk for cognitive impairment associated with the APOE epsilon 4 and epsilon 2 alleles in a community-based cohort of non-Hispanic white (NHW; N = 739) and white Hispanics (WH; N=321). All patients were recruited consecutively from a memory-screening program and evaluated using standardized assessment procedures. Cognitive impairment was classified according to an age and education adjusted Folstein Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSAdj) score of less than 24. The results indicated the APOE epsilon 4 allele was associated with increased risk for cognitive dysfunction in NHW and WH after controlling for the effects of age, education, and gender. This risk was generally observed to be dose-dependent, with greater risk among epsilon 4 homozygotes in relation to epsilon 4 heterozygotes. The epsilon 2 allele of APOE did not confer decreased risk for cognitive impairment among NHW and WH. This study supports the relation of APOE polymorphism to cognitive dysfunction among two ethnic populations residing in the community.",

It also aimed to explore the influence of physical activity on the relationship between obesity and oxidative stress in this at risk cohort.Older adults at risk for dementia underwent comprehensive medical, neuropsychological, and psychiatric assessment. At risk was defined as participants with subjective or mild cognitive impairment. Glutathione was assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the left hippocampus and the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated and classified as healthy (BMI <25 kg/m2) or overweight/obese (BMI ≥25 kg/m2).Sixty-five older adults (mean age=66.2 y) were included for analysis. The overweight/obese group had significantly greater glutathione in the hippocampus compared with the healthy weight group (t=-2.76, P=0.008). No significant difference in glutathione was observed between groups in the anterior or posterior cingulate. In the overweight/obese group, a higher BMI was associated with a diabetes diagnosis and lower total time engaging in physical activity (r=-0.36, P=0.025), however, glutathione did not correlate with activity levels across groups.This study demonstrates that changes in in vivo markers of oxidative stress are present in overweight/obese older adults at risk for dementia. Future research should explore the relationship with diabetes and the longitudinal relationship between BMI and oxidative stress, and response to therapeutic interventions.",

The etiology and genetic basis of these diseases remain poorly understood. Our study aimed to identify additional mutations or variants associated with sEOAD and PCA and to further examine their genetic and phenotypic spectrums. Methods: We performed whole-exome sequencing and analyzed the clinical and neuroimaging features of mutation carriers with 29 patients having sEOAD and 25 having PCA. Results: Nine rare damaging variants were identified in 4 patients with sEOAD and 3 with PCA. A novel mutation (p.A136V) in PSEN1 was identified in a patient with sEOAD and a likely pathogenic variant (p.M239T) was identified for PSEN2 in a patient with PCA. In addition, 7 rare damaging variants were detected in other genes related to neurodegenerative diseases. The patient carrying the PSEN1 p.A136V mutation presented with typical clinical and imaging features of sEOAD, and the PCA patient with the PSEN2 p.M239T mutation presented with visuospatial impairment as the initial symptom. Conclusion: Our study expands the PSEN1 mutation spectrum of sEOAD and highlights the importance of screening PSEN1 and/or PSEN2 mutations in PCA patients.",

OA was administered to bvFTD patients, normal controls, and a dementia control group with Alzheimer disease (AD). Two other frontal lobe measures adopted from animal models were administered: delayed response (DR) and delayed alternation (DA). Brain volumes were measured using the semiautomatic brain region extraction method. Compared with the normal controls, bvFTD patients were significantly impaired on OA and DR. For OA and DR, sensitivities and specificities were 100% and 51.5% (cutoff=22.5 errors) and 9.5% and 98% (cutoff=1.5 errors), respectively. Negative predictive value (NPV) for OA was 100% at all prevalence rates. Comparing AD with bvFTD, there were no significant differences on OA, DR, or DA. Nevertheless, positive predictive value (PPV) and NPV were good at all prevalence rates for OA (cutoff=36.5 errors) and DA (cutoff=6 errors); PPV was good for DR (cutoff=9 errors). Error scores above cutoffs favored diagnosis of AD. Performance on OA was significantly related to medial frontal gray matter atrophy. OA, together with DR and DA, may facilitate assessment of bvFTD as a novel probe of medial frontal function.",

Methods: A 7-item questionnaire assessing patient and caregiver views (510 total respondents) toward amyloid PET imaging was advertised broadly through alz.org/trialmatch. Results: We received 510 unique responses from 48 US states, 2 Canadian provinces, the Dominican Republic, and Greece. Both patients and caregivers indicated that they would want to receive amyloid imaging if offered the opportunity. Over 88% of respondents had a positive response (∼10% with neutral and 2% with negative responses) to whether amyloid PET should be offered routinely and be reimbursed. Such information was felt to be useful for long-term legal, financial, and health care planning. Respondents identifying with early age cognitive decline (younger than 65 y) were more likely to explore options for disability insurance ( P =0.03). Responders from the Midwest were more likely to utilize information from amyloid imaging for legal planning ( P =0.02), disability insurance ( P =0.02), and life insurance ( P =0.04) than other US regions. Discussion: Patients and caregivers supported the use of amyloid PET imaging in clinical practice and felt that the information would provide significant benefits particularly in terms of future planning.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The present study investigated (a) the agreement between computerized tomography (CT) and 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the visual grading of medial temporal atrophy (MTA); and (b) whether MTA on CT differentiated patients with dementia from no dementia in memory clinics. Materials and Methods: Data were obtained from patients who underwent CT scans at the National University Hospital of Singapore, and from a subsample who subsequently underwent 3 T MRI scans in a research study. Agreements and disagreements between CT and MRI were determined. Area under the curve (AUC) analyses determined if CT-graded MTA distinguished patients with dementia from no dementia. Results: Of the 107 patients in the subsample, MTA scores of 71 agreed on both CT and MRI. The true positive rate between CT and MRI for MTA scores ≥2 was 79.7%. The true negative rate for MTA scores between 0 and 1 was 96.4%. CT underestimated MTA severity in 33 of 36 disagreements with the MRI. MTA scores ≥2 on CT distinguished dementia from no dementia in both discovery [n=263; AUC (95% confidence interval)=0.77 (0.72-0.83); sensitivity=0.69; specificity=0.74] and validation [n=264; AUC (95% confidence interval)=0.77 (0.71-0.82); sensitivity=0.72; specificity=0.72] groups.

    "abstract": "Although Alzheimer disease (AD) remains a clinical diagnosis, biomarkers are in use to support the diagnosis. Three cerebrospinal biomarkers, amyloid-β (Aβ), total tau (T-tau), and phospho tau (P-tau), reflect neuropathologic changes observed in AD patients.The aim of this study was to explore the performance of the cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers used in a memory clinic setting.We included 205 patients who had been through a standardized examination including lumbar puncture. Diagnoses were made blind to the results of the spinal fluid analyses.By combining low Aβ and high T-tau or P-tau values, the sensitivity was 31.9% and the specificity was 92.5% when comparing patients with AD with other patients. In receiver operating characteristic analyses, the AUC for the Aβ was 0.78 (SE=0.04; 95% CI, 0.7-0.85), for T-tau 0.80 (SE=0.03; 95% CI, 0.73-0.86), and for P-tau 0.76 (SE=0.04; 95% CI, 0.69-0.83). A significant difference was found between the sexes, with higher values of Aβ among younger men (under 65 y of age) with AD [799.8 (SD=317.2) vs. 558.9 (SD=123.5) for women, P-value=0.003].The present study found a lower performance of the biomarkers than reported previously.",

Those in the bottom 2 quartiles of CPF had significantly greater decline in TICS-m than those in the top quartile (Q1: -0.3 points/year, Q2: -0.2 points/year). Apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele carriers had greater cognitive decline per unit of CPF. Those with greater CPF preserve TICS-m performance better despite greater WMHV.Telephone cognitive assessments can detect decline due to white matter lesions and smaller brain volumes.",

Methods: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional, PS-matched case (dementia): control (nondementia) study of older adults (65 y or above) using alternative years data from pooled 2005 to 2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys (MEPS). Chronic comorbidities were identified based on Clinical Classifications System or ICD-9-CM codes. Ordinary least squares regression was utilized to quantify the impact of chronic comorbidities on the excess expenditures with logarithmic transformation. Expenditures were expressed as 2019 US dollars. All analyses accounted for the complex survey design of MEPS. Results: The mean yearly home health care expenditures were particularly higher among older adults with dementia and co-occurring anemia, eye disorders, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension compared with PS-matched controls. Ordinary least squares regression models revealed that home health care expenditures were 131% higher (β=0.837, P &lt;0.001) among older adults with dementia compared with matched nondementia controls before adjusting for chronic comorbidities. When additionally adjusting for chronic comorbidities, the percentage increase, while still significant ( P &lt;0.001) decreased from 131% to 102%. Conclusions: The excess home health care expenditures were partially explained by chronic comorbidities among community-dwelling older adults with dementia.",

Methods: Incident cancer diagnoses and memory (immediate and delayed recall, combined with proxy-reported memory) were assessed at biennial study interviews in the US Health and Retirement Study (N=14,235, 1998-2016). We used multivariable segmented linear mixed-effects models to evaluate the rate of change in standardized memory score (SD/decade) in the years before, acutely at the time of, and in the years following an incident cancer diagnosis, compared to cancer-free adults, by race. Results: Black participants experienced faster memory decline than White participants (cancer-free group: −1.211 vs. −1.077; P &lt;0.0001).

We aimed to assess the prescribing and discontinuation patterns of medications following diagnosis of MNCD among community-dwelling older adults. Methods: Using the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System, we conducted a population-based cohort study comparing 1-year prediagnosis and postdiagnosis use of medications between a group of individuals older than 65 years newly diagnosed with MNCD in 2016-2017 and a control group without MNCD. The difference-in-difference method was used to estimate the prediagnosis and postdiagnosis variation in the number of medications prescribed and in the proportion of psychotropic and anticholinergic medication users. Results: In the MNCD group, the mean number of medications used (excluding Alzheimer disease treatments) increased by 1.25 in the year after the diagnosis. The respective increase was 0.45 in the control group, yielding an adjusted difference-in-differences of 0.81 (95% confidence interval: 0.74; 0.87) between groups. The adjusted difference-in-differences in the proportions of antipsychotic, antidepressant, and anticholinergic medication users was 13.2% (12.5; 13.9), 7.1% (6.5; 7.7), and 3.8% (3.1; 4.6), respectively. Conclusions: The medication burden among older adults tends to increase in the year following a diagnosis of MNCD. The use of antipsychotics and antidepressants may explain a part of the observed increase.",

We formulated screening criteria, and 2 researchers completed the screening, quality evaluation, and data extraction tasks. Finally, 35 studies related to tau, and 14 studies related to α-synuclein were included. Review Manager 5.4 and Stata16 were used for meta-analysis. Subgroup, sensitivity, and meta-regression analyses were performed to identify sources of heterogeneity and strengthen the results.

Computerized testing has become more widely used in clinical trials; however, it is unclear how sensitive these measures are to early signs of neurodegeneration. We investigated the use of the NIH Toolbox-Cognition (NIHTB-CB) and Cogstate-Brief computerized neuropsychological batteries in the identification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) versus healthy older adults [healthy control (HC)] and amnestic (aMCI) versus nonamnestic MCI (naMCI). Exploratory analyses include investigating potential racial differences. Methods: Two hundred six older adults were diagnosed as aMCI (n = 58), naMCI (n = 15), or cognitively healthy (HC; n = 133). Results: The NIH Toolbox-CB subtests of Flanker, Picture Sequence Memory, and Picture Vocabulary significantly differentiated MCI from HC. Further, subtests from both computerized batteries differentiated patients with aMCI from those with naMCI. Although the main effect of race differences was noted on tests and in diagnostic groups was significant, there were no significant race-by-test interactions. Conclusions: Computer-based subtests vary in their ability to help distinguish MCI subtypes, though these tests provide less expensive and easier-to-administer clinical screeners to help identify patients early who may qualify for more comprehensive evaluations. Further work is needed, however, to refine computerized tests to achieve better precision in distinguishing impairment subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Background: Despite substantial progress made in the past decades, the pathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer disease (sAD) and related biological markers of the disease are still controversially discussed. Cerebrospinal fluid and functional brain imaging markers have been established to support the clinical diagnosis of sAD. Yet, due to the invasiveness of such diagnostics, less burdensome markers have been increasingly investigated in the past years. Among such markers, extracellular vesicles may yield promise in (early) diagnostics and treatment monitoring in sAD. Materials and Methods: In this pilot study, we collected the blood plasma of 18 patients with sAD and compared the proteome of extracted extracellular vesicles with the proteome of 11 age-matched healthy controls. The resulting proteomes were characterized by Gene Ontology terms and between-group statistics. Results: Ten distinct proteins were found to significantly differ between sAD patients and controls ( P &lt;0.05, False Discovery Rate, corrected). These proteins included distinct immunoglobulins, fibronectin, and apolipoproteins. Conclusions: These findings lend further support for exosomal changes in neurodegenerative disorders, and particularly in sAD. Further proteomic research could decisively advance our knowledge of sAD pathophysiology as much as it could foster the development of clinically meaningful biomarkers.",

The delineation of subtypes is important for a variety of reasons, and there are probably several ways to identify subtypes. One crude but functionally promising distinction is between patients with early onset of AD and those with late onset. In theory, such a distinction appears to be a simple one, but critical methodologic issues are involved in this dichotomy, because a key aspect is estimating the rate of progression of the disease in different subtypes. This article discusses potential problems with various measures of deterioration and illustrates how the application of a novel technique—the trilinear model—can address many of these problems and provide additional valuable information. The trilinear model is especially well suited for use in pharmacologic studies because of the additional insight that it can provide.",

    "abstract": "The rates of change for five widely used psychometric tests were analyzed to compare how much more variance reduction can be achieved using full-information methods relative to the single-equation methods previously used in dementia research. Nondemented controls and subjects with Alzheimer disease (AD), probable/ possible vascular dementia (VD), or mixed dementia (MD) were evaluated. A cohort design was followed, with follow-up of three demented groups and one normal control group; data were analyzed in a multiple-equation regression model estimated with full-information methods. The study was conducted at Alzheimer's Disease Research Center sites at the University of California, Irvine, and at the University of Southern California. In all, 226 patients and controls who had completed initial assessment and at least one annual reassessment were included in the study. Dependent variables were annualized rates of change in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Short-Blessed Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease drawings test (CD), the WAIS-R Block Design test (WRB), and the Boston Naming Test (BNT). Independent variables were dementia severity, diagnosis (AD, VD, MD, or control), sex, age, marital status, education, and age at onset. Full-information methods reduced the variance in the change scores by > or = 25% compared with previous studies. The model's prediction of a test's rate of change was almost entirely due to dementia stage and diagnosis. The effects of other explanatory variables (sex, marital status, age, and education) were weak and statistically insignificant. When the effects of other independent variables were controlled, AD and MD patients were found to decline at significantly faster rates than VD patients. Full-information methods, relative to single-equation methods, substantially reduce the variance of rates of change for multiple psychometric tests. They do so by simultaneously considering the correlated error terms in the regression for each dependent psychometric change score variable. The robustness of these results to minor variations in follow-up time suggests that annualization is a reasonably valid procedure for making change scores comparable. This study's results suggest that change scores in psychometric tests provide information that can be used to aid differential diagnosis. However, the large variances of change scores preclude many other uses. Finally, since standardization of psychometric change scores translates all tests to the same scale (0-100%), standardized change scores are easier to interpret. The analysis of standardized change scores deserves further investigation.",

Although many results have been reported about the burden on caregivers of demented relatives, no guidelines for managing behavioral symptoms of demented patients have been developed. One of the major reasons for the lack of practical guidelines is that dementia behavioral syndromes have been understood to be a socio-psycho-somato disorder. Also, no standardized procedures to assess behavioral symptoms are yet available. In this article, the relationship of behavioral symptoms to the severity of dementia is examined by different assessment procedures, with the aim of understanding their manifestation mechanisms. In 223 patients with age-associated dementia, including 99 with Alzheimer type dementia, 32 behavioral symptoms were assessed according to frequency, severity, and intensity, which was assessed corresponding to a value score multiplied by a frequency score multiplied by a severity score. The results by an analysis of covariance with intensity, frequency, and severity of symptoms as dependent variables; severity of dementia as an independent variable; and age, sex, and activities of daily living scores as covariates, indicated that some behavioral symptoms are significantly related to severity of dementia, which is hypothesized to correspond to organic changes in the brain, while other symptoms are not related to severity of dementia. Also, the pattern of relationship varied according to assessment procedures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Summary This article examines the feasibility of using molecular genetic information for diagnostic and predictive testing in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The scope is limited largely to early onset familial cases, but a brief update on genetic research in late onset disease is included. The usefulness and accuracy of such testing is determined by the results and interpretation of current research data which are presented herein. The ethical and legal issues implicated in such procedures are not covered but are examined elsewhere in this issue. During the course of the genetic analysis of AD, it has become clear that it is an etiologically heterogeneous disorder. In understanding the genetic predisposition to AD there should be continual attention to this message. Age of onset and familiality have emerged as the most useful clinical features demarcating subgroups with common origins. At least two genes predispose (independently) to early onset familial AD: the 3-amyloid precursor protein gene (βAPP) and an unidentified gene on chromosome 14. Germ line mutations in these genes act dominantly. The accurate use of genetic data in AD, for diagnostic, screening and predictive purposes relies on the most up-to-date knowledge of the transmission of the disorder in relation to mutations in these genes. The interpretation of genetic data is examined for each of the known early onset genes. In addition, we review the data pertaining to late onset disease and risk conferred by the APOE locus to both familial and nonfamilial cases. The use of these data in genetic risk analysis must be reserved until a full explanation of the association and its meaning is forthcoming. Isolated cases of AD occur at all ages of onset, but no AD mutations in the βAPP gene have yet been identified in isolated cases.",

    "abstract": "The spatial distribution of the diffuse, primitive, and classic amyloid-beta deposits was studied in the upper laminae of the superior frontal gyrus in cases of sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD). Amyloid-beta-stained tissue was counterstained with collagen IV to determine whether the spatial distribution of the amyloid-beta deposits along the cortex was related to blood vessels. In all patients, amyloid-beta deposits and blood vessels were aggregated into distinct clusters and in many patients, the clusters were distributed with a regular periodicity along the cortex. The clusters of diffuse and primitive deposits did not coincide with the clusters of blood vessels in most patients. However, the clusters of classic amyloid-beta deposits coincided with those of the large diameter (>10 microm) blood vessels in all patients and with clusters of small-diameter (< 10 microm) blood vessels in four patients. The data suggest that, of the amyloid-beta subtypes, the clusters of classic amyloid-beta deposits appear to be the most closely related to blood vessels and especially to the larger-diameter, vertically penetrating arterioles in the upper cortical laminae.",

Substitution of leucine for proline at codon 102 of the prion protein gene has been found in several families with the disease; this mutation is genetically linked to GSS. Mice containing murine prion protein transgenes with this mutation spontaneously develop neurologic symptoms of ataxia, lethargy, and rigidity accompanied by spongiform degeneration throughout the brain. Thus, many of the clinical and pathological features of the GSS have been reproduced in this transgenic mouse paradigm; to our knowledge, this study illustrates, for the first time, that a neurodegenerative process similar to a human disease can be genetically modeled in animals. Whether or not this transgenic mouse model of GSS may facilitate the understanding of common neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease remains to be established.",

Galantamine is a novel treatment for Alzheimer disease with a dual mode of action. The mechanisms involved may result in better long-term cognitive function, and may specifically affect behavioral symptoms. Three acetylcholinesterase inhibitors available in the USA, donepezil, rivastigmine and tacrine, have demonstrated improvements in activities of daily living. However, data are mixed and much is questionable because of the outcome measures used. Galantamine showed evidence of functional benefit in three pivotal Phase III studies of up to 6 months' duration. Furthermore, galantamine stabilized instrumental and basic activities of daily living in an open-label 12-month study. This long-term maintenance of functional ability would be expected to be an important benefit for patients and carers. Open-label studies have suggested that donepezil and tacrine might have beneficial effects on behavioral symptoms. In a 5-month pivotal study, galantamine significantly slowed the progression of behavioral symptoms in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease. These behavioral benefits were associated with reduced caregiver distress and translated into reduced caregiver time. These benefits would be expected to make an important difference to the quality of life of patients and caregivers.",

HLA-DR–positive activated microglia were observed to associate with SPs in AD. In the DNTC brain, which lacks SPs, HLA-DR–positive microglia were mainly accumulated around weakly tau-positive NFTs, which were also positive for anti–amyloid-P and anti-C3d antibodies. The results of this study suggest that the complement pathway is also activated in the DNTC brain and that immune and inflammatory responses, including microglia activation, may occur around extracellular NFTs in DNTC patients.",

Serial assessments of a 29-year-old woman showed progressive dementia. Marked cognitive and behavioral deficits were seen on neuropsychologic testing, corresponding to striking cortical abnormalities on positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and histopathologic studies. Typical motor manifestations of the disorder did not emerge until the patient was 34 years old, 5 years after the onset of cognitive symptoms. Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of progressive cortical dementia in a young adult, even in the absence of motor dysfunction.",

Methods Baseline data from 2 ongoing AD clinical trials with 402 and 313 randomized participants were analyzed. Magnetic resonance imaging substudy enrollers (166 participants in trial 1 and 161 participants in trial 2) and nonenrollers were compared on baseline demographic, medical and clinical characteristics separately for the 2 trials. Results In both trials, enrollers were statistically similar to nonenrollers on most demographic and clinical measures. One study sample showed that enrollers had lower cognitive scores at baseline when compared with nonenrollers: lower Mini Mental State Examination scores (20.15±3.6 vs. 21.04±3.6, P=0.02), and higher Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive domain scores (24.99±8.5 vs. 23.03±9.3, P=0.03); however, the difference was not considered clinically important and was not observed in the second trial. Conclusions The groups of individuals who agreed to participate in the imaging substudies of AD trials were remarkably comparable to the comparison groups at baseline on a wide range of demographic and clinical measures; there seems to be a minimal effect of self-selection bias. The results indicate that it may be reasonable to generalize findings in an imaging substudy to the complete the study population.",

For people with dementia, data on potential gradients in life expectancy and mortality by social deprivation are sparse. This study aimed to explore potential differentials in life expectancy and mortality in people with dementia according to social deprivation. METHODS: Using The Health Improvement Network (THIN) primary care database, we included people with a diagnosis of dementia in the United Kingdom in 2000 to 2016 and obtained data on age at death and mortality. Comparisons were made according to social deprivation quintiles adjusting for age at diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 166,268 people with dementia there were no differences in life expectancy and mortality in the most deprived compared with the least deprived. This pattern has been stable during the study period, as no increasing inequalities in life expectancy and mortality according to social deprivation were found. DISCUSSION: Contrary to the general population, there were limited inequalities in life expectancy and mortality according to social deprivation for people with dementia.",

We examined longitudinal profiles of financial and health literacy in relation to limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC). Participants: A total of 275 community-dwelling older persons who had completed annual literacy assessments, died and undergone brain autopsy. Methods: Financial and health literacy was assessed using a 32-item instrument. Latent class mixed effects models identified groups of individuals with distinct longitudinal literacy profiles. Regression models examined group differences in 9 common age-related neuropathologies assessed via uniform structured neuropathologic evaluations. Results: Two distinct literacy profiles emerged. The first group (N=121, 44%) had higher level of literacy at baseline, slower decline and less variabilities over time. The second group (N=154, 56%) had lower level of literacy at baseline, faster decline, and greater variabilities. Individuals from the latter group were older, with fewer years of education and more female. They also had higher burdens of Alzheimer disease and LATE-NC. The group association with Alzheimer disease was attenuated and no longer significant after controlling for cognition. By contrast, the association with LATE-NC persisted. Conclusion: Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy is uniquely associated with distinct longitudinal profiles of financial and health literacy in old age.",

    "abstract": "Background: Chronic cerebrovascular pathology accelerates the incidence of poststroke dementia (PSD). Whether the risk of PSD varies according to different types of chronic cerebrovascular pathology remains unclear. Objectives: We investigated whether PSD is associated with a unique pattern of interactions between chronic cerebrovascular pathologies and acute stroke lesions. Materials and Method: In this case-control study of acute mild stroke patients (n=185), cases included patients who developed PSD at a 6-month poststroke follow-up, and controls included patients who remained nondemented at 6 months, matched on prestroke cognitive status. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at initial stroke presentation; neuropsychological assessments were performed 6 months after the stroke. Results: White matter hyperintensities (WMH), chronic lacunes, microbleeds, and acute infarcts were not associated with PSD after controlling for demographics, cardiovascular risk, and global cortical atrophy. The risk of PSD was largest for patients with acute large subcortical infarcts (&gt;15 mm) and concomitant periventricular WMH compared with patients with large subcortical infarcts and punctate/absent periventricular WMH [odds ratio (OR)=5.85, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.85-40.04]. A moderate risk of PSD was observed for patients with acute multiple small infarcts (3 to 15 mm) and concomitant lacunes (OR=2.48, 95% CI=0.94-6.51) or concomitant lobar microbleeds (OR=2.20, 95% CI=0.89-5.41), compared with patients with acute multiple small infarcts and absent lacunes or microbleeds. Single small infarcts did not interact with cerebrovascular pathology to affect PSD. Conclusions: The risk of PSD varies depending on the presence of chronic cerebrovascular pathologies and type of acute infarcts. Clinical implications support a precision medicine approach for stratifying those at highest risk of PSD.",

Methods: Using National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center neuropathology diagnoses, we defined pARTE (n=21), pAD (n=203), and ADARTE (n=158) groups. We compared demographics, medical history, psychometrics, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) allele variants across neuropathology groups. Retrospective timepoints were first evaluation with Global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 0.5 and 1.0, via the CDR Dementia Staging Instrument, corresponding to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia, respectively. Results: In MCI, clinical differences were minimal but pARTE subjects were older, had later onset cognitive decline, and progressed less severely than pAD. In mild dementia, pAD subjects were younger and had earlier onset of decline. Neuropsychiatric (depression) and psychometric (Logical Memory Delayed Recall, Trails B) differences also emerged between the groups. In MCI, APOE4 associated with worse Logical Memory Delayed Recall in pAD and ADARTE. In mild dementia, APOE4 associated with better animal fluency in pAD, but with better Trails A performance and more neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire) in ADARTE. Conclusions: Differences between pARTE, pAD, and ADARTE emerge at mild dementia rather than MCI. APOE4 has varied cognitive and psychiatric impact dependent on neuropathology group and stage.",

Methods: Here, we performed a genome-wide interaction study to identify single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that modify the effect of Aβ (measured by 18 F-florbetapir positron emission tomography) on brain atrophy (measured by cortical thickness using magnetic resonance imaging). We used magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, cerebrospinal fluid, and genetic data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database [discovery cohort, ADNI-GO/2 (n=723) and replication cohort, ADNI-1 (n=129)]. Results: We identified a genome-wide suggestive interaction of rs3807779 SNP (β=−0.14, SE=0.029, P =9.08×10 −7 ) in the discovery cohort. The greater dosage of rs3807779 SNP increased the detrimental effect of Aβ deposition on cortical thickness. In replication analyses, the congruent results were replicated to confirm our findings. Furthermore, rs3807779 SNP augmented the detrimental effect of Aβ deposition on cognitive function. Genetic profiling showed that rs3807779 has chromatin interactions with the promoter region of MAGI2 gene, suggesting its association with MAGI2 expression. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that subjects carrying the rs3807779 SNP are more susceptible to Aβ-related neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD) is an earlier Alzheimer disease form which is characterized by the mutations in the amyloid precursor protein, presenilin-1/2 ( PSEN1/2 ), and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 ( TREM2 ). However, it is still necessary to report mutational screening in multiethnic groups to improve the genetic background of EOAD due to the variant classification challenge. Methods: We performed targeted sequencing for the amyloid precursor protein, PSEN1 , PSEN2 , and TREM2 genes in 74 patients and 1 family diagnosed with EOAD. Results: Among the detected variants, 8 were coding and 6 were noncoding in 15 of 74 patients. In PSEN1 , 2 pathogenic coding variants (T274K and L364P) detected in 2 patients were novel and 3 coding variants (G183V, E318G, and L219P) detected in 2 patients were previously reported. We found 4 patients with the compound heterozygosity for the PSEN2 A23= and N43= and a family with the coexistence of them, and 1 patient with TREM2 Y38C. The coding variation frequency was 12.1%. In silico analysis indicated pathogenic potentials and clinical interpretations of the detected variants. Conclusion: Our study reveals the rare gene variants including novel ones from the Turkish EOAD cohort and provides to clinicians the list of detected variants in the screened genes, which may also be useful for accurate genetic counseling.",

A previous study showed that conversion to dementia from amyloid-negative mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was observed in up to 11% of patients, drawing attention to this condition.We gathered the detailed neuropsychological and neuroimaging data of this population to elucidate factors for conversion to dementia from amyloid-negative amnestic MCI.This study was a single-institutional, retrospective cohort study of amyloid-negative MCI patients over age 50 with at least 36 months of follow-up. All subjects underwent detailed neuropsychological testing, 3 tesla brain magnetic resonance imaging), and fluorine-18(18F)-florbetaben amyloid positron emission tomography scans.During the follow-up period, 39 of 107 (36.4%) patients converted to dementia from amnestic MCI. The converter group had more severe impairment in all visual memory tasks. The volumetric analysis revealed that the converter group had significantly reduced total hippocampal volume on the right side, gray matter volume in the right lateral temporal, lingual gyri, and occipital pole.Our study showed that reduced gray matter volume related to visual memory processing may predict clinical progression in this amyloid-negative MCI population.",

    "abstract": "The current study addresses the nature of memory difficulties in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Whereas recollection is consistently found to be impaired in aMCI, the results on familiarity are divergent. One potential factor that could explain this divergence in findings relates to the heterogeneity of aMCI patients, so that only those aMCI patients who develop Alzheimer disease (AD) may present with impaired familiarity. The present study aimed at testing this hypothesis.A group of 45 aMCI patients and a group of 26 healthy older adults performed a verbal recognition memory test with the Remember/Know paradigm to assess recollection and familiarity processes. All participants were followed for 4 years with clinical and neuropsychological testing. At the end of follow-up, 22 aMCI patients progressed to AD and 23 aMCI patients remained stable. Initial memory performance was compared between the 3 groups.Whereas recollection was severely diminished in all aMCI patients, familiarity accuracy (and consequently global recognition accuracy) was found to be impaired only in aMCI patients who subsequently developed AD.These findings suggest that the enrichment of the aMCI population with predementia stage patients may modulate the likelihood to observe familiarity deficits, and impaired global recognition accuracy may accompany incipient AD.",

The stability of the telomere-telomerase system is closely related to AD. A previous meta-analysis indicated that AD patients had shorter telomere length (TL) than control subjects. However, there are no consistent telomerase activity findings in AD patients, and the published telomerase studies were not meta-analyzed yet. Methods: We searched all the related studies that probed into TL and/or telomerase activity in AD patients based on PubMed and Embase database from the establishment to September 2020. The Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang and China Science and Technology Journal Database were also utilized. The quality of the included studies was evaluated by using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. All the statistical analyses of this meta-analysis were performed using Stata version 15.0. Results: Analyzing 30 TL data from 2248 AD patients and 4865 controls, AD patients had a significantly shorter TL than the controls, with a standardized mean difference of −0.70 (confidence interval: −0.95 to −0.46; P &lt;0.05). The meta-analysis included 3 primary studies and did not find a significant difference in the telomerase activity between 233 AD patients and 132 controls, but AD patients had a trend of increased telomerase activity compared with controls (standardized mean difference: 0.47; confidence interval: −0.29 to 1.23; P &gt;0.05). Conclusion: Our results showed that compared with the control group, the AD group had a shorter TL and may have higher telomerase activity.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) patients experience progressive neurological and cognitive decline attributed to neurodegeneration. Cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) has been identified to protect and rescue neurons in various preclinical neurodegeneration models. The expression of this protein occurs in both the central nervous system and peripheral blood. Blood platelets exhibit several biochemical impairments similar to the brain tissues of patients with neurological disorders. This study examines CDNF mRNA expression in human blood platelets in healthy subjects and Alzheimer-probable patients.Platelets were extracted from whole blood from patients. mRNA was extracted to synthesize cDNA and quantify CDNF gene expression from 21 Alzheimer-probable patients and 73 healthy age-matched control subjects using real-time qPCR. Grouping analysis of the data with regard to sex was conducted.CDNF mRNA expression was significantly decreased in Alzheimer-probable patients relative to the control subjects (P<0.05). Further analysis demonstrated reduced CDNF expression in male Alzheimer-probable patients compared with their age and sex-matched controls (P<0.05). However, no change in female subjects was observed. Interestingly, there is a lower level of CDNF expression in the female control group relative to the control male group (P<0.05).Alzheimer-probable male patients demonstrated significant reductions in CDNF expression, suggesting that CDNF plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of AD. In addition, it may assist in diagnosing male Alzheimer patients.",

We obtained cognitive data and caregiver ratings on the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe) for aMCI patients (N=29 ε4 carriers; N=29 noncarriers) and AD patients (N=47 carriers; N=42 noncarriers). In both diagnostic groups, ε4 carriers had lower scores on tests of memory but did not differ on cognitive screening measures or tests of executive functioning. There were no differences in retrospective caregiver ratings of preillness status on the FrSBe by ε4 status in either diagnostic group.

We construct a broadly based diagnostic algorithm synthesizing information from known risk factors, such as poor cognition, sociodemographic factors, and health history. Data were from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA) Phase I. Dementia was diagnosed by clinical consensus. All subjects had a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score and a Modified MMSE (3MS) score. Multiple logistic regression was used to build our diagnostic algorithm, which was then tested for classification accuracy on the basis of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve for our diagnostic algorithm using 3MS as a binary variable was significantly greater than the 3MS alone (P<0.001). However, no significant difference was found when using 3MS as a continuous variable in the algorithm. Similarly, a binary MMSE algorithm would provide greater accuracy than MMSE alone. In terms of the usage of our algorithm in practice settings, given the prevalence of dementia, the clear benefits of accurate identification and earlier intervention, adding a few questions to the binary 3MS in our algorithm quantitatively improves the dementia prediction, which is important for patients, caregivers, and health providers.",

The CC genotype of a single nucleotide polymorphism rs760678 within this gene was associated with increasing risk of AD in a large study with white population. Our study aimed to replicate the initial report in Chinese population and explore its effect on cognitive performance. A total of 262 patients with AD, 293 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 434 cognitive intact controls were recruited in the study. The result showed that G allele had a greater risk of AD (χ for trend test=5.61, df 1, P=0.018). The effects were mainly observed among Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 noncarriers (χ for trend test=4.30, df 1, P=0.038). After adjustment of sex, age, education year, and APOE ε4 status by logistic regression, significant association between NEDD9 GG genotype and AD remained [OR=2.04, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.02-4.08, P=0.044]. The scores of Cantonese version of the Mini-mental State Examination and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Subscale-Cognitive subscale were associated with N polymorphism after adjusting for sex, age, education year, and ApoE ε4 status (Linear regression model, P<0.05).

Setting: Tertiary referral center. Patient: A 75-year-old man who initially presented with anxiety and depression along with mild cognitive impairment, later developed drug-induced parkinsonism because of sertraline treatment, and eventually showed symptoms and signs of probable DLB. Interventions: Sertraline treatment for depression. Main Outcome Measures: Clinical examination, magnetic resonance imaging, neuropsychologic test, and cardiac 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy. Results: His parkinsonian symptoms, which became apparent after sertraline therapy, improved markedly after the discontinuation of the drug. When he started taking sertraline, he had no dementia but had mild cognitive impairment. However, he eventually showed most of the symptoms and signs to indicate probable DLB. Conclusions: To our knowledge, there has been no report of sertraline-induced or aggravated parkinsonian motor symptoms in DLB patients. Our patient had a short period with neither dementia nor parkinsonism during the early stage of his illness, and this period might have been regarded as the preclinical stage of DLB in the natural course of his illness.",

    "abstract": "Anosognosia is common in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) even in early stages. Although neural correlates and the impact of cognitive dysfunctions have been described, possible psychodynamic processes such as a repressive coping style as described in other illnesses, have not been examined. Our study aimed to examine possible psychological influence factors on illness perception embracing a repressive coping style and cognitive functions in AD patients in the diagnostic process. Fifty-four subjects with mild AD diagnosed in our memory clinic were enrolled. Anosognosia was evaluated using a patient-caregiver discrepancy rating. All patients underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing. In addition, characteristics of a repressive coping style were assessed. In total, 79.6% of our patients showed a lack of awareness at least to some degree. 33.3% of the patients were classified as repressors. Repressors and nonrepressors did not differ in cognition, or the unawareness score. Multivariate regression analysis showed that repressive coping style did not significantly contribute to anosognosia, but that verbal memory and naming ability had a strong influence. Although our data indicate that a high proportion of patients with mild AD show characteristics of repressive coping, this possible defense mechanism had no influence on the awareness of illness-related deficits measured by caregiver patient discrepancy.",

    "abstract": "Summary: Besipirdine hydrochloride (HP 749) is an indole-substituted analog of 4- aminopyridine. Besipirdine enhances both cholinergic and adrenergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system. The present study examined the efficacy and tolerability of two doses of besipirdine (5 and 20 mg b.i.d.) in 275 patients with Alzheimer disease during 3 months of treatment and for 3 months after withdrawal of treatment. Assessment after withdrawal of treatment was used in an effort to distinguish persistent efficacy attributable to a neuroprotective mechanism from reversible symptomatic efficacy. Besipirdine was generally well tolerated. The level of performance on the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog) was sustained during 3 months of treatment with besipirdine, whereas some deterioration in the performance of patients treated with placebo was observed over the same period. The small difference between active and placebo treatment groups approached, but did not reach statistical significance in the primary intent-to-treat analysis (p=0.067); analysis of patients who completed all assessments was supportive (p=0.031). Global ratings using the Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change did not detect a besipirdine treatment benefit, possibly because of an adverse effect on mood and behavior in some patients. A high ratio of adrenergic to cholinergic potency may have resulted in the adverse effects of besipirdine and hence its failure to support the hypothesis that multiple neurotransmitter treatment may be more efficacious than monotherapy. The efficacy apparent on the ADAS-Cog after 3 months of treatment did not persist 3 months after withdrawal of treatment, suggesting that the benefit was symptomatic. This study provides a practical example of the use of treatment withdrawal assessment to distinguish neuroprotective from symptomatic efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Summary: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible dementia syndrome characterized by loss of intellectual capacity in many domains, altered behavior, inability to care for oneself, and, ultimately, neurologic abnormalities. AD results from a cascade of events that leads to the formation of neuritic plaques (containing amyloid proteins) and neurofibrillary tangles (paired, helical filaments containing tau proteins) in the cortex and hippocampus. The cognitive impairments of AD can be traced, in part, to neurotrans-mitter deficits, primarily the loss of chemicals involved in acetylcholine synthesis in the brain; this is known as the cholinergic hypothesis. Risk factors for the disease include age, head injuries, family history of AD or Down's syndrome, sex (i.e., more common in women), and vascular disease. The exact cause of AD is still unknown. Etiologic hypotheses suggest that AD may be caused by genetic abnormalities (primarily on chromosomes 14, 21, and 19), environmental toxins (e.g., aluminum), inflammations due to viruses or infections, defective neuronal plastic capability, or disrupted oxidative metabolism. At present, treatment of AD is limited to addressing the symptoms of the disease. As the mechanisms of AD pathology become better understood, it is hoped that strategies for interfering with those mechanisms can be developed and implemented as treatments to thwart the development or progress of the disease.",

    "abstract": "We have reported that physostigmine, a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor, enhances verbal memory in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). To elucidate the mechanism of cognition enhancement, plasma hormones were measured during high-dose acute and low-dose chronic steady-state intravenous infusions of physostigmine in nine subjects with AD. High-dose hormone responses were measured during and for 24 h after the infusion of physostigmine 1–1.5 mg over 45–60 min. Chronic responses were measured during continuous intravenous infusions of physostigmine at doses (0.5–25 mg/day) that escalated over 2 weeks, and then during 1 week infusion of the dose that optimized cognition (2–12 mg/day) or placebo administered in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. A replicable improvement in verbal memory was found in five subjects. High-dose physostigmine infusion that produced noxious side effects resulted in significant elevation above baseline in plasma levels of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) (p = 0.0001), cortisol (p = 0.0001), and β-endorphin (p = 0.0001). Chronic physostigmine administration, in the absence of adverse effects, produced no significant elevation in ACTH (p = 0.08), cortisol (p = 0.70), or β-endorphin (p = 0.82). These results indicate that high-dose physostigmine activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, likely representing a \"stress response.\" In contrast, cognition-enhancing doses do not produce a peripheral corticosteroid response. Thus, physostigmine-induced memory improvement is independent of the activation of the HPA axis.",

    "abstract": "Conflicts of interest and other ethical dilemmas occur in Alzheimer disease (AD) patient care and research but often are underrecognized by physicians. One or more bioethical principles of autonomy, confidentiality, truth telling, beneficence, and justice, which apply to demented individuals as they do to other patients, may conflict in everyday clinical situations. For example, when demented patients wish to continue driving, autonomy (the patient's right to self-determination) conflicts with beneficence (the duty to promote the patient's welfare). Cognitively impaired patients depend on others for ethical decision making in the resolution of these dilemmas. It is essential that clinicians and investigators involved in the decision-making process do so without bias or conflict of interest. Full disclosure of financial interests increasingly is an accepted requirement in the conduct of biomedical research. In AD, less obvious potential conflicts of interest arise when physicians recruit their patients for antidementia drug trials sponsored by a pharmaceutical company (that provides the physician with research funding) or when investigators fail to acknowledge the patient's withdrawal of assent when attempting to complete a research protocol. The recognition of both financial and nonfinancial conflicts should lead to measures to reduce bias, which in turn will improve the integrity of research findings and promote patient welfare.",

Today, the clinician has to rely on clinical examination, history, and, possibly, brain imaging to identify cerebrovascular damage and other signs of VaD. The clinical diagnosis of subcortical VaD may be difficult because the clinical manifestation of this disorder is often similar to that of Alzheimer disease. There are also mixed forms of the two disorders. Biochemical diagnostic markers, which reflect the pathogenetic processes in the brain, would add to the accuracy of the diagnosis. There are some interesting candidate markers: the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum albumin ratio could be used to identify blood-brain barrier damage to the small intracerebral vessels, CSF sulfatide to identify ongoing demyelination of the white matter, CSF neuron-specific enolase to identify ongoing neuronal degeneration, and CSF tau protein and CSF neurofilament light protein to identify ongoing axonal degeneration. None of these potential markers is specific to subcortical VaD, but together and used in conjunction with the conventional diagnostic workup, they may be of diagnostic value.",

The disease is essentially a sporadic condition, and there is no known genetic predisposition or metabolic abnormality. The hallmark of the disease is the diffuse accumulation of Rosenthal fibers (RF) throughout the central nervous system. Although an etiological relationship of the RF to disease pathogenesis has been suspected since the initial description of Alexander disease, such a relationship has not been confirmed. We previously identified a number of oxidative post-translational modifications, including advanced glycation end products and lipid peroxidation adducts, in intimate association with the RF of Alexander disease. Such oxidative protein damage provides a mechanism, through protein crosslinking, for insolubility and accumulation of RF. Notably, these findings show a striking parallel with the biochemical features of age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease. Therefore, Alexander disease and Alzheimer disease likely share a common pathogenesis, namely oxidative injury as a potential primary process in the etiology and pathogenesis.",

Prevention of Alzheimer disease is an urgent priority, but study of potentially modifiable risk factors for the illness is at an early stage. Laboratory studies suggest that oxidative mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease and raise the possibility that antioxidant nutrients could be used in disease prevention. Observational studies suggest that antioxidant nutrients may have protective effects against a number of other common chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. Because the protective effects, if any, of antioxidant nutrients are likely to be small to moderate in magnitude, large-scale randomized trials of primary prevention will likely be necessary to resolve this issue, and a major question is how quickly to progress to expensive and time consuming trials needed to provide more definitive evidence. This is a difficult question, but the severity of the disease, the current absence of preventive strategies and the likelihood that observational studies alone will not provide clear resolution of the issue all suggest that it may be prudent to strongly consider such trials in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Summary: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a hereditary disease that is characterized by recurrent stroke episodes and focal neurologic deficits progressing to pseudobulbar palsy and dementia. The causative gene is the Notch3 gene on chromosome 19, and 22 missense mutations have been identified in Caucasian patients to date. To perform mutational analysis of the Notch3 gene, we identified its exon-intron boundaries and prepared sets of primers for amplification of each exon. Using these primers, we determined the Notch3 gene in a Japanese family with CADASIL symptoms and found a missense mutation (Argl33Cys) in exon 4. The mutation was heterozygous and cosegregated with the disease. Thus, the Notch3 gene is responsible for CADASIL in patients across different ethnic groups.",

    "abstract": "Summary: The neuroprotective glial cell modulator propentofylline has been used in clinical trials involving more than 800 patients with vascular dementia (VaD). These data derive from two sources: a pooled group of VaD patients from four early phase III European trials, and a multinational European/Canadian phase III study (MN 305) that features a combined randomized withdrawal/delayed onset of progression design to evaluate the effect of propentofylline on disease progression. In the pooled studies, DSM-III-R criteria, Hachinski Ischemia Scores, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used to select subjects with mild-to-moderate disease; in MN 305, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN) criteria and neurologic examinations (including CT and MRI scans) were used to select patients with possible or probable VaD. The use of a central rater to assess cerebrovascular disease in neuroradiologic examinations for study MN 305 was considered to be a key feature for reducing the heterogeneity of the VaD patient population. In addition, the inclusion of patients with possible VaD in this trial greatly increased the number of eligible patients; subgroup analyses revealed no substantial differences between patients with probable versus possible VaD, justifying their inclusion in the study. VaD patients exhibited a more pronounced placebo response in global assessments compared with the Alzheimer disease population in a parallel study. In addition, they experienced less deterioration over time with respect to cognitive and global assessments. Beneficial effects of propentofylline were consistently demonstrated in the domains of cognitive and global function for both VaD populations; however, no treatment benefits could be demonstrated for activities of daily living, possibly due to factors relating to the study population/design, the lack of a validated test instrument for such patients, the caregiver-related phenomenon of “tutoring,” or the nature of the disease itself.",

    "abstract": "Great strides have been made in the measurement of outcomes and treatment efficacy in clinical trials of Alzheimer disease (AD) drugs during the past 25 years. Several sensitive, reliable, and valid clinical outcome measures have been developed. The methodology, trial design, and outcome measures for demonstrating symptomatic benefits of an AD drug are now established. However, a greater challenge lies ahead. Major advances in fundamental knowledge about the pathophysiology of the disease and in animal models have transformed the focus of current efforts to developing and testing therapies that may actually slow disease progression, delay the onset of symptoms, and even ultimately prevent the disease. The long-duration trials that will likely be necessary to demonstrate an effect on disease progression will be costly and difficult. Proof-of-concept trials and subsequent long-term trials could gain power and efficiency from use of biologic markers of underlying disease severity, but currently available biologic markers are not ideal. A major barrier to such trials is their size and cost. One approach to reducing the cost would be to recruit \"enriched\" samples of subjects who are at greater risk of developing AD during the trial than the general, elderly population. The major effort required to screen and recruit large numbers of subjects for such trials also contributes to the cost. Probably the biggest problem currently is the enormous effort and cost of conducting periodic clinical evaluations to determine if subjects have declined or developed dementia. Research to develop more efficient assessment methods is clearly needed. Data acquisition over the Internet is potentially efficient and attractive and may become practical as Internet accessibility increases.",

In the absence of immunohistochemical methods for specific disease markers, we had to rely solely on structural features. Later, from the 80s, the successively introduced methods to show glial acidic protein, tau, synaptophysin, ubiquitin, and other markers confirmed our impression of a simple type of degeneration. These methods also added further forms with additional features, and from the 90s genetics has contributed new disease characteristics, all these advances leading up to the present conceptual structure of frontotemporal lobar degeneration.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to test the hypothesis that the statistical Chinese brain template would be more effective to detect gray matter (GM) changes in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) in Chinese populations.In total, 50 patients with AD and 50 sex-matched and age-matched healthy controls were included in this study. Chinese2020, a typical statistical Chinese brain template, and MNI152, a typical Caucasian template were used for spatial normalization respectively. The GM volume alterations in patients with AD were examined by using voxel-based morphometry with education level and total intracranial volume as nuisance variables. The GM proportions of the identified brain areas with group difference were compared.By using Chinese2020 and MNI152, significant GM atrophies in patients with AD were commonly detected in the bilateral medial temporal lobe, lateral temporal lobe, inferior/medial frontal cortex, as well as left thalamus. However, higher GM percentages of detected regions were acquired when Chinese2020 was used rather than MNI152. Furthermore, stronger statistical powers in the detected clusters were observed using Chinese2020 than MNI152. In addition, the laterality index analysis showed the bilateral atrophies with no hemispheric laterality in the para/hippocampus when using population-specific brain atlas (ie, Chinese2020).These findings indicated that applying the population-specific brain atlas to neuroimaging studies may achieve higher accuracy in activation detection. This may have implications to the imaging study of neurodegenerative diseases.",

We developed a categorization algorithm that made use of temporal sequencing of diagnoses and provider type.We identified 36,838 individuals with ADRD. After application of our algorithm, the largest proportion of cases were nonspecific dementia (41.2%), followed by individuals with antidementia medication but no ADRD diagnosis (15.6%). Individuals with Alzheimer disease formed 10.2% of cases. Individuals with vascular dementia had the greatest burden of comorbid disease. Initial documentation of dementia occurred primarily in the office setting (35.1%).Our algorithm identified 6 dementia subtypes and three additional categories representing unique diagnostic patterns in the data. Differences and similarities between groups provided support for the approach and offered unique insight into ADRD subtype characteristics.",

Methods/Patients: Therefore, the current study examined change in 18 F-Flutemetamol uptake in 19 nondemented older adults (65 to 82 y old) who were either cognitively intact or had Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) who were scanned twice across 3.6 years. Results: Baseline and follow-up composite SUVRs were significantly correlated (0.96, P &lt;0.001). Significant increases in the composite SUVR from baseline to follow-up were observed ( P =0.002). For the total sample, the average difference over this time period when using the composite SUVR was 6.8%. Similar results were seen in subsets of the total sample (MCI vs. cognitively intact, amyloid positive vs. negative). Finally, a Reliable Change Index that exceeded ±0.046 SUVR units would indicate a significant change of 18 F-Flutemetamol. Conclusions: The current results extend the limited literature on longitudinal variability of 18 F-Flutemetamol uptake across 3.6 years, which should give clinicians and researchers more confidence in the stability of this amyloid imaging agent in longer therapeutic and prevention trials in cognitive decline in MCI and Alzheimer disease.",

    "abstract": "The use of biomarkers has recently supported the association between Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology and the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (PPA). We aim to investigate possible differences in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker concentrations in the three PPA variants, and to assess any agreement between CSF biomarkers and (18)F-florbetapir PET. A group of 10 PPA were retrospectively enrolled. Patients with logopenic variant (lvPPA) showed different levels of Aβ1-42 and p-tau compared to nonfluent/agrammatic and semantic variants (nfv/svPPA). All nfv/svPPA patients had negative amyloid PET. Among the lvPPA group, a negative amyloid PET was found only in one patient, who was also the only one to display a normal CSF. Thus, this small cohort appeared to display an excellent agreement between CSF and (18)F-florbetapir PET and suggest that these examinations may have the same validity in detecting in vivo evidence of AD pathology in PPA clinical variants.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common in Alzheimer Disease (AD). Treatment could be optimized by supplementing the clinician’s impression of a patient with information from the caregiver. Yet the agreement between caregivers and physicians on the presence of NPS in patients with AD is understudied. Methods: Data were obtained from a 2-staged survey in neurology outpatient offices. At stage 1, patients (n=403) were documented by their physicians, including an assessment on the presence of NPS. At stage 2, patients’ CGs (n=171) were asked about the presence of NPS in the patients, based on questions from the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Caregivers were screened for depression with the Depression Screening Questionnaire. Patients: The study sample comprised patients with mild or moderate AD. Results: NPS frequency varied between 52.6% [95% confidence interval (CI), 44.9%-60.3%] and 67.2% (95% CI, 59.7%-74.2%, reported by CGs) and 34.2% (95% CI, 26.8%-42.1%) and 50.9% (95% CI, 42.9%-58.9%, reported by physicians). Apathy, depression, aggression, and irritability occurred most frequently according to both sources. κ values were lowest for euphoria (κ=0.03; 95% CI, −0.08 to 0.25), and highest for depression (κ=0.26; 95% CI, 0.11-0.43). CG depression was associated with an increased probability (odds ratio=2.9; 95% CI, 1.2-6.7) of disagreement between caregivers and physicians on the patient’s mental status. Conclusion: NPS, though very prevalent in dementia patients, are perceived differently by caregivers and physicians. This divergence increases depending on the psychological health of caregivers.",

Research Design and Methods: The Study of Longevity in Diabetes (SOLID) consists of 734 older adults with T1DM, reporting diabetes locus of control (dLOC), age of diabetes diagnosis and other demographics, history of hypoglycemic episodes, and depressive symptoms. Global and domain-specific (language, executive function, episodic memory, simple attention) cognitive functioning was assessed at in-person interviews. Cross-sectional associations between dLOC and cognition were estimated using covariate-adjusted linear regression models in pooled and sex-stratified models. Results: In pooled analyses, a 1-point increase in dLOC (more internal) was positively associated with global cognition [β=0.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.02, 0.07], language (β=0.04, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.07), and executive function (β=0.04, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.07), but not episodic memory or simple attention. However, in sex-stratified analyses, this effect was seen only in males and not females. Conclusions: In elderly individuals with T1DM, we found associations between dLOC and cognition overall and in men but not women. Underlying sex differences should be considered in future research or interventions on psychosocial characteristics for cognition.",

Methodology: People older than or equal to 60 years were included: (1) With normal cognition: no/low education, high education, and depression; (2) People with mild and moderate dementia. The diagnostic and statistical manual IV-TR clinician diagnosis was used as the gold standard for dementia. The Clinician Dementia Rating scale was used to rate dementia severity. The geriatric mental status AGECAT stage I output was used to diagnose depression. The 10/66 battery was comprised of CSI-D (cognitive screening instrument for dementia), CERAD (consortium to establish a registry of Alzheimer disease), and animal naming test. Result: The sensitivity and specificity of CSI-D COG score for diagnosing dementia was 86.7% and 72.1%, for CSI-D DF score was 71.1% and 96.1%, for CERAD-10 word list delayed recall was 85.9% and 62.2% at a cut point of ≥5 words, and 70.3% and 97.7% for 10/66 diagnostic algorithm.

The concurrent onset of psychiatric and cognitive symptoms prompted a detailed evaluation for a neurodegenerative disease. A 50-year-old male lawyer presented with low mood, apathy, delusions, and auditory hallucinations over 18 months. He considered his wife as an imposter and would require her text message to confirm her identity. He became more forgetful and had to give up his law practice. His neuropsychological assessment was impaired in all domains. Genetic testing revealed homozygosity for APOE e4 alleles. His magnetic resonance imaging showed predominant parietal and medial temporal atrophy, [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed frontal, parietal and posterior temporal hypometabolism and [18F]Flutemetamol positron emission tomography was positive for amyloid deposition, leading to the diagnosis of EOAD. This case highlights EOAD as a differential diagnosis in young patients who present with Capgras syndrome.",

All instruments had similar accuracy among those with low literacy (primary school and lower educational level or illiterate).To distinguish between SCC, aMCI, and AD in a sample of older Turkish adults, the Qmci-TR may be preferable. In very low literacy, the choice of the instrument appears less important.",

    "abstract": "Background: Incidence of dementia increases exponentially with age; little is known about its risk factors in the ninth and 10th decades of life. We identified predictors of dementia with onset after age 85 years in a longitudinal population-based cohort. Methods: On the basis of annual assessments, incident cases of dementia were defined as those newly receiving Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) ≥1. We used a machine learning method, Markov modeling with hybrid density-based and partition-based clustering, to identify variables associated with subsequent incident dementia. Results: Of 1439 participants, 641 reached age 85 years during 10 years of follow-up and 45 of these became incident dementia cases. Using hybrid density-based and partition-based, among those aged 85+ years, probability of incident dementia was associated with worse self-rated health, more prescription drugs, subjective memory complaints, heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, thyroid disease, arthritis, reported hypertension, higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and hearing impairment. In the subgroup aged 85 to 89 years, risk of dementia was also associated with depression symptoms, not currently smoking, and lacking confidantes. Conclusions: An atheoretical machine learning method revealed several factors associated with increased probability of dementia after age 85 years in a population-based cohort. If independently validated in other cohorts, these findings could help identify the oldest-old at the highest risk of dementia.",

Inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia is a progressive autosomal dominant disorder associated with a mutation in valosin-containing protein (VCP) with typical onset of symptoms in the 30s. APOE [Latin Small Letter Open E]4 is a major risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects memory, thinking, behavior, and emotion as a result of the excessive buildup and decreased clearance of β-amyloid proteins resulting in the appearance of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In conclusion, we report a unique patient with an APOE [Latin Small Letter Open E]4/APOE [Latin Small Letter Open E]4 genotype and atypical VCP disease associated with early Alzheimer disease and severe vision impairment. Future studies will elucidate the interaction of VCP mutations and APOE [Latin Small Letter Open E]4 alleles in understanding common mechanisms in AD and VCP disease.",

Our study aims included: (1) identifying the DSRS factor structure, (2) examining the relation between neuropsychological measures, the Mini-Mental State Examination, and clinical diagnoses with the DSRS, and (3) determining the clinical utility of the DSRS in a mixed clinical sample. A total of 270 veterans were referred to a cognitive disorders clinic at a VA medical center and completed neuropsychological, affective, and cognitive screening measures. Caregivers completed the DSRS. Principal components analysis identified a 2-factor solution. After controlling for age and education, memory and language were related to the Cognitive factor, whereas attention, processing speed, visuospatial processing, and executive functioning were related to both Cognitive and Self-Care factors. Neither factors correlated with depression. The total DSRS score was able to differentiate patients by the Mini-Mental State Examination scores and diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment and dementia (mixed vascular Alzheimer, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer disease). A cut-score >15 was optimal for detecting dementia in a mixed clinical sample (sensitivity=0.41, specificity=0.79), with a posttest probability of 74%. This study suggests that the DSRS improves detection of dementia and requires minimal effort to implement.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Research addressing Alzheimer disease and related dementias must examine nonbiological factors influencing the risk for and expression of Alzheimer disease and related dementias. These factors address the interplay of cognition with lived experiences and social and structural determinants of health (SSDOH). However, coordinated measures of SSDOH are limited. Methods: The Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC) at Washington University in St. Louis developed and piloted a comprehensive battery to measure SSDOH. One hundred and twelve participants, very mildly cognitively impaired or unimpaired, enrolled in memory studies completed the electronic SSDOH battery. The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) determined the presence or absence of cognitive impairment. Results: Four domains demonstrated above acceptable intraclass correlation scores for test-retest reliability (≥0.70), including adverse childhood events, discrimination, social status, and early education. Twenty very mildly impaired participants completed the electronic pilot study. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that participants with early-stage symptomatic Alzheimer disease are able to participate in electronic SSDOH data collection. In collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania ADRC, we replaced/modified certain assessments to increase intraclass correlation. The resulting battery, Social and Structural Life-courses Influencing Aging and Dementia (SS-DIAD), can serve as a SSDOH collection tool and is currently utilized in cognitively impaired and unimpaired research participants at both ADRCs.",

Ten MCI-English language learner pairs had conversation sessions over 6 weeks. We tracked session engagement, monitored conversations, and interviewed participants at follow-up. Pairs completed 78% of scheduled sessions; only 7% were missed because the MCI participant canceled or failed to appear. Qualitative interviews suggested that participants felt comfortable and engaged. No negative experiences were observed or reported. This program is feasible and potentially desirable for older adults with MCI. This model is interesting given the concern about in-person volunteering risks, and the millions of people motivated to improve English fluency.",

Methods: We recruited 68 participants (37 CO, 10 iNPH, and 21 AD) who underwent neurological examination, the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease neuropsychological test battery (CERAD-NB), and a Clinical Dementia Rating interview. The KD reading test was performed using computer-based ET. We analyzed the total time used for the reading test, number of errors, durations of fixation and saccade, and saccade amplitudes. Results: The iNPH group significantly differed from the CO group in the KD test mean total time (CO 69.3 s, iNPH 87.3 s; P ≤0.009) and eye-tracking recording of the mean saccade amplitude (CO 3.6 degree, iNPH 3.2 degree; P ≤0.001). The AD group significantly differed from the CO group in each tested parameter. No significant differences were detected between the iNPH and AD groups. Conclusion: For the first time, we demonstrated altered reading ability and saccade amplitudes in patients with iNPH.",

In this study, we characterized differences between caregivers of those with MCI versus those with dementia. Methods: A total of 158 caregivers were enrolled in this cross-sectional study, most of whom were dementia caregivers (65%). Caregivers completed questionnaires on depressive symptoms, self-rated health (SRH), perceived burden and stress, as well as psychosocial and demographic measures. Results: Caregivers of those with MCI reported fewer depressive symptoms and lower stress and burden compared with dementia caregivers. In adjusted analyses caregivers with greater stress reported more depressive symptoms. For SRH, at lower stress levels, having a sibling die before age 18 (ie, early life adversity) was associated with poorer SRH; at higher stress levels, having early life adversity was associated with better SRH. At lower burden levels, more live births were associated with worse SRH; at higher burden levels, more live births were associated with better SRH. Conclusions: Early life factors are relevant for caregivers of those with cognitive impairment and targeted prevention and early intervention may be helpful in alleviating caregiver burden and stress.",

This research examined the evaluation of dementia in MEGs in Scotland and compared it with previous research to highlight the changes in the clinical evaluation of dementia over the decade. Design and Setting: A self-administered survey was created online and emailed to 14 Heads of the boards under the Scottish National Health Service and dementia-associated settings and organizations. Results: Most surveyed centers (85.6%) received MEG referrals. Although 92.9% of the centers used professional translators when needed, 85.7% thought assessing dementia in MEGs was difficult, mostly due to the suitability of test instruments and rating scales and patients’ linguistic abilities. Very few found their skills to be good in evaluating MEGs. There was no mention of specialized dementia services for MEGs. Conclusions: The lack of culturally appropriate instruments and specialized dementia services reveals that the services are not ready to meet the demand for evaluating patients from diverse cultural and language backgrounds. Inadequate clinical evaluation may lead to misdiagnoses. Therefore, although significant work has been carried out in the past few years, improvements must be continued to enhance the current practices and apply suitable evaluation methods for MEGs.",

Methods: This pilot study determined the feasibility and acceptability of a multifaceted observational protocol to capture, characterize, and validate ELs in individuals with advanced dementia in hospice. Feasibility was measured through enrollment/retention rates, workload/usability assessment of video observation, and data processing procedures to facilitate the measurement of verbal and nonverbal features for EL characterization. The acceptability of observation and informant validation procedures was qualitatively examined with clinician and family caregiver participants. Results: Study procedures were endorsed as highly acceptable among clinician (N = 49) and caregiver (N = 16) participants, demonstrating higher than anticipated thresholds for observation duration. Enrollment and retention rates for patient participants (N = 6) were 100% and 84%, respectively. Workload and usability measures demonstrated low disruptiveness and high ease of use after training. Discussion: Longitudinal video observation among individuals with advanced dementia in hospice care for the detection of lucidity was feasible and highly acceptable. Multidimensional, temporal coding of features of ELs is feasible but time-intensive.",

Results: Compared with White participants, Black participants had greater odds of MCI (OR 1.53; 95% CI, 1.13 to 2.06) and were more likely to report depressive symptoms, diabetes, and stroke, to have high blood pressure and BMI, and to be APOE - 4 carriers. Exposures associated with higher odds of MCI were diabetes, stroke, lifetime smoking, sleep disturbances, social isolation, loneliness, depression and anxiety symptoms, and vision and hearing loss. There were no significant interactions between race and any exposure. Conclusions: Black participants had 53% higher odds of MCI adjusting for age, sex, and education.

The specific stressor studied here is the provision of caregiving to older persons with Alzheimer disease and related disorders. The aims were to examine the factor structure of stress and nonstress biomarkers, different methods for calculating AL, and the relationship of AL with other variables. Methods: Latent variable models were used to examine biomarkers. Regression analyses were performed with the outcomes: AL calculated as percentile-based and clinically-based for both stress and nonstress components. The sample was 187 Hispanic caregivers to individuals with dementia. Results: The results of the confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) suggested defining 2 factors: nonstress and stress-related. Performance was better for the CFA results and the associations with covariates when stress and nonstress components were examined separately. Despite some limitations, this is one of the first studies of biomarkers in Hispanic caregivers to patients with dementia. It was possible to explain almost 30% of the variance in the nonstress AL component. Conclusion: It may be important to differentiate among biomarkers indicative of cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune response as contrasted with the more stress-related biomarkers.",

However, current understanding of the spatial and temporal interplay between these measures remains limited. Methods: Here, we examined longitudinal atrophy and hypometabolism relationships in 15 bvFTD subjects with 2 to 4 follow-up MRI and PET scans (56 visits total). Subject-specific slopes of atrophy and hypometabolism over time were extracted across brain regions and correlated with baseline measures both locally, via Pearson correlations, and nonlocally, via sparse canonical correlation analyses (SCCA). Results: Notably, we identified a robust link between initial hypometabolism and subsequent cortical atrophy rate changes in bvFTD subjects. Network-level exploration unveiled alignment between baseline hypometabolism and ensuing atrophy rates in the dorsal attention, language, and default mode networks. SCCA identified 2 significant and highly localized components depicting the connection between baseline hypometabolism and atrophy slope over time. The first centered around bilateral orbitofrontal, frontopolar, and medial prefrontal lobes, whereas the second concentrated in the left temporal lobe and precuneus. Conclusions: This study highlights 18 FDG-PET as a dependable predictor of forthcoming atrophy in spatially adjacent brain regions for individuals with bvFTD.",

Methods: This study analyzed data from a 78-week trial with 107 participants with MCI, comparing computerized cognitive training (CCT) and computerized crossword puzzle training (CPT). Outcomes were changes in cognitive and functional measures from baseline. Linear mixed-effect models were used to identify prognostic factors for each intervention. Results: Baseline neuropsychological composite z-score was positively associated with cognitive and functional improvements for both interventions in univariable models, retaining significance in the final multivariable model for functional outcome in CPT ( P &lt; 0.001). Apolipoprotein E e4 carriers had worse cognitive ( P = 0.023) and functional ( P = 0.001) outcomes than noncarriers for CPT but not CCT. African Americans showed greater functional improvements than non-African Americans in both CPT ( P = 0.001) and CCT ( P = 0.010). Better baseline odor identification was correlated with cognitive improvements in CPT ( P = 0.006) and functional improvements in CCT ( P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Baseline cognitive test performance, African American background, and odor identification ability are potential prognostic factors for improved outcomes with cognitive interventions in older adults with MCI.

Analyzing reasons for withdrawal in Alzheimer studies is crucial to ruling out attrition bias, which can undermine a study’s validity. In contrast, attrition in studies using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has received much less attention. Our goal was to identify any commonalities between participants who withdrew for the same reasons. Three independent coders rated each response concerning the reasons for withdrawal, and frequency tables were generated to characterize the participants within each category. This study was conducted on the 28 withdrawn cases from a 7-month study investigating the short-term and long-term therapeutic effects of rTMS for Alzheimer disease among 156 participants across 3 sites of the study. Seven reasons for withdrawal were identified, with health and medical changes being the most commonly reported reason (7 participants). Personal issues involving family or caregivers were the next most common (5 participants), and the remaining 5 categories consisted of 3 participants each. Although the limited sample size prevented the use of inferential statistics, our findings highlight the need for more transparent reporting of attrition rates and withdrawal reasons by rTMS researchers.",

This study aimed to determine whether mild functional impairment (MFI) in CN older adults could predict incident dementia over 6 years, in addition to assessing its association with cognitive performance. Design: A longitudinal study with a 6-year follow-up. Participants: A cohort of 296 community-dwelling CN older adults. Measurements: MFI was defined by cutoffs for impairment on an objective performance-based and/or subjective questionnaire-based functional assessment. Cox regression analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between MFI and risk of incident dementia and cognitive performances over 6 years. Linear regression analysis examined the association between MFI and baseline cognitive performance. Results: There were no significant longitudinal associations between MFI and incident dementia or changes in cognitive performance over 6 years. Defining MFI using both performance-based and informant-reported assessments was predictive of dementia. Cross-sectional analyses demonstrated significant associations between MFI and poorer baseline global cognition and performance in attention, visuospatial ability, and executive functioning. Conclusions: CN older adults with MFI were not at an increased risk of developing dementia over 6 years. A definition of functional impairment requiring both performance-based and informant-based assessments may be useful in predicting dementia.",

Case-control studies show that left-handedness is not a risk factor for late-onset AD (LOAD). However, nonright handedness was found to be more prevalent in patients with early-onset AD (EOAD). Moreover, handedness does not seem to affect neuropsychological performance. We also show that collapsing versus separating mixed and left-handedness may yield different results.

Here, we assessed the effects of restrictions on the cognitive function of the patients by comparing control group. Methods: We examined the impact on cognitive function using the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (Japanese version) cognitive subscale (ADAS-JCOG), in patients with mild to moderate ADRD by a post hoc subgroup analysis of double-blinded, noninferiority study of donepezil 27.5 mg patches and donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg tablets (JapicCTI-194582). After demonstrating the noninferiority of both treatments, we used combined data for this analysis. Results: The analyzed subpopulation of the per-protocol set groups was balanced (n=126 and 135, respectively). Patient demographics were similar between subgroups. The difference of ADAS-JCOG scores [least-squares mean (95%CI)] between the groups was 0.388 (-0.377 to 1.152, not statistically significant). Conclusion: Social isolation affects cognitive function on ADRD and this knowledge should be considered in future.",

Where testing programs are experimental in character, investigators bear legal responsibilities to inform their subjects adequately and separate duties to submit their proposals to ethical review. Access to routine care and counseling and to specialized testing programs are addressed in the contexts of antidiscrimination laws and patient protection. The law on patients' adequately informed and free decision-making regarding testing is reviewed, with particular attention to reproductive counseling and planning for future inability to make or express decisions about care. Modern perceptions of the legal nature of medical confidentiality are applied to results of predictive genetic testing, and distinctions are illustrated between justified and excusable breaches of confidentiality, particularly with regard to familial disorders. Attention is given to patients' directions that their medical information be made available to third parties and to themselves. Finally, legal issues are considered regarding legal control of tissue samples that patients give for genetic diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is a clinical and pathologic diagnosis and refers to the findings of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques in the brain of a patient with dementia. Clinically it is recognized that there are familial and sporadic forms, with further division into those with presenile and senile onset. Clinical, neuroimaging, neuropathological, and neurochemical studies have attempted to identify differences between cases with an earlier and later onset, but have not identified a categorical biologic difference between the two groups. Recent advances in the molecular genetics of familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) and the discovery of defined genetic abnormalities have provided a robust approach to distinguishing between early- and late-onset cases within the group of autosomal dominant FAD. The precise biologic classification made possible by molecular genetic analysis of FAD provides a benchmark against which phenotypic differences can be assessed. This article argues that future studies will be able to contrast early-onset familial versus late-onset familial disease, and early-onset familial versus early-onset sporadic disease. Previous reports of phenotypic differences within AD may have been the result of including FAD within early-onset groups, though this remains to be established.",

Patients met standard diagnostic criteria for probable DAT and results were compared with similar measures in 26 age-matched, neurologically and cognitively normal volunteers. Perfusions of frontal and occipital white matter as well as frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortex were reduced in DAT compared with age-matched normals. White matter perfusion differences were not observed among DAT patients with and without risk factors for stroke. Reduced perfusion of frontal white matter correlated significantly with reduced perfusion of thalamus and putamen in patients with DAT. Results confirm the frequent association of white matter abnormalities in patients with DAT that are possibly caused by amyloid angiopathy and may contribute to cognitive impairments.",

As part of a social and health survey, we administered the Hodkinson abbreviated mental test to all persons over age 59 residing in the Commune of Appignano on January 1, 1987 (N = 778). We then investigated all subjects scoring 7 or less on the cognitive test following a standardized diagnostic protocol. We found 48 patients affected by dementia, yielding a crude prevalence ratio (cases per 100 population over age 59) of 6.2; prevalence ratios were 2.6 for Alzheimer9s disease, 2.2 for multi-infarct dementia, 0.8 for mixed dementia, 0.4 for secondary dementia, and 0.3 for unspecified dementia. Age- and sex-specific prevalence ratios increased steeply with age and were consistently higher in women for Alzheimer9s disease and in men for dementia of all types and multi-infarct dementia. Alzheimer9s disease was slightly more frequent than multi-infarct dementia; however, the most common type of dementia varied across age groups. Most cases of Alzheimer9s disease were sporadic and had a late age of onset. Comparison with other populations suggests that dementia of all types is as frequent in Appignano as elsewhere, and that Alzheimer9s disease might be more frequent in rural than in urban populations.",

We conclude from these sources that the public health importance of cognitive impairment and dementia secondary to cerebrovascular disease is recognized in Australia as is the potential to alter the public health burden significantly by preventative strategies. VaD is considered to be a heterogenous group of syndromes, and there is a lack of consensus on the appropriate diagnostic criteria. The concept is considered to be in evolution and empirical support is needed for its definition, subtyping, and the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms. An alternative term—vascular cognitive disorder—is suggested to overcome some of the difficulties inherent in the concept of “dementia” as used currently. The importance of noncognitive disorders of vascular origin is highlighted. No treatment is recognized to be specifically effective in VaD. Australian clinicians and researchers are beginning to grapple with the many difficulties entailed in our understanding of the cognitive and noncognitive consequences of cerebrovascular disease. There is a need for an international consensus on diagnostic criteria, particularly for drug development and research.",

    "abstract": "Summary: Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuritic plaques (NPs) are the classic ncuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD). It is generally assumed that the pathogenic process of AD could start by local neurotoxicity induced by the 3-amyloid core of plaques, followed by the appearance of NFTs and eventually cell death. To determine whether or not local neurotoxicity around NPs is indeed a major pathogenetic mechanism, we used an image analysis system to measure the neuronal density around Bodian-stained NPs in the hippocampal CA1 area of eight AD patients. Neuronal density, as measured within two arbitrary concentric circles around NPs with a radius of 74 and 123.5 µm, respectively, was on average 19% and 16% lower than the density in similar control circles without NPs in the same section. Furthermore, neuronal density around NPs was inversely related to their size. To investigate the impact of such a local reduction in cell density around NPs on the entire CA1 area, we also determined the proportion of the CA1 covered by the NPs and the arbitrary concentric circles around them. This appeared to be 16.3% of the total CA1 area, which means that the negative effect of NPs on the cell density can only explain 2.6% of cell death in the entire CA1 area. In conclusion, this study suggests that although NPs have a local negative effect on neighboring neurons, their contribution to the strong decrease in CA1 cell numbers is limited.",

The distinctive arrangement of microtubules in spindle and its size make this structure an obvious choice for study. Recovery trends in the three patient groups differed significantly; in particular, the controls showed an earlier appearance of intact spindle microtubules than AD. Other researchers found similar results using AD fibroblasts. The results from the DS cells were inconsistent and difficult to interpret. It is unclear how the AD microtubules differ from controls, or whether a relationship exists between the altered microtubule repolymerization kinetics observed in this study and the presence of neurofibrillary tangles in AD patients. A difference in repolymerization rates can be the basis for a diagnostic test for AD if it can be verified.",

We studied the nature of the antigens recognized by this antiserum by immunocytochemistry, immunoblots and immunoadsorption. These approaches showed that the anti-PHF specifically labels a set of low molecular weight 65-50 kDa microtubule-associated proteins, named Tau proteins, which are promoting factors of microtubule assembly. Furthermore, antisera against Tau proteins stained NFT. It is concluded that neurofibrillary tangles are very likely composed of aggregated Tau proteins.

    "abstract": "The drug discovery and the drug development processes represent a continuum of recursive activities that range from initial drug target identification to final Food and Drug Administration approval and marketing of a new therapeutic. Drug discovery, as its name implies, is more exploratory and less focused in many cases, whereas drug development has a clinically defined endpoint and a specific disease goal. Academia has historically made major contributions to this process at the early discovery phases. However, current trends in the organization of the pharmaceutical industry suggest an expanded role for academia in the near future. Megamergers among major pharmaceutical corporations indicate their movement toward a focus on end-stage clinical trials, manufacturing, and marketing. There has been a parallel increase in outsourcing of intermediate steps to specialty small pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and contract service companies. The new paradigm suggests that academia will play an increasingly important role at the proof-of-principle stage of basic and clinical drug discovery research, in training the future skilled work force, and in close partnerships with small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. However, academic drug discovery research faces a set of barriers to progress, the relative importance of which varies with the home institution and the details of the research area. These barriers fall into four general categories: (1) the historical administrative structure and environment of academia; (2) the structure and emphasis of peer review panels that control research funding by government and private agencies; (3) the organization and operation of the academic infrastructure; and (4) the structure and availability of specialized resources and information management. Selected examples of barriers to drug discovery and drug development research and training in academia are presented, as are some specific recommendations designed to minimize or circumvent these barriers. In some cases, precedents established by other disease-focused areas may be relevant to Alzheimer disease and related disorders, but the overall impact of any changes requires adaptation at the top of the administrative structures in academia and funding agencies to support and encourage cooperative efforts among faculty investigators.",

In the Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study Prevention Instrument Project a book club was introduced as a recruitment and retention device. A 3-arm study was designed and included: a nonrandomized, self-selected group (n=211) who chose not to participate in the book club, and 2 groups randomly assigned to receive 2 books per year in individual self-improvement (n=210) or community involvement (n=207) categories. Participants reported their reactions to the selections and other reading behaviors. Results from the first 2 years revealed that most book club participants agreed with Likert-type statements indicating the readings were enjoyable (P<0.001), had an impact on their thinking (P=0.01), and were shared by them with others (P=0.002). Respondents in the community involvement group agreed more strongly with these statements than those in the self-improvement category. Comments from participants in response to open-ended questions in the reader survey revealed such themes as developing plans for successful aging and reflecting on attitudes and behaviors in their own lives. Further longitudinal analyses are planned to determine whether the book club influenced retention and whether participation was associated with slowing cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in humans. However, to date, the cause of sporadic AD (SAD), which is the most frequent form, is still unknown. Although it has not been possible to determine the origin of this disease, the amyloid hypothesis is one of the most accepted to explain the etiology of AD. This hypothesis proposes that the pathogenesis of AD is derived from the toxic effect produced by the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide in the brain parenchyma, but it does not make clear how Aβ is capable of producing such damage. Furthermore, it has been observed that SAD is accompanied by disruptions in the vascular system, such as damage to the blood-brain barrier. This facilitates the transfer of some systemic proteins, such as fibrinogen, to the brain parenchyma, where Aβ is abundant. Therefore, this Aβ interacts with fibrinogen, which favors the formation of clots resistant to fibrinolysis, inducing a risk of thrombosis and neuroinflammation. Notably, Aβ is not only of neuronal origin; platelets also contribute to high Aβ production in the circulation. The Aβ present in circulation favors the activation of coagulation factor XII, which leads to the generation of thrombin and bradykinin. In addition to Aβ-induced platelet activation, all these events favor the development of inflammatory processes that cause damage to the brain vasculature. This damage represents the beginning of the toxic effects of Aβ, which supports the amyloid hypothesis. This review addresses the relationship between alterations in the vascular and hemostatic systems caused by Aβ and how both alterations contribute to the progression of SAD.",

This prospective longitudinal study examined in-home medication-taking and transition from normative aging to MCI. Methods: Daily, weekly, and monthly medication-taking metrics derived from an instrumented pillbox were examined in 64 healthy cognitively intact older adults (M age =85.5 y) followed for a mean of 2.3 years; 9 transitioned to MCI during study follow-up. Results: In the time up to and after MCI diagnosis, incident MCI participants opened their pillbox later in the day (by 19 min/mo; β=0.46, P&lt;0.001) and had increased day-to-day variability in the first pillbox opening over time (by 4 min/mo) as compared with stable cognitively intact participants (β=4.0, P=0.003). Discussion: Individuals who transitioned to MCI opened their pillboxes later in the day and were more variable in their medication-taking habits. These differences increased in the time up to and after diagnosis of MCI. Unobtrusive medication-taking monitoring is an ecologically valid approach for identifying early activity of daily living changes that signal transition to MCI.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) usually experience naming difficulty due to storage and access problems in phonological-lexical representation. Investigating naming response patterns followed by cueing may help us to understand the underlying mechanism of naming deficits in AD. A total of 221 patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD [Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 0.5, 1, 2] were included as subjects. Sixty items of the Korean version of the Boston Naming Test were given, and upon failure, semantic/syllabic cues were verbally presented. From the results, even in the CDR 2 group, which is considered to be a moderate stage of AD, syllabic cues significantly facilitated correct responses. Our findings are in contrast with previous studies conducted with English-speaking patients, which reported that phonological-lexical representation may have been disrupted in the moderate stage of AD, and that none of the cues facilitated correct word retrieval. The difference may be ascribed to the fact that direct access to the phonological-lexical representation via syllabic cues was possible in the confrontation naming task performed by the Korean patients. It can be concluded that phonological-lexical representation in moderate stage Korean AD might be partially preserved because syllabic cues in AD patients were effective in facilitating target words.",

Methods: Fifty-seven cognitively unimpaired individuals aged 51 to 88, genotyped according to apolipoprotein E (APOE) and translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane (40 homolog) poly-T lengths, completed cognitive testing before, 2.5 and 5 hours after receiving a 1 mg dose of lorazepam. Results: Post-lorazepam, there were significant ( P &lt;0.05) declines from baseline in memory, psychomotor processing speed, and executive function. At 2.5 hours, the magnitude of this lorazepam-induced cognitive change was significantly greater in the APOE3/4 group than in the APOE3/3 group for tests of working memory and visuospatial memory/executive function. At 5 hours postchallenge, verbal memory and working memory deficits persisted in the APOE3/4 group compared with the APOE3/3 group. At 5 hours after lorazepam challenge, as compared with the very long/very long group, the short/short group performed slightly worse on a test of working memory ( P &lt;0.05), but no other differences were observed among translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane 40 homolog poly-T variant groups.

The present study analyzed data from 2 recent multicenter studies based on the same executive battery. The objective was to derive a shortened battery by using the GREFEX population as a training dataset and by cross-validating the results in the REFLEX population. A total of 102 AD patients of the GREFEX study (MMSE=23.2±2.9) and 72 patients of the REFLEX study (MMSE=20.8±3.5) were included. Tests were selected and receiver operating characteristic curves were generated relative to the performance of 780 controls from the GREFEX study. Stepwise logistic regression identified 3 cognitive tests (Six Elements Task, categorical fluency and Trail Making Test B error) and behavioral disorders globally referred as global hypoactivity ( P =0.0001, all). This shortened battery was as accurate as the entire GREFEX battery in diagnosing dysexecutive disorders in both training group and the validation group. Bootstrap procedure confirmed the stability of AUC. A shortened battery based on 3 cognitive tests and 3 behavioral domains provides a high diagnosis accuracy of executive disorders in mild-to-moderate AD.",

    "abstract": "There is little knowledge of the long-term course of Alzheimer disease (AD) in light of current pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions provided in a \"real-life\" setting.The Frisian Alzheimer's Disease Cohort study is a \"real-life\" study of the course of AD in patients (n=576) treated with pharmacological (ie, cholinesterase inhibitors) and nonpharmacological (ie, case management, respite care) interventions. Disease course was described by changes in cognition (Mini Mental State Examination, clock-drawing test) and number of types of professional care applying a repeated-measures analysis using a marginal model (population-based average model). In addition, behavioral and psychological symptoms, and proportions of nursing home admissions and deaths were investigated.During 3.5 years, the average Mini Mental State Examination decreased from 22.24 to 18.91, the clock-drawing test score increased from 3.38 to 4.05, the number of types of professional care increased from 0.85 to 2.64, and the patients with behavioral and psychological symptoms increased from 29.0% to 70.2%. The proportion of patients admitted to a nursing home was 40.8% and 41.0% died.Cognition and behaviour of AD patients deteriorated accompanied with an increase in care-dependency during 3.5 years. Nevertheless, compared with the precholinesterase inhibitor era, current pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions appear to slow cognitive decline, which emphasizes that they seem to have a favorable effect.",

    "abstract": "Age at onset is one of the most important factors that affects the clinical course in Alzheimer disease (AD), whereas other factors such as apolipoprotein E (apoE) genotype may also play a major role. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of age at onset and apoE genotype on white-matter changes in AD using diffusion tensor imaging. About 213 patients with AD and 66 normal individuals underwent diffusion tensor imaging, and apoE genotype was obtained in all AD patients and in 24 normal individuals. When multiple regression analysis was conducted, a younger age at onset was associated with lower fractional anisotropy in both deep-located long-range limbic and association fibers and superficial-located short-range association fibers in the frontal, the temporal, and the parietal lobes, and with a higher mean diffusivity in deep-located fibers and the bilateral medial thalamus. When analyzed separately in apoE e4 carriers and noncarriers, e4 carriers showed an association between a younger age at onset and lower fractional anisotropy, mainly in deep-located fibers, whereas noncarriers showed this association in both deep-located and superficial-located fibers. There was no difference in the spatial distribution between carriers and noncarriers in the association between the age at onset and mean diffusivity. Our results suggest that the topographical distribution of white-matter changes in AD is significantly affected by the interaction between age at onset and apoE genotype.",

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 462 community-dwelling older adults. We performed cognitive, psychosocial, and clinical assessments and face-to-face interviews with all older adults. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to determine the participant’s cognitive performance and the associated factors. Results: The mean cognitive score on the Identification and Intervention for Dementia in Elderly Africans cognitive test was 11.04 (SD=2.89). Per the proposed cut-off scores to define probable and possible dementia, 13.2% of the population had probable dementia and another 13.9% had possible dementia. Increase in age was associated with poor cognitive performance (β=−0.076, 95% CI=−0.109 to −0.043, P &lt;0.001); whereas male sex (β=0.989, 95% CI=0.333 to 1.645, P =0.003), higher educational attainment (β=2.575, 95% CI=0.557 to 4.594, P =0.013) and performance in instrumental activities of daily living (β=0.552, 95% CI=0.376 to 0.729, P &lt;0.001) were associated with higher cognitive performance. Discussion: Older people in rural settings of central Tanzania have poor cognitive functions and are at high risk of further cognitive decline. Preventive and therapeutic programs for the affected older people are warranted to prevent further decline and maintain quality of life.",

Respondents were then asked about their perceived burden, risks, and societal contribution from participation. Results: An offer of remuneration increased willingness to participate, with no difference between $50 and $100. The increase was similar across racial, ethnic, and income groups. Remuneration did not affect perceived risks or altruistic benefits. Compensation caused Whites and Hispanics, but not Blacks, to lower the perceived burden. Discussion: Modest levels of remuneration are likely to improve recruitment to AD research studies without causing collateral ethical or motivation problems. Remuneration does not differentially enhance minority recruitment.",

This study compares reported dementia mortality in national vital statistics between countries and over time. In countries with low dementia reporting, this study identifies other causes to which dementia may be misclassified. Methods: Using the World Health Organization (WHO) Mortality Database, we calculated the ratio of reported to expected (Global Burden of Disease estimated) age-standardized dementia death rates in 90 countries from 2000 to 2019. Other causes to which dementia may be misclassified were identified as having relatively high cause fractions compared with other countries. Patients: No patients were involved. Results: There is a large intercountry variation in reported dementia mortality rates. The ratio of reported to expected dementia mortality exceeded 100% in high-income countries but was below 50% in other super regions. In countries with low reported dementia mortality, cardiovascular diseases, ill-defined causes, and pneumonia have relatively high cause fractions and may be misclassified from dementia. Discussion: Large discrepancies in dementia mortality reporting between countries, including often implausibly low reported mortality, makes comparison extremely difficult. Improved guidance for and training of certifiers and the use of multiple cause-of-death data can help strengthen the policy utility of dementia mortality data.",

This study investigated the prevalence and associations of dementia in older adults (less than 60 y) attending the outpatient department of Mount Meru Hospital in Tanzania. Methods: This one-phase cross-sectional study screened a sample using the Identification of Dementia in Elderly Africans (IDEA) cognitive screening tool. Those that screened as having possible and probable dementia were further assessed, and diagnosis of dementia was made according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). Demographic and risk factor data were collected. Results: Within those screened, 57/1141 (5.0%) (95% CI: 3.7-6.3) had dementia. Female sex [odds ratio (OR)=2.778, 95% CI: 1.074–7.189], having never attended school (OR=6.088, 95% CI: 1.360–27.256), alcohol (U/wk) (OR=1.080, 95% CI: 1.016-1.149), uncorrected visual impairment (OR=4.260, 95% CI: 1.623-11.180), body mass index &lt;18.5 kg/m 2 (OR=6.588, 95% CI: 2.089-20.775), and stroke (OR=15.790, 95% CI: 3.48-74.475) were found to be significantly, independently associated with dementia. Conclusions: The prevalence of dementia in this population is similar to a recent community-based rate in Tanzania and lower than a hospital-based rate in Senegal. This is the first time the association between visual impairment and dementia has been reported in SSA. Other associations are in keeping with previous literature.",

Methods: A neurologically mixed sample of older adults was randomized to 8 weekly, webcam conversations with English-language learners or a waitlist control. Outcomes included the Cognitive Change Index (CCI) and surveys of program satisfaction. Here, we report on session completion, intervention satisfaction, and follow-up CCI scores. Exploratory analyses of CCI intervention effects controlled for baseline CCI scores and the interaction between group and baseline CCI. Results: Participants (N=38) were on average 70.8 years of age, 28/38 were White, and 16/38 demonstrated possible cognitive impairment on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Pairs completed 115/136 sessions (85%) and all volunteers said they would recommend the program. Controlling for the interaction between baseline CCI and randomization group, SPEAK! volunteers had better follow-up CCI scores than controls ( P =0.018). Improvements in CCI were greater among participants with fewer baseline memory problems. Conclusions: SPEAK! was feasible and appreciated by older adults with and without cognitive impairment. Larger studies should confirm benefits for memory and other determinants of quality of life.",

Considering potential reactions to learning biomarker results can guide prebiomarker and postbiomarker testing education and counseling programs. Methods: Cognitively healthy adults enrolled in observational Alzheimer research responded to a telephone survey about learning AD risk information (n=334; 44% Black or African American; mean age=64.9±7.0). Multiple linear regression models tested if contextual factors predicted anticipated psychological impact (distress, stigma, and cognitive symptoms) or behavior change (planning and risk-reduction). Secondary analyses tested for differences in relationships by racial identity. Results: Internal health locus of control, concern about AD, self-identified sex, education, family dementia history, and belief in AD modifiability predicted anticipated psychological impact. Concern about AD, age, racial identity, belief in AD modifiability, research attitudes, and exposure to brain health-related social norms predicted anticipated behavior change. For Black respondents, there were no sex differences in anticipated distress, whereas there were stronger relationships between health locus of control, brain health social norms, and education on outcomes compared with White respondents. Conclusions: Results may inform personalized and culturally tailored biomarker testing education and counseling to minimize psychological impacts and increase behavior change related to learning AD risk information.",

    "abstract": "In January 1992, the IMAGE Project extended the establishment of its registry of familial Alzheimer cases to all areas of the province of Quebec, for collection of epidemiological and clinical data, as well as biological samples. The aim is to study genetic transmission patterns of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to provide a sampling framework for further etiologic and risk factor studies. The IMAGE registry already includes data of a population-based study in the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean area; the project to collect data on familial AD (FAD) cases across the province of Quebec is known as the ALGENE Initiative. The registry is thus a collection of \"AD families\" for both familial and sporadic cases. The establishment of the registry involves several steps in the field work: recruitment and selection of families; collection of information on family medical history; selection of informative families and genetic testing for AD/FAD by linkage analysis. As AD is not homogeneous in its etiology and since we do not know if, in the event that genetics is involved in AD whether or not penetrance of the gene(s) is high, we must be aware of the \"genetic horizons\" of AD in collecting and conserving data on families of cases, and in the genetic testing for AD/FAD by linkage analysis. Families who choose genetic testing must be aware of the implications of our undertaking, assured of the confidentiality of the test and, at the same time, they must understand its limitations. The experimental nature of our research project raises ethical dilemmas. This article examines these initial considerations of the field work involved in developing a registry pertaining to genetic testing for AD/FAD by linkage analysis and offers some preliminary observations on the experience of the first year of this project.",

We optimized the sensitivity of the assay so that the inhibition of alpha-chymotrypsin could be measured in all samples. The competitive inhibition was proportional to the amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) added to the reaction mixture. After correction for protein concentration, the inhibition was higher with CSF from patients with senile dementia of Alzheimer's type than with those from patients with vascular dementia or controls. Inhibitory activity appeared to be specific for alpha-chymotrypsin because no inhibition for papain was found. Moreover, the depletion of alpha 1-antichymotrypsin from CSF by immunoadsorption revealed that this serpin was responsible for the disappearance of the inhibitory activity. Our findings suggested that the increased alpha-chymotrypsin inhibitory activity might represent an in vivo functional index of an abnormal protease metabolism in patients with Alzheimer's disease.",

ALCAR seems to exert a number of central nervous system (CNS)-related effects, even though a clear pharmacological action that could explain clinical results in AD has not been identified yet. The aim of this study was to determine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biological correlates of ALCAR effects in AD after a short-term, high-dose, intravenous, open treatment. Results show that ALCAR CSF levels achieved under treatment were significantly higher than the ones at baseline, reflecting a good penetration through the blood-brain barrier and thus a direct CNS challenge. ALCAR treatment produced no apparent change on CSF classic neurotransmitters and their metabolite levels (homovanillic acid, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, MHPG, dopamine, choline). Among CSF peptides, while corticotropin-releasing hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone remained unchanged, beta-endorphins significantly decreased after treatment; plasma cortisol levels matched this reduction. Since both CSF beta-endorphins and plasma cortisol decreased, one possible explanation is that ALCAR reduced the AD-dependent hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis hyperactivity. At present, no clear explanation can be proposed for the specific mechanism of this action.",

AD was identified as a distinct disease process early in this century and research into its etiology and treatment has a short, but active, history. This paper emphasizes past, present, and future biomedical research for the goal of stimulating research to solve some of the unanswered questions to ultimately help the victims of Alzheimer disease. The \"hot\" topics today for biomedical researchers include early diagnosis, presymptomatic markers, the role of presenilins, amyloid, protein precursor processing, and continued exploration for genetic and environmental risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Vascular dementia (VaD) is a heterogeneous pathology currently regarded as the result of a variety of causes. Different types of VaD can be identified according to different criteria. This heterogeneity might be one of the causes of the controversial results observed, up to now, in clinical trials. Recently, the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) explicitly identified subcortical VaD as a well-defined subgroup. Abnormalities of white matter are clearly detectable with computed tomography or magnetic resonance scans. The clinicoradiological association of dementia, blood hypertension, and other vascular risk factors, extensive white matter lesions, and small subcortical infarcts might be considered as a clinical univocal entity. Following the encouraging results of a preliminary pilot study, the above-mentioned criteria were followed to define a population of patients to be enrolled in a double-blind, parallel-groups, placebo-controlled clinical trial with nimodipine, which has been proposed as a drug that can improve cognitive functions in patients with VaD. The paper discusses the protocol design of this ongoing trial and its main entry criteria, with particular emphasis on the definition of the population to be enrolled. Implication for future trials in subcortical VaD are discussed further.",

Various methods such as respite services and day care as well as counseling and support groups have been shown to reduce caregiver stress and burnout. Moreover, there are many areas in which the informed, trained caregiver can contribute positively to, and even lead, the interdisciplinary ongoing care of AD patients. For example, the caregiver can help with memory aids, behavioral interventions, the maintenance of exercise and nutrition, health care proxies and housing arrangements, decisions about intensity of treatment, and the timely implementation of palliative care approaches. Caregivers skilled in such matters will increase the quality of life of the AD patient and reduce their dependency. Many support services and educational activities are known to help caregivers and their patients, yet their availability is variable, and it is unclear whose responsibility it is to organize and finance them.",

The clinical picture of vascular dementia varies, and the role of functional brain imaging of cerebral blood flow and metabolism would be expected to be different among subtypes of vascular dementia. The role and value of functional brain imaging is limited for cortical infarcts; it is very valuable in assessing the impact on cortical function for small subcortical infarcts; and it is probably useful for evaluating white matter lesions, but this needs to be determined in further studies. At least in research of vascular dementia, functional brain imaging criteria should be included for proper patient selection. Careful studies using functional imaging tools in a well-characterized patient population will be needed.",

This difference was due to a significant increase in S/B in female but not male DAT patients compared with AGED (p < 0.05). There were no differences in levels of circulating NE between DAT and AGED, nor between sexes. Thus, the present data suggest that in this model of the postsynaptic β-adrenergic receptor/effector complex, receptor sensitivity was increased in women with DAT.",

    "abstract": "In a white, predominantly middle class southern California retirement community, 817 adults aged 65-99 years were evaluated in 1980-1982 in a study designed to assess prevalence of early Alzheimer-type senile dementia. Based on 162 neurologically diagnosed cases, the age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in the target population was 15.3% (95% confidence interval = 13.0-17.5) among persons aged 65+ years and 35.8% among persons aged 80+ years. Age-adjusted correction for false negatives not detected by a screening procedure yields an estimated prevalence of 16.4% in persons aged 65+ years. Validity of the diagnostic approach was confirmed by a follow-up study. These rates far exceed past prevalence estimates for this disease. Since prevalence of mid- or later stages of Alzheimer's disease may have been underestimated, the high rates in this study may reflect a considerable community burden of early disease. Observed prevalence of Alzheimer-type senile dementia was higher among men than women after adjustment for age, 19.1% and 13.1%, respectively. The female predominance reported in many past clinical surveys may be peculiar to late disease and reflect care-seeking and care-utilization behaviors, rather than differences in incidence.",

Data used in this investigation primarily came from the 1991 to 2003 On-line Survey Certification of Automated Records and the Area Resource File. Approximately, 20% (n=2815) of nursing homes had an A-SCU in 2003. We found that opening an A-SCU promoted more favorable occupancy rates and private-pay mix, but did not influence Medicare payer mix. Three years after opening an A-SCU, the gain in occupancy rate for nursing homes was more than 3% and the gain in private-pay census was approximately 2%. These gains occurred while the national trend was one of declining occupancy and private-pay census.",

The test measures speed and accuracy in reaction time, visual learning, and working memory tasks.Neuroticism, although not related to cognitive performance overall (P>0.05), was related to a greater increase in accuracy (estimate=0.07, P=0.04) and speed (estimate=-0.09, P=0.03) on One Card Learning. Greater conscientiousness was related to faster overall speed on Detection (estimate=-1.62, P=0.02) and a significant rate of improvement in speed on One Card Learning (estimate=-0.10, P<0.03). No differences in satisfaction or adherence to monthly monitoring as a function of neuroticism or conscientiousness were observed.Participants volunteering for regular cognitive monitoring may be quite uniform in terms of personality traits, with personality traits playing a relatively minor role in adherence and satisfaction. The more neurotic may exhibit better accuracy and improve in speed with time, whereas the more conscientious may perform faster overall and improve in speed on some tasks, but the effects appear small.",

    "abstract": "Slow participant recruitment impedes Alzheimer disease research progress. Although research suggests that direct involvement with potential participants supports enrollment, strategies for how best to engage potential participants are still unclear.This study explores whether community health fair (HF) attendees who engage in a brief cognitive screen (BCS) are more likely to enroll in research than attendees who do not complete a BCS.A total of 483 HF attendees.Attendees were tracked for a 1-year period to ascertain research involvement.In total, 364 attendees expressed interest in research and 126 completed a BCS. Over the follow-up period, 21 individuals prescreened as eligible and 19 enrolled in an investigational study. Among all HF attendees, BCS completers had a 2.5-fold increase in subsequently prescreening as eligible as compared with non-BCS completers. However, when limited only to participants who stated an interest in research, this difference was no longer significant.Completing a BCS at a community event may be an indicator of future research engagement, but for those already interested in participation, the BCS may be a poor indicator of future involvement. The BCS may also reduce anxiety and stigma around memory evaluation, which may translate into research engagement in the future.",

However, no reliable indicators of discontinuance of oral feeding have yet been identified. We therefore aimed to identify predictors of discontinuance of oral feeding in postaspiration pneumonia patients with AD.Relevant clinical and laboratory data of 60 patients with AD admitted to our hospital in Japan for aspiration pneumonia were retrospectively compared between oral feeding and discontinuance groups.The study groups differed in interval since diagnosis of AD, CURB-65 score, pneumonia severity index score, and proportion of patients who died (higher in the discontinuance group) and body mass index (BMI), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, and functional independence measure score (lower in the discontinuance group). According to multivariate logistic regression analysis of all identified independent variables, only CURB-65 and MMSE scores and BMI are significant predictors of discontinuance of oral feeding after aspiration pneumonia in patients with advanced AD.In patients with advanced AD, discontinuance of oral feeding after aspiration pneumonia may be predicted by CURB-65 and MMSE scores and BMI.",

We aimed to examine the psychometric properties of the short versions of the Assessment Scale of Psychosocial Impact of the Diagnosis of Dementia (ASPIDD-s), a multidimensional awareness scale. Using a cross-sectional design, we included 201 people with dementia and their family caregivers. The creation of the short versions was based on items with higher loadings on each factor, the correlations between the short versions and demographic or clinical variables and the relevance of the item to the respondent population. Three short versions were created: version 1 and 3, with 12 items and version 2, with 16 items. The short versions correlated very strongly with the full scale and with the 4 factors of the original scale, maintaining the multidimensional nature of the ASPIDD. Loss of awareness was associated with worse quality of life, decreased functionality and cognitive level, and higher caregiver burden across the short versions. Considering the appropriateness of the items and their clinical relevance, we recommend version 3 for use. With only 12 items, the time required for the completion of the scale is short, while maintaining robust psychometric properties.",

Methods: Using the Korean National Health Insurance Service Elderly cohort database, 388,629 adults aged 70 years and older in 2012 were included. The use of strong anticholinergic agents (ACs) in 2012 was quantified by standardized prescribed doses. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were applied to examine the level of their heavy use (≥90 doses of the prescribed amount in 2012) in patients with AD and potential explanations of the heavy use. Results: Antihistamines and antidepressants were the most prescribed strong ACs among non-AD and AD elderly, respectively. The heavy use of strong ACs was more prevalent in patients with AD than in non-AD elderly [odds ratio (95% confidence interval)=1.48 (1.41-1.56)]. When the morbidities associated with AD were adjusted for, odds ratio were reduced [0.91 (0.85-0.96)]. Conclusions: Heavy use of strong ACs was more prevalent in patients with AD than in non-AD elderly. Multiple ACs for treating multimorbidities in AD were mainly attributable to their heavy use. In patients with AD, the integrated management of medications for reducing the preventable heavy use of these drugs should be reinforced.",

Our goal was to determine whether cerebral gray matter volume is related to neck circumference (NC), a measure of regional adiposity having unique relationships with metabolic disorders and cardiovascular disease. Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging and NC were cross-sectionally assessed from 2011 to 2014 in a population-based sample of 2916 men and women in the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study. Results: For men, NC was inversely associated with total and regional gray matter in the frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes after adjusting for age and intracranial brain volume. Associations were especially strong in the presence of diabetes. With further adjustment for indices of body composition and other characteristics, total and frontal gray matter in diabetic men were lowered by 6.1 mL (95% confidence interval: 2.5-9.7, P =0.004) and 2.9 mL (95% confidence interval: 1.0-4.9, P =0.017), respectively, per SD increase in NC (2.3 cm). For men without diabetes, and in all women, associations were less apparent. Conclusions: In men with diabetes, NC was inversely associated with cerebral gray matter volume. The link between neck anthropometry and brain aging in diabetic men warrants further consideration.",

The objectives of this study were to examine views, preferences, and recommendations regarding acute care-based ADRD research recruitment among persons with dementia and their caregivers.The authors conducted semistructured interviews with recently hospitalized persons with dementia (N=3) and family caregivers (N=28). Interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis.All participants endorsed acute care as an appropriate time for recruitment into ADRD research studies and identified important elements of an appropriately tailored recruitment approach and an interpersonally effective research staff. Participants emphasized that this approach should consider the acute care context with respect to participant situation, uncertainty, and timing. Participant suggestions informed the design of a 5-step process to guide ADRD research recruitment in the context of acute care.Findings provide valuable insights from people with dementia and their caregivers regarding opportunities for research engagement surrounding acute care and can inform expanded recruitment in these settings.",

Coregistered T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and dynamic 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) images confirmed that the focal PiB enhancement was in the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses, outside of the adjacent cortex. Flow through the venous vasculature was normal as assessed by dynamic FDG PET imaging.

One or more bioethical principles of autonomy, confidentiality, truth telling, beneficence, and justice, which apply to demented individuals as they do to other patients, may conflict in everyday clinical situations. For example, when demented patients wish to continue driving, autonomy (the patient's right to self-determination) conflicts with beneficence (the duty to promote the patient's welfare). Cognitively impaired patients depend on others for ethical decision making in the resolution of these dilemmas. It is essential that clinicians and investigators involved in the decision-making process do so without bias or conflict of interest. Full disclosure of financial interests increasingly is an accepted requirement in the conduct of biomedical research. In AD, less obvious potential conflicts of interest arise when physicians recruit their patients for antidementia drug trials sponsored by a pharmaceutical company (that provides the physician with research funding) or when investigators fail to acknowledge the patient's withdrawal of assent when attempting to complete a research protocol. The recognition of both financial and nonfinancial conflicts should lead to measures to reduce bias, which in turn will improve the integrity of research findings and promote patient welfare.",

Diagnosis of AD was made according to criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-R (DSM-III-R). All AD patients were tested with the Chinese version of Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI). Their primary caregivers rated the patients using the Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist (RMBPC), the short version of Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-S), and obtained information about coping strategies using the Carer's Stress scale. The three subscale scores for memory-related problems, depression, and disruptive behavior were obtained from the RMBPC. Scores for three subscales for management of situations, meaning, and distress were obtained from the coping strategies' assessment. Depression was defined as a GDS-S score s» 5. Among the 74 AD patients, 38 were men and 36 women. Their ages ranged from 47 to 90 years, with a mean age of 12.2 years (SD, 9.0). The CASI scores ranged from 1 to 88 (mean, 45.2; SD, 22.9). Thirty-three caregivers were men and 41 were women. Their age ranged from 20 to 85 years, with a mean age of 53.5 years (SD, 16.9). Twenty-six of the 74 caregivers (35.1%) were classified as depressed. The GDS-S scores of caregivers were correlated positively with the frequency of the use of a management of distress coping strategy and the frequency of the patients' disruptive behavior and were correlated negatively with the educational years of the caregivers",

    "abstract": "Summary: Decline in functional abilities is a major component of the dementia syndrome. The definition of dementia in the International Classification of Diseases (10th rev.) requires a cognitive impairment sufficient to impair personal activities of daily living (ADL). The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) also requires cognitive deficits sufficiently severe to cause impairment in occupational or social functioning and must represent a decline from a higher level of functioning. However, the term disability is more appropriate than impairment to describe a loss in activities, as opposed to a loss of elementary functions, and is consistent with World Health Organization definitions of impairment, disability, and handicap. There is no doubt that ADL outcomes are required in therapeutic drug studies on vascular dementia, and there is a good rationale and some evidence for the use of ADL scales developed for therapeutic research in Alzheimer disease, favoring scales devoid of items sensitive to physical disabilities. Similarly, ADL-related clinical milestones could be used for longer-term studies aiming predominantly at slowing progression of disease in both early and later stages of dementia. Slower decline in ADL and delay in reaching ADL-related clinical milestones should be considered as valid outcomes by regulatory bodies in the process of dementia drug approval.",

In the Alzheimer disease membranes from hippocampus, the density of total Gαo and all three subtype forms was not changed significantly when compared with control values. There were statistically significant alterations in Gαo in cortical membranes from Alzheimer disease when compared with controls. The density of Gαo1 was decreased by approximately 85%, density of Gαo3 was decreased by approximately 95%, and total Gαo density was decreased by approximately 84% of control value. However, Gαo2 density was decreased by approximately 44% but was found not to be statistically different from controls.",

    "abstract": "The objective was to determine the prevalence of screening for cognitive impairment and its effect on diagnosis and management of cognitive impairment in a long-term care setting, especially in comparison to depressive and behavioral symptoms. The study was a prospective cohort study of medical records of 60 patients admitted to the 120 bed Veterans Administration Nursing Home in San Francisco. Screening was determined by documented results on the Mini-Mental Status Examination, Geriatric Depression Scale, and Minimum Data Set. Diagnosis and management were determined by review of medical records for provider documentation. Strategies for management were broad, including interventions such as pharmacological therapy, education, behavioral strategies, or caregiver interventions. Screening was conducted routinely for cognitive impairment (95%), depressive symptoms (95%), and behavioral symptoms (85%). Cognitive status was uncertain in 8 patients; 23 (44%) met criteria for cognitive impairment. Twelve (52%) had a differential diagnosis of cognitive impairment and 11 (48%) had evidence of strategies for management. Depressive and behavioral symptoms were equally or almost as common as cognitive impairment (44% and 25%, respectively), but evidence of a management plan was more frequently present (80% and 100%; p = 0.002 vs. with cognitive impairment). Although depressive and behavioral symptoms were frequently diagnosed and interventions initiated, the diagnosis and management of cognitive impairment were often imprecise or absent. Further research is needed to identify barriers to diagnosis and management so that greater numbers of patients can benefit from recommended strategies.",

Coupled with protective stay at home guidelines, clinical research at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ISMMS ADRC) needed to quickly adapt to remain operational and maintain our cohort of research participants. Data collected by the ISMMS ADRC as well as from other National Institute on Aging (NIA) Alzheimer Disease centers, follows the guidance of the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC). However, at the start of this pandemic, NACC had no alternative data collection mechanisms that could accommodate these safety guidelines. To stay in touch with our cohort and to ensure continued data collection under different stages of quarantine, the ISMMS ADRC redeployed their work force to continue their observational study via telehealth assessment. On the basis of this experience and that of other centers, NACC was able to create a data collection process to accommodate remote assessment in mid-August. Here we review our experience in filling the gap during this period of isolation and describe the adaptations for clinical research, which informed the national dialog for conducting dementia research in the age of COVID-19 and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Patients with Alzheimer disease dementia (ADD) often show impaired orientation and navigation. Signage offers an opportunity to compensate for these deficits, communicate information efficiently and facilitate wayfinding. Certain properties of signs such as colors and contrasts may beneficially affect the uptake and processing of information particularly in ADD patients. Methods: Thirty-six healthy older adults and 30 ADD patients performed a computerized color perception task that required discriminating different color combinations. The effects of different contrast features on performance accuracy and speed in the 2 experimental groups were examined by nonparametric mixed analysis of variances. Results: Analyses revealed a significant effect of contrast polarity on reaction times, significant effects of group on reaction times and errors as well as a marginally significant interaction of group×color on errors. All participants benefitted from positive contrast polarity (ie, dark target on lighter background) as indicated by increased performance speed. Furthermore, ADD patients reacted slower and less accurate than healthy controls, but showed higher accuracy at black-white and red-yellow than at blue-green color combinations. Conclusions: Our findings suggest the implementation of signs with positive contrast polarity to ensure faster reactions. In addition, certain color combinations may enhance accuracy, particularly in patients with ADD.",

However, longitudinal change in self-reported spatial navigation ability in preclinical AD has yet to be examined. The current study examined whether AD biomarkers suggestive of preclinical AD at baseline spatial navigation assessment and APOE genotype predicted decline in self-reported spatial navigation ability and whether APOE genotype moderated the association of AD biomarkers with change in self-reported spatial navigation. Clinically normal (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale=0) adults aged 56 to 90 completed the Santa Barbara Sense of Direction Scale (SBSOD) annually for an average of 2.73 years. Biomarker data was collected within +/−2 years of baseline (ie, cerebrospinal fluid Aβ 42 , p-tau 181 , p-tau 181 /Aβ 42 ratio, positron emission tomography imaging with Florbetapir or Pittsburgh Compound-B, and hippocampal volume). APOE genotyping was obtained for all participants. SBSOD demonstrated a nonsignificant trend toward a decline over time ( P =0.082). AD biomarkers did not predict change in self-reported spatial navigation (all P s&gt;0.163). APOE genotype did not moderate the relationship between AD biomarkers and self-reported spatial navigation in planned analyses (all P s&gt;0.222). Results suggest that self-reported spatial navigation ability, as estimated with the SBSOD, may be limited as a measure of subtle cognitive change in the preclinical stage of AD.",

    "abstract": "A recent study has shown that optokinetic stimulation (OKS) can induce attentional distractibility in Alzheimer disease (AD). In this study, we investigated whether OKS also perturbs balanced attentional deficit in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a prodromal phase of AD, and explored whether the effects of OKS at baseline differ between aMCI patients who convert to AD at follow-up (converters) and those who do not (nonconverters). A total of 44 patients with aMCI, 14 patients with subcortical vascular mild cognitive impairment (svMCI), and 35 age-matched and education-matched normal controls were studied for their ability to bisect solid lines superimposed on a background of OKS. Background OKS movements were either leftward or rightward, or were stationary. A total of 33 of the 44 patients with aMCI were clinically followed for an average of 2.8 years, of which there were 15 converters and 18 nonconverters. Under both the leftward and rightward movement conditions, the magnitudes of line bisection errors (LBEs) in aMCI patients were greater than in normal controls. However, there were no differences in LBEs between svMCI patients and normal controls or between aMCI and svMCI patients. Baseline LBEs of aMCI converters were significantly greater than those of nonconverters in both leftward and rightward movement conditions. These results may indicate that OKS is useful for detecting AD at a very early stage and for predicting the conversion of aMCI to AD.",

Methods: Participants were healthy at-risk relatives from families with at least one affected patient, in whom a disease-associated genetic variant had been ascertained. A comprehensive psychological assessment (personality, anxiety and depression, quality of life, coping strategies, resilience and health-related beliefs) was administered at baseline, at 6 months and 12 months follow-up. Results: Twenty-four participants from 13 families were included. Sixteen participants underwent blood sampling and genetic analysis; 6 resulted to be carriers of pathogenic variants (1 in PSEN1 , 1 in PSEN2 , 4 in GRN ). Carriers showed higher score on the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) – social competence, and on Multidimensional Health Locus of Control – internal, than noncarriers ( P =0.03 for both). Ten at-risk relatives who completed the follow-up showed improvement in RSA – planned future ( P =0.01) with respect to baseline. Discussion: Our case series showed that at-risk individuals undergoing predictive testing showed benefit on personal life and no detrimental impact on a broad range of psychological outcomes. Higher social skills and lower internal health locus of control in carriers may be an early psychological correlate of preclinical dementia.",

Questionnaires assessed SCD, depressive symptoms, and age perceptions (essentialist aging beliefs, subjective age, age group identification, and explicit/implicit age stereotypes). Cognitive functioning was measured with a semantic interference and learning task.SCD was correlated with essentialist aging beliefs, age identification, and depressive symptoms [ rrange =0.18 to 0.22, Prange =0.009 to 0.02, confidence interval (CI) range =0.00-0.39]. Essentialist aging beliefs were correlated with subjective age and age group identification ( rrange =0.22 to 0.42, Prange <0.001 to 0.003, CI range =0.08-0.57). Both age group identification and essentialism were correlated with depressive symptoms ( rrange =0.22, Prange =0.009 to 0.01, CI range =0.04-0.39). In the adjusted regression model including depressive symptoms, age perceptions, and SCD, only SCD was associated with cognition ( b =-0.31, P <0.001).Although correlated with SCD, perceptions of aging do not explain the relationship between SCD and performance on a sensitive cognitive test among older adults.",

Our objective was to examine baseline neuropsychological indicators that could discriminate between stable SCD Versus progression toward an NCD. We retrospectively included patients consulting for SCD at a university medical center’s memory center (Amiens, France) who had undergone 3 or more neuropsychological assessments. Among the 80 patients with SCD, 11 had progressed to an NCD. The combination of age, memory, and speed scores at the baseline assessment predicted the progression of SCD with a sensitivity of 91%, and a negative predictive value of 98%. The present results constitute a first step (pending prospective studies) toward helping physicians to identify cases of SCD at risk of progression and, in particular, identifying patients with SCD who will not progress by examining baseline neuropsychological indicators.

Methods: Latent class analysis and multivariable regression were applied to data on 266 caregivers of community-dwelling Singaporean older adults, aged 60 years and above, with cognitive impairment who participated in a community-based dementia care study in 2018. Results: Three unique types of caregiving experience were identified: satisfied (low burden and high benefits; 54% of caregivers), dissatisfied (low burden and low benefits; 35%), and intensive (high burden and high benefits; 11%). Met needs were positively associated with satisfied caregiving experience (vs. dissatisfied caregiving experience), and both met and unmet needs were positively associated with intensive caregiving experience (vs. dissatisfied caregiving experience). Specifically, caregivers tended to have satisfied caregiving experience if older adults’ care needs in daytime activities or mobility were met. Discussion: Fulfillment of unmet needs of older adults with cognitive impairment is associated with a satisfied caregiver experience characterized by lower caregiver burden and greater caregiver benefits. Identification of and tailored interventions for unmet care needs of older adults will likely promote satisfied caregiving experience.",

We aimed to investigate the association between ICS and brain Aβ and their independent and joint associations with cognition. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 185 patients recruited from a memory clinic. ICS was measured on 3-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography and defined as stenosis ≥50%. Brain Aβ was measured with [ 11 C] Pittsburgh compound B–positron emission tomography imaging. Cognition was assessed with a locally validated neuropsychological battery. Results: A total of 17 (9.2%) patients had ICS, and the mean standardized uptake value ratio was 1.4 (±0.4 SD). ICS was not significantly associated with brain Aβ deposition. ICS was significantly associated with worse global cognition (β: −1.26, 95% CI: −2.25; −0.28, P =0.013), executive function (β: −1.04, 95% CI: −1.86; −0.22, P =0.015) and visuospatial function (β: −1.29, 95% CI: −2.30; −0.27, P =0.015). Moreover, in ICS patients without dementia (n=8), the presence of Aβ was associated with worse performance on visuomotor speed. Conclusions: ICS was significantly associated with worse cognition and showed interaction with brain Aβ such that patients with both pathologies performed worse on visuomotor speed specifically in those without dementia. Further studies may clarify if ICS and brain Aβ deposition indeed have a synergistic association with cognition.",

We wished to determine the responsive pattern of DAT patients to neurohormonal and pharmacologic probes affecting growth hormone (GH) release through an interaction with hypothalamic cholinergic and somatostatineergic (SS) neurons. In 10 DAT patients, pyridostigmine (120 mg orally, p.o.), an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, induced an increase in GH levels similar to that elicited by the drug in age-matched controls. In 9 DAT patients, administration of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH, 1 μg/kg body weight, intravenously, i.v.) induced an increase in plasma GH not different from that evidenced in control subjects. In DAT patients the GHRH-induced GH increase was completely inhibited by pretreatment with atropine (1 mg intramuscularly, i.m., 15 min before administration of GHRH). These findings are considered to indicate that in DAT patients, hypothalamic cholinergic and somatostatinergic neurons involved in control of somatotropic function are preserved.",

These ALT elevations have usually been mild but have exceeded 20 times the upper limit of normal in 2% of patients enrolled in controlled clinical trials of tacrine. No deaths have been linked to tacrine hepatotoxicity to date. There is no reliable method for determining which patients are at risk of severe hepatotoxicity before starting treatment, and no clear symptoms may manifest until liver injury is severe. Therefore, serum ALT levels must be monitored in all patients receiving tacrine therapy. Under currently recommended guidelines, serum ALT levels should be monitored weekly for at least 18 weeks after tacrine therapy is commenced, and for a minimum of 6 weeks after any increase in dosage. Approximately 88% of patients who discontinued tacrine therapy due to elevated ALT levels and who were subsequently rechallenged with tacrine were able to tolerate long-term tacrine therapy.",

ALCAR seems to exert a number of central nervous system (CNS)–related effects, even though a clear pharmacological action that could explain clinical results in AD has not been identified yet. The aim of this study was to determine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biological correlates of ALCAR effects in AD after a short-term, high-dose, intravenous, open treatment. Results show that ALCAR CSF levels achieved under treatment were significantly higher than the ones at baseline, reflecting a good penetration through the blood–brain barrier and thus a direct CNS challenge. ALCAR treatment produced no apparent change on CSF classic neurotransmitters and their metabolite levels (homovanillic acid, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, MHPG, dopamine, choline). Among CSF peptides, while corticotropin-releasing hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone remained unchanged, β-endorphins significantly decreased after treatment; plasma cortisol levels matched this reduction. Since both CSF β-endorphins and plasma cortisol decreased, one possible explanation is that ALCAR reduced the AD-dependent hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenocortical (HPA) axis hyperactivity. At present, no clear explanation can be proposed for the specific mechanism of this action.",

One model for informed consent for dementia research would be to obtain consent in advance of the loss of decision-making capacity, perhaps using written advance directives similar to those used for clinical decisions on life-sustaining treatments. This article examines the advance consent model, contrasts the life-sustaining treatment arena with dementia research issues, and suggests that written advance consent should not be required to conduct dementia research.

    "abstract": "Whereas early-onset Alzheimer disease (AD; usually onset at age < 50 years) has been defined with genetic mutation on chromosomes 1, 14, and 21, the degree of familial contribution to late-onset AD is unclear. Further, it is uncertain if subgroups of late-onset AD exist. To examine the influence of familial factors as a function of age in late-onset AD we investigated lifetime risks and age-specific hazard rates of AD-like illness among late-onset AD probands' and controls' first-degree relatives, using questionnaires and medical records. As part of a longitudinal study on aging and AD, we studied 78 AD probands with age of onset > or =50 years (28 \"definite\" and 50 \"probable\" AD according to NINCDS/ADRDA criteria) and 101 healthy old controls seen since 1981. Both probands and controls were screened rigorously with medical tests and brain imaging and seen regularly until autopsy. Multiple informants and medical records were used for first-degree relatives. Among first-degree relatives, 49 secondary cases of AD-like illness were found for the AD probands' relatives (391 relatives 40 years old or older) compared with 20 cases among controls' relatives (456 relatives 40 years old or older). Relatives of AD probands had a significantly increased lifetime risk of AD-like illness of 52.8+/-11.4% by age 94 years compared with a lifetime risk in relatives of controls of 22.1+/-5.8% by age 90 years. Age-specific hazard rates in relatives of AD probands increased until the 75-79-year age interval and then decreased; in contrast the age-specific hazard rates increased in relatives of controls after the 80-84-year age interval. To determine if a dividing line exist among late-onset AD, several cutoff ages were used in our study to compare cumulative risk curves of AD-like illness between relatives of late-onset probands and relatives of late-late-onset probands. Differences in the pattern of cumulative incidence of AD in relatives showed that 67-71 years is the range for a dividing line between late- and late-late-onset AD. Age-specific hazard rates of AD in relatives supported a difference between late- and late-late-onset. Whereas these rates increased until the 75-79-year age interval and then decreased in late-onset AD, the rates began increasing after the 65-69-year age interval and through the oldest age interval in both late-late-onset AD and control groups. Our results support the concept that familial factors exist in late-onset AD and that different familial factors may exist in late-onset AD subgroups.",

However, VaD can be viewed as being one of the many possible consequences of cerebrovascular diseases, so that there is more to expect from secondary prevention strategies for VaD than for AD (in which both the etiology and the pathophysiological mechanisms are largely unknown). So it seems logical to put more emphasis on the stabilization of the symptoms of VaD, by preventing progression or recurrence insofar as the vascular risk factors for VaD can often be identified and controlled, than in attempting to improve the existing clinical manifestations of established vascular brain damage. Even if purely symptomatic drugs are developed to improve the symptoms of VaD, they will have to be studied in the context of a tight control of existing vascular risk factors. For secondary prevention, trials of at least 1 year seem advisable.",

An observation of an elder with Alzheimer disease sets the scene for thinking about ways to explore, describe, and interpret human experiences and the context within which these experiences are perceived. The philosophical assumptions and standards for qualitative research methods are discussed. Two of the qualitative research approaches (ethnography and grounded theory) are presented using examples from published studies to illustrate the logical consistency of fit between purpose statement, data collection strategies, analysis structures, and results specific to the language, and guidelines and rules for each of these two approaches. Practical issues of data management, including the availability of qualitative computer packages and publication, are addressed briefly.",

    "abstract": "The dementia of Alzheimer disease (AD) correlates with the deposition of extracellular amyloid, and this amyloid arises from the abnormal processing of a high molecular weight amyloid peptide precursor (APP), which is a normal cellular protein that is found in both brain and in peripheral tissues in humans. Overproduction of the APP in AD could cause increased concentrations of this protein in either human blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, thus far no direct demonstration of soluble APP in human blood has been possible, owing to poor assay sensitivity and interfering plasma proteins. These two problems were eliminated with the present development of an extracting two-site immunoradiometric assay (IRMA). Two rabbit polyclonal antisera were prepared reacting to two different sites (amino acids 161–180 and 597–624) of the APP molecule. The near N-terminal antiserum (anti-APP 161–180) was covalently coupled to a solid phase support and the near C-terminal directed antiserum (anti-APP 597–624) was indirectly labeled using 125labeled near C-terminal synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 597–624. The IRMA was validated by partial purification of the APP from human serum and demonstration of the protein's molecular weight (112 kDa) by Western immunoblot procedures. Results of the IRMA showed that the APP is present in human plasma (mean ± SE concentration=32 ± 6 pM, n=25), and there was no significant difference in the APP concentration in 25 controls, 19 patients with AD, and 10 individuals with Down syndrome (DS). Immunoreactive APP was generally not detectable in control or AD CSF volumes as large as 1 ml. In conclusion, these studies provide the first demonstration of the presence of APP in human blood that is immunoreactive with an antiserum directed against the amyloidotic portion (i.e., amino acids 597–624) of the APP molecule. In addition, these studies show that soluble APP is present in human blood, but that its concentration is not increased in AD.",

Alzheimer disease (AD) and related dementias pose a particular challenge for families, care providers, and researchers because of the nature of the illness. Naturally, those at potential risk of developing the disease are eager for scientists to develop valid predictive tests for the disease. Alzheimer organizations have developed worldwide in response to the growing awareness and knowledge of the effects of dementia on individuals and their families. These organizations have played a role in advocating for research, increasing general awareness of the nature of the disease, and lobbying for more services for persons with dementia and their families. These organizations have also realized the increasing concern about the many ethical issues that arise in caring for those with AD and researching causes and cures. This paper describes a unique process one national Alzheimer society used to develop an Ethics Task Force to provide guidelines on ethical issues.",

    "abstract": "A large 10-generation family with late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) inherited as an autosomal dominant trait was evaluated historically, clinically, and genetically. The family origin was traced to a founder couple of French ancestry with approximately 3,000 descendants. Although the transmission of a genetic predisposition to LOAD is demonstrated through male individuals, a predominance of affected women is observed. Currently, 14 individuals, 12 of whom are women, are classified as affected with Alzheimer disease (AD). Among the affected, the age of onset ranged from 55 to 78 years. Geno-typing of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) locus demonstrated that homozygotes for the E4 allele (APOE4) developed signs of AD in their late 60s, whereas affected heterozygotes presented with the disease in their 70s. A significantly higher APOE4 frequency was observed in affected family members than in those unaffected (0.79 vs. 0.25, X2 = 9.919, p = 0.0016, df = 1). Survival for more than 15 years after diagnosed onset was observed in a number of those affected and can be attributed to an improved environment, including excellent care and management during the disabling phase of illness. Alternatively, it may be an example of the genetic heterogeneity in AD. Complete documentation of large families such as the one presented will facilitate the discovery of the multiple genetic factors involved in the pathogenesis of AD.",

These measures were obtained for 31 probable DAT patients and 31 age- and education-matched controls using a set of six newly constructed cognitive scales designed to provide reliable measurement in both patient and control groups. A measure assessing similarity to the average performance of the controls provided perfect separation of the patient and control groups. A measure assessing similarity to the average performance of the probable DAT patients identified up to four atypical cases of probable DAT. One of these four cases has come to autopsy and was found to have Pick disease. The cognitive profiles of this Pick patient and an autopsy-confirmed DAT patient are compared to illustrate the potential advantages of using DAT patients as the reference group for profile analysis.",

    "abstract": "The rapid pace of neurobiology research has increased the prospects of developing drugs to prevent neurodegenerative disorders. Although the goal of delaying the onset of brain disorders may be within the grasp of modern medicine, there are several critical barriers to progress. Among these is the lack of appropriate models and modeling systems for specific neurodegenerative diseases. Traditionally, in drug discovery, testing, and development, a combination of models is used. These include in vitro, in vivo, transgenic, and other animal models. However, each of these models has limitations. In this article, the author advocates the use of “in silico” modeling systems, which could complement currently available models and enable investigators to simulate alternative strategies to modulate neural function in a dynamic interactive mode. Advances in computer technology, including increasing speed and memory, and ready access to parallel processing systems have made it easier for investigators to develop databases for computer abstractions of neural function and dysfunction and to begin to develop prototypes for use in complex systems modeling environments. Multimodeling systems have been widely used in other areas of science to study emergent behavior of complex systems, such as the impact of atmospheric changes on weather, flight patterns of birds in a flock, and the behavior of traders in a commodities market. Adoption of such approaches should increase understanding of the complexities of signal transduction pathways in neural networks and accelerate the drug discovery process.",

As a result, such a development program must meet regulatory requirements for all countries in which approval for the new drug will be sought. Barriers to Alzheimer disease (AD) drug discovery and development in the pharmaceutical industry can be categorized as (1) regulatory, (2) logistical, and (3) drug development issues. Some of the regulatory barriers could be overcome by international harmonization of guidelines for the development of antidementia drugs. The logistical issues can be reduced through international collaboration in the conduct of clinical studies, and the developmental issues can be addressed by using an expedited drug development plan that not only can reduce the time but also the resources required to develop the drug.",

Repeated observations over the complete course of the disease are necessary to quantitatively evaluate hypotheses such as the triphasic linear model of Brooks et al. (1993). The goal of this study is to compare the triphasic linear and quadratic models of decline in a group of 12 AD patients confirmed at autopsy with a group of age- and sex-matched normal control subjects. Both groups were taken from the University of Western Ontario Dementia Study, and the Extended Scale for Dementia was used as the outcome measure. The squared multiple correlation as a measure of goodness of fit suggested the superiority of the more parsimonious quadratic model over the triphasic linear model. Quantitative models more accurately reflect the profiles of change in AD and may prove more sensitive in measuring the effects of drugs on these patterns.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuropathological hallmarks including deposits of the beta-amyloid peptide (AssP). Studies have shown that immunization with Abeta42 peptide reduces both the spatial memory impairments and Alzheimer disease-like neuropathologic changes in Alzheimer disease transgenic mice, but can cause side effect of a cell-mediated autoimmune meningoencephalitis. Recently, some studies showed that DNA vaccination could be used to generate an antibody response to Abeta without the adverse cell-mediated immune effect. In the current study, we generate four DNA vaccine plasmids (pV-GE1, pV-GE2, pV-GE3, and pV-GE4) against Alzheimer disease by separately fusing Abeta epitope sequences (coding for EFGH, DAEFGH, EFGH+EFGH, and EFGH+DAEFGH) with IgG heavy chain coding region of mouse. Meanwhile, the full-length gene Abeta encoding plasmid (pV-Abeta), empty vector (pVAX) and synthetic AssP were also included as control. The sera of BALB/c mice immunized via intramuscular with plasmids and peptide were tested by indirect ELISA for auto-AssP immunoreactivity. The results showed that all the DNA vaccine plasmids induced AssP-specific antibodies; moreover pV-GE2 and pV-Abeta constructs elicited higher antibody titers than other constructs (P < 0.05). To further enhance the immune response, GM-CSF encoding plasmid (pGM-CSF) and purified BCG-DNA were used as molecular adjuvants. BCG-DNA could enhance humoral and cellular immune responses simultaneously and did not alter the phenotype of the immune responses, whereas pGM-CSF showed no obvious effect on immune response. These results suggest that this immunization strategy of using Abeta epitope encoding plasmid plus BCG-DNA adjuvant may serve as the basis for developing anti-Alzheimer disease vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Background: Linear models cannot capture nonlinear associations when the relationships between cognition and risk factors vary across risk levels. We demonstrate a method of modelling nonlinear associations using the example of blood pressure (BP) and memory. Methods: We measured memory and BP (in mm Hg) annually for 10 years in a population-based cohort (N=1982) aged 65+. We evaluated the relationship between BP and memory at the same time points using both linear mixed models and generalized additive mixed models with smoothing splines, adjusting for relevant covariates. Results: Linear mixed models found no significant associations. Generalized additive mixed models detected different associations between BP and memory across baseline BP categories (normotensive, hypertensive, hypotensive). Among normotensives, systolic blood pressure (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) around 140/80 was associated with the highest, while SBP/DBP around 110/60 was associated with the lowest, predicted memory scores. Among hypertensives, SBP/DBP around 130/85 was associated with the highest, while SBP/DBP around 150/65 was associated with the lowest, predicted memory scores. Among hypotensives, no significant association was found. Among both normotensives and hypertensives, a DBP &gt;75 was associated with better memory. Conclusions: By modelling nonlinear associations, we showed that the relationship between BP and memory performance varied by baseline BP among normotensives and hypertensives.",

This matched case-control study examined whether nongenetic risk factors cluster together, to inform targeted prevention efforts. Methods: Ninety-six participants with non–autosomal-dominant degenerative and/or vascular YOD and 175 controls were recruited to 2 Australian epidemiological studies. Risk exposure was retrospectively self-reported and/or informant-reported. Results: Each additional exposure increased the risk for YOD, though only where vascular dementia was included in the analysis. Cluster analysis identified 4 risk groups, one of which reported a high probability of exposure to all risks and a significantly higher risk for YOD. Discussion: Results suggest that combinations of nongenetic risk factors confer more risk for young onset vascular dementia, and possibly primary degenerative YOD, than a single factor on its own. Compared with their same-age peers, some people with YOD experience a lifetime of risk exposure starting from early in life.",

Herein we describe a 71-year old male who presented with an atypical dementia syndrome including years of stability after an initial abrupt decline, marked visuospatial dysfunction, and relative sparing of memory. CSF biomarkers combined with the pattern of cognitive symptoms made AD unlikely and were consistent with DLB. This classification was confirmed clinically, with the emergence of classic DLB symptoms, and at postmortem pathologic examination. This case highlights the role for AD CSF biomarkers in facilitating earlier diagnosis of non-Alzheimer neurodegenerative dementias.",

We report the case of an 83-year-old woman with advanced Alzheimer disease who had recently used nortriptyline and sertraline and was admitted with chest pain. An electrocardiogram showed ST-elevation, and markers of myocardial necrosis were slightly increased. However, coronariography did not demonstrate stenotic lesions. Transthoracic echocardiography and ventriculography identified decreased ventricular function, apical akinesia, and compensatory hyperkinesia of other segments that were compatible with TC. The patient evolved with cardiogenic shock and died. Alzheimer patients may be more susceptible to develop TC, both because of the disease itself and because of the multiple medications they are exposed to that increase catecholamine levels. In this case, antidepressant drugs were considered to be a potential factor that enhanced the susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: African Americans (AA) are disproportionately affected by Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias yet are under-represented in clinical research. Outreach events for AA are offered to encourage research participation; however, this approach’s effectiveness remains largely unexplored. Methods: To explore the effectiveness of AA-focused versus general audience events, the authors examined attendance data over 5 years, encompassing 10 general audience events and 4 events focused on AA. For each individual, the authors searched center records for recruitment contacts and research enrollment. Summary scores for attendance at AA-focused events, general audience events, and total events were compared between those with and without research involvement. Results: Out of 773 unique AA that attended ≥1 event, 88 became or were involved in research (11.4% engagement). AA-focused events achieved greater AA attendance than general audience events. Although research-engaged individuals were more likely to have ever attended an AA-focused event than a general audience event, attendance at AA-focused events did not statistically relate to research engagement. In contrast, attendance at events focused on the general public was related to an increased likelihood of research participation. Discussion: These findings have important implications for designing and implementing community events to encourage AA research participation.",

Measurements were adjusted for age and head size. The AD patients had wider third and lateral ventricles as well as larger temporal horns and Sylvian fissures compared with controls. Cortical atrophy tended also to be more pronounced for AD patients relative to controls. Thus measures of central and temporal atrophy clearly distinguished AD patients from normal aged individuals. In AD patients, the width of the third ventricle was significantly correlated with the choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in the post-mortem frontal cortex (r = 0.65, p = 0.005) and in the temporal cortex (r = 0.59, p = 0.006). CT measures did not correlate significantly with neurofibrillary tangle or senile plaque scores. The result suggests that the width of the third ventricle better reflects the degree of cholinergic deficit than severity of histopathological changes, scores of plaques, and tangles in AD.",

To understand better this type of memory loss, the effects of familiarity and temporal organization on memory for event schemas was investigated in college students, elderly controls, and individuals with AD. Participants were asked to read short stories describing common activities. Both recall and recognition memory were assessed immediately after reading the story. The number of items correctly remembered and the error types were recorded and analyzed. Both familiarity and temporal organization were found to play a role in memory for event schemas. All groups remembered the most information when the stories were familiar and sequentially organized. Elderly participants were more likely to remember items associated with, but included in, the stories than were the other groups. The AD group was the only group to recall or recognize items not associated with the story. It was concluded that event schema memory in AD participants is moderated by the same factors that influence memory in healthy young and elderly participants. These results suggest that individuals with AD will be best able to perform common everyday activities when they are familiar and when daily activities follow a predictable sequential pattern.",

Forty-seven percent of these patients met NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD, and 29% met NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for possible AD. The majority of the probable AD patients were women, and many were suffering from comorbid medical illnesses. In the probable AD patients, there was an association between higher levels of education and a higher frequency of affective symptoms, and an association between longer duration of cognitive symptoms and the presence of parkinsonism. Possible AD was also common in this sample of demented black outpatients and was often encountered mixed with vascular dementia.",

    "abstract": "In cases of Alzheimer's presenile and senile dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT), respectively, we have observed, in addition to the gray matter degeneration, a lesion that has the character of an incomplete infarction confined to the white matter. It is encountered in 60% of both groups, with mild changes in two thirds and moderate or severe changes in one third. It involves the deep white matter symmetrically, tapering off toward the cortex. It is characterized by partial loss of myelin, axons, and oligodendroglial cells; mild reactive astrocytic gliosis; and sparsely distributed macrophages as well as stenosis resulting from hyaline fibrosis of arterioles and smaller vessels. No complete or cavitating infarctions and no hypertensive vascular changes were observed. The white matter changes are thought to be due to hypoperfusion of the concerned white matter territories since, in addition to the white matter hyaline vascular stenosis, these cases show signs of cardiovascular disease, usually with hypotension. The white matter disorder also occurs independent of the gray matter process of AD and SDAT and may be seen as the sole brain lesion in non-AD subjects. Its occurrence is thus neither regularly related to the severity nor to the regional appearance and accentuation of the cortical Alzheimer process and is thus not likely to be just the result of a wallerian degeneration. Histologically it is similar in several respects to Binswanger's disease, although with some distinct differences. It is thus related to the cerebrovascular group of disorders in addition to AD and SDAT. In view of its frequency and severity, this white matter lesion is important to define, to diagnose, and ultimately to prevent or cure.",

    "abstract": "Part of the challenge in research on degenerative neurologic disease relates to distinguishing those measurements that essentially describe patient characteristics stable across the course of illness (traits) from those that vary systematically within subjects (states), particularly those specifically related to stage or duration of illness. A components-of-variance approach was used to examine the state versus trait aspects of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) Cognitive and Noncognitive subscales, a clinical instrument frequently used in research on Alzheimer disease. Subjects were 190 patients with probable AD followed longitudinally. Stage of illness was indexed by mental status scores. Analysis of variance was used to partition total variance into that associated with subjects (trait), stages (state: stage), subjects × stages (state: other), and error. ADAS Cognitive scores were strongly related to stage of illness (83% of true variance). ADAS Noncognitive scores were modestly related to stage (approximately 21% of true variance) and moderately related to state: other (47%). We discuss how state–trait analyses can be helpful in focusing attention on those areas of assessment most likely to accomplish specific objectives.",

    "abstract": "Background and Purpose The effect of different diagnostic criteria for detecting dementia in both epidemiological and stroke cohort studies has been shown, but comparison between different assessment methods has only seldom been done. We compared both assessment methods and diagnostic criteria for dementia in a large well-defined stroke cohort. Subject and Methods A group of 227 of 486 patients aged 55 to 85 years who 3 months after ischemic stroke completed a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery, structured clinical mental status examination of defined cognitive domains with expanded Mini-Mental State Examination. The criteria for dementia were those of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III, DSM-III-R) and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Associated Internationale pour la Reserche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN). Results The main differences between clinical and neuropsychological examinations were seen in memory functions: clinically 24.7% and neuropsychologically 54.2% had impairment in short-term memory and 10.4% versus 5.3% in long-term memory. Accordingly, the prevalence of dementia varied greatly: It was clinically 14.1% by DSM-III, 9.7% by DSM-III-R and 8.4% by NINDS-AIREN criteria. The corresponding frequencies based on neuropsychological evaluation were 27.3%, 4.0% and 25.6%. Between these 3 diagnostic criteria the concordance varied in clinical testing between 59.4%-68.8% (kappa 0.72–0.79) and in neuropsychological testing between 14.5%–81.1% (kappa 0.20–0.86). The concordance between clinical and neuropsychological testing was 56.8% (kappa 0.42) by DSM-III , 31.6% (kappa 0.35) by DSM-III-R and 25.5% (kappa 0.24) by NINDS-AIREN. Conclusions The frequency of poststroke dementia and cognitive decline varied sharply when different systems of diagnostic classification and methods were used. This may have serious influences on investigation and treatment of patients. We underline the importance of further debate and studies to refine the categories of cognitive impairment used in the setting of CVD.",

We have used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, immunoblots, and immunohistochemistry, together with appropriate controls, to show that BR88 does not cross-react with tau. This contradicts the claim in question and confirms our previous findings in which BR88 was used to show that some tangle-bearing cells displayed the N-terminus of beta/A4 on their surfaces.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this commentary is briefly to review the genetic, social, demographic, and environmental factors associated with Alzheimer disease with the specific purpose of planning an intervention to prevent or possibly delay the onset of disease. Complex disorders such as Alzheimer disease are the result of one or more genes and other contributing risk factors. For example, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes can indicate a degree of susceptibility, but the gene is neither \"necessary nor sufficient\" to cause the disease. Thus, many potential risk factors remain to be identified. The association between Alzheimer disease and APOE also varies with age, genetic background, and ethnic group. While the use of APOE genotyping has provided a method to identify individuals at greatest risk of Alzheimer disease, how other factors modify the degrees of the APOE-related risk needs to be further investigated. Moreover, the effect of APOE on disease course and various noncognitive manifestations warrant scrutiny. Because risk prediction is not straightforward, practical issues related to developing a national strategy to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer disease require careful consideration, planning, and an organized interdisciplinary effort.",

Three blood samples were taken at 10-15 day intervals. Serum alpha 1-ACT levels from first and second serum samples were elevated in one out of 11 I-AD patients. Serpin serum levels from the third sample were increased in four out of 11 I-AD patients. None of these patients showed increased levels of other acute phase proteins measured in the three serum samples. VD patients did not show abnormal serum levels of alpha 1-ACT. Serum levels of alpha 1-ACT along with those of other acute phase proteins were altered in patients with inflammation. This investigation showed that in I-AD patients with increased alpha 1-ACT and no concomitant elevation of other acute phase proteins, serum levels of alpha 1-ACT varied with time. Based on our results, serum alpha 1-ACT does not appear to be a useful biomarker for clinical diagnosis of probable I-AD, but it might be associated with the clinical history of the disease.",

This report discusses the many societal, economic, logistical, and attitudinal barriers that have inhibited the participation of minority patients and their families in medical research programs of AD. Special consideration is given to the unique cultural issues that arise when conducting studies involving African-American elderly subjects. Methods are considered for overcoming the barriers to participation gleaned from the national study CERAD (Consortium to Establish a Registry of Alzheimer Disease) and other investigations of AD. Recommendations are made for future research programs targeted on the specific health care needs and concerns of the minority segments of our population.",

To date, little is known about parosmia in right-lateralized semantic variant primary progressive aphasia. A 60-year-old right-handed man presented with a 2-year history of parosmia and prosopagnosia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated severe atrophy of the right anterior and mesial temporal lobe, particularly in the fusiform cortex and the regions known as the primary olfactory cortex. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose position emission tomography showed asymmetric hypometabolism of the bilateral temporal lobes (right > left). We clinically diagnosed him with right-lateralized semantic variant primary progressive aphasia. As the right hemisphere is known to be more involved in the processing of pleasant odors than the left hemisphere, we speculate that the unique manifestation of parosmia observed in this patient might be associated with the lateralization of the olfactory system.",

This is the first report of 18 F-Florbetapir amyloid imaging findings in a 35-year-old male patient with EOAD carrying the G378E mutation in PSEN1 gene. Brain computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging scans showed remarkable cerebral atrophy with dilatation of the cerebrospinal fluid spaces; furthermore, a 18 F-Florbetapir PET/CT scan demonstrated also widespread remarkable accumulation of the amyloid tracer in the cerebral cortex, with reduction of the normal contrast between white and gray matter and flattening of the external cortical margins. Furthermore, PET/CT showed intense 18 F-florbetapir uptake in the striatum and in the thalamus bilaterally. Our case supports the usefulness of amyloid PET imaging in the diagnostic work-up of EOAD.",

Setting: This was a community setting. Participants: Age-stratified random population sample drawn from publicly available voter registration list. Design: Participants underwent assessments including cognitive testing and self-reported current and past driving status, instrumental activities of daily living, self-rated health, social supports, physical limitations, and depressive symptoms. We built multivariable logistic regression models to identify factors associated with never having driven, having ceased driving, and reporting difficulties while driving. Results: In the multivariable model, “never drivers” were more likely than “ever drivers” to be older, female, less educated and to leave home less frequently. Former drivers were significantly older, more likely to be women, have lower test performance in the cognitive domain of attention, have more instrumental activity of daily living difficulties, leave home less frequently and have visual field deficits in the right eye than current drivers. Current drivers with reported driving difficulties were more likely than those without difficulties to have lower test performance in attention but higher in memory, were more likely to report depressive symptoms and to have both vision and hearing loss. Conclusion: Age, female sex, marital status, and education appear to be associated with driving cessation. Cognitive and functional impairments, mood symptoms and physical health also seem to influence driving cessation and reduction. Our findings may have implications for clinicians in assessing and educating their patients and families on driving safety.",

Tests of verbal memory, processing speed, and verbal fluency and a composite global Z-score were used to assess cognitive performance longitudinally in a large (n=11,620) biracial cohort of older adults in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Neurocognitive Study from midlife to older age. Linear mixed models were used to estimate associations between the Ala12 allele and cognitive performance over 20 years of follow-up. Heterogeneity was present for rate of cognitive decline as measured by the global Z-score by race, sex, and Ala12 allele status (P=0.01 for 4-way interaction term: race×sex×time×Ala12 carrier status). Stratified analysis showed a significantly increased rate of global cognitive decline over the 20-year follow-up for carriers of the Ala12 allele compared with noncarriers among black male individuals (-0.92 SD decline vs. -0.57 SD; P=0.02) but not among black female, white male, or white female individuals. Decline in global cognitive function among black male Ala12 carriers was primarily driven by decline in verbal memory. Our data underscore the context-dependent association between the Pro12Ala polymorphism and cognitive decline, specifically race/ethnic background and sex.",

The objective was to determine the HMPAo SPECT hypoperfusion pattern in cognitively impaired patients with positive CSF AD biomarker and to evaluate its diagnostic accuracy. This study included 120 patients referred to a university memory clinic assessed using HMPAo SPECT, MRI, and CSF biomarkers. Three biomarker signatures suggestive of AD were analyzed (1, Aß1-42; 2, Aß1-42+t-tau and/or p-tau; 3, Aß1-42/p-tau). The clinical diagnoses were possible AD (n=29) or other causes of cognitive impairment (n=91). All CSF AD signatures were significantly (1, P =0.004; 2, P =0.017; 3, P =0.024) associated with the difference between inferior parietal perfusion and lateral dorsal frontal cortex perfusion. The hypoperfusion pattern discriminated between patients with positive CSF AD biomarkers and those with other cognitive impairments with a sensitivity of 67% to 71% and a specificity of 63% to 65% and a greatest negative predictive value (NPV) of 90%. Inferior parietal cortex hypoperfusion was the most sensitive and specific feature in AD patients diagnosed using clinical and CSF biomarker criteria. This hypoperfusion pattern was associated with an NPV of 90% and therefore discriminated sharply between AD and other cognitive disorders.",

A measure assessing similarity to the average performance of the controls provided perfect separation of the patient and control groups. A measure assessing similarity to the average performance of the probable DAT patients identified up to four atypical cases of probable DAT. One of these four cases has come to autopsy and was found to have Pick disease. The cognitive profiles of this Pick patient and an autopsy-confirmed DAT patient are compared to illustrate the potential advantages of using DAT patients as the reference group for profile analysis.",

Sixteen DAT patients and 16 normal elderly controls, matched for age and education, read 50 stimulus words presented individually on a cathode-ray tube. DAT patients exhibited a significantly greater cognitive impairment as shown by multivariate analysis of variance (p less than 0.0001). Canonical variate correlations revealed RT (0.961) to be more sensitive to decline in cognitive functioning in dementia than the measure of number of reading errors (0.559). Results confirm that RT is a highly sensitive measure of central nervous system integrity, which allows for a more refined investigation of a patient's cognitive deficit than is obtainable with traditional test measures. These findings suggest that chronometric measures should be incorporated in clinical and research studies attempting to document the existence and severity of cognitive impairment in neurodegenerative disease.",

The major target symptoms of brain metabolism enhancers are peripheral psychiatric symptoms (symptoms of the noncognitive type) of demented patients. A review of double-blind studies of major brain metabolism enhancers in Japan revealed that 60-70% of patients were better than slightly improved and 20-30% better than moderately improved in treatment of cerebrovascular disorders. In treatment of Alzheimer-type dementia, on the other hand, the better than slightly improved patients comprised 30-70% in mild to moderately demented cases. Severe cases of dementia showed a lower improvement rate. The incidence of side effects ranged from 4-9%. In our geriatric outpatient clinic, 72.5% of elderly demented patients (85% were mild-moderate dementia) exhibited better than a moderate improvement with combined psychopharmacotherapy, so far as peripheral psychiatric symptoms were concerned. Psychophysiological analysis of cases in terms of improvement of scores on Hasegawa's dementia scale strongly suggested that sporadic cases with cognitive improvement were brought about, at least secondary to improved vigilance, or with improved concentration and attention.",

    "abstract": "Summary: A conference was held in Brussels in November 1997 under the auspices of the International Working Group for Harmonization of Dementia Drug Guidelines. The meeting reviewed development of European Dementia Guidelines, with a focus on the roles of academics, industry, the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the European Medicines Evaluation Agency. The objectives of the meeting were to review progress in development of dementia drug guidelines across Europe, with particular reference to harmonization of these efforts with developments in other countries, particularly the United States and Japan. Specific topics covered included issues in developing trials to address disease progression, very mild disease, severe disease, and the non-Alzheimer dementias. Clinical trial designs and the types of measures chosen in these new areas are unlikely to be the same as those used in previous trials for symptomatic relief of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease. The assessment tools need to be specific for the purpose of the trial and ongoing research is still needed in this area. Little is known about the natural progression of disease based on the types of measures used in clinical trials. Evidence suggests that rates of decline are variable and non-linear. Improved collaboration between academics, industry personnel, and regulators, particularly through the sharing of placebo data sets, could allow considerable advances in our understanding of natural disease progression.",

The possible association of vascular disease with dementia may offer the best preventive high-risk approach. The identification of individuals with clinical and subclinical vascular disease is possible. There is a very high prevalence of subclinical cerebral infarction in older individuals. Specific treatments can prevent clinical disease such as stroke and coronary heart disease. Whether therapies will prevent some dementia can be determined.",

Given the current notion that there are different subtypes of vascular dementia according to pathophysiological mechanisms, it is reasonable to suspect that one of the main causes of the disappointing results was that the study samples included patients not fitting with the rationale of selective treatments. Testing this hypothesis is difficult because characterization of patients in relation to different subtypes of vascular dementia is not available for most studies. However, attempts are ongoing to reclassify patients entered in some trials for post hoc subgroup analyses with some preliminary interesting results. We propose that (1) specific subtypes of vascular dementia should be the target in any single trial using a treatment with a proper rationale; and (2) subcortical vascular dementia, caused by small vessel disease leading to lacunar infarcts and subcortical white matter changes, represents a clinically and radiologically well-defined entity to be considered for future trials designed specifically for testing adequate drugs.",

We provide some background for the IWG and for the study of its processes and focus on the construction of consensus and consensus statements of the constituent working groups of the IWG. We delineate a cultural ethos of cooperation that pushes scientists to agree even when they do not and to conceal disagreements. Our observations suggest that the consensus process may serve to inhibit or block the development of new ideas and solutions to problems by keeping conflicts hidden and different viewpoints masked. The masked ideas, although minority ideas, may contain much of importance for subsequent paradigm shifts in approaches to Alzheimer disease and other dementias. In subsequent reports, we will chronicle other aspects of the work of the IWG, including the nature of cross-cultural differences in the drug research structures and processes, governmental regulatory bodies, and the relationship of the pharmaceutical industry to clinical trials research. The present article adds some understanding of the IWG and its mission and contributes to the literature on the cultural construction and social organization of science.",

There were no significant differences in total CPT activity, its inhibition by malonyl-CoA, the effect of the detergent Triton X-100 on CPT activity, COT activity, and CAT activity in any of the brain regions examined, whether activities were expressed as grams of wet weight or corrected for noncollagen protein content. The addition of Triton X-100 increased CAT activity by 50%. Our results suggest that there is no defect of fatty acid transport within the AD brain cell. Total CPT activity, COT activity, and CAT activity are not affected in AD nor is the ratio of CPT I to CPT II altered in the AD versus the normal human brain.",

Although many Lewy bodies were unstained, a peripheral ring of positive immunoreactivity was frequently observed.

Since AD can be diagnosed with certainty only at autopsy, currently available epidemiological data are based on a presumed clinical diagnosis. Current data indicate that AD represents a major health problem, at least in the developed countries. The prevalence ratio for AD ranges between 1.9 and 5.8 cases per 100 population aged 65 and over. Moreover, its prevalence is likely to increase in the next twenty years as a consequence of current demographic trends. The prevalence ratio for AD increases steeply with age and is higher in females. Incidence rates show a similar pattern, suggesting that AD should not be subdivided in a presenile and a senile form based on age of onset alone. Annual incidence rates of 2.4 cases per 100,000 population between ages 40 and 60, and 127 cases per 100,000 population after age 60 have been reported. Several case-control studies show that the occurrence of either dementia or Down's syndrome in other family members, advanced age of the mother at subject's birth, and head injury are possible risk factors.",

Data from Phase III clinical trials have demonstrated that donepezil improves cognition, global function, and activities of daily living. In addition, there were no clinically significant treatmentrelated effects on vital signs or laboratory values in any trial. Adverse events, when present, were generally mild in intensity, transient, and resolved during continued treatment with donepezil. This favorable safety profile, together with its reported clinical benefits established donepezil as one standard of AD therapy. Vitamin E is one of two anti-oxidant therapies that may help to slow the progression of AD over at least a two-year period. One large-scale clinical trial suggests that it has sufficient benefit and safety to join donepezil as a current standard of AD therapy",

    "abstract": "Summary: The symptomatology of Alzheimer disease (AD), its longevity, and associated cost make it an extremely challenging disease for individuals, their families, health care, and social support systems. Moreover, the expanding aging population worldwide means that strategies to contain costs are an urgent priority. As the largest component of the direct costs of AD is due to the cost of institutionalization, cost-containment strategies have focused on ways to maintain the AD patient in the community for as long as possible. Disease severity is a strong predictor of institutionalization, and patients' cognitive function (in the form of their Mini-Mental State Examination score) is frequently used as a prognostication of their living environment, and thus the overall cost of their care. Strategies to maintain patients at home are directed at either the patient's symptoms or the caregiver's ability to cope with those symptoms and the responsibilities of caregiving. Examples of strategies directed at the caregiver include education and support programs. Drug treatments, notably acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, present the best option for improving patient function, thereby preserving patient autonomy. A number of preliminary studies, whose results are summarized here, have demonstrated that the use of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors tacrine, metrifonate and donepezil, and the glial cell modulator, propentofylline, results in reductions in the overall costs of care. Most health economic studies have focused only on comparison of the costs associated with paying for administering a treatment and the savings produced by postponed institutionalization. However, there is a growing realization that some measures of the quality of life or well-being of both patient and caregiver should also be incorporated. Thus, the health economics of dementia is an extremely complex area of study that is rapidly growing, due to the likelihood that cost-effectiveness will form the basis for future reimbursement decisions.",

    "abstract": "The major barrier to Alzheimer disease (AD) drug discovery and development in the biotechnology industry is scale. Most biotechnology companies do not have the personnel or expertise to carry a drug from the bench to the market. Much effort in the industry has been directed toward the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of AD and the identification of new targets. Advances in biotechnology have generated new insights into disease mechanisms, increased the number of lead compounds, and accelerated biologic screening. The majority of costs associated with drug development are in clinical testing and development activities, many of which are driven by regulatory issues. For most biotechnology companies, the costs of such trials and the infrastructure necessary to support them are prohibitive. Another significant barrier is the definition of therapeutic benefit for AD drugs; Food and Drug Administration (FDA) precedent has established that a drug must show superiority to placebo on a performance-based test of cognition and a measure of global clinical function. This restrictive definition is biased toward drugs that enhance performance on memory-based tests. Newer AD drugs are targeted toward slowing disease progression; however, there is currently no accepted definition of what constitutes efficacy in disease progression. Despite these obstacles, the biotechnology industry has much to offer AD drug discovery and development. Biotechnology firms have already developed essential technology for AD drug development and will continue to do so. Biotechnology companies can move more quickly; of course, the trick is to move quickly in the right direction. Speed may offset some of the problems associated with lack of scale. Additionally, biotechnology companies can afford to address markets that may be too restricted for larger pharmaceutical companies. This advantage will have increasing importance, as therapies are developed to address subtypes of AD.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive deficits beyond memory impairment, such as those affecting language production or executive functioning, can be useful in clinically distinguishing between dementia syndromes. We tested the hypothesis that Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) patients who have dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and carry glucocerebrosidase (GBA) mutations will have verbal fluency deficits different from those found in Alzheimer disease (AD), whereas AJ patients with DLB who have no GBA mutations will have similar deficits in verbal fluency to those found in AD. We compared performance in phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks in 44 AJ patients with DLB and 20 patients with AD, matched for age, education, and age of immigration. All groups were found to have a deficit in semantic verbal fluency. On conducting the phonemic task, patients with DLB who carried GBA mutations scored more poorly than patients with AD, whereas DLB-noncarriers performed similarly to patients with AD. We suggest that verbal fluency tasks could serve as a possible clinical marker to subtype patients with DLB, with phonemic fluency being a marker for GBA-associated DLB.",

The Aging and Memory Quality of Life was administered to 45 individuals diagnosed with MCI and 45 cognitively normal participants serving as control subjects matched for age, sex, and education. Study partners were surveyed to collect corroborating and or discrepant observer responses. Results: Inconsistent with study partners’ reporting, MCI subjects may be underreporting physical limitations, and overreporting medication compliance. MCI subjects identified challenges to managing financial affairs. Discussion: Developing strategies to circumvent the development of maladaptive behaviors could significantly reduce morbidity and mortality in MCI patients.",

    "abstract": "Cancer diagnoses are associated with better long-term memory in older adults, possibly reflecting a range of social confounders that increase cancer risk but improve memory. We used spouse's memory as a negative control outcome to evaluate this possible confounding, since spouses share social characteristics and environments, and individuals' cancers are unlikely to cause better memory among their spouses. We estimated the association of an individual's incident cancer diagnosis (exposure) with their own (primary outcome) and their spouse's (negative control outcome) memory decline in 3601 couples from 1998 to 2014 in the Health and Retirement Study, using linear mixed-effects models. Incident cancer predicted better long-term memory for the diagnosed individual. We observed no association between an individual's cancer diagnosis and rate of spousal memory decline. This negative control study suggests that the inverse association between incident cancer and rate of memory decline is unlikely to be attributable to social/behavioral factors shared between spouses.",

Methods: Sample consisted of 199 initially community-living patients with probable Alzheimer disease recruited from 3 academic medical centers in the United States followed for up to 10 years and had ≥2 Dependence Scale recorded. Nonparametric K-means cluster analysis for longitudinal data (KmL) was used to identify dependence clusters. Medicare expenditures data (1999-2010) were compared between clusters. Results: KmL identified 2 distinct Dependence Scale clusters: (A) high initial dependence, faster decline, and (B) low initial dependence, slower decline. Adjusting for patient characteristics, 6-month Medicare expenditures increased over time with widening between-cluster differences. Discussion: Dependence captures dementia care costs over time. Better characterization of dependence clusters has significant implications for understanding disease progression, trial design and care planning.",

Developing models of DLB disease progression will provide information on the burden of disease and facilitate the evaluation of treatments for DLB from a clinical and cost perspective.Longitudinal, cognitive evaluation data were utilized in order to identify distinct health states for DLB and to estimate transition probabilities across the DLB disease continuum. These probabilities were applied to a health state transition model to evaluate disease progression and associated outcomes for a closed cohort over a fixed time horizon. The effect of a reduction in the risk of disease progression on outcomes was assessed.Estimated transition probabilities indicate that a patient >60 years of age with mild DLB has a 54%, 30%, 4%, and 12% chance of remaining mild, progressing to severe DLB, being institutionalized, and dying after 1 year, respectively. Reducing the annual risk of transitioning from mild to severe DLB by 40% decreased time institutionalized and increased time to death.This study used real-world longitudinal data to create a clinically relevant DLB disease progression model. Reducing the rate of disease progression resulted in meaningful benefits with potentially significant public health implications.",

We examined the differences in the appraisal of activities of daily living performance by CPs versus occupational therapists specialized in dementia treatment and investigated factors related to this discrepancy.The discrepancy in the assessment of function is common between CPs and clinicians. CPs tend to overestimate the abilities of persons with dementia. Appraisal discrepancy was most strongly associated with (1) sex of the person with dementia, (2) timing of assessment performance, (3) number of behavioral symptoms of the person with dementia, and (4) cognitive abilities of the person with dementia.Many factors influence the ability of CPs to appraise the function of persons with dementia. The inaccurate appraisal could result in insufficient daily assistance for, or even unnecessary health care utilization, of the person with dementia. Timeliness of intervention is crucial as their health status may change quickly.",

Objective: The aim was to examine the utility of the German version of the Repeat and Point (R&amp;P) Test for subtyping patients with PPA. Method: During the R&amp;P Test, the examiner reads out aloud a noun and the participants are asked to repeat the word and subsequently point to the corresponding picture. Data from 204 patients (68 svPPA, 85 nfvPPA, and 51 lvPPA) and 33 healthy controls were analyzed. Results: Controls completed both tasks with &gt;90% accuracy. Patients with svPPA had high scores in repetition (mean=9.2±1.32) but low scores in pointing (mean=6±2.52). In contrast, patients with nfvPPA and lvPPA performed comparably in both tasks with lower scores in repetition (mean=7.4±2.7 for nfvPPA and 8.2±2.34 for lvPPA) but higher scores in pointing (mean=8.9±1.41 for nfvPPA and 8.6±1.62 for lvPPA). The R&amp;P Test had high accuracy discriminating svPPA from nfvPPA (83% accuracy) and lvPPA (79% accuracy). However, there was low accuracy discriminating nfvPPA from lvPPA (&lt;60%). Conclusion: The R&amp;P Test helps to differentiate svPPA from 2 nonsemantic variants (nfvPPA and lvPPA). However, additional tests are required for the differentiation of nfvPPA and lvPPA.",

Methods: Data were obtained from the Italian Ministry of Health and included all discharge records from Italian hospitals concerning subjects aged 65 years or above admitted to acute Internal Medicine during 2 years (n=3,695,278 admissions). Discharge diagnoses were re-classified into 24 clusters, each including homogeneous diseases by the ICD-9-CM code classification. Dementia was identified by the presence of ICD-9-CM codes 290, 294, or 331 series. Results: Patients with dementia represented 7.5% of the sample; compared with those without dementia, they were older and more often female, had a greater length of hospital stay and higher mortality rate. Besides delirium [odds ratio (OR): 54.20], enthesopaties (OR: 2.19), diseases of fluids and electrolytes (OR:1.96), diseases of arteries (OR: 1.69), skin diseases (OR: 1.64), and pneumonia and pleurisy (OR: 1.53) were the diseases more strongly associated with the diagnosis of dementia, independent of other clusters, age, sex, and length of stay. Conclusions: Some comorbidities are specifically associated with the diagnosis of dementia among hospitalized elderly patients. Overall, these comorbidities describe the typical clinical profile of the patient with advanced dementia and could be treated in the context of the primary care, since they do not require specific skills belonging to hospital settings.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess antipsychotic prescribing within ambulatory settings in the United States among older adults with Alzheimer disease after adjusting for demographic, provider, and clinical factors.This cross-sectional cohort study utilized Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) ambulatory care data from 2014 to 2016 among visits 65 years old or older with any listed diagnosis of Alzheimer. Multivariable logistic regression analyses assessed the association between the outcome of antipsychotic prescribing after controlling for numerous demographic, provider, and clinical covariates. An extension of the Oacaxa-Blinder decomposition was used to assess observed differentials.An estimated 15,471,125 ambulatory visits involving Alzheimer disease among those 65 years old or older occurred from 2014 to 2016. Antipsychotics were prescribed in 9.3% of these visits, equating to 6.81 times higher multivariable-adjusted odds relative to non-Alzheimer visits (95% confidence interval: 2.86-16.20, P <0.001). The decomposition analysis indicated that the study's predictor variables explained 15.6% of the outcome gap between Alzheimer versus non-Alzheimer visits.Despite potential mortality risks with antipsychotics in adults 65 years old or older with Alzheimer disease and recommendations discouraging their use, this nationally representative study observed significantly higher odds of prescribing independent of demographic, provider, and clinical characteristics. Polypharmacy may be a risk factor that warrants continued assessment regarding the appropriateness of antipsychotic prescribing in this vulnerable population.",

    "abstract": "Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Although recent reports have noted that cognitive impairment is common in NMOSD, little longitudinal information is available on the trajectories of cognitive function in the disease. Here, we report a case of a 55-year-old woman with an 11-year history of NMOSD who visited our memory clinic for progressive memory loss. She was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer disease based on amyloid and tau positron emission tomography imaging biomarkers. This is the first report of early-onset Alzheimer disease in a patient with NMOSD. Complications of Alzheimer disease should be considered when patients with NMOSD exhibit rapid cognitive decline. More longitudinal studies of NMOSD with cognitive impairment are needed.",

Objectives: To estimate the association of elderly patients being accompanied during medical visits and patient’s memory complaint with objective cognitive impairment. Methods: We included elderly outpatients awaiting medical consultations in 3 non-neurological medical specialties. Demographic and Mini-Mental State Examination were collected. Patients’ memory complaints were evaluated with a single question to both patients and companions. Results: Five hundred ninety-three elderly patients were included in the study with 64.6% female and median (interquartile range) age 73 (68-78), 4 (2-6) years of education. Of these, 242 patients were accompanied and 62.6% presented memory complaints. The median (interquartile range) Mini-Mental State Examination scores were significantly lower in patients accompanied and in those with memory complaints. In a logistic regression model, age, education, memory complaint, and presence of companion were associated with cognitive impairment. In the model including only accompanied patients, only age and companion memory complaints were associated with objective cognitive impairment. Conclusions: The presence of a companion during a clinical consultation and patients’ memory complaints are both synergistically associated with objective cognitive impairment.",

Methods: We performed quantitative EEG analysis for 16 LBD and 14 non-LBD patients. After artifact removal, a fast Fourier transform was performed on 90, 60, and thirty 2-second epochs to derive dominant frequency; dominant frequency variability; and dominant frequency prevalence. Results: In LBD patients, there were no significant differences in EEG features derived from 90, 60, and thirty 2-second epochs (all P &gt;0.05). There were no significant differences in EEG features derived from 3 different groups of thirty 2-second epochs (all P &gt;0.05). When analyzing EEG features derived from ninety 2-second epochs, we found that LBD had significantly reduced dominant frequency, reduced dominant frequency variability, and reduced dominant frequency prevalence alpha compared with the non-LBD group (all P &lt;0.05). These same differences were observed between the LBD and non-LBD groups when analyzing thirty 2-second epochs. Conclusions: There were no differences in EEG features derived from 1 minute versus 3 minutes of EEG data, and both durations of EEG data equally differentiated LBD from non-LBD.",

    "abstract": "Recent clinical trials in mild Alzheimer disease (AD) have enriched for amyloid-specific positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and used extended versions of the AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) in an effort to increase the sensitivity to detect treatment effects. We used data from mild AD participants in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative to model trial effect sizes for 12- and 24-month trials using 3 versions of the ADAS-Cog and increased standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) cutoffs for amyloid imaging inclusion criteria. For 12-month trials, extended ADAS-Cog versions improved effect sizes. The ADAS-Cog11 elicited larger effect sizes when enriching for SUVR 1.1 only, whereas the ADAS-Cog12 and ADAS-Cog13 were associated with larger effect sizes with higher SUVR thresholds. For 24-month trials, extended ADAS-Cog versions increased effect sizes for trials not enriched for amyloid and trials enriched for SUVR 1.1. Only enriching for higher SUVR thresholds (1.3 and 1.4, not 1.1) increased trial power. We conclude that extended versions of the ADAS-Cog improve mild AD trial effect sizes for both 12- and 24-month long studies, whereas amyloid imaging criteria may be most valuable for 12-month trials.",

BBS scores and posturography metrics, including medial-lateral sway range, anterior-posterior sway range, sway area, and sway velocity, were assessed in eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. Adjusted linear regressions were used to assess relationships between posturography and BBS score. Mean BBS score was 50.4±5.3. In eyes-open conditions, posturography and BBS score were not significantly associated. In eyes-closed conditions, better BBS score was significantly associated with lower sway area (β=−0.91; P =0.006). Better scores of BBS items involving turning and reduced base of support were associated with greater eyes-closed sway area. Posturography in the more challenging eyes-closed condition may predict functional balance deficits in AD patients.",

We investigated the associations of cognitive and motor function and gray matter volumes (GMVs) with COVID-19 lockdown-related emotional distress of type 2 diabetes older adults, participating in the Israel Diabetes and Cognitive Decline Study. We administered a questionnaire to obtain information about anxiety, depression, general well-being, and optimism during a mandated lockdown. Lower grip strength before lockdown was associated with increased sadness, anxiety, and less optimism. Slower gait speed was associated with greater sadness. Lower GMV was related to greater anxiety during the lockdown when compared with anxiety levels before the COVID-19 outbreak. Yet, global cognition was not associated with any emotional distress measure. These results support the role of good motor function on emotional well-being during acute stress and GMV as a potential underlying mechanism.",

The aim of this study is to investigate whether depressive symptomatology at the time of dementia diagnosis was predictive of cognitive, functional, and behavioral decline over 1 year. Methods: In a Rural and Remote Memory Clinic, 375 patients consecutively diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer disease, or non-Alzheimer disease dementia completed the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale at first visit and 1-year follow-up to assess depressive symptomatology. The same cohort was evaluated for cognitive, functional, and behavioral decline through the completion of 5 clinical tests performed at the first visit and at 1-year follow-up. Results: Depressive symptomatology at time of dementia diagnosis did not predict cognitive or functional decline over 1 year, although increases in depressive symptomatology over 1 year significantly correlated with higher caregiver ratings of neuropsychiatric symptom severity and related distress over that time. Conclusion: Increasingly severe depressive symptomatology over 1 year correlated with greater caregiver distress. This study points the way for future studies delineating the relationship between depression, dementia progression, and caregiver distress.",

Methods: The SNPI and BEHAVE-AD instruments were administered to community-dwelling Saudi AD patients and their caregivers. Results: The sample size was 192. The first 59 constituted the validation cohort. Cronbach alpha of the SNPI and BEHAVE-AD were 0.91 and 0.79, respectively. There were significant correlations between: (1) the total SNPI and BEHAVE-AD scores ( r =0.84, P &lt;0.001); (2) analogous SNPI and BEHAVE-AD symptom subscores ( P &lt;0.05); (3) SNPI and BEHAVE-AD caregiver distress ( F =22.6, P &lt;0.001). Inter-rater reliability of the SNPI was excellent (kappa=0.74). Ninety percent of patients experienced 4 SNPI symptoms or more. Patients with stroke and prior psychiatric history were most likely to experience BPSDs. The most common symptom was apathy (82%). Caregiver distress was determined by the total NPI score and impulsiveness subscale score. Conclusions: The SNPI is valid and reliable for assessing BPSD in Saudi AD patients.

    "abstract": "Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), a potential early marker for neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer’s disease, is common among older adults. Although it is often regarded as a personal health concern, most individuals with SCD do not seek help from a health care professional. Help-seeking (HS) is a complex, individualized process with significant life-course implications, and older adults often face several barriers to HS across personal, socioeconomic, and cultural domains. The pandemic exacerbated these barriers by imposing additional limitations on in-person care. In response, virtual assessment became a popular method to conduct remote care. We provide a narrative review of the challenges and triumphs that came with the transition from in-person, pen-paper cognitive assessments to virtual cognitive assessments. In addition, we address the impact virtual assessment had in tackling barriers that previously limited individuals with SCD from formal HS. We argue that virtual cognitive assessment helps alleviate health access barriers to HS (e.g., cost, transportation, and physician availability) and allows individuals with different coping styles to undergo assessment within more convenient environments. We hope the findings presented in this review inform health care practice, public education, and future research targeted towards the use of virtual assessment to facilitate HS in older adults with SCD.",

This study aimed to determine whether there is an association between RAR and BPSD among patients with moderate and severe dementia.RAR analyses of 64 participants were performed using actigraphy. BPSD was assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home (NPI-NH) scale, and other clinical variables were assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination, Cognitive Test for Severe Dementia, and Hyogo Activities of Daily Living Scale. Correlations among RAR, sleep time, and BPSD were analyzed. A stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the association of RAR and sleep time with BPSD. The demographic variables were also adjusted. Variables were compared between two groups with aberrant and nonaberrant activity peak timing.Correlation analysis showed that longer maximum durations of activity and shorter daytime sleep were associated with higher NPI-NH scores. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed that maximum activity duration predicted the NPI-NH score after adjustment for the demographic variables. There was no significant difference in any variables between the groups with aberrant and nonaberrant activity peak timing.RAR is associated with BPSD in moderate-to-severe dementia, which should be considered with regard to treatment.",

Our objective was to longitudinally investigate the relationship between SC and cognitive and clinical variables in persons with AD and their caregivers. We also evaluated the different SC predictors from 3 perspectives: people with AD, caregivers of people with AD, and discrepancy analysis. Methods: In all, 137 dyads (people with AD and their caregivers) underwent 2 assessments: at baseline (M1) and after 1 year (M2). During follow-up, 58 dyads were excluded, and the study was thus concluded with 79. Results: Longitudinal analysis of the people with AD showed that while some cognitive functions declined (which is consistent with disease progression), SC impairments showed a more stable pattern. Another interesting result was related to SC predictors. For people with AD, SC was associated with cognition at both time points. For caregivers, besides cognition, other predictors included reduced functional abilities and quality of life in people with AD. These results are consistent with the discrepancy predictors. Conclusion: The stable pattern in SC functioning over 12 months in AD suggests that this neurocognitive domain may be influenced more by emotional processing than by cognitive impairment. In addition, the SC predictors showed that the investigation of different points of view enables a more global understanding, contributing to better and more targeted treatment for the patient.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Using the metadata collected in the digital version of the Self-Administered Gerocognitive Examination (eSAGE), we aim to improve the prediction of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia (DM) by applying machine learning methods. Patients and Methods: A total of 66 patients had a diagnosis of normal cognition (NC), MCI, or DM, and eSAGE scores and metadata were used. eSAGE scores and metadata were obtained. Each eSAGE question was scored and behavioral features (metadata) such as the time spent on each test page, drawing speed, and average stroke length were extracted for each patient. Logistic regression (LR) and gradient boosting models were trained using these features to detect cognitive impairment (CI). Performance was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, with accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) score as evaluation metrics. Results: LR with feature selection achieved an AUC of 89.51%, a recall of 87.56%, and an F1 of 85.07% using both behavioral and scoring. LR using scores and metadata also achieved an AUC of 84.00% in detecting MCI from NC, and an AUC of 98.12% in detecting DM from NC. Average stroke length was particularly useful for prediction and when combined with 4 other scoring features, LR achieved an even better AUC of 92.06% in detecting CI. The study shows that eSAGE scores and metadata are predictive of CI. Conclusions: eSAGE scores and metadata are predictive of CI. With machine learning methods, the metadata could be combined with scores to enable more accurate detection of CI.",

(1993) recently reported statistically significant decreases in systolic blood pressure upon standing in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) (n = 60) as compared with healthy elderly controls (n = 20), which would suggest a possible autonomic dysfunction associated with AD. To investigate this issue, we conducted a retrospective analysis of blood pressures and heart rates of 31 patients 55-85 years of age (mean 69.6) who met National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable AD. The patients were selected from a pool of placebo-treated patients with AD in five inpatient phase I clinical trials. All patients met rigorous entrance criteria and thus were in excellent physical health except for AD. Blood pressure and pulse were assessed after 3-5 min of lying down and after 1-3 min of standing. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures showed decreases upon standing of 12 mm Hg (8.6%) and 6 mm Hg (8.2%), respectively, on day 1 and decreases of 10 mm Hg (7.6%) and 4 mm Hg (5.7%), respectively, on day 7 of hospitalization (p < 0.05). Pulse rates increased upon standing by 17% and 13% on days 1 and 7, respectively (p < 0.05). Our data support the finding of Vitiello et al. of significant postural decreases in systolic blood pressure in patients with AD. Well-controlled, prospective studies of orthostasis in AD and healthy elderly subjects should be conducted to determine its prevalence in both populations and to determine whether the orthostatic changes seen in AD differ from those in normal aging.",

Here we have determined the effects of brain extracts from normal and from AD patients on neuronal process formation by a pheochromocytoma (PC-12) and a neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid cell line (NG108–15). PC12 cells show a dose-related stimulation of branching of neuronal processes by AD brain extracts with cells cultured on a laminin substrate. The neurotrophic effects of extracts of AD brains may be related to the abnormal sprouting and neurofibrillary tangle formation observed in the brain in this disorder.",

The fundamental steps in this process involve induction of neurotoxic microglia by senile plaques. Recent studies have shown that microglia in contact with isolated plaque fragments secrete neurotoxins that can cause neuronal injury and brain damage typical of AD. In vitro models help to delineate individual steps of this activation cascade by which quiescent microglia become neuron-killing cells. Moreover, such model systems provide rapid screening assays to identify immunosupprcssive drugs that might slow brain damage brought on by neurotoxic microglia.",

How persons with AD live, and the potential to improve the lives of persons with AD, is a rich resource for conducting interdisciplinary research in AD. This paper presents the \"lifestyle approach\" which is a method of easing the transition from his/her home into a nursing home setting. The lifestyle approach helps establish a daily routine for residents that is familiar and that fills their days with meaningful activities. Little research has been initiated to study how to increase the quality of life of nursing home residents with AD. Each component of the lifestyle approach is presented and suggestions for studies to support or refute the author's opinion are made to stimulate research in this area.",

New techniques together with long-term prospective follow-up studies, as well as utilization of data accumulated in existing data bases, are needed to move the field forward.

    "abstract": "The magnocellular nuclei in the basal forebrain--the medial septal nucleus, the nucleus of the diagonal band, and the basal nucleus within the substantia innominata--are tightly connected with each other. Large multipolar neurons clearly predominating in number can be differentiated from a spindle-shaped and a small globular type of neuron on account of their typical pattern of lipofuscin pigmentation. As an additional feature some of the multipolar neurons exhibit intracytoplasmic acidophilic granules. At the ultrastructural level, these granules reveal a homogeneous substructure, and they are occasionally located within mitochondria. The percentage of large multipolar neurons displaying acidophilic granules varies in a topographical manner (medial septal nucleus and vertical limb nucleus of the diagonal band: 10%, horizontal limb nucleus of the diagonal band and anteromedial subnucleus of the basal nucleus: 36%, posterolateral subnucleus of the basal nucleus: 54%). In parkinsonian cases a significant decrease of granule-bearing neurons within the posterolateral subnucleus of the basal nucleus is noted. This decrease might be associated with the appearance of neurons containing Lewy-bodies. It is also conceivable that the granule-bearing neurons show a higher vulnerability and underlie neuronal death. Analyzing the lipofuscin pigmentation within the two subnuclei of the basal nucleus in parkinsonian cases, one notices that the number of large multipolar neurons displaying pigment granules in a dendritic stem is significantly higher than in controls. Moreover, it is apparent that the degree of this pigment penetration is more pronounced in cases of Parkinson's disease. These alterations may be interpreted as a sign of plasticity of this neuronal population.",

Because animal data support stimulatory cholinergic mediation of AVP osmoregulation at a brain level, the AVP response in AD might provide clinically useful information about the status of brain cholinergic systems. Seventeen AD outpatients and eight normal older subjects underwent both a 90-min hypertonic saline infusion and a 90-min control (normal saline) infusion. Substantial increases in plasma osmolality during hypertonic saline infusion were accompanied by substantial and linear increases in plasma AVP in both groups. However, there were no significant differences in AVP responses between AD and normal older subjects. These results do not support the utility of plasma AVP response to hypertonic saline in the assessment of brain cholinergic status in AD.",

(1993) recently reported statistically significant decreases in systolic blood pressure upon standing in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) (n = 60) as compared with healthy elderly controls (n = 20), which would suggest a possible autonomic dysfunction associated with AD. To investigate this issue, we conducted a retrospective analysis of blood pressures and heart rates of 31 patients 55–85 years of age (mean 69.6) who met National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable AD. The patients were selected from a pool of placebo-treated patients with AD in five inpatient phase 1 clinical trials. All patients met rigorous entrance criteria and thus were in excellent physical health except for AD. Blood pressure and pulse were assessed after 3–5 min of lying down and after 1–3 min of standing. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures showed decreases upon standing of 12 mm Hg (8.6%) and 6 mm Hg (8.2%), respectively, on day 1 and decreases of 10 mm Hg (7.6%) and 4 mm Hg (5.7%), respectively, on day 7 of hospitalization (p < 0.05). Pulse rates increased upon standing by 17% and 13% on days 1 and 7, respectively (p < 0.05). Our data support the finding of Vitiello et al. of significant postural decreases in systolic blood pressure in patients with AD. Well-controlled, prospective studies of orthostasis in AD and healthy elderly subjects should be conducted to determine its prevalence in both populations and to determine whether the orthostatic changes seen in AD differ from those in normal aging.",

This article provides an introduction to a number of recruitment and retention tools in a National Institute on Aging Health Disparities Toolbox and to this special edition on challenges and opportunities in recruitment and retention of minority populations in Alzheimer disease and dementia research. The Health Disparities Toolbox and Health Disparities Resource Persons Network are described along with other more established resource tools including the Alzheimer Disease Center Education Cores, Alzheimer Disease Education and Referral Center, and Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research. Nine featured articles are introduced. The articles address a range of concerns including what we know and do not know, conceptual and theoretical perspectives framing issues of diversity and inclusion, success as a result of sustained investment of time and community partnerships, the significant issue of mistrust, willingness to participate in research as a dynamic personal attribute, Helpline Service and the amount of resources required for success, assistance in working with Limited English Proficiency elders, and sage advice from social marketing and investigations of health literacy as a barrier to recruitment and retention. Finally, an appeal is made for scientists to share tools for the National Institute on Aging Health Disparity Toolbox and to join the Health Disparities Resource Persons Network.",

    "abstract": "Summary: The diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) is made first by clinical criteria to establish progressive dementia and second by extensive laboratory evaluation to exclude other possible causes of dementia. There are no widely accepted biochemical markers to establish the presence of the disease in living patients. Sensitivity, specificity, and cost still limit the widespread use of single photon emission computerized tomography and positron emission tomography in diagnosis of the disease. Several cerebrospinal fluid markers, including amyloid β-protein precursor, are being developed to aid diagnosis and to use as surrogate markers for use during trials of therapy. Chromosomes 21, 14, and 19 genetic markers have recently been associated with or linked to AD. In the coming years, early identification of susceptibility or disease-causing genes may facilitate risk-factor modification or drug therapy to halt or at least delay disease onset. To date, therapy of AD has been limited to treating secondary behavioral symptoms. Recent studies of tacrine have shown significant improvement in cognition of treated patients, as demonstrated by neuropsycho-logic testing and global clinical measures. Several other approaches to treating AD are being developed. In the future, subgroups of AD may be identified by genetic markers that will each respond to specific modes of treatment.",

    "abstract": "Summary: Memantine is a moderate-affinity, voltage-dependent, uncompetitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. In contrast to competitive NMDA antagonists, Memantine is well tolerated in humans and is being developed for the treatment of dementia. The pathogenesis of vascular dementia (VaD) is largely unknown, and is likely multifactorial, but it involves the impairment of blood circulation as a common denominator. There is broad evidence for the efficacy of Memantine in several animal models of ischemia. Memantine also acts on several secondary, potentially contributing factors in VaD such as neuronal depolarization, removal of magnesium block of NMDA receptors, chronic overstimulation of these receptors, and, possibly, mitochondrial dysfunction. Among others, it also has additional positive effects on long-term potentiation and cognition in standard animal models of impaired synaptic plasticity. Recently, clinical efficacy of Memantine has been shown in an etiologically mixed population of severely demented patients, including those with VaD. Given the difficulties of diagnosing VaD in clinical practice, an optimal antidementive drug should be beneficial in both Alzheimer disease and VaD. Preclinical data presented in this paper indicate that such benefits can be achieved with Memantine. In addition, phase II clinical data in dementia are summarized, and two ongoing pivotal trials in VaD are described. Suggestions for VaD guideline development are made regarding clinical instruments, and etiologies and severity stages are considered.",

    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: The aim was to identify whether performance on olfactory identification can distinguish neurological/neurodegenerative disorders (NNDs) from primary psychiatric disorders (PPDs). Methods: This is a cross-sectional retrospective study of inpatients assessed in Neuropsychiatry, Royal Melbourne Hospital. Data extracted from the admission records included: demographics, tobacco use, medical comorbidities, cognitive function using the Neuropsychiatry Unit Cognitive Assessment Tool (NUCOG), and odor identification using the Sniffin’ Sticks Screening 12 test. The final diagnosis for patients was informed by established diagnostic criteria. Results: A total 121 patients were included. Eighty-eight patients (73%) were diagnosed with neurological or neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimers dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body parkinsonian-related dementias (Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy, dementia with Lewy bodies) and other neurological causes of dementia; 33 patients (27%) were diagnosed with PPDs (including mood and psychotic disorders). Patients who scored ≤8 on the Sniffin’ Sticks Screening 12 test were more likely to have NND than PPD, even after adjustment for age, sex and tobacco use ( P =0.009, adjusted odds ratios=3.85, 95% confidence interval=1.40-10.62). Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses demonstrated that a score of ≤8 differentiated NND from PPD with sensitivity of 57% and specificity of 73% (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.67, P =0.004). Conclusions: Patients with neuropsychiatric difficulties who score 8 or less on Sniffin’ Sticks are more likely to have a neurodegenerative illness. A cut-off score of 8 is potentially a “red flag” for clinicians faced with the diagnostic question of PPD versus NND.",

Although the general assumption is that this population benefits from their home environment when performing ADLs, very few experimental studies have been conducted to date.The aim was to investigate the influence of the environment (home vs. Research-lab) and the role of clutter on ADL performance.Sixty-five PwD were evaluated with a performance-based ADL assessment (at home and clutter-free Research-lab). Paired t tests compared ADL performance and level of clutter in both environments. Multiple regression analysis investigated factors associated with better ADL performance.Overall, PwD performed better at home even though clutter was significantly lower in the Research-lab. When stratified by dementia stage, PwD in the moderate stage of the disease performed better at home.Absence of clutter in the Research-Lab did not appear to play a beneficial role in ADLs. When stratified by dementia stage, only PwD in the moderate stage appeared to benefit from their home environment when performing ADL tasks. Future studies are required to elucidate the wider role of the environment in supporting engagement in daily activities in different dementia stages.",

In the present study, we explored the association between diagnostic outcome and clinician’s level of certainty with quality of life (QoL) after [ 18 F]flutemetamol PET results were disclosed in young onset dementia patients in a memory clinic cohort. Methods: In 154 patients suspected of dementia, QoL was measured before and after [ 18 F]flutemetamol PET results were disclosed. Multiple regression analyses were conducted with (changed) general and disease-specific QoL measures as dependent factors [QoL-Alzheimer disease (AD) and EQ-5D Dutch tariff] and etiological diagnosis and clinician’s certainty as independent factors. Results: (Change in) diagnosis of AD was associated to QOL in 2 of the 4 analyses (utility-based QoL β=0.15, P =0.010; disease-specific QoL β=2.0, P =0.037). Diagnostic certainty was associated to QOL in 1 of the 4 analyses (generic QoL β=0.002, P =0.028). Discussion: The diverse results in this explorative analysis do not reflect a univocal association between diagnosis, certainty, and QoL. Nevertheless, this result could be interpreted as a possible potential for advanced diagnostic technologies for AD, which requires confirmation in future research.",

At the heart of this hypothesis lies a defect in blood brain barrier function and/or structure within the cerebral cortex and this defect may be the cause of the cerebral vessel amyloidosis common in many patients with Alzheimer's disease. Age-related alterations in blood brain barrier allow for damage to nerve terminals and limited formation of senile plaques within cerebral cortex; neurofibrillary tangles are formed within cortical and subcortical nerve cells which project to or near damaged vessels/senile plaques. Uptake of neurotoxin at affected terminals and retrograde transport to perikarya causes neurofibrillary tangles to be formed; their accumulation leads to perikaryal changes culminating in cell death and loss. Loss of cells in cortically projecting areas of subcortex such as nucleus basalis, locus caeruleus and dorsal raphe, which terminate on cerebral vessels, causes further blood brain barrier dysfunction, new plaque formation and continued cell loss in cortex and subcortex. Once started, such a process could be self-perpetuating and the initial site of damage could lie within the amygdala/hippocampus with putative pathogenic agent accessing the brain via the olfactory pathways.",

    "abstract": "The visual recognition of rhesus monkeys was evaluated by means of a delayed nonmatching-to-sample task with trial-unique objects. Each daily session consisted of two lists of 20 objects each, which untreated animals were able to recognize at approximately 75% accuracy. When they were performing at this level reliably, doses of physostigmine (0.32, 1.0, 3.2, 10.0, 32.0, 56.0 μg/kg), scopolamine (1.0, 3.2, 5.6, 10.0, 17.8, 32.0 μg/kg), or saline were administered 20 min prior to the session. Physostigmine and scopolamine produced dose-related increases and decreases, respectively, in the number of objects correctly remembered. The systematic changes in performance support the view that cholinergic mechanisms contribute to recognition memory and suggest that tasks with trial-unique objects may be particularly useful for studying the mnemonic effects of cholinergic drugs.",

We aimed to address the issue of pathologic heterogeneity that often underlies a clinical AD diagnosis. Methods: We performed a deep whole-genome sequencing study aiming to identify variants that are associated specifically with healthy brain aging. Patients: We examined samples from the community-based longitudinal Vienna Transdanubian Aging study comparing neuropathologically “healthy” aging in individuals above 80 years of age with pure AD patients of the same age. Results: Focusing on potentially functional variants, we discovered a single variant ( rs10149146) that lies on the autophagy-associated TECPR2 gene and was carried by 53.6% of the “healthy” brain elderly individuals (15/28). An additional nonsynonymous variant on the CINP gene (encoding a cell cycle checkpoint protein) was also found in 46% of healthy controls. Both variants are absent from all AD cases. TECPR2 and CINP appear to be “partner” genes in terms of regulation and their associated transcription factors have been previously implicated in AD and neurodegeneration. Conclusions: Our study underlines the strength of neuropathology-driven definitions in genetic association studies and points to a potentially neuroprotective effect of key molecules of autophagy and cell cycle control.",

Currently, there is a lack of insight on the association between amyloid-PET status and the widely used Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA). Studying this relationship may optimize the clinical use of amyloid-PET imaging.To evaluate the relationship between amyloid-PET status and MoCA scores and to identify a MoCA score cutoff that translates to amyloid-PET positivity.Using retrospective chart review, patients from 2010 to 2017 with amyloid-PET scans (positive or negative) and MoCA test scores were included. We studied the relationship between amyloid-PET status and MoCA scores and the influence of age, sex, education, and race. A MoCA score cutoff for amyloid-PET positivity was estimated.Among the 684 clinic patients with dementia, 99 fulfilled inclusion criteria. Amyloid-PET positivity was associated significantly with lower MoCA scores (median=19, U=847, P=0.01). The MoCA score cutoff (25) used for minimal cognitive impairment (MCI) predicted amyloid-PET positivity suboptimally (sensitivity=94.6%, specificity=13.9%). A MoCA score cutoff of 20 patients had optimal sensitivity (64.2%) and specificity (67.4%).Amyloid-PET positivity is associated with lower MoCA scores. Clinical utility of amyloid-PET scan is likely to be suboptimal at the MoCA score cutoff for minimal cognitive impairment.",

Lenient scoring of SOEs on the MMSE occurred in 53 (51.4%) patients and lowered the sensitivity by 7% to 18%, with variable gains in specificity (0% to 11%) to psychometrically operationalized cognitive impairment. Results are consistent with previous reports that lenient scoring is widespread and attenuates the sensitivity of the MMSE.

Cognitive assessment was evaluated by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and cognitive improvement was defined as MMSE scores ≥27 or 4-score elevation at 3-month follow-up after stroke. The AD7c-NTP level was 0.68±0.40 ng/mL in the 135 patients with cognitive improvement, while the AD7c-NTP level was 1.49±0.99 ng/mL in the 89 patients without improvement ( P <0.001).

It is critical to identify participants in this preclinical phase as early as possible since treatment plans may be more effective in this stage. Monitoring for changes in driving behavior, as measured with GPS sensors, has been explored as a low-burden, easy-to-administer method for detecting AD risk. However, driving is a complex, multifaceted process that is likely influenced by other factors, including personality traits, that may change in preclinical AD. Methods: We examine the moderating influence of neuroticism and conscientiousness on longitudinal changes in driving behavior in a sample of 203 clinically normal older adults who are at varying risk of developing AD. Results: Neuroticism moderated rates of change in the frequency of speeding as well as the number of trips taken at night. Conscientiousness moderated rates of change in typical driving space. Conclusions: Personality traits change in early AD and also influence driving behaviors. Studies that seek to utilize naturalistic driving behavior to establish AD risk need to accommodate interpersonal differences, of which personality traits are one of many possible factors. Future studies should explicitly establish how much benefit is provided by including personality traits in predictive models of AD progression.",

    "abstract": "Background: Psychosis in Alzheimer disease (AD) is a major burden for patients and their family. Identifying the characteristics of delusions and hallucinations in the AD population is key to understanding the interconnection between the psychiatric and cognitive symptoms in neurocognitive disorders. The aim of this study is to compare the cognitive profiles of AD patients with and without psychosis. Methods: We conducted a rapid review to explore the relationship between psychotic symptoms and cognitive performances in patients with AD. We used MEDLINE, Embase, and PsychINFO literature databases between January 2015 and January 2023. This rapid review was guided by the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group. Results: We identified 2909 records from the initial searches. After reviewing the titles, abstracts, and full texts, we selected 8 cross-sectional and 5 cohort studies for the qualitative analysis. Among them, 6 studies were included in the final quantitative analysis. Most studies suggested a correlation between general cognitive decline and the risk of presenting psychotic symptoms. Three studies found an association between hallucinations and deficits in the visuocognitive domains (visuospatial, visuoperceptual, and visuoconstructive skills). Two studies found a relationship between psychotic symptoms and executive dysfunction. Two studies also found a correlation between psychotic symptoms and language. Our results are in line with previous data in the literature, especially regarding the outcome of psychosis on executive function and visuocognitive abilities. Conclusions: There appears to be an association between cognitive deficits and psychotic symptoms in AD, but the direction of causality is still unclear, and further studies using longitudinal designs would give more insight into the pathophysiological process of psychosis in AD.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) response to osmotic stimulation induced by hypertonic saline infusion is blunted in the early and middle stages of Alzheimer disease (AD). Because animal data support stimulatory cholinergic mediation of AVP osmoregulation at a brain level, the AVP response in AD might provide clinically useful information about the status of brain cholinergic systems. Seventeen AD outpatients and eight normal older subjects underwent both a 90-min hypertonic saline infusion and a 90-min control (normal saline) infusion. Substantial increases in plasma osmolality during hypertonic saline infusion were accompanied by substantial and linear increases in plasma AVP in both groups. However, there were no significant differences in AVP responses between AD and normal older subjects. These results do not support the utility of plasma AVP response to hypertonic saline in the assessment of brain cholinergic status in AD.",

    "abstract": "Summary: Cognitive enhancers is a provocative and vague label for drugs used to treat dementia of the Alzheimer type. Several issues have to be carefully considered in order to perform reliable clinical trials with such compounds. The lack of an animal model appropriately matching the human pathology, the difficulty in finding worldwide criteria for clinical diagnosis and determining which patients are eligible and how they are best tested, methods of treatment, and interpreting results are undoubtedly the major problems to be solved. A review of the literature points out that the “day-after” approach of treatment (once severe neuropathological damage has been established) is no longer feasible, or has limited advantages. A different pharmacological approach, based on preventive measures during the first stages of the neurodegeneration, seems mandatory",

    "abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to compare causes of death in the most prevalent neuropathologically diagnosed dementias. Methods: We analyzed causes of death in a community-based cohort of participants aged 50 or older, submitted to full-body autopsy and a comprehensive neuropathologic examination of the brain. Individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), mixed dementia (AD+VaD), or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLBs) were compared with individuals with no dementia. Results: In a sample of 920 individuals, 456 had no dementia, 147 had AD, 120 had VaD, 53 had DLB, and 37 had AD+VaD. Pneumonia as the cause of death was more frequent in the AD ( P =0.023), AD+VaD ( P =0.046), and DLB ( P =0.043) groups. In addition, VaD ( P =0.041) and AD+VaD ( P =0.028) groups had a higher frequency of atherosclerosis as detected by full-body autopsy. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the importance of preventive measures regarding atherosclerosis and pneumonia in patients with dementia. Moreover, because of cognitive impairment, these patients may not fully account for symptoms to make early detection and diagnosis possible. These results confirm findings from previous studies that were based on clinical data, with added accuracy provided by neuropathologic diagnosis and full-body autopsy reports.",

Methods: Cross-sectional study of 902 adults aged 65+ with mean age 76.6 years (SD 8.06). We created a social cognition composite comprising standardized z scores on the Social Norms Questionnaire and the 10-item Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test. We identified associated factors and compared sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve of social cognition, for MCI defined as Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)=0.5, to those of other cognitive domains. We calculated the impact of including social cognition on the proportion neuropsychologically classified as MCI. Results: Better social cognition was associated with younger age, female sex, higher education, better general cognition (mini-mental state examination), fewer depressive symptoms, and lower CDR. Adjusting for demographics, associations with mini-mental state examination, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and subjective cognitive complaints remained significant. The sensitivity and specificity of social cognition for CDR=0.5 were comparable to those of the traditional 5 cognitive domains. Including social cognition as a sixth domain of cognition resulted in a 5% increase in the proportion classified as MCI. Conclusions: Brief objective assessment of social cognition may enhance cognitive assessment of older adults.",

We thus assessed how patients with AD remember the announcement of diagnosis.We recruited 47 participants with mild AD (26 women; M age=68.89 y, SD=7.37; M years of formal education=9.74, SD=3.00). We invited the participants to remember the moment when their clinicians announced their diagnosis, within 6 months of the event, as well as a control memory, over the same period. We analyzed memory retrieval regarding specificity, as well as the subjective experience of retrieval (ie, regarding mental time travel, visual imagery, emotion and importance).No significant differences were observed between memory of diagnosis and control memory regarding specificity, mental time travel and visual imagery. However, memory of diagnosis triggered a more intense emotional experience and feeling of importance than control memory.Retrieval of the diagnosis announcement can activate a strong emotional and personally important experience in patients with AD. When remembering the diagnosis announcement, patients with AD may re-experience some features of that turning point in which they shift from \"person\" to \"patient.\"",

    "abstract": "Patients with dementia can experience hallucinations and delusions because of their underlying neurodegenerative condition, a syndrome known as dementia-related psychosis. Dementia-related psychosis contributes to morbidity and mortality among patients with dementia and increases the burden on caregivers and the health care system. With no pharmacological treatment currently approved in the United States for this condition, patients are often treated off-label with antipsychotics. Though typical and atypical antipsychotics have demonstrated variable to modest efficacy in dementia-related psychosis, serious safety concerns arise with their use. Accordingly, clinical and Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services guidelines recommend trying antipsychotics only when other therapies have failed and encourage treatment discontinuation of antipsychotics after 4 months to assess whether ongoing therapy is needed. Discontinuation of effective antipsychotic treatment, however, may increase the risk for relapse of symptoms and the associated morbidities that accompany relapse. A randomized medication withdrawal clinical trial design allows assessment of relapse risk after discontinuation and can provide initial information on longer-term safety of therapy for dementia-related psychosis. Given the substantial unmet need in this condition, new, well-tolerated therapies that offer acute and sustained reduction of symptoms while also preventing recurrence of symptoms of psychosis are critically needed.",

    "abstract": "Background: E2027 is a novel, highly selective and potent inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 9 in development for dementia with Lewy bodies. Cardiac safety assessments for emerging agents are essential to avoid drug-induced QT interval prolongation, which may predispose individuals to potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmias. To evaluate the cardiac safety of E2027 and to inform dose selection for the phase 2 study of E2027 in dementia with Lewy bodies, we evaluated concentration-response modeling of pooled electrocardiogram data. Patients and Methods: A post hoc concentration-QTc analysis evaluated potential QT effects using data from 2 randomized, double-blind studies in healthy subjects: a single ascending dose (SAD) study and a multiple ascending dose (MAD) study. Daily E2027 doses ranged from 5 to 1200 mg. Results: A linear mixed-effects model was used to establish the relationship between plasma concentrations of E2027 and change from the baseline of QTcF (ΔQTcF). A significant but shallow relationship was observed in the estimated slope of the concentration-ΔQTcF: 0.002 ms/ng/mL (90% confidence interval: 0.0007-0.0031) with a small, nonsignificant treatment effect-specific intercept of −0.6 ms. Based on this pooled concentration-QTc analysis, an effect on the QTcF interval &gt;10 ms can be excluded up to E2027 plasma concentrations of ∼3579 ng/mL, corresponding to a dose at least 4-fold larger than the 50 mg phase 2 dose. Conclusion: This pooled post hoc analysis evaluating cardiac safety of E2027 demonstrated that clinically concerning QTcF prolongation and related cardiac complications are highly unlikely with proposed E2027 doses planned for phase 2.",

Methods/Subjects: The MissionAD program consisted of 2 global phase 3 studies evaluating the BACE inhibitor elenbecestat in subjects with early Alzheimer disease. The CTF monitored and engaged with MissionAD clinical sites to provide support through collegial discussions to maximize the efficiency of the preconsent recruitment phase. Results: The CTF significantly improved cognitive screening efficiency in the MissionAD program, with a 24% decline in cognitive SF rate for the sites that the CTF contacted. The study-wide 11.5% reduction in cognitive SF rates were likely further driven by wider country-level initiatives in which CTF members held CTF-specific Investigator meetings with the recruitment staff, speaking to all sites on a country level regardless of their recruitment performance. Conclusions: The establishment of a CTF to support efficient cognitive screening is highly recommended for future Alzheimer disease studies. Additional benefits included improved site relationships, increased engagement in MissionAD and access to a group of cognitive experts for consulting, with a focus on achieving more efficient trial recruitment.",

    "abstract": "Worldwide, it is estimated that around 50 million older adults have Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). Cognitive deficits associated with ADRD may affect a driver’s perception and decision-making and potentially cause safety concerns. Despite much research, there lacks a comprehensive cognitive evaluation to determine the driving capability of a person with ADRD and it is unclear what are the most effective training and interventions that help to enhance driving performance for these individuals. The purpose of this article is to conduct a comprehensive literature survey to review and summarize studies of driving performance evaluation and intervention for people with ADRD and discuss perspectives for future studies. Although many studies have investigated the correlations between driving behaviors and cognitive performances for people with ADRD, it remains unclear how driving behaviors and cognitive performances are associated with psychophysiological measures. We discussed the need to develop regular driving evaluation and rehabilitation protocol for people with ADRD. We also highlighted the potential benefit to combine driving tests with psychophysiological measures to assist in characterizing personalized cognitive evaluation in the behavioral evaluation process.",

Method: Eighty-nine community-dwelling older adults (aged 61 to 92 years, M=72.93, SD=6.36, 76% women) received dementia risk factor information in 2 formats: “traffic lights” (green=risk absent, amber=risk emerging, and red=risk present) or red/risk-only. Participants reported motivation to change risk-related behaviors, motivation to maintain good health behaviors, liking of the formats, categorical preference for traffic lights versus risk-only formats, reasons for preferences (open-ended), total applicable risks, and Motivation to Change Lifestyle and Health Behaviour for Dementia Risk Reduction. Results: Traffic lights presentation was more motivating ( Z =4.16, P &lt;0.001), more liked ( Z =4.80, P &lt;0.001), and preferred, N Traffic =71, N Red =14, χ 2 (1)=38.22, P &lt;0.001, over risk-only. Self-efficacy and motivation to maintain good health behaviors were significant unique predictors of motivation to change risk-related behaviors following traffic lights presentation over age, sex, education, total applicable risks, perceived susceptibility, cues to action, and liking of the traffic lights presentation format. Themes indicated (1) traffic light presentation is informative and clear, and (2) green-light information increases self-efficacy. Conclusions: Traffic light presentation increases patient motivation to reduce dementia risk. Green-light information increases self-efficacy.

Methods: Test dates for specific stages of AD were referenced as index dates to study behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and other patient characteristics related to utilization/work-up and time to death. Patients: We identified veterans with AD and neurocognitive evaluations using the VAHS Electronic Health Record (EHR). Results: Anxiety and sleep disorders/disturbances were the most documented BPSDs across all AD severity stages. Magnetic resonance imaging, neurology and psychiatry consultations, and neuropsychiatric evaluations were slightly higher in veterans with mild AD than in those at later stages. The overall average time to death from the first AD severity record was 5 years for mild and 4 years for moderate/severe AD. Conclusion: We found differences in clinical symptoms, healthcare utilization, and survival among the mild, moderate, and severe stages of AD. These differences are limited by the low documentation of BPSDs among veterans with test score-based AD stages. These data support the hypothesis that our cohorts represent coherent subgroups of patients with AD based on disease severity.",

    "abstract": "There is no consensus on how long antidementia medications should be administered to patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). To clarify this issue, we investigated the discontinuation of antidementia medications in Japanese home care settings, including community-dwelling and institutionalized patients. Using medical records from April 2017 to March 2022 at 3 clinics in Tokyo and Chiba prefectures, we selected patients with AD who started receiving home care medicine. Forty-nine patients discontinued antidementia medications during the observation period, there was no apparent deterioration in cognitive function or new occurrence of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia caused by the discontinuation of medications. More aggressive discontinuation of AD medications probably is recommended for patients with activities of daily living dysfunction, such as those receiving home care medicine.",

We examined the relation of AD biomarkers with performance in the NIHTB-CB in late middle age. Methods: This is a cross-sectional analysis of 334 Hispanic participants aged 64.22±3.35 years from a study of AD biomarkers. White matter hyperintensities (WMH), infarcts, and cortical thickness in AD regions (CT) were assessed with 3T magnetic resonance imaging. Amyloid and tau were assessed with 18 F-Florbetaben and 18 F-MK6240 positron emission tomography, respectively. Results: Lower CT and infarcts were associated with worse Oral Reading Recognition and Cognition Crystallized Composite scores. Lower CT and higher WMH were associated with worse Pattern Comparison Processing Speed. Amyloid and tau were not associated with any test. Discussion: Amyloid and tau, the culprits of AD, are not related to the NIHTB-CB in late middle age. Continued follow-up will reveal if AD impacts performance on the NIHTB-CB.",

The first activity involves developing the research team. Selection of colleagues who will strengthen and support the research ideas is an early first step to developing a competitive grant application. It is important to communicate clearly the roles and responsibilities of each team member. The second activity is development of the scientific plan-the research proposal-from specific aims to plans for data analysis. Strategies used to review the literature, synthesize existing knowledge, develop the argument for the research proposal, and select the most appropriate method are discussed. The third activity involves developing a business plan-the budget-that demonstrates clearly the investigator's ability to complete the proposed research. These three activities are set within a timeline to guide investigators in successful completion of a grant application.",

Moderate numbers of senile plaques but no neurofibrillary tangles were found in the neopallium or in the limbic areas. A positive correlation was found between the distribution of the cortical Lewylike bodies and the proposed distribution of dopamine terminals in the cerebral cortex. Cell loss in the ventral tegmental area and the basal nucleus of Meynert suggest abnormalities in the dopaminergic and cholinergic innervation of the cerebral cortex. The relative lack of senile changes of Alzheimer type make these two proposed abnormalities a more plausible explanation for the dementia in this patient.",

    "abstract": "The prevention of fall-related injuries in patients with Alzheimer-type dementia (ATD) is hampered by an incomplete understanding of their causes. We studied falls and fractures in 157 ATD patients, including 117 with three-year follow-up. Initially all but one patient could walk; 31% reported falls. During follow-up, 50% either fell or became unable to walk. The fracture rate during follow-up (69/1000/y) was more than three times the age- and sex-adjusted fracture rate in the general population. Features of both ATD and comorbid conditions contributed to the risk of falls and fractures. In particular, patients who experienced toxic reactions to drugs on entry into the study were more likely to report they had fallen prior to entry (odds ratio, 4.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.78 to 13.3), and patients who wandered were more likely to sustain fractures (odds ratio, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.25 to 10.4) during the follow-up period, including hip fractures for which the odds ratio of 6.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.66 to 28.6) was unexpectedly high. Preventive measures may be possible, including controlling wandering, avoiding toxic reactions to drugs, and treating comorbid illnesses. (JAMA1987;257:1492-1495)",

Identification of these lesions in plastic thick sections (1 micron) is more tedious and relies essentially on morphological criteria. This causes investigators to subsequently analyze large numbers of thin sections under the electron microscope. Since many researchers use electron microscopy for various aspects of Alzheimer's disease and related research, it would be advantageous to have a rapid method enabling the investigator to quickly and reliably identify in thick sections the characteristic NPs, NFTs and/or CA, which can then be used for further analysis at the ultrastructural level. In this context, the present study describes a dependable technique for identifying NPs, NFTs and/or CA in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders and involves Congo red staining on one micron sections after plastic removal.",

Age at onset of dementia was determined and individual longevity quotients (i.e. actual duration of survival divided by expected survival) were calculated. Expected survival was derived from the Dutch life tables for the general population. Age at onset of dementia was 75.6 +/- 7.8 years (mean +/- SD). Duration of dementia until death was 7.2 +/- 4.1 years. Dementia of early onset (before age 76) was associated with a significantly reduced life expectancy (LQ = 0.70 +/- 0.30), but this was not found for onset after age 75 (LQ = 0.91 +/- 0.58). Duration of symptoms at the time of admission into a nursing home was not associated with severity of behavioural and cognitive impairments as measured with behaviour rating scales. However, the severity of behavioural impairments predicted 1-year survival after admission, as could be shown by multivariate analysis which corrected for the effects of age and sex.",

While the ultrastructure of these intraneuronal lesions has been extensively studied, the biochemical composition of the fibers comprising the NFT is unknown. We report the production of three monoclonal antibodies against the microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2), one of which intensely labels Alzheimer NFT. All three antibodies specifically recognize MAP-2 on immunoblots and stain brain tissue in a characteristic dendritic pattern. The three antibodies are directed against at least two different antigenic sites on the MAP-2 molecule, and one appears to recognize a phosphorylation site on MAP-2. That only one of the three antibodies immunolabels NFT suggests that the formation of the tangle involves some modification of the MAP-2 molecule. Our findings suggest that one aspect of Alzheimer-type neurofibrillary pathology is an aggregation of MAP-2 or MAP-2 fragments with altered neurofilamentous elements present in NFT. Normal interactive function, which putatively occurs between neurofilaments and MAP-2, may thus be disrupted in Alzheimer disease.",

A number of important methodological issues arise in studies of AD that do not typically arise in studies of other chronic diseases. These issues include: the definition of the primary study endpoint that is simple to measure and easy to interpret; proper design of trials that take into account that the patient population is very old: and the proper statistical analysis that addresses the high drop out rate and the multiple ways of measuring disease severity. Addressing these issues will speed the progress of the evaluation of promising compounds to prevent and treat AD.",

A speculative sequence of events is suggested by which neuronally-contained aluminosilicates might cleave or otherwise alter a normal cellular protein in such a manner that aggregates would arise that could interfere with cellular function and which also could act in a pseudo-infective manner, relaxing translational and transcriptional controls in the synthesis of the native protein. Some relevant experiments and potential therapies arising from the hypothesis presented are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Familial and genetic studies of high-incidence amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and parkinsonism-dementia among the Chamorro people of Guam were initiated in 1958 with the establishment of a prospective case-control registry. The major objective of this registry was to determine if first-degree relatives and spouses of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or parkinsonism-dementia had an increased risk of developing disease compared with relatives of nonaffected controls individually matched for age, sex, and village. At the time of its closing in 1963, the registry included 126 patients (77 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 42 with parkinsonism-dementia, and seven with both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and parkinsonism-dementia) and an equal number of controls; 994 living first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, and offspring) of patients and 1,218 of controls; and 88 living spouses of patients and 101 of controls. The present analysis of the 25-year follow-up study (1958-1983) demonstrated a significantly increased risk of developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or parkinsonism-dementia among parents, siblings, and spouses of patients, but not among relatives of controls. Offspring of both patients and controls showed no significantly increased risk of developing disease. The increased risk among spouses of patients and the lack of increase among their offspring, together with recent histochemical findings, support the contention that exogenous factors are strong contributors to the etiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and parkinsonism-dementia. The present results also demonstrate a declining incidence of both diseases.",

Of the 174 dementia cases, 98 were Alzheimer disease (AD), 41 were vascular dementia (VaD), and 35 were other dementias. In 42% of AD subjects, single memory deficit was the earliest problem, while in 56% of VaD cases, the tendency was to present two or more disturbances in the early stages. Slightly younger mean age at onset was reported in VaD than in AD cases. Our results support the hypothesis that the debut of the dementia is variable with any combination of symptoms. However, when memory problems start, assessment is needed. Among the neurological findings in the clinical examination, extrapyramidal signs were present in 25% of all dementia cases and in 20% of AD cases. A higher frequency of extrapyramidal signs was present in more severe cases, confirming previous reports of the unfavorable prognostic value of these signs.",

We compared BR88, an anti-serum to amino acids 1–12 of β/A4, with BR126, an antiserum to the sequence SEKLDFKDRVQS in τ protein, since τ protein is the only confirmed component of PHFs. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), both antibodies reacted with pronase-treated PHFs better after PHFs were treated with guanidine. τ protein shares no sequence homology with β/A4. Nevertheless, BR88 cross-reacted with human recombinant τ isoforms by ELISA and Western blot analysis with potencies comparable to those for anti-τ antibodies. BR88 reacted with a β/A4 peptide as well on a molar basis as with τ protein and showed some reactivity to the tubulin-binding region of τ protein. In conclusion, the β/A4 antiserum BR88 cross-reacts with τ protein, possibly explaining its reactivity with PHFs.",

Research on age at onset as a subtype has yielded conflicting results that may, in part, reflect different measurement approaches. Refinement of the measurement of change in AD should yield a clearer picture of subtypes, as would closer ties between neuropathologic and clinical work. Thus, it is suggested that future research should use measurement techniques that more closely characterize AD than do current approaches. In addition, progress would likely be through attempts to link clinical findings regarding rates of change to neuropathologic findings.",

Sixteen patients constituted the experimental group and 12 the control group. The last cognitive, functional, and affective evaluation in the experimental and control group was performed 8.2 and 8.5 months after baseline assessment, respectively. The experimental group had repeated cycles of 1-month ROT classes, and 5–7 weeks was allowed between each cycle. Differential change for MMSE score between the two groups was significant. In the experimental group, there was mild improvement in MMSE score (0.68 point) at the last assessment, whereas the control group declined (-2.58 points). This treatment effect on MMSE score (3.27 points) was controlled for potential confounders in a multiple regression analysis. Adjusted treatment effect, including age, education, baseline MMSE, disease duration, disease severity, number of diseases other than Alzheimer, and time elapsing from baseline to last assessment, was very slightly lower: 3.12. In the experimental group, treatment effect was evaluated by comparing ROT cycle changes and resting period changes. A clearly significant treatment effect was found for MMSE and verbal fluency.",

Of the 174 dementia cases, 98 were Alzheimer disease (AD), 41 were vascular dementia (VaD), and 35 were other dementias. In 42% of AD subjects, single memory deficit was the earliest problem, while in 56% of VaD cases, the tendency was to present two or more disturbances in the early stages. Slightly younger mean age at onset was reported in VaD than in AD cases. Our results support the hypothesis that the debut of the dementia is variable with any combination of symptoms. However, when memory problems start, assessment is needed. Among the neurological findings in the clinical examination, extrapyramidal signs were present in 25% of all dementia cases and in 20% of AD cases. A higher frequency of extrapyramidal signs was present in more severe cases, confirming previous reports of the unfavorable prognostic value of these signs.",

SETTING This was a community setting. PARTICIPANTS Age-stratified random population sample drawn from publicly available voter registration list. DESIGN Participants underwent assessments including cognitive testing and self-reported current and past driving status, instrumental activities of daily living, self-rated health, social supports, physical limitations, and depressive symptoms. We built multivariable logistic regression models to identify factors associated with having driven, having ceased driving, and reporting difficulties while driving. RESULTS In the multivariable model, never were more likely than ever to be older, female, less educated and to leave home less frequently. Former drivers were significantly older, more likely to be women, have lower test performance in the cognitive domain of attention, have more instrumental activity of daily living difficulties, leave home less frequently and have visual field deficits in the right eye than current drivers. Current drivers with reported driving difficulties were more likely than those without difficulties to have lower test performance in attention but higher in memory, were more likely to report depressive symptoms and to have both vision and hearing loss. CONCLUSION Age, female sex, marital status, and education appear to be associated with driving cessation. Cognitive and functional impairments, mood symptoms and physical health also seem to influence driving cessation and reduction. Our findings may have implications for clinicians in assessing and educating their patients and families on driving safety.",

An additional comparator involved prediction directly from a numeric value for baseline cognitive performance.A normal mixture model suggested 3 risk strata based on Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) T scores: high, intermediate, and low risk. Cox modeling of time to cognitive decline based on posterior probabilities for risk stratum membership yielded an estimated hazard ratio of 4.00 with 95% confidence interval 1.53-10.44 in comparing high risk membership to low risk; for intermediate risk membership versus low risk, the modeling yielded hazard ratio=2.29 and 95% confidence interval=0.98-5.33. Latent class analysis produced 3 groups, which did not have a clear ordering in terms of risk; however, one group exhibited appreciably greater hazard of cognitive decline. All methods for generating predictors of cognitive transition yielded statistically significant likelihood ratio statistics but modest concordance statistics.Posterior probabilities from mixture modeling allow for risk stratification that is data-driven and, in the case of CERAD T scores, modestly predictive of later cognitive decline. Incorporating other covariates may enhance predictions.",

We investigated whether CMBs—independent of other traditional markers of cerebral small vessel disease—are related to cognition. Chinese subjects from the population-based Singapore Chinese Eye Study, who failed an initial cognitive screening and were recruited into the ongoing Epidemiology of Dementia in Singapore Study, underwent neuropsychological testing and 3 T brain magnetic resonance imaging. The presence and number of CMBs were graded using Brain Observer Microbleed Scale on susceptibility-weighted images. Other magnetic resonance imaging lesions that were graded included presence of lacunes, white matter lesion, and total brain volumes. A comprehensive neuropsychological battery was administered and cognitive function was summarized as composite and domain-specific Z-scores. Among 282 subjects, 91 had any CMBs (32.3%), of whom 36 (12.8%) had multiple CMBs. CMBs were—independent of cardiovascular risk factors and other markers of cerebral small vessel disease—significantly associated with poorer cognitive function as reflected by composite Z-score (mean difference per CMB increase: −0.06; 95% confidence interval: −0.11, −0.01] and with domain-specific Z-scores including executive function, attention, and visuoconstruction. Among Chinese subjects CMBs were, independent of other concomitant markers of cerebral small vessel disease, associated with poorer cognitive function.",

The scale comprised 10 items categorized into two symptom domains of decreased spontaneity and impaired emotion. Also, two items for global assessment of the two symptom domains were added. Each item had seven anchor points from 0, representing no impairment, to 6, corresponding to complete impairment. Face validity of the scale was confirmed through the questionnaire survey. Nine neurologists independently assessed psychiatric symptoms in 30 videotaped post-stroke patients. Weighted kappa coefficients of more than 0.5 were noted for all the items except for one item. Data from three cerebral metabolism enhancers trials were used to examine the validity. Changes in severity in the Global Change Scale (GCS) from the baseline to the final assessment was assessed by raters' impression in these trials. Factorial validity of the scale was confirmed by the factor analysis. GCS in the three trials were considerably related to the summed scores of the items in the two categories. Namely, in the box plot figures, boxes of the middle 50% of data well differentiated the adjacent categories of GCS. However, overlap from vertical bars was observed. These results suggest reliability and validity of the scale.",

    "abstract": "Summary: Several therapeutic trials have been performed for vascular dementia, with drugs differing in type and mechanism of action. The results have been almost invariably inconclusive. Given the current notion that there are different subtypes of vascular dementia according to pathophysiological mechanisms, it is reasonable to suspect that one of the main causes of the disappointing results was that the study samples included patients not fitting with the rationale of selective treatments. Testing this hypothesis is difficult because characterization of patients in relation to different subtypes of vascular dementia is not available for most studies. However, attempts are ongoing to reclassify patients entered in some trials for post hoc subgroup analyses with some preliminary interesting results. We propose that (1) specific subtypes of vascular dementia should be the target in any single trial using a treatment with a proper rationale; and (2) subcortical vascular dementia, caused by small vessel disease leading to lacunar infarcts and subcortical white matter changes, represents a clinically and radiologically well-defined entity to be considered for future trials designed specifically for testing adequate drugs.",

A 36-year-old woman presented with repetitive seizures, a 5-year history of progressive behavioral and cognitive changes, and an affected sibling. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed an ischemic lesion in the left medial temporal lobe. Extensive evaluation of juvenile stroke revealed that viral and autoimmune encephalitides, serum lactate and pyruvate levels, and cerebrospinal fluid composition were all normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was notable of thinning of the corpus callosum and caudate and frontotemporal cortical atrophy, in addition to the ischemic lesion. Whole exome sequencing revealed a homozygous mutation (c.A257T; p.D86V) in TREM2. The present case expands the clinical phenotype of Nasu-Hakola disease and further suggests that TREM2 pathway might have role in vessel wall health.",

Here, we report the case of a 67-year-old man with a history of progressive impairment of behavioral and cognitive functions, including apathy, inhibition, tendency to mutism, and deficits in complex planning skills. Neurological examination revealed pyramidalism in the lower limbs. Brain imaging showed symmetrical confluent frontal leukoencephalopathy, bilateral frontal calcifications, and thinning of the corpus callosum. The diagnosis was confirmed by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor. As far as we know, this is the first documented case in Spain.

In young-onset dementia (YOD), especially Alzheimer’s disease, the symptoms that stand out in the initial stage are deficits in attention, visual-spatial function, praxis, and language. The present study aims to investigate what components of EF differ in young and late-onset dementia (LOD) and its impact on awareness and its domains. Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, we included 44 people with YOD and 70 with LOD. We assessed awareness and its domains, cognition, dementia severity, EF, functionality, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Results: The YOD group was more impaired in general cognition ( P =0.017) and had a worse performance in Wechsler Digit Span Backward (DSB) ( P =0.007) and Phonemic fluency task (FAS) ( P =0.046) tests. In the LOD group, deficits in EF had a greater impact on awareness and on most domains (awareness total score, cognitive functioning and health condition, functional activity impairments and social function). Conclusions: Our study findings support the heterogeneity of awareness, not only with regard to the difference between the domains and the measures of EF, but also to the groups studied.",

    "abstract": "Background: Verbal and visuospatial memory impairments are common to Alzheimer disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), but the patterns of decline in these domains may reflect genetic and lifestyle influences. The latter may be pertinent to populations such as the Amish who have unique lifestyle experiences. Methods: Our data set included 420 Amish and 401 CERAD individuals. Sex-adjusted, age-adjusted, and education-adjusted Z-scores were calculated for the recall portions of the Constructional Praxis Delay (CPD) and Word List Delay (WLD). ANOVAs were then used to examine the main and interaction effects of cohort (Amish, CERAD), cognitive status (case, control), and sex on CPD and WLD Z-scores. Results: The Amish performed better on the CPD than the CERAD cohort. In addition, the difference between cases and controls on the CPD and WLD were smaller in the Amish and Amish female cases performed better on the WLD than the CERAD female cases. Discussion: The Amish performed better on the CPD task, and ADRD-related declines in CPD and WLD were less severe in the Amish. In addition, Amish females with ADRD may have preferential preservation of WLD. This study provides evidence that the Amish exhibit distinct patterns of verbal and visuospatial memory loss associated with aging and ADRD.",

Methods: We calculated proportions of D/D+AD and AD/D+AD deaths as proxies of national diagnosis and certification habits. Pearson correlation coefficients ( r ) were estimated to assess the associations of proportions with the mortality rates of dementia or AD among adults aged 75 to 84 years across 38 countries. Results: The countries with a high preference for recording dementia as the UCOD were Taiwan and Latvia with proportion of D/D+AD deaths of 92% and 88%, respectively, and those with a high preference for recording AD as the UCOD were Slovenia, Turkey, and Poland with proportion of AD/D+AD deaths of 100%, 99%, and 89%, respectively. The r values for the proportions and mortality rate for dementia and AD were 0.67 (95% CI: 0.44-0.81) and 0.46 (95% CI: 0.16-0.68), respectively. Conclusion: We identified a small number of countries with obvious natonal diagnosis and certification habits preferring dementia or AD and had moderate effects on international variations in the mortality rates of dementia and AD.",

It is a severe neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects the elderly and causes significant brain cell death. According to the most complete scientific research, the APOE gene, which encodes the APOE protein, maybe the key to identifying the likely cause of delayed AD. The development of plaques and tangles, as well as increased amyloid (amyloid-β) levels and deposition, have been linked to APOE4 . Pathogenic mutations in this gene can impact how beta-amyloid deposits and how they are cleared from the body. In this study, we report a novel pathogenic mutation, Arg160Leu, in APOE that was identified in a Moroccan patient. The magnetic resonance imaging of this 67-year-old woman revealed hippocampal shrinkage, and the results of her cognition testing revealed that she is suffering from severe AD. The current study may increase awareness of the genetic risk factors for AD caused by APOE4 mutations.",

    "abstract": "Objective: We examined how cognitive complaint types (CCTs) correlate with cognitive testing, perceived stress, and symptom distress in older adults with normal cognition and dementia. Methods: Older adults (n = 259) with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, or mild-stage Alzheimer disease completed cognitive testing and self-report measures (Cognitive Difficulties Scale, Global Distress Index, Perceived Stress Scale). Cross-sectional analyses examined: (1) CCT composition by classification method,( 2) CCTs by diagnostic group, (3) correlations of CCTs with cognitive testing scores, and (4) correlations of CCTs with perceived stress and symptom distress. Results: CCTs derived from 2 classification approaches loaded onto 4 factors: memory, attention-concentration (AC), temporal orientation, and praxis. Memory contained complaints about both memory and executive functioning. AC contained both classifications of AC complaints. Complaints about AC (AC1 and AC2) differed by diagnostic group (all P &lt; 0.05). One of 2 classifications of AC (AC1) complaints discerned between impaired and unimpaired long-delay memory scores (both P &lt; 0.05). In multivariable analyses, that same classification of AC (AC1) complaints correlated with higher perceived stress (both P &lt; 0.001) but not symptom distress (both P &gt; 0.05). Conclusion: CCTs showed a factor structure that was mostly robust between classification methods; however, some content-divergent CCTs shared factors, suggesting construct overlap. Relatively slight variations in content altered how CCTs correlated with diagnostic groups, perceived stress, and symptom distress. Most CCTs did not discern between impaired and unimpaired cognitive test scores. Research is needed to better understand CCTs as clinical markers and targets of clinical interventions.",

We analyzed longitudinal data from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center Unified Data Set (March 2015 to December 2021). Analyses included individuals who were cognitively normal and who had nonmissing assessment of PTSD at the initial visit and had at least 1 follow-up visit with cognitive impairment. We compared the difference in the mean neuropsychiatric symptom score at the first Unified Data Set visit versus the first visit with a Clinical Dementia Rating of 0.5 between those with and without a history of PTSD. The mean neuropsychiatric symptom score change did not differ between those with and without a history of PTSD (1.06 vs. 0.77, respectively; P =0.79). The null results found in this study warrant future research. Several methodological limitations might explain these results.",

Identification of patients who are presymptomatic. by discovering early markers of Alzheimer disease will be essential. Clinical trials methodology must be devised to accommodate atypical outcome measures, prolonged trials, and large sample sizes without posing serious ethical considerations regarding placebo administration. Finally, regulatory issues that discourage development of drugs that will be in complicated, expensive and lengthy clinical trials need to be addressed. This paper reviews these issues, and offers some suggestions.",

    "abstract": "Summary: The spatial patterns of discrete 13-amyloid (Aβ) deposits in brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) were studied using a statistical method based on linear regression, the results being compared with the more conventional variance/mean (V/M) method. Both methods suggested that Aβ deposits occurred in clusters (400 to<12,800 um in diameter) in all but I of the 42 tissues examined. In many tissues, a regular periodicity of the Aβ deposit clusters parallel to the tissue boundary was observed. In 23 of 42 (55%) tissues, the two methods revealed essentially the same spatial patterns of AB deposits; in 15 of 42 (36%), the regression method indicated the presence of clusters at a scale not revealed by the V/M method; and in 4 of 42 (9%), there was no agreement between the two methods. Perceived advantages of the regression method are that there is a greater probability of detecting clustering at multiple scales, the dimension of larger Aβ clusters can be estimated more accurately, and the spacing between the clusters may be estimated. However, both methods may be useful, with the regression method providing greater resolution and the V/M method providing greater simplicity and ease of interpretation. Estimates of the distance between regularly spaced Aβ clusters were in the range 2,200-11,800 um, depending on tissue and cluster size. The regular periodicity of Aβ deposit clusters in many tissues would be consistent with their development in relation to clusters of neurons that give rise to specific neuronal projections.",

    "abstract": "The progressive dysfunction and loss of neurons in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is accompanied by marked structural changes in innumerable neuronal cell bodies and neurites, particularly in limbic and association cortices. Qualitatively indistinguishable neuronal lesions occur in much smaller numbers during normal aging. Highly insoluble paired helical filaments (PHF) and antigenically related straight filaments accumulate in perikaryal tangles and the neurites of neuritic plaques. In addition, PHF antibodies reveal the presence of PHF antigens in many individual cortical neurites not clustered into discrete plaques. Recent studies in several laboratories indicate that altered forms of the microtubule-associated phosphoprotein, tau, are important constituents of PHF. Other neuronal cytoskeletal proteins, particularly microtubule-associated protein 2 and neurofilament, have also been associated with PHF. In contrast, the extracellular amyloid filaments found in the centers of many neuritic plaques and in cortical and meningeal vessels appear to be composed of hydrophobic low molecular weight protein(s) distinct from PHF. A major question for further study regards the cellular origin and role of microvascular amyloid in the degeneration of neurites of multiple neurotransmitter specificities in AD cortex. The widespread neuritic and perikaryal alterations in brain tissue are likely to represent, at least in part, the morphological substrate of cortical dysfunction in AD.",

The risk of iatrogenic transmission of CJD has long been recognized, but until recently, the low prevalence of the disorder and minimal use of therapeutic products derived from human tissues may have limited the risk. From 1963 to 1985, approximately 10,000 children received pit-hGH. These patients, exposed to pooled products potentially contaminated with the CJD agent, may have significantly increased the number of individuals whose blood and tissues could transmit CJD. This possibility as well as data on the pathophysiology of CJD and scrapie, a related disease of animals, should guide the development of practices that would limit iatrogenic spread of CJD.",

The present study addresses the issue of whether these determinants are located on the paired helical filaments or on other components of the neurofibrillary tangle. Sections from postmortem brains from Alzheimer disease patients were stained by using Bodian's silver method or immunostained by using poly- and monoclonal antibodies to neurofilaments and polyclonal antibodies to microtubules. Bodian's silver stain has an intense affinity for neurofibrillary tangles and has been shown to bind to specific domains of neurofilament subunits. The antibodies to neurofilaments used here immunostain most or all of the neurofibrillary tangles present in the sections whereas the antiserum to microtubule protein immunoreacted with about half of the neurofibrillary tangles. All of the antibodies as well as Bodian's silver stain reacted with the paired helical filaments. The epitopes that we have shown to be present in the paired helical filament, in contrast to the corresponding epitopes present in normal neuronal cytoskeleton, are insoluble in ionic detergent. It is concluded that these epitopes are integral components of the paired helical filaments and that, at least in part, paired helical filaments are derived from altered elements of the normal neuronal cytoskeleton.",

Prevalence rates were found to vary as a function of methodological differences between studies. However, despite these differences, the relationship between prevalence and age was found to be consistent across studies, with rates doubling every 5.1 years. Across studies, Alzheimer's disease (AD) was found to be more common in women, with a tendency for multi-infarct dementia (MID) to be more common in men. There were also national differences in the relative prevalence of AD and MID, with MID being more commmon in Japanese and Russian studies, no difference in Finnish and American studies, and an excess of AD in other Western European countries.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To increase understanding of the potential in elderly persons for disability related to behavioral side effects ofanxiolytic medications, cognitive and psychomotor effects ofclinical doses ofbuspirone and a popular intermediate-acting benzodiazepine, alprazolam, were examined in carefully screened, healthy elderly subjects. Method: Sixty subjects recruited through community organizations and newspaper advertisements and screened on the basis ofhistory, physical examination, and laboratory studies were randomly assigned to one of three drug treatment groups. After 2 days of washout placebo, subjects were given 0.25 mg t.i.d. ofalprazolam, S mg t.i.d. ofbuspirone, or placebo three times a day for a total of 14 days in a double-blind design. Behavioral assessments were completed beginning 1 hour after ingestion of medication on the second washout placebo day, day 1 of the treatment period, and day I 4 of the treatment period. Tests included the continuous performance test, recall memory for word lists, digit-symbol substitution, retention of pictorial stimuli over I hour, the Profile of Mood States, and subjective ratings of mental status. Results: Buspirone did not affect reaction time, vigilance, psychomotor speed, or memory function. Alprazolam had minimal effects on vigilance, psychomotor speed, and memory on the first treatment day and had no effects after repeated doses. Conclusions: Buspirone did not produce behavioral side effects that could lead to disability, and alprazolam had minimal side effects. Because the patients were carefully screened, it is unclear whether these medications in the doses used would have more side effects in less healthy elderly patients.

    "abstract": "Adverse drug reactions causing cognitive impairment are an important problem in the elderly. Thirty-five patients with adverse drug reaction were identified among more than 300 patients evaluated for cognitive impairment and compared with patients without adverse drug reaction. Sedative hypnotic agents, especially long-acting benzodiazepines, were the commonest drugs associated with cognitive impairment in this population. The number of drugs used, use of sedative hypnotics and antihypertensives, and falling were strongly associated with adverse reactions in logistic regression analyses. The relative odds of an adverse reaction associated with cognitive impairment increased as the number of prescription drugs increased, exceeding 9.0 for patients taking four or more prescription drugs. Adverse drug reactions are an important source of excess morbidity in patients with dementia or suspected dementia. Strategies that could minimize this problem include a high index of suspicion, drug-free trials in suspected cases, and careful monitoring of drug therapy.",

    "abstract": "Recent reports suggest that cultivated nonneuronal cells from individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD) and other specific hereditary neuro-degenerative disorders show hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents such as x-rays and radiomimetic chemicals. The hypothesis proposed is that a number of chronic neurologic degenerations, including AD, may be the result of accumulation of damaged DNA, resulting from a defect in DNA repair. We investigated this hypothesis by evaluating cells from individuals from pedigrees of familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) for hypersensitivity to x-irradiation. Sensitivity was assayed by viability measured by trypan blue dye exclusion and micronucleus formation. We tested B-lymphoblastoid cell lines from nine patients and nine unaffected family members from pedigrees with FAD, three unrelated controls, three ataxia telangiectasia (AT) patients, and three Down syndrome individuals. The AT cell lines showed the expected reduced viability and increased micronucleus formation after x-ray treatment. The FAD and control lines showed marked heterogeneity with both assays. There was no significant differences between the FAD patients and controls. The wide variability in the response of cell lines from controls and patients indicates the need for more sensitive assays for detection of radiation sensitivity in cells from various neurologic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Hirano bodies are eosinophilic, rod-shaped intraneuronal inclusions whose frequency increases with age and with Alzheimer's disease. To investigate their composition and possible relationship to the neuronal cytoskeleton, we employed immunocytochemistry and immunoelectronmicroscopy by using antisera to cytoskeletal proteins. The presence of actin, alpha-actinin, vinculin and tropomyosin was demonstrated diffusely throughout the Hirano body. The presence of these proteins supports the contention that Hirano bodies are derived from an abnormal organization of the neuronal cytoskeleton. The staining of Hirano bodies with fluorescent labelled phalloidin, a probe with a unique affinity for F-actin, indicates that the actin in Hirano bodies is in the F-state. Results of high voltage electron microscopy on 1.0 and 0.5 micron sections confirm the purely filamentous nature of Hirano bodies. These findings suggest that the mechanism of formation of Hirano bodies is different from that of the neurofibrillary tangle, another characteristic intraneuronal inclusion seen in Alzheimer patients.",

The Israeli National Neurologic Disease Register and clinical records of all patients discharged from hospitals between 1974 and 1983 with a neurologic or psychiatric diagnosis suggestive of dementia were reviewed. A total of 71 Jewish patients with onset of PDAT between 1974 and 1978 was ascertained. The age at onset in these patients ranged from 43 to 60 years. The median survival was 8.1 years, with slightly longer survival if onset occurred before age 55 years, even after correction for expected mortality according to age and sex. The average annual incidence rate per 100,000 population at risk was 2.4 in the population aged 40 through 60 years. Although the incidence rates were slightly greater for women, the difference between the rates by sex was not statistically significant. The age- and sex-adjusted incidence of PDAT per 100,000 population was significantly higher in those born in Europe or America (2.9) than in those born in Africa or Asia (1.4). No significant difference in survival was found between these two groups. The curve of the incidence rates by age for PDAT in Israel is continuous with that for senile dementia of the Alzheimer type collected by similar methods elsewhere, which suggests that one disease process may account for both conditions.",

Manifestations included dementia, lack of volition, emotional lability, small-stepped gait, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, grasp reflex, pyramidal signs, paraplegia in flexion, and akinetic mutism. Pathologically, there was diffuse incomplete softening of white matter in all cases. Both lacunes and diffuse softening were found predominantly in the frontal lobes. The prominent clinical features were therefore frontal lobe symptoms, with good correlation between the symptoms and the distribution of pathologic lesions.",

    "abstract": "The lack of a suitable animal model for Alzheimer research continues to be an impediment to the elucidation of the pathogenesis of the histological features of this condition, including PHF. Chronic ethanol intoxication induces the formation of PHF in young rats. Abnormalities in number and subcellular distribution of nematosomes in DRG of rats subject to chronic ethanol feeding has been noted by us. We present evidence that a vitamin A deficient diet promotes the formation of PHF and nematosomes in DRG of rats chronically intoxicated with ethanol. Three groups of young male Wistar BR rats were implanted with a gastrostomy cannula and infused with the following liquid diet: first group received 30% of total calories as corn oil, 32% ethanol, 25% protein with the balance as dextrose; 5% lard was substituted for the corn oil in the second group; the third group received 25% corn oil and was maintained in a vitamin A deficient state. Control animals were pair-fed the diet and isocaloric in dextrose with the experimental animals' alcohol intake. Animals were sacrificed at approximately 150 days and DRG were fixed in situ with a solution containing 2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde. The increased number of nematosomes in all ethanol treated rats was prominent and more so in animals with a vitamin A deficient diet. A large amount of lipofuscin was usually associated with these thread-like structures which were of several types. Nematosomes commonly enclosed neurofibrillary tangles of PHF in animals treated with the ethanol-vitamin A deficient diet. PHF were rarely observed in other animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "One hundred consecutive outpatients with dementia were prospectively studied to investigate the diagnoses of dementing diseases and to correlate these diagnoses with socioeconomic status and with education. Alzheimer disease was the most common cause of dementia (54%), followed by vascular dementia (20%). Eight patients presented with potentially reversible causes of dementia. These frequencies are similar to those reported by case register studies from Western Europe and the United States. We did not find differences in the frequencies of the dementing diseases according to socioeconomic status or education. Alzheimer disease was the most common cause of dementia in all socioeconomic classes. Potentially reversible dementias, vascular dementias, and other secondary dementias were not more frequent in the lower socioeconomic strata. There was a trend to a higher frequency of vascular dementia among patients with less education, but this was not statistically significant.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: The course of dementia may differ between men and women. Men, for example, are more likely to exhibit aggression. It is unclear if sex differences are present at initial presentation. The present study examines sex differences among patients at initial referral to a memory clinic. Materials and Methods: Three hundred seventy-five (159 males, 216 females) patients referred to the University of Saskatchewan’s Rural and Remote Memory Clinic participated. Data were collected from patients and caregivers at initial assessment. Cognitive, functional, and demographic information were compared between males and females. Results: Males and females presented to the clinic at similar ages. Females were more likely to have a son or daughter caregiver and to live alone. Males were more likely to be currently working. No statistically significant differences were found for cognitive or functional assessment scores. Discussion: Within this rural and remote sample, there was equivalence between male and female level of cognitive decline, function and neuropsychiatric symptoms at initial referral. Both sexes were of similar ages at the time of initial presentation. These findings may provide reassurance to patients and their family members as it does not appear that patients of one sex were referred later than the other.",

This cross-sectional study (n=196) aimed to examine the moderating effect of sex on the relationships between both perceived social support and salivary cortisol levels and NPS of AD patients. Only in women, greater cortisol levels were associated with higher scores in Neuropsychiatric Inventory mood, agitation, and frontal subscales whereas higher Psychosocial Support Questionnaire scores were related to lower scores in Neuropsychiatric Inventory mood and psychosis subscales. Given the relevance that sex differences might have on the design of preventive strategies, present findings should be confirmed in longitudinal studies.",

Methods: We selected 18,097 individuals who participated in 2 National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center visits between June 2005 and May 2020, with completed collateral rating of functioning on activities of daily living assessed by the Functional Activities Questionnaire. Both distribution-based (ie, regression-based reliable change indices) and anchor-based (ie, typical change associated with advancing a syndromal stage for clinically meaningful difference) methods were applied for individuals classified as: unimpaired cognition, mild cognitive impairment, mild dementia, moderate dementia, or severe dementia. Results: There were marked differences in the distribution of functional ratings depending on their syndromal stage. There were also differences in the functional change associated with advancing across different syndromal stages. These informed stage-specific metrics for reliable change indices and clinically meaningful differences. Conclusions: Our indices provide a hitherto unavailable method that allows clinicians to determine whether observed functional change is reliable or meaningful based on syndromal stage.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: The Perceived Research Burden Assessment (PeRBA) was developed to measure participant perceptions of burden in research studies. This study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of this assessment using Rasch analysis in participants in the longitudinal studies of the Alzheimer disease (AD) and their family members. Methods: PeRBA was administered to 443 participants in studies of AD and 212 family members across 4 Alzheimer Disease Research Centers. We used Rasch analysis to examine PeRBA’s psychometric properties, and data-model fit both at item and scale levels. Results: PeRBA demonstrated good reliability and item and person fit for participants and family members. A few items did not fit the model for participants or family members. Areas of content redundancy were found in items assessing similar amounts of perceived research burden. Areas of content gaps were also found, with no items assessing certain levels of perceived research burden. Conclusion: Analysis results support the good overall psychometric properties of PeRBA among research participants in studies of AD and their family members. Recommendations have been provided to improve the assessment, including rewording items and adding items that could account for a broader range of perceived research burden.",

Two complementary techniques, differential display and gene expression arrays, allow researchers to identify differentially expressed genes. These techniques promote a systematic examination of gene expression. In conjunction with a technique that allows the isolation of mRNA from individual cells, differential display and gene expression array technology can be used to examine AD-induced changes in gene expression patterns in individual cells. This area of research should elucidate information that will provide a greater understanding of the pathological processes in AD and aid in the development of therapeutic agents.",

Determination of risk factors for post-traumatic neurodegeneration in patients with TBI is critical given the high incidence of TBI. We hypothesized that cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities, in addition to TBI severity, are associated with the risk of post-traumatic development of Alzheimer disease dementia (ADD). A case-controlled retrospective study was conducted using medical records and medical insurance data of 5642 patients with TBI admitted to a tertiary trauma center over a 12-year period, to assess risk factors of developing ADD after TBI. Logistic regression shows that presence of post-traumatic amnesia ( P= 0.03) and chronic vascular lesions ( P= 0.04) are significantly associated with development of ADD after TBI. This innovative preliminary study is the first to explore risk factors for post-traumatic ADD. Further association studies are essential to optimize care following TBI.",

Two institutions closely involved in this programme, the Society for the Study of Human Biology and the British Society for Research in Ageing, held a joint symposium in 1984 to consider human ageing and longevity from an interdisciplinary point of view. The resulting book has four main sections: the evolution and genetics of ageing, biological age assessment, demographic and social aspects, and the nutritional and physiological aspects of ageing and longevity. The fundamental nature of the subject will generate interest across a wide range of biological and medical disciplines.",

In this study, uninjured basal forebrain cholinergic neurons did not die after excitotoxic ablation of their target neurons in young adult rats, indicating that they are either not dependent on neurotrophic factors for survival or can obtain trophic support from other sources after target neurons are lost. This finding suggests that cholinergic cell death in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease is not due solely to a loss of target neurons or factors provided by them.",

Among discordant pairs of twins and siblings, frequencies were significantly greater in affected than intact partners. There was no significant difference in allelic frequencies between twins with a positive family history and twins with a negative family history. The ∊4 allele was more common in the sibling sample selected for family aggregation of AD than the twin sample. Several lines of evidence indicate that while the ∊4 allele appears to be one risk factor for AD, other etiological factors must be considered as well.",

    "abstract": "All major psychiatric disorders aggregate in families. For most disorders, both genes and environmental factors play an important role in this aggregation. While recent work has tended to concentrate on the importance of genetic factors, this report focuses on the potential importance of environmental risk factors which themselves aggregate in families. In particular, this article examines how much of the familial aggregation of a psychiatric disorder may result from the familial aggregation of a risk factor. The model is illustrated and then applied to putative familial risk factors for schizophrenia and depression. The results of the model suggest that if parental loss and exposure to pathogenic rearing practices are true risk factors for depression, then they could account for a significant proportion of the familial aggregation of depression. By contrast, the model predicts that even if obstetric injury and low social class are true risk factors for schizophrenia, they together would account for only a very small proportion of the tendency for schizophrenia to aggregate in families.",

We utilized single photon emission computed tomography andN-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine iodine 123 to evaluate regional cerebral blood flow in nine patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), five healthy elderly control subjects, and two patients with multi-infarct dementia. We found that all subjects with AD demonstrated flow deficits in temporoparietal cortex bilaterally, and that the ratio of activity in bilateral temporoparietal cortex to activity in the whole slice allowed the differentiation of all patients with AD from both the controls and from the patients with multi-infarct dementia. Furthermore, this ratio showed a strong correlation with disease severity in the AD group. Single photon emission computed tomography appears to be useful in the differential diagnosis of dementia and reflects clinical features of the disease.",

Cerebral glucose metabolism was measured using positron emission tomography (PET) and 2-[18-F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG). The affected twin had a seven year history of progressive cognitive impairment and was severely demented. Neuropsychological testing of the affected twin demonstrated marked deficits in all areas of cognitive function. The asymptomatic twin showed some impairment on tests of perceptual organisation and delayed recall. The affected twin had loss of gray matter and ventricular enlargement on QCT and MRI compared with healthy controls (p less than 0.05). He also had frontal and parietal lobe hypometabolism and increased asymmetry of metabolism on PET compared to both his twin and healthy age-matched controls (p less than 0.05). PET, QCT, and MRI distinguished changes in the twin with DAT compared with his brother and healthy controls. Although the subtle neuropsychological abnormalities of the asymptomatic twin may be signs of early DAT, they were not accompanied by any changes in regional cerebral metabolism or brain structure.",

    "abstract": ": A detailed comparative study of RNA transcripts isolated from the neocortex of control and Alzheimer postmortem brains was made to determine whether morphological changes in the chromatin of Alzheimer neurons and glia, which we reported earlier, are accompanied by changes in the products of transcription. A number of parameters were determined including the yields of total and mRNA per gram of tissue, the relative proportions of polyadenylated [poly(A) +] mRNA in the total RNA, the size distribution of the transcripts and the length of their poly(A) tails, and the nature of their in vitro translation products. The levels of endogenous RNase activity were also measured. The effect of the agonal process on the transcript complement was examined by Northern blotting of a cloned human heat-shock cDNA to total human brain RNA. Our results reveal that the yields of total RNA, unadenylated mRNA, and poly(A) tail lengths from Alzheimer neocortex samples do not differ significantly from those of control and non Alzheimer dementia neocortex. On the other hand we find a significant reduction in the levels and proportion of poly(A)+ mRNA in the Alzheimer samples as compared to control brain samples. Quantitative rather than qualitative differences were observed in the in vitro translation products when programmed with control and Alzheimer mRNA. No differences were found in the levels of RNase activity between control and Alzheimer simples. Heatshock mRNA transcripts were detected in brain samples from patients in whom fever was associated with death. The direct correlation of reduced poly(A)+ mRNA and chromatin condensation in Alzheimer neocortex suggests a cause-and-effect relationship. Whether all transcribed genes are affected or only a specific subset has yet to be determined.",

    "abstract": "Neurofibrillary tangles are a prominent feature in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and in neurones of the cerebral cortex of people suffering from senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT)1. Similar neuronal changes also occur in elderly Down's syndrome patients and to a lesser degree in intellectually normal old people2. The tangles are composed of bundles of paired helically twisted 10–13 nm filaments (PHF)3,4, which may be either neurofilaments3 or microtubules5. Attempts to isolate tangles from postmortem material have met with some success6 but there is disagreement over the molecular weight (Mr) of presumptive PHF proteins enriched in these fractions, with conflicting claims of 50,000 (refs 6,7) and 20,000 (ref. 8). Initially it seemed that the 50,000-Mr putative PHF protein and tubulin cross-react9,10 but this result may have been a serological artefact, due to tangle-associated material in preparations of microtubule proteins used as immunogen and as test antigen11. We have used monoclonal antibodies to show here that neurofilament antigens are present in neurofibrillary tangles.",

Neurofilament and microtubule proteins were substrates for this enzyme but the insoluble neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) isolated from Alzheimer's disease brain were not substrates. In vitro cross-linking of neurofilaments and microtubules by the enzyme did not produce paired helical filaments (PHF), which are the major ultrastructural component of NFT.

    "abstract": ": Cytoplasmic and pellet fractions from postmortem temporal cortex from eight cases of neuropathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease, one case of cerebrovascular dementia, and five controls were examined by sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. No differences were observed in the cytoplasmic proteins from the five controls and the case of cerebrovascular dementia. In five cases of Alzheimer's disease with neurone loss, there was a major loss of a cytoplasmic 55,000-dalton protein identified as tubulin and variable reductions in cytoplasmic proteins of molecular weights of 28,000, 30,000, 92,000, and 200,000 daltons. Three cases of Alzheimer's disease had no detectable neurone loss; two of these cases had protein patterns indistinguishable from the controls and one showed some reduction in soluble tubulin only. These results indicate that decreases of particular proteins in the temporal cortex in Alzheimer's disease may be associated with neurone loss.",

The present study examined the value of these tests in the distinction between SDAT and dementias of other etiologies. Our results replicated those of Storandt and coworkers in that these tests did distinguish normal persons from patients with both SDAT and other dementias. These tests, however, did not accurately differentiate among the dementias. These results indicate that assessment batteries utilizing additional procedures to supplement cognitive testing are indicated to more accurately discriminate among the dementias.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the evidence for a genetic etiology of Alzheimer's Disease. Three groups of cases are identified; the first being those with a consistently early age of onset, in which autosomal dominant inheritance can be established. These families may require genetic counseling, and represent an extraordinary resource for research. There are early onset cases without a strong genetic component, and later onset cases generally show only weak evidence of hereditary disease. Some of the apparent distinctions between these groups may result from methodologic problems, especially if the age of onset of symptoms is highly variable in the majority of families. Studies of associations between Alzheimer's Disease and Down's Syndrome suggest a role for genes on chromosome 21 in the genesis of the pathologic features, and testable hypotheses can be identified. Attempts to link the development of Alzheimer's Disease to the presence of specific inherited markers have generally been unsuccessful to date, but there are some promising findings. Recent progress in understanding the molecular basis of other inherited diseases is reviewed in relation to attempts to understand the possible molecular basis of Alzheimer's Disease. A limiting factor in future studies will probably be the availability of cells and tissues from pedigrees demonstrating autosomal dominant inheritance of this disorder.",

Each group has a characteristic mean age of onset. A range of neurodegenerative diseases (including Alzheimer-type dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) can also be classified in this way, with similar characteristic mean ages of onset. The emergence of these diseases in later middle age, and the interdependence of age of onset and the type of familial occurrence suggest that these pathological processes are related to those genetic mechanisms which determine senescence. It is argued that the majority of cases of transmissible dementia arise, not from infection, but from the expression of endogenous virogene sequences as part of the aging processes.",

Vascular lesions were limited to the brain and were characterized by granulomatous and necrotizing angiitis of the small leptomeningeal and intracortical vessels. Amyloid deposits were present in large amounts along vascular segments showing vasculitis, in foreign body giant cells, in plaque-like structures surrounding diseased perforating arterioles, along cortical microvessels and in many neuritic plaques.

It was hypothesized this would allow a more accurate distinction to be made between normal adults (n = 20) and patients with dementia (n = 19) on the basis of observed P3 latencies. Two models for predicting latency were assessed. The first, which used age alone as a predictor, explained 18% of the normal variation in latency and misclassified 40% of the patients. The second model, which incorporated scores on psychometric tests, explained 74% of latency variation and misclassified 20% of the patients. Scores on the Similarities subtest of the WAIS and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, however, correctly identified 92% of the patients. This finding casts doubt on the justification of the P3 latency measures to diagnose dementia.",

The most frequent symptom leading to admission was mental deterioration in the dementia group and epileptic seizures in the other group. The location of the tumours was similar in both groups.

Relative to their normal siblings, maternal age at time of birth of the ADs was not significantly increased, nor were the AD individuals more likely to be later-borns in their sibships. The percentage of individuals bearing children was 75.7% for AD versus 70.8% for their normal siblings. For those ever bearing children, ADs produced slightly more children than their normal siblings (average of 3.92 versus 3.67). It was concluded that AD is not associated with either reduced fertility or increased parental age.",

Clinical drug trials currently being carried out are being designed either to improve the core symptoms of the disease or to alter the natural rate of decline.
