    "abstract": "As they travel through space, some light beams rotate. Such light beams have angular momentum. There are two particularly important ways in which a light beam can rotate: if every polarization vector rotates, the light has spin; if the phase structure rotates, the light has orbital angular momentum (OAM), which can be many times greater than the spin. Only in the past 20 years has it been realized that beams carrying OAM, which have an optical vortex along the axis, can be easily made in the laboratory. These light beams are able to spin microscopic objects, give rise to rotational frequency shifts, create new forms of imaging systems, and behave within nonlinear material to give new insights into quantum optics.",

    "abstract": "Orbital angular momentum (OAM), which describes the \"phase twist\" (helical phase pattern) of light beams, has recently gained interest due to its potential applications in many diverse areas. Particularly promising is the use of OAM for optical communications since: (i) coaxially propagating OAM beams with different azimuthal OAM states are mutually orthogonal, (ii) inter-beam crosstalk can be minimized, and (iii) the beams can be efficiently multiplexed and demultiplexed. As a result, multiple OAM states could be used as different carriers for multiplexing and transmitting multiple data streams, thereby potentially increasing the system capacity. In this paper, we review recent progress in OAM beam generation/detection, multiplexing/demultiplexing, and its potential applications in different scenarios including free-space optical communications, fiber-optic communications, and RF communications. Technical challenges and perspectives of OAM beams are also discussed.",

We start by reviewing protocolsof quantum key distribution based on discrete variable systems. Next we consider aspects of device independence, satellite challenges, and high rate protocols based on continuous variable systems. We will then discuss the ultimate limits of point-to-point private communications and how quantum repeaters and networks may overcome these restrictions. Finally, we will discuss some aspects of quantum cryptography beyond standard quantum key distribution, including quantum data locking and quantum digital signatures.",

Key recent theoretical contributions to the modeling and analysis of WGM systems are highlighted. Subsequently we review the state of the art of WGM sensors by outlining efforts made to date to improve current detection limits. Proposals in this vein are numerous and range, for example, from plasmonic enhancements and active cavities to hybrid optomechanical sensors, which are already working in the shot noise limited regime. In parallel to furthering WGM sensitivity, efforts to improve the time resolution are beginning to emerge. We therefore summarize the techniques being pursued in this vein. Ultimately WGM sensors aim for real-world applications, such as measurements of force and temperature, or alternatively gas and biosensing. Each such application is thus reviewed in turn, and important achievements are discussed. Finally, we adopt a more forward-looking perspective and discuss the outlook of WGM sensors within both a physical and biological context and consider how they may yet push the detection envelope further.",

Multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) equalization methods developed for wireless communication can be applied as an electronic method to equalize mode crosstalk. Optical approaches, including differential modal group delay management, strong mode coupling, and multicore fibers, are necessary to bring the computational complexity for MIMO mode crosstalk equalization to practical levels. Progress in passive devices, such as (de)multiplexers, and active devices, such as amplifiers and switches, which are considered straightforward challenges in comparison with mode crosstalk, are reviewed.

    "abstract": "We present a detailed overview of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in single-mode optical fibers. The review is divided into two parts. In the first part, we discuss the fundamentals of SBS. A particular emphasis is given to analytical calculation of the backreflected power and SBS threshold (SBST) in optical fibers with various index profiles. For this, we consider acousto-optic interaction in the guiding geometry and derive the modal overlap integral, which describes the dependence of the Brillouin gain on the refractive index profile of the optical fiber. We analyze Stokes backreflected power initiated by thermal phonons, compare values of the SBST calculated from different approximations, and discuss the SBST dependence on the fiber length. We also review an analytical approach to calculate the gain of Brillouin fiber amplifiers (BFAs) in the regime of pump depletion. In the high-gain regime, fiber loss is a nonnegligible effect and needs to be accounted for along with the pump depletion. We provide an accurate analytic expression for the BFA gain and show results of experimental validation. Finally, we review methods to suppress SBS including index-controlled acoustic guiding or segmented fiber links. The second part of the review deals with recent advances in fiber-optic applications where SBS is a relevant effect. In particular, we discuss the impact of SBS on the radio-over-fiber technology, enhancement of the SBS efficiency in Raman-pumped fibers, slow light due to SBS and SBS-based optical delay lines, Brillouin fiber-optic sensors, and SBS mitigation in high-power fiber lasers, as well as SBS in multimode and microstructured fibers. A detailed derivation of evolutional equations in the guided wave geometry as well as key physical relations are given in appendices.",

With the commercialization of liquid-crystal devices, digital holography as an enabling tool has become accessible to all, and with it all-digital tools for the decomposition of light have finally come of age. We review recent advances in unravelling the properties of light, from the modal structure of laser beams to decoding the information stored in orbital angular momentum (OAM)-carrying fields. We show application of these tools to fiber lasers, solid-state lasers, and structured light created in the laboratory by holographic laser beam shaping. We show by experimental implementation how digital holograms may be used to infer the intensity, phase, wavefront, Poynting vector, polarization, and OAM density of some unknown optical field. In particular, we outline how virtually all the previous ISO-standard beam diagnostic techniques may be readily replaced with all-digital equivalents, thus paving the way for unravelling of light in real time. Such tools are highly relevant to the in situ analysis of laser systems, to mode division multiplexing as an emerging tool in optical communication, and for quantum information processing with entangled photons.",

Over the past two decades, AlGaN-based materials and devices experienced rapid development. Deep ultraviolet AlGaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with improved efficiency of 20.3% (at 275 nm) have been produced. An electron beam (EB)-pumped AlGaN-based UV light source at 238 nm, output power of 100 mW, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 40% has also been fabricated. UV stimulated emission from AlGaN multiple-quantum-wells laser diodes (LDs) using electrical pumping at room temperature has also been achieved at a wavelength of 336 nm. Compared with GaN-based blue and green LEDs and LDs, the efficiency of AlGaN-based UV LEDs and LDs is lower. Further optimization and improvements in both structure and fabrication are required to realize high-performance devices. In AlGaN-based UV photodetectors (PDs), gain as high as 104 orders of magnitude has been reported using the separated absorption and multiplication region avalanche photodiode structure but is still far from detecting the weak signal, and thus UV single-photon detectors with high detectivity is challenging. Recently, there has been extensive work in the nonlinear optical properties of AlGaN and AlGaN-based passive devices, such as waveguides and resonators. However, how to minimize the scattering and defect-related absorption needs to be further studied. In this review, first, approaches used to grow an AlGaN epilayer and p-type doping are introduced. Second, progress in AlGaN-based UV LEDs, EB-pumped light sources, LDs, PDs, passive devices, and the nonlinear optical properties are presented.

    "abstract": "A new class of planar optics has emerged using subwavelength gratings with a large refractive index contrast, herein referred to as high-contrast gratings (HCGs). This seemingly simple structure lends itself to extraordinary properties, which can be designed top-down based on intuitive guidelines. The HCG is a single layer of high-index material that can be as thin as 15% of one wavelength. It can be designed to reflect or transmit nearly completely and with specific optical phase over a broad spectral range and/or various incident beam angles. We present a simple theory providing an intuitive phase selection rule to explain the extraordinary features. Our analytical results agree well not only with numerical simulations but also experimental data. The HCG has made easy fabrication of surface-normal optical devices possible, including vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs), tunable VCSELs, and tunable filters. HCGs can be designed to result in high-quality-factor (Q) resonators with surface-normal output, which is promising for wafer-scale lasers and optical sensors. Spatially chirped HCGs are shown to be excellent focusing reflectors and lenses with very high numerical apertures. This field has seen rapid advances in experimental demonstrations and theoretical results. We provide an overview of the underlying new physics and the latest results of devices.",

    "abstract": "Over the years extensive studies have been carried out to apply coherent optics methods in real-time communications and image transmission. This is especially true when a large amount of information needs to be processed, e.g., in high-resolution imaging. The recent progress in data-processing networks and communication systems has considerably increased the capacity of information exchange. However, the transmitted data can be intercepted by nonauthorized people. This explains why considerable effort is being devoted at the current time to data encryption and secure transmission. In addition, only a small part of the overall information is really useful for many applications. Consequently, applications can tolerate information compression that requires important processing when the transmission bit rate is taken into account. To enable efficient and secure information exchange, it is often necessary to reduce the amount of transmitted information. In this context, much work has been undertaken using the principle of coherent optics filtering for selecting relevant information and encrypting it. Compression and encryption operations are often carried out separately, although they are strongly related and can influence each other. Optical processing methodologies, based on filtering, are described that are applicable to transmission and/or data storage. Finally, the advantages and limitations of a set of optical compression and encryption methods are discussed.",

This finite overlap means that there is no way of determining with certainty in which of two such states a given physical system has been prepared. We review the various strategies that have been devised to discriminate optimally between nonorthogonal states and some of the optical experiments that have been performed to realize these.",

    "abstract": "Ghost-imaging experiments correlate the outputs from two photodetectors: a high-spatial-resolution (scanning pinhole or CCD array) detector that measures a field that has not interacted with the object to be imaged, and a bucket (single-pixel) detector that collects a field that has interacted with the object. We give a comprehensive review of ghost imaging—within a unified Gaussian-state framework—presenting detailed analyses of its resolution, field of view, image contrast, and signal-to-noise ratio behavior. We consider three classes of illumination: thermal-state (classical), biphoton-state (quantum), and classical-state phase-sensitive light. The first two have been employed in a variety of ghost-imaging demonstrations. The third is the classical Gaussian state that produces ghost images that most closely mimic those obtained from biphoton illumination. The insights we develop lead naturally to a new, single-beam approach to ghost imaging, called computational ghost imaging, in which only the bucket detector is required. We provide quantitative results while simultaneously emphasizing the underlying physics of ghost imaging. The key to developing the latter understanding lies in the coherence behavior of a pair of Gaussian-state light beams with either phase-insensitive or phase-sensitive cross correlation.",

Furthermore, THz imaging is positioned to play a key role in many industrial applications, as THz technology is steadily shifting from university-grade instrumentation to commercial systems. In this context, the objective of this review is to discuss recent advances in THz imaging with an emphasis on the modalities that could enable real-time high-resolution imaging. To this end, we first discuss several key imaging modalities developed over the years: THz transmission, reflection, and conductivity imaging; THz pulsed imaging; THz computed tomography; and THz near-field imaging. Then, we discuss several enabling technologies for real-time THz imaging within the time-domain spectroscopy paradigm: fast optical delay lines, photoconductive antenna arrays, and electro-optic sampling with cameras. Next, we discuss the advances in THz cameras, particularly THz thermal cameras and THz field-effect transistor cameras. Finally, we overview the most recent techniques that enable fast THz imaging with single-pixel detectors: mechanical beam-steering, compressive sensing, spectral encoding, and fast Fourier optics. We believe that this critical and comprehensive review of enabling hardware, instrumentation, algorithms, and potential applications in real-time high-resolution THz imaging can serve a diverse community of fundamental and applied scientists.",

    "abstract": "The main obstacle in retrieving quantitative phase with high sensitivity is posed by the phase noise due to mechanical vibrations and air fluctuations that typically affect any interferometric system. In this paper, we review diffraction phase microscopy (DPM), which is a common-path quantitative phase imaging (QPI) method that significantly alleviates the noise problem. DPM utilizes a compact Mach–Zehnder interferometer to combine several attributes of current QPI methods. This compact configuration inherently cancels out most mechanisms responsible for noise and is single-shot, meaning that the acquisition speed is limited only by the speed of the camera employed. This technique is also nondestructive and does not require staining or coating of the specimen. This unique collection of features enables the DPM system to accurately monitor the dynamics of various nanoscale phenomena in a wide variety of environments. The DPM system can operate in both transmission and reflection modes in order to accommodate both transparent and opaque samples, respectively. Thus, current applications of DPM include measuring the dynamics of biological samples, semiconductor wet etching and photochemical etching processes, surface wetting and evaporation of water droplets, self-assembly of nanotubes, expansion and deformation of materials, and semiconductor wafer defect detection. Finally, DPM with white light averages out much of the speckle background and also offers potential for spectroscopic measurements.",

    "abstract": "Microwires and nanowires have been manufactured by using a wide range of bottom-up techniques such as chemical or physical vapor deposition and top-down processes such as fiber drawing. Among these techniques, the manufacture of wires from optical fibers provides the longest, most uniform and robust nanowires. Critically, the small surface roughness and the high-homogeneity associated with optical fiber nanowires (OFNs) provide low optical loss and allow the use of nanowires for a wide range of new applications for communications, sensing, lasers, biology, and chemistry. OFNs offer a number of outstanding optical and mechanical properties, including (1) large evanescent fields, (2) high-nonlinearity, (3) strong confinement, and (4) low-loss interconnection to other optical fibers and fiberized components. OFNs are fabricated by adiabatically stretching optical fibers and thus preserve the original optical fiber dimensions at their input and output, allowing ready splicing to standard fibers. A review of the manufacture of OFNs is presented, with a particular emphasis on their applications. Three different groups of applications have been envisaged: (1) devices based on the strong confinement or nonlinearity, (2) applications exploiting the large evanescent field, and (3) devices involving the taper transition regions. The first group includes supercontinuum generators, a range of nonlinear optical devices, and optical trapping. The second group comprises knot, loop, and coil resonators and their applications, sensing and particle propulsion by optical pressure. Finally, mode filtering and mode conversion represent applications based on the taper transition regions. Among these groups of applications, devices exploiting the OFN-based resonators are possibly the most interesting; because of the large evanescent field, when OFNs are coiled onto themselves the mode propagating in the wire interferes with itself to give a resonator. In contrast with the majority of high-Q resonators manufactured by other means, the OFN microresonator does not have major issues with input-output coupling and presents a completely integrated fiberized solution. OFNs can be used to manufacture loop and coil resonators with Q factors that, although still far from the predicted value of 10. The input-output pigtails play a major role in shaping the resonator response and can be used to maximize the Q factor over a wide range of coupling parameters. Finally, temporal stability and robustness issues are discussed, and a solution to optical degradation issues is presented.",

It is based on Raman scattering, a phenomenon in which incident photons lose or gain energy via interactions with vibrating molecules in a sample. These energy shifts can be used to obtain information regarding molecular composition of the sample with very high accuracy. Applications of Raman spectroscopy in the life sciences have included quantification of biomolecules, hyperspectral molecular imaging of cells and tissue, medical diagnosis, and others. This review briefly presents the physical origin of Raman scattering, explaining the key classical and quantum mechanical concepts. Variations of the Raman effect will also be considered, including resonance, coherent, and enhanced Raman scattering. We discuss the molecular origins of prominent bands often found in the Raman spectra of biological samples. Finally, we examine several variations of Raman spectroscopy techniques in practice, looking at their applications, strengths, and challenges.

Recent work on SBS in nano-photonic waveguides and micro-resonators is presented, with special attention paid to photonic integration of applications such as narrow-linewidth lasers, slow- and fast-light, microwave signal processing, Brillouin dynamic gratings, and nonreciprocal devices.",

    "abstract": "Particle tracking is a fundamental technique for investigating a variety of biophysical processes, from intracellular dynamics to the characterization of cell motility and migration. However, observing three-dimensional (3D) trajectories of particles is in general a challenging task in classical microscopy owing to the limited imaging depth of field of commercial optical microscopes, which represents a serious drawback for the analysis of time-lapse microscopy image data. Therefore, numerous automated particle-tracking approaches have been developed by many research groups around the world. Recently, digital holography (DH) in microscopy has rapidly gained credit as one of the elective techniques for these applications, mainly due to the uniqueness of the DH to provide a posteriori quantitative multiple refocusing capability and phase-contrast imaging. Starting from this paradigm, a huge amount of 3D holographic tracking approaches have been conceived and investigated for applications in various branches of science, including optofluids, microfluidics, biomedical microscopy, cell mechano-trasduction, and cell migration. Since a wider community of readers could be interested in such a review, i.e., not only scientists working in the fields of optics and photonics but also users of particle-tracking tools, it should be very beneficial to provide a complete review of state-of-the-art holographic 3D particle-tracking methods and their applications in bio-microfluidics.",

    "abstract": "Black phosphorus is a newly rising layered material with tremendous and intriguing physical, chemical, and electronic properties. Recently, it was reintroduced into the community from the perspective of two-dimensional (2D) materials, showing excellent carrier mobility, strong light–matter interactions in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) range, and unique anisotropic physical properties. These features are beyond the existing 2D materials in terms of bandgap range and mobility/bandgap trade-off, making it possible to bridge the application gaps ranging from mid-IR photonics to high-performance field-effect devices. In this paper, we review the status and perspectives of the optical properties of black phosphorus, with a particular emphasis on their broadband tunable bandgap and anisotropic optical properties. We began with a brief introduction on the history, synthesis, crystal/band structures, and basic physical properties of black phosphorus. In Section 3, we discuss the optical properties of black phosphorus, including comparison of the electronic-excitation-induced versus phonon-excitation-induced optical properties, linear versus nonlinear absorption, and static versus dynamic photoresponse, as well as the quasi-particle effect versus the effect. After that, we exemplify typical black phosphorus photonic devices in Section 4. We highlight recent progress in photodetectors covering mid-IR and terahertz wavelength, ultrafast Q-switching and mode-locking pulse lasers and nanophotonic devices. Finally, we present a summary and outlook of black phosphorus regarding current challenges and future application opportunities in Section 5.",

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been tremendous interest in excitable optoelectronic devices and in particular excitable semiconductor lasers that could potentially enable unconventional processing approaches beyond conventional binary-logic-based approaches. In parallel, there has been renewed investigation of non-von Neumann architectures driven in part by incipient limitations in aspects of Moore's law. These neuromorphic architectures attempt to decentralize processing by interweaving interconnection with computing while simultaneously incorporating time-resolved dynamics, loosely classified as spiking (a.k.a. excitability). The rapid and efficient advances in CMOS-compatible photonic interconnect technologies have led to opportunities in optics and photonics for unconventional circuits and systems. Effort in the budding research field of photonic spike processing aims to synergistically integrate the underlying physics of photonics with bio-inspired processing. Lasers operating in the excitable regime are dynamically analogous with the spiking dynamics observed in neuron biophysics but roughly 8 orders of magnitude faster. The field is reaching a critical juncture at which there is a shift from studying single devices to studying an interconnected network of lasers. In this paper, we review the recent research in the information processing abilities of such lasers, dubbed \"photonic neurons,\" \"laser neurons,\" or \"optical neurons.\" An integrated network of such lasers on a chip could potentially grant the capacity for complex, ultrafast categorization and decision making to provide a range of computing and signal processing applications, such as sensing and manipulating the radio frequency spectrum and for hypersonic aircraft control.",

    "abstract": "High- and ultrahigh-Q whispering-gallery mode resonators have the capability to trap photons by total internal reflection for a duration ranging from nanoseconds to milliseconds. These exceptionally long photon lifetimes enhance the light–matter interactions at all scales, namely at the electronic, molecular, and lattice levels. As a consequence, nonlinear photon scattering can be triggered with very low threshold powers, down to a few microwatts. The possibility to efficiently harness photon–photon interactions with a system optimizing size, weight, power, and cost constraints has created a new, quickly thriving research area in photonics science and technology. This topic is inherently cross-disciplinary, as it stands at the intersection of nonlinear and quantum optics, crystallography, optoelectronics, and microwave photonics. From a fundamental perspective, high-Q whispering-gallery mode resonators have emerged as an ideal platform to investigate light–matter interactions in nonlinear bulk materials. From an applied viewpoint, technological applications include time-metrology, aerospace engineering, coherent optical fiber communications, or nonclassical light generation, among others. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the most recent advances in this area, which is increasingly gaining importance in contemporary photonics.",

Hence, deep insight into the basics of scattering theory and an understanding of the peculiar features of electromagnetic scattering are necessary for the correct interpretation of experimental data and an understanding of the underlying physics. Recently, a broad spectrum of exceptional scattering phenomena attainable in suitably engineered structures has been predicted and demonstrated. Examples include bound states in the continuum, exceptional points in parity–time (PT)-symmetrical non-Hermitian systems, coherent perfect absorption, virtual perfect absorption, nontrivial lasing, nonradiating sources, and others. In this paper, we establish a unified description of such exotic scattering phenomena and show that the origin of all these effects can be traced back to the properties of poles and zeros of the underlying scattering matrix. We provide insights on how managing these special points in the complex frequency plane provides a powerful approach to tailor unusual scattering regimes.",

The discovery of lasers in the 1960s gave birth to optical beam lithography in the 1970s.

The last few decades have seen the evolution of new illumination techniques meant to improve certain imaging capabilities of the microscope. Most of them are, however, not amenable for wide-field observation and hence have restricted use in microscopy applications such as cell biology and microscale profile measurements. The method of structured illumination microscopy has been developed as a wide-field technique for achieving higher performance. Additionally, it is also compatible with existing microscopes. This method consists of modifying the illumination by superposing a well-defined pattern on either the sample itself or its image. Computational techniques are applied on the resultant images to remove the effect of the structure and to obtain the desired performance enhancement. This method has evolved over the last two decades and has emerged as a key illumination technique for optical sectioning, super-resolution imaging, surface profiling, and quantitative phase imaging of microscale objects in cell biology and engineering. In this review, we describe various structured illumination methods in optical microscopy and explain the principles and technologies involved therein.",

    "abstract": "Modes generally provide an economical description of waves, reducing complicated wave functions to finite numbers of mode amplitudes, as in propagating fiber modes and ideal laser beams. But finding a corresponding mode description for counting the best orthogonal channels for communicating between surfaces or volumes, or for optimally describing the inputs and outputs of a complicated optical system or wave scatterer, requires a different approach. The singular-value decomposition approach we describe here gives the necessary optimal source and receiver &#x201C;communication modes&#x201D; pairs and device or scatterer input and output &#x201C;mode-converter basis function&#x201D; pairs. These define the best communication or input/output channels, allowing precise counting and straightforward calculations. Here we introduce all the mathematics and physics of this approach, which works for acoustic, radio-frequency, and optical waves, including full vector electromagnetic behavior, and is valid from nanophotonic scales to large systems. We show several general behaviors of communications modes, including various heuristic results. We also establish a new &#x201C;M-gauge&#x201D; for electromagnetism that clarifies the number of vector wave channels and allows a simple and general quantization. This approach also gives a new modal &#x201C;M-coefficient&#x201D; version of Einstein&#x2019;s A&#x0026;B coefficient argument and revised versions of Kirchhoff&#x2019;s radiation laws.

Among those various manipulations, optical pulling has emerged recently as an attractive notion and captivated the popular imagination, not only because it constitutes a rich family of counterintuitive phenomena compared with traditional manipulations but also due to the profound physics underneath and potential applications. Beginning with a general introduction to optical forces, related theories, and methods, we review the progresses achieved in optical pulling forces using different mechanisms and configurations. Similar pulling forces in other forms of waves, including acoustic, water, and quantum matter waves, are also integrated. More importantly, we also include the progresses in counterintuitive left-handed optical torque and lateral optical force as the extensions of the pulling force. As a new manipulation degree of freedom, optical pulling force and related effects have potential applications in remote mass transportation, optical rotating, and optical sorting. They may also stimulate the investigations of counterintuitive phenomena in other forms of waves.",

Fano resonance arises from the interference of broad and narrow spectra of radiation and becomes an important tool for many applications in the physical, chemical, and biological sciences. At the beginning of this paper, we consider Fano resonances in individual particles, primarily of spherical and cylindrical shapes, and discuss their connection with the physics of bound states in the continuum that determine the high quality factors of resonators. Further, we discuss two areas in which structures with Fano resonances have already found or will find real application in the nearest future—sensors and lasers. The penultimate section concerns our future, which will be associated with the complete replacement of electronic processing, transmission, and storage of information with optical devices as many hope. It is believed that this sophisticated goal can be achieved with devices that implement the slow-light regime associated with the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency, which can be considered as a special case of Fano resonance. The review completes with one more promising topic related to quantum electrodynamics in structures with Fano cavities.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, progress in hollow-core optical fiber technology has reduced the attenuation of these fibers to levels comparable to those of all-solid silica-core single-mode fibers. The sustained pace of progress in the field has sparked renewed interest in the technology and created the expectation that it will one day enable realization of the most transparent light-propagating waveguides ever produced, across all spectral regions of interest. In this work we review and analyze the various physical mechanisms that drive attenuation in hollow-core optical fibers. We consider both the somewhat legacy hollow-core photonic bandgap technology as well as the more recent antiresonant hollow-core fibers. As both fiber types exploit different guidance mechanisms from that of conventional solid-core fibers to confine light to the central core, their attenuation is also dominated by a different set of physical processes, which we analyze here in detail. First, we discuss intrinsic loss mechanisms in perfect and idealized fibers. These include leakage loss, absorption, and scattering within the gas filling the core or from the glass microstructure surrounding it, and roughness scattering from the air–glass interfaces within the fibers. The latter contribution is analyzed rigorously, clarifying inaccuracies in the literature that often led to the use of inadequate scaling rules. We then explore the extrinsic contributions to loss and discuss the effect of random microbends as well as that of other perturbations and non-uniformities that may result from imperfections in the fabrication process. These effects impact the loss of the fiber predominantly by scattering light from the fundamental mode into lossier higher-order modes and cladding modes. Although these contributions have often been neglected, their role becomes increasingly important in the context of producing, one day, hollow-core fibers with sub-0.1-dB/km loss and a pure single-mode guidance. Finally, we present general scaling rules for all the loss mechanisms mentioned previously and combine them to examine the performance of recently reported fibers. We lay some general guidelines for the design of low-loss hollow-core fibers operating at different spectral regions and conclude the paper with a brief outlook on the future of this potentially transformative technology.",

    "abstract": "Space-time wave packets (STWPs) constitute a broad class of pulsed optical fields that are rigidly transported in linear media without diffraction or dispersion, and are therefore propagation-invariant in the absence of optical nonlinearities or waveguiding structures. Such wave packets exhibit unique characteristics, such as controllable group velocities in free space and exotic refractive phenomena. At the root of these behaviors is a fundamental feature underpinning STWPs: their spectra are not separable with respect to the spatial and temporal degrees of freedom. Indeed, the spatiotemporal structure is endowed with non-differentiable angular dispersion, in which each spatial frequency is associated with a single prescribed wavelength. Furthermore, controlled deviation from this particular spatiotemporal structure yields novel behaviors that depart from propagation-invariance in a precise manner, such as acceleration with an arbitrary axial distribution of the group velocity, tunable dispersion profiles, and Talbot effects in space–time. Although the basic concept of STWPs has been known since the 1980s, only very recently has rapid experimental development emerged. These advances are made possible by innovations in spatiotemporal Fourier synthesis, thereby opening a new frontier for structured light at the intersection of beam optics and ultrafast optics. Furthermore, a plethora of novel spatiotemporally structured optical fields (such as flying-focus wave packets, toroidal pulses, and spatiotemporal optical vortices) are now providing a swath of surprising characteristics, ranging from tunable group velocities to transverse orbital angular momentum. We review the historical development of STWPs, describe the new experimental approaches for their efficient synthesis, and enumerate the various new results and potential applications for STWPs and other spatiotemporally structured fields, before casting an eye on a future roadmap for this field.",

    "abstract": "The generation, manipulation, storage, and detection of single photons play a central role in emerging photonic quantum information technology. Individual photons serve as flying qubits and transmit the relevant quantum information at high speed and with low losses, for example between individual nodes of quantum networks. Due to the laws of quantum mechanics, the associated quantum communication is fundamentally tap-proof, which explains the enormous interest in this modern information technology. On the other hand, stationary qubits or photonic states in quantum computers can potentially lead to enormous increases in performance through parallel data processing, to outperform classical computers in specific tasks when quantum advantage is achieved. In this review, we discuss in depth the great potential of semiconductor quantum dots in photonic quantum information technology. In this context, quantum dots form a key resource for the implementation of quantum communication networks and photonic quantum computers, because they can generate single photons on demand. Moreover, these solid-state quantum emitters are compatible with the mature semiconductor technology, so that they can be integrated comparatively easily into nanophotonic structures such as resonators and waveguide systems, which form the basis for quantum light sources and integrated photonic quantum circuits. After a thematic introduction, we present modern numerical methods and theoretical approaches to device design and the physical description of quantum dot devices. We then introduce modern methods and technical solutions for the epitaxial growth and for the deterministic nanoprocessing of quantum devices based on semiconductor quantum dots. Furthermore, we highlight the most promising device concepts for quantum light sources and photonic quantum circuits that include single quantum dots as active elements and discuss applications of these novel devices in photonic quantum information technology. We close with an overview of open issues and an outlook on future developments.",

    "abstract": "During the past few years, the optics and photonics communities have renewed their attention toward transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), which for over two decades have been broadly employed for the fabrication of transparent electrodes in photovoltaic and communication technologies. This reinvigorated research curiosity is twofold: on the one hand, TCOs, with their metal-like properties, low optical absorption, and fabrication flexibility, represent an appealing alternative to noble metals for designing ultra-compact plasmonic devices. On the other hand, this class of hybrid compounds has been proved to possess exceptionally high optical nonlinearities when operating on a frequency window centered around their crossover point, the wavelength point at which the real part of the dielectric permittivity switches sign. Because TCOs are wide-bandgap materials with the Fermi level located in the conduction band, they are hybrid in nature, thus presenting both interband and intraband nonlinearities. This is the cause of a very rich nonlinear physics that is yet to be fully understood and explored. In addition to this, TCOs are epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials within a broad near-infrared spectral range, including the entire telecom bandwidth. In this operational window a myriad of novel electromagnetic phenomena have been demonstrated experimentally such as supercoupling, wavefront freezing, and photon doping. Furthermore, TCOs stand out among all other ENZ systems due to one fundamental characteristic, which is hardly attainable even by using structured materials. In fact, around their ENZ wavelength and for a quite generous operational range, these materials can be engineered to have an extremely small real index. This peculiarity leads to a slow-light effect that is ultimately responsible for a significant enhancement of the material nonlinear properties and is the cornerstone of the emerging field of near-zero-index photonics. In this regard, the recent history of nonlinear optics in conductive oxides is growing extremely fast due to a great number of experiments reporting unprecedentedly remarkable effects, including unitary index change, bandwidth-large frequency shift, efficient ultra-low-power frequency conversion, and many others. This review is meant to guide the reader through the exciting journey of TCOs, starting as an industrial material for transparent electrodes, then becoming a new alternative for low-loss plasmonics, and recently opening up new frontiers in integrated nonlinear optics. The present review is mainly focused on experimental observations.",

This unprecedented control leads to multimode fiber applications in imaging, endoscopy, optical trapping and microfabrication. Furthermore, the output speckle pattern from a multimode fiber encodes spatial, temporal, spectral and polarization properties of the input light, allowing such information to be retrieved from spatial measurements only.

However, there is yet a lack of a comprehensive and holistic overview of transverse momenta (both linear and angular) as well as of optical lateral forces (OLFs). In this article, we first review the most recent transverse momenta including the transverse spin angular momentum, optical skyrmions, as well as lateral momenta from directional side scattering, spin–orbit interaction, and surface plasmon polaritons. Since optical forces result from the momentum exchange between light and matter, the transverse momentum consequently gives rise to intriguing OLFs, which is the second topic of this article. Additional non-trivial lateral forces that combine optics with other effects from thermodynamics, electricity, and microfluidics, are also discussed. It should be emphasized that these momenta and forces ubiquitously exist in a broad range of optical phenomena and have often been neglected due to their unpredicted underlying physics and shortage of experimental means, especially prior to the last decade.",

    "abstract": "Entanglement is a quintessential quantum mechanical phenomenon with no classical equivalent. First discussed by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen and formally introduced by Schrödinger in 1935, entanglement has grown from a scientific debate to a radically new resource that sparks a technological revolution. This review focuses on fundamentals and recent advances in entanglement-based quantum information technology (QIT), specifically in photonic systems. Photons are unique quantum information carriers with several advantages, such as their ability to operate at room temperature, their compatibility with existing communication and sensing infrastructures, and the availability of readily accessible optical components. Photons also interface well with other solid-state quantum platforms. We first provide an overview on entanglement, starting with an introduction to its development from a historical perspective followed by the theory for entanglement generation and the associated representative experiments. We then dive into the applications of entanglement-based QIT for sensing, imaging, spectroscopy, data processing, and communication. Before closing, we present an outlook for the architecture of the next-generation entanglement-based QIT and its prospective applications.",

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal sculpturing of light pulses with sophisticated structures on demand is one major goal of the everlasting pursuit of ultrafast information transmission and processing as well as ultraintense energy concentration and extraction using light. It may hold the key to unlocking new extraordinary fundamental physical effects. Traditionally, spatiotemporal light pulses are treated as spatiotemporally separable wave packets as a solution to Maxwell’s equations. In the past decade, more generalized forms of spatiotemporally nonseparable solution started to emerge with growing importance for their striking physical effects. This tutorial intends to provide the necessary basics on how to sculpture light in the spatiotemporal domain to realize spatiotemporal structures on demand and highlight some of the recent advances in the creation and characterization of increasingly complex spatiotemporal wave packets. These spatiotemporally separable to complex nonseparable states with diverse geometric and topological structures exhibit unique physical properties during propagation, focusing, and interaction with matter. The broad potential applications as well as outlook and future trends and open challenges in this field are presented.",

    "abstract": "Computational methods for determining the complex propagation constants of leaky waveguide modes have become so powerful and so readily available that it is possible to use these methods with little understanding of what they are calculating. We compare different computational methods for calculating the propagation constants of the leaky modes, focusing on the relatively simple context of a W-type slab waveguide. In a lossless medium with infinite transverse extent, a direct determination of the leaky mode by using mode matching is compared with complete mode decomposition. The mode matching method is analogous to the multipole method in two dimensions. We then compare these results with a simple finite-difference scheme in a transverse region with absorbing boundaries that is analogous to finite-difference or finite-element methods in two dimensions. While the physical meaning of the leaky modes in these different solution methods is different, they all predict a nearly identical evolution for an initial, nearly confined mode profile over a limited spatial region and a limited distance. Finally, we demonstrate that a waveguide that uses bandgap confinement with a central defect produces analogous results.",

The distinctive features of\nthese waveguides are that they have extremely large third-order susceptibility χ(3) and dispersive properties. The strong dispersion and large\nthird-order nonlinearity in Si photonic wires cause the linear and nonlinear optical\nphysics in these guides to be intimately linked. By carefully choosing the waveguide\ndimensions, both linear and nonlinear optical properties of Si wires can be\nengineered. We review the fundamental optical physics and emerging applications for\nthese Si wires. In many cases, the relatively low threshold powers for nonlinear\noptical effects in these wires make them potential candidates for functional on-chip\nnonlinear optical devices of just a few millimeters in length; conversely, the\nabsence of nonlinear optical impairment is important for the use of Si wires in\non-chip interconnects. In addition, the characteristic length scales of linear and\nnonlinear optical effects in Si wires are markedly different from those in commonly\nused optical guiding systems, such as optical fibers or photonic crystal fibers, and\ntherefore guiding structures based on Si wires represent ideal optical media for\ninvestigating new and intriguing physical phenomena.",

    "abstract": "In conventional lasers, the optical cavity that confines the photons also determines essential characteristics of the lasing modes such as wavelength, emission pattern, directivity, and polarization. In random lasers, which do not have mirrors or a well-defined cavity, light is confined within the gain medium by means of multiple scattering. The sharp peaks in the emission spectra of semiconductor powders, first observed in 1999, has therefore lead to an intense debate about the nature of the lasing modes in these so-called lasers with resonant feedback. We review numerical and theoretical studies aimed at clarifying the nature of the lasing modes in disordered scattering systems with gain. The past decade has witnessed the emergence of the idea that even the low-Q resonances of such open systems could play a role similar to the cavity modes of a conventional laser and produce sharp lasing peaks. We focus here on the near-threshold single-mode lasing regime where nonlinear effects associated with gain saturation and mode competition can be neglected. We discuss in particular the link between random laser modes near threshold and the resonances or quasi-bound (QB) states of the passive system without gain. For random lasers in the localized (strong scattering) regime, QB states and threshold lasing modes were found to be nearly identical within the scattering medium. These studies were later extended to the case of more lossy systems such as random systems in the diffusive regime, where it was observed that increasing the openness of such systems eventually resulted in measurable and increasing differences between quasi-bound states and lasing modes. Very recently, a theory able to treat lasers with arbitrarily complex and open cavities such as random lasers established that the threshold lasing modes are in fact distinct from QB states of the passive system and are better described in terms of a new class of states, the so-called constant-flux states. The correspondence between QB states and lasing modes is found to improve in the strong scattering limit, confirming the validity of initial work in the strong scattering limit.",

Momentum conservation requires consideration not only of the momentum of the field and of recoiling guest atoms, but also of the momentum the field imparts to the medium. Different model assumptions with respect to electrostriction and the dipole force lead to different expressions for this momentum.

Particular emphasis is placed on the spatial propagation of stationary fields, as well as on the propagation of pulses through dispersive media. In the first case, the Wigner function gives a representation of the field that is similar to a radiance or weight distribution for all the rays in the system, since its arguments are both position and direction. In cases in which the field is paraxial and where the system is described by a simple linear relation in the ray regime, the Wigner function is constant under propagation along rays. An equivalent property holds for optical pulse propagation in dispersive media under analogous assumptions. Several properties and applications of the Wigner function in these contexts are discussed, as is its connection with other common phase-space distributions like the ambiguity function, the spectrogram, and the Husimi, P, Q, and Kirkwood–Rihaczek functions. Also discussed are modifications to the definition of the Wigner function that allow extending the property of conservation along paths to a wider range of problems, including nonparaxial field propagation and pulse propagation within general transparent dispersive media.",

The process involves manipulating single photons in a sequence of projective measurements, often to construct a density matrix from which other information can be inferred, and is as laborious as it is complex. Here we unravel the steps of a QST and outline how it may be demonstrated in a fast and simple manner with intense (classical) light. We use scalar beams in a time reversal approach to simulate the outcome of a QST and exploit non-separability in classical vector beams as a means to treat the latter as a “classically entangled” state for illustrating QSTs directly. We provide a complete do-it-yourself resource for the practical implementation of this approach, complete with tutorial video, which we hope will facilitate the introduction of this core quantum tool into teaching and research laboratories alike. Our work highlights the value of using intense classical light as a means to study quantum systems and in the process provides a tutorial on the fundamentals of QSTs.",

Furthermore, a major application, all-optical switching, has still not been realized because of the lack of a suitable material with high nonlinear figure of merit. This review focuses specifically on molecular materials that provide an opportunity for optimization of optical nonlinearity at two levels: microscopic and bulk. We present essential physics at these two levels and describe how the relationship between microscopic and bulk levels can be exploited to design new materials with enhanced optical nonlinearity. In this context, we introduce recent advances in multiscale modeling. The emphasis in this review is placed on third-order optical nonlinearity that governs all-optical processes. We discuss the current status of nonlinear optical studies on new molecular systems and the challenges to be met. This review covers newly emergent promising directions, together with their most impactful applications, and thus is beyond the comprehensive account of all the progress that has been made in the area of molecular nonlinear optics. Therefore, novel directions for enhancing molecular nonlinearities are presented, which include twist-motif chromophores, synergistic coupling between bond length alternation and high density of states, microscopic cascading, hybridization of states, etc. We then present some specific, promising nonlinear media. In this context, metamaterials and metasurfaces are also discussed, as they play an important role in the enhancement of nonlinearities and light manipulations. Another new direction covered is chiral nonlinearity. Finally, we present some selected major applications of nonlinear optics, specifically in optical signal processing, optical limiting, biophotonics, and upconversion random lasing.

The single-nanostructure sensitivity of optical microscopy has solidified the optical approach as a reliable technique for examining the electronic structure of materials at the nanoscale. By zooming in on the individual, optical microscopy has permitted detailed investigations of the linear optical response of nanomaterials such as semiconducting quantum dots and plasmon active nanometals. Besides studying the linear optical properties of nanostructures, optical microscopy has also been used to probe the nonlinear optical properties of nanoscale materials. FWM microscopy, a coherent third-order optical imaging technique, has shown great potential as a tool for investigating the nonlinear optical response of nanostructures. FWM microscopy not only permits the characterization of the nonlinear susceptibility of individual nanostructures, it also offers a route to explore the time-resolved dynamics of electronic and vibrational excitations on single structures. In addition, FWM produces strong signals from nanomaterials that are compatible with fast imaging applications, which holds promise for biological imaging studies based on nanoparticle labels that are not prone to photobleaching.",

    "abstract": "Exhibited by structurally chiral materials—such as Reusch piles, cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs), and chiral sculptured thin films (STFs)—due to their helical nonhomogeneity along a fixed axis, the circular Bragg phenomenon is the almost total reflection of the incident light of the co-handed circular-polarization state but very little reflection of the incident light of the cross-handed circular-polarization state. Manifesting itself in spectral regimes that depend on the angle of incidence, the structural period, and the relative permittivity dyadic, the phenomenon amounts to the formation of a light pipe that bleeds energy backward under appropriate conditions. Mild dissipation and dispersion do not significantly affect the circular Bragg regime. Every structurally chiral material of sufficient thickness is essentially a circular-polarization-sensitive band-rejection filter. Cascades of these materials with or without structural defects can be used to satisfy complex filtering requirements, such as multiband, narrowband, and ultra-narrowband filtering. A shift in the circular Bragg regime due to infiltration of a chiral STF by a fluid enables optical sensing. Sources of circularly polarized light can be fabricated by embedding emission sources in CLCs and chiral STFs.",

High-power and low-efficiency-droop blue LEDs have been demonstrated on nonpolar and semipolar planes III-nitride due to the advantages of eliminated or reduced polarization-related electric field and homoepitaxial growth. Semipolar (202¯1) and (202¯1¯) LEDs have contributed to bridging \"green gap\" (low efficiency in green spectral region) by incorporating high indium compositions, reducing polarization effects, and suppressing defects. Other properties, such as low thermal droop, narrow spectral linewidth, small wavelength shift, and polarized emission, have also been reported for nonpolar and semipolar LEDs. In this paper we review the theoretical background, device performance, material properties, and physical mechanisms for nonpolar and semipolar III-nitride semiconductors and associated blue and green LEDs. The latest progress on topics including efficiency droop, thermal droop, green-gap, and three-dimensional nanostructures is detailed.

    "abstract": "Semiconductor nanowires (or other wire-like nanostructures, including nanoribbons and nanobelts) synthesized by bottom-up chemical growth show single-crystalline structures, excellent geometric uniformities, subwavelength transverse dimensions, and relatively high refractive indices, making these one-dimensional structures ideal optical nanowaveguides with tight optical confinement and low scattering loss. When properly pumped by optical or electrical means, lasing oscillation can be readily established inside these high-gain active nanowires with feedback from endface reflection or near-field coupling effects, making it possible to realize nanowire lasers with miniature sizes and high flexibilities. Also, the wide-range material availability bestows the semiconductor nanowire with lasing wavelength selectable within a wide spectral range from ultraviolet (UV) to near infrared (IR). As nanoscale coherent light sources, in recent years, nanowire lasers have been attracting intensive attention for both fundamental research and technological applications ranging from optical sensing, signal processing, and on-chip communications to quantum optics. Here, we present a review of the status and perspectives of semiconductor nanowire lasers, with a particular emphasis on their optical characteristics categorized in two groups: (1) waveguiding related properties in Section 3, which includes waveguide modes, near-field coupling, endface reflection, substrate-induced effects, and nanowire microcavities, and (2) optically pumped semiconductor nanowire lasers in Section 4, starting from principles and basic types of UV, visible, and near-IR nanowire lasers relying on Fabry–Perot cavities, to advanced configurations including wavelength-tunable, single-mode operated, fiber-coupled, and metal-incorporated nanowire lasing structures for more possibilities. In addition, the material aspects of semiconductor nanowires, including nanowire synthesis and electrically driven nanowire lasers, are briefly reviewed in Sections 2 and 5, respectively. Finally, in Section 6 we present a brief summary of semiconductor nanowire lasers regarding their current challenges and future opportunities.",

    "abstract": "Propulsive effects of light, which often remain unnoticed in our daily-life experience, manifest themselves on spatial scales ranging from subatomic to astronomical. Light-mediated forces can indeed confine individual atoms, cooling their effective temperature very close to absolute zero, as well as contribute to cosmological phenomena such as the formation of stellar planetary systems. In this review, we focus on the transport processes that light can initiate on small spatial scales. In particular, we discuss in depth various light-induced mechanisms for the controlled transport of microscopic particles; these mechanisms rely on the direct transfer of momentum between the particles and the incident light waves, on the combination of optical forces with external forces of other nature, and on light-triggered phoretic motion. After a concise theoretical overview of the physical origins of optical forces, we describe how these forces can be harnessed to guide particles either in continuous bulk media or in the proximity of a constraining interface under various configurations of the illuminating light beams (radiative, evanescent, or plasmonic fields). Subsequently, we introduce particle transport techniques that complement optical forces with counteracting forces of non-optical nature. We finally discuss particle actuation schemes where light acts as a fine knob to trigger and/or modulate phoretic motion in spatial gradients of non-optical (e.g., electric, chemical, or temperature) fields. We conclude by outlining possible future fundamental and applied directions for research in light-induced particle transport. We believe that this comprehensive review can inspire diverse, interdisciplinary scientific communities to devise novel, unorthodox ways of assembling and manipulating materials with light.",

    "abstract": "Surface plasmons (SPs) are electromagnetic excitations existing at the interface between a metal and a dielectric material. Control and manipulation of light based on SPs at the nanometer scale offers significant advantages in nanophotonic devices with very small elements, since the peculiar properties of SPs can be tailored by construction of nanostructures with various interfaces between metals and dielectric materials. Recent progress in nanostructures for SPs is reviewed. Resonance frequencies or wavelengths of SPs can be tuned by design of metal nanostructures, such as nanoparticles, nanorods, nanowires, nanosheets, and nanodisks. Moreover, SP resonance modes can also be tuned by control of the shapes and sizes of nanostructures, where the resonance modes include longitudinal and transversal resonances, dipolar and multipolar resonances, and Fano resonances. Based on SP coupling for metal nanostructures, metal–semiconductor nanostructures, metal–dielectric nanostructures, and metal–polymer nanostructures, propagating and guiding of SP can be achieved through the metal nanostructures and the hybrid structures. Additionally, metal nanostructures exhibit remarkable field enhancement effects (e.g., local near-field enhancement, and optical transmission enhancement) due to SP coupling. Furthermore, SP nanostructures perform unique focusing and imaging characteristics at the nanometer scale beyond the diffraction limit. Tailoring SPs by control of the nanostructures is expected to be used for design and development of high-performance optical components and circuits, which offer both potential and challenges for new generations of nanophotonic devices.",

When the metal NPs are suspended in liquids or embedded in solid substrates, the obtained composites may present high-order optical nonlinearities (HON) beyond the third-order nonlinearity, usually studied for most materials. Moreover, it is observed that the magnitude and phase of the effective high-order susceptibilities can be controlled by adjusting the light intensity, I, and the volume filling fraction, f, occupied by the NPs. Therefore, the sensitivity to the values of I and f allowed the development of a nonlinearity management procedure for investigation and control of various phenomena, such as self- and cross-phase modulation, spatial modulation instability, as well as bright and vortex solitons stabilization, in media presenting relevant third-, fifth-, and seventh-order susceptibilities. As a consequence, it is reviewed in this paper how the exploitation of HON in metal–dielectric nanocomposites may reveal new ways for optimization of all-optical switching devices, light-by-light guiding, as well as the control of solitons propagation for long distances. Also, theoretical proposals and experimental works by several authors are reviewed that may open the possibility to identify new high-order phenomena by applying the nonlinearity management procedure. Therefore, the paper is focused on the properties of metal nanocomposites and demonstrates that these plasmonic composites are versatile platforms for high-order nonlinear optical studies.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides an extensive survey of nonlinear parametric upconversion infrared (IR) imaging, from its origin to date. Upconversion imaging is a successful innovative technique for IR imaging in terms of sensitivity, speed, and noise performance. In this approach, the IR image is frequency upconverted to form a visible/near-IR image through parametric three-wave mixing followed by detection using a silicon-based detector or camera. In 1968, Midwinter first demonstrated upconversion imaging from short-wave-IR (1.6 μm) to visible (484 nm) wavelength using a bulk lithium niobate crystal. This technique quickly gained interest, and several other groups demonstrated upconversion imaging further into the mid- and far-IR with significantly improved quantum efficiency. Although a few excellent reviews on upconversion imaging were published in the early 1970s, the rapid progress in recent years merits an updated comprehensive review. The topic includes linear imaging, nonlinear optics, and laser science and has shown diverse applications. The scope of this article is to provide in-depth knowledge of upconversion imaging theory. An overview of different phase matching conditions for the parametric process and the sensitivity of the upconversion detection system are discussed. Furthermore, different design considerations and optimization schemes are outlined for application-specific upconversion imaging. The article comprises a historical perspective of the technique, its most recent technological advances, specific outstanding issues, and some cutting-edge applications of upconversion in IR imaging.",

These effects result in extrinsic propagation losses associated with the excitation of radiation and backscattering modes. In this work, we present a comprehensive review on the extrinsic loss mechanisms occurring in optical waveguides, identifying the main origins of scattering loss and pointing out the relationships between the loss and the geometrical and physical parameters of the waveguides. Theoretical models and experimental results, supported by statistical analysis, are presented for two widespread classes of waveguides: waveguides based on total internal reflection (TIR) affected by surface roughness, and disordered photonic crystal slab waveguides (PhCWs). In both structures extrinsic losses are strongly related to the waveguide group index, but the mode shape and its interaction with waveguide imperfections must also be considered to accurately model the scattering loss process. It is shown that as long as the group index of PhCWs is relatively low (ng<30), many analogies exist in the radiation and backscattering loss mechanisms with TIR waveguides; conversely, in the high ng regime, multiple scattering and localization effects arise in PhCWs that dramatically modify the waveguide behavior. The presented results enable the development of reliable circuit models of photonic waveguides, which can be used for a realistic performance evaluation of optical circuits.",

    "abstract": "Programmable integrated photonics is an emerging new paradigm that aims at designing common integrated optical hardware resource configurations, capable of implementing an unconstrained variety of functionalities by suitable programming, following a parallel but not identical path to that of integrated electronics in the past two decades of the last century. Programmable integrated photonics is raising considerable interest, as it is driven by the surge of a considerable number of new applications in the fields of telecommunications, quantum information processing, sensing, and neurophotonics, calling for flexible, reconfigurable, low-cost, compact, and low-power-consuming devices that can cooperate with integrated electronic devices to overcome the limitation expected by the demise of Moore’s Law. Integrated photonic devices exploiting full programmability are expected to scale from application-specific photonic chips (featuring a relatively low number of functionalities) up to very complex application-agnostic complex subsystems much in the same way as field programmable gate arrays and microprocessors operate in electronics. Two main differences need to be considered. First, as opposed to integrated electronics, programmable integrated photonics will carry analog operations over the signals to be processed. Second, the scale of integration density will be several orders of magnitude smaller due to the physical limitations imposed by the wavelength ratio of electrons and light wave photons. The success of programmable integrated photonics will depend on leveraging the properties of integrated photonic devices and, in particular, on research into suitable interconnection hardware architectures that can offer a very high spatial regularity as well as the possibility of independently setting (with a very low power consumption) the interconnection state of each connecting element. Integrated multiport interferometers and waveguide meshes provide regular and periodic geometries, formed by replicating unit elements and cells, respectively. In the case of waveguide meshes, the cells can take the form of a square, hexagon, or triangle, among other configurations. Each side of the cell is formed by two integrated waveguides connected by means of a Mach–Zehnder interferometer or a tunable directional coupler that can be operated by means of an output control signal as a crossbar switch or as a variable coupler with independent power division ratio and phase shift. In this paper, we provide the basic foundations and principles behind the construction of these complex programmable circuits. We also review some practical aspects that limit the programming and scalability of programmable integrated photonics and provide an overview of some of the most salient applications demonstrated so far.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative phase microscopy (QPM), a technique combining phase imaging and microscopy, enables visualization of the 3D topography in reflective samples, as well as the inner structure or refractive index distribution of transparent and translucent samples. Similar to other imaging modalities, QPM is constrained by the conflict between numerical aperture (NA) and field of view (FOV): an imaging system with a low NA has to be employed to maintain a large FOV. This fact severely limits the resolution in QPM up to 0.82λ/NA, λ being the illumination wavelength. Consequently, finer structures of samples cannot be resolved by using modest NA objectives in QPM. Aimed to that, many approaches, such as oblique illumination, structured illumination, and speckle illumination (just to cite a few), have been proposed to improve the spatial resolution (or the space–bandwidth product) in phase microscopy by restricting other degrees of freedom (mostly time). This paper aims to provide an up-to-date review on the resolution enhancement approaches in QPM, discussing the pros and cons of each technique as well as the confusion on resolution definition claims on QPM and other coherent microscopy methods. Through this survey, we will review the most appealing and useful techniques for superresolution in coherent microscopy, working with and without lenses and with special attention to QPM. Note that, throughout this review, with the term \"superresolution\" we denote enhancing the resolution to surpass the limit imposed by diffraction and proportional to λ/NA, rather than the physics limit λ/(2n med ), with n med being the refractive index value of the immersion medium.",

Starting from the anomalous interference in simple structures such as double nanoslits, thin films, and catenary apertures, the theories and applications of light–matter interaction in layered, periodic, and aperiodic subwavelength structures are discussed. Two basic platforms, i.e., Young's double slits and the Fabry–Perot cavity, are used as prototypes for the investigation of the complex interference of surface waves. It is shown that these novel phenomena could dramatically reduce the characteristic lengths of functional devices and increase the resolution of optical imaging. By engineering the dispersion of surface waves, broadband responses beyond traditional limits in both temporal and spatial regimes have been demonstrated. As a final remark, the current challenges and future trends of subwavelength interference engineering are addressed.",

This half-century-old material is currently embracing a revolution in thin-film LN integrated photonics. The success of manufacturing wafer-scale, high-quality, thin films of LN on insulator (LNOI), accompanied with breakthroughs in nanofabrication techniques, have made high-performance integrated nanophotonic components possible. With rapid development in the past few years, some of these thin-film LN devices, such as optical modulators and nonlinear wavelength converters, have already outperformed their legacy counterparts realized in bulk LN crystals. Furthermore, the nanophotonic integration enabled ultra-low-loss resonators in LN, which unlocked many novel applications such as optical frequency combs and quantum transducers. In this Review, we cover -- from basic principles to the state of the art -- the diverse aspects of integrated thin-film LN photonics, including the materials, basic passive components, and various active devices based on electro-optics, all-optical nonlinearities, and acousto-optics. We also identify challenges that this platform is currently facing and point out future opportunities. The field of integrated LNOI photonics is advancing rapidly and poised to make critical impacts on a broad range of applications in communication, signal processing, and quantum information.",

    "abstract": "Off-axis holographic multiplexing involves capturing several complex wavefronts, each encoded into off-axis holograms with different interference fringe orientations, simultaneously, with a single camera acquisition. Thus, the multiplexed off-axis hologram can capture several wavefronts at once, where each one encodes different information from the sample, using the same number of pixels typically required for acquiring a single conventional off-axis hologram encoding only one sample wavefront. This gives rise to many possible applications, with focus on acquisition of dynamic samples, with hundreds of scientific papers already published in the last decade. These include field-of-view multiplexing, depth-of-field multiplexing, angular perspective multiplexing for tomographic phase microscopy for 3-D refractive index imaging, multiple wavelength multiplexing for multiwavelength phase unwrapping or for spectroscopy, performing super-resolution holographic imaging with synthetic aperture with simultaneous acquisition, holographic imaging of ultrafast events by encoding different temporal events into the parallel channels using laser pulses, measuring the Jones matrix and the birefringence of the sample from a single multiplexed hologram, and measuring several fluorescent microscopy channels and quantitative phase profiles together, among others. Each of the multiplexing techniques opens new perspectives for applying holography to efficiently measure challenging biological and metrological samples. Furthermore, even if the multiplexing is done digitally, off-axis holographic multiplexing is useful for rapid processing of the wavefront, for holographic compression, and for visualization purposes. Although each of these applications typically requires a different optical system or processing, they all share the same theoretical background. We therefore review the theory, various optical systems, applications, and perspectives of the field of off-axis holographic multiplexing, with the goal of stimulating its further development.",

    "abstract": "Optical parametric amplifiers rely on second-order susceptibility (three-wave mixing) or third-order susceptibility (four-wave mixing) in a nonlinear process where the energy of incoming photons is not changed (elastic scattering). In the latter case, two pump photons are converted to a signal and to an idler photon. Under certain conditions, related to the phase evolution of the waves involved, this conversion can be very efficient, resulting in large amplification of an input signal. As the nonlinear process can be very fast, all-optical applications aside from pure amplification are also possible. If the amplifier is implemented in an optical input-phase-sensitive manner, it is possible to amplify a signal wave without excess noise, i.e., with a noise figure of 0 dB. In this paper, we will provide the fundamental concepts and theory of such amplifiers, with a focus on their implementation in highly nonlinear optical fibers relying on four-wave mixing. We will discuss the distinctions between phase-insensitive and phase-sensitive operation and include several experimental results to illustrate their capability. Different applications of parametric amplifiers are also discussed, including their use in optical communication links.",

It is shown that the performance of graphene-based infrared and terahertz detectors is lower in comparison with those detectors existing on the global market. The high sensitivity of hybrid photodetectors does not coincide with a fast response time, which limits real detector functions. The most effective single graphene detectors operated at room temperature are terahertz detectors, which utilize plasma rectification phenomena in field effect transistors. The challenges facing the development of focal-plane arrays in the future are also considered. Special attention is directed toward the main trends in the development of arrays in the near future—an increase in the pixel count to above 108 pixels, with pixel size decreasing to about 5 μm for both cooled and uncooled long-wavelength infrared arrays.

In classical optics, these traits are characterized by the Stokes parameters, which can be geometrically interpreted using the Poincaré sphere. Remarkably, these Stokes parameters can also be applied to the quantum world, but then important differences emerge: now, because fluctuations in the number of photons are unavoidable, one is forced to work in the three-dimensional Poincaré space that can be regarded as a set of nested spheres. Additionally, higher-order moments of the Stokes variables might play a substantial role for quantum states, which is not the case for most classical Gaussian states. This brings about important differences between these two worlds that we review in detail. In particular, the classical degree of polarization produces unsatisfactory results in the quantum domain. We compare alternative quantum degrees and put forth that they order various states differently. Finally, intrinsically nonclassical states are explored, and their potential applications in quantum technologies are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the phenomenon of rogue wave formation, often called extreme waves, in diverse branches of nonlinear science has become one of the most attractive domains. Given the great richness of the new results and the increasing number of disciplines involved, we are focusing here on two pioneering fields: hydrodynamics and nonlinear optics. This tutorial aims to provide basic background and the recent developments on the formation of rogue waves in various systems in nonlinear optics, including laser physics and fiber optics. For this purpose we first discuss their formation in conservative systems, because most of the theoretical and analytical results have been realized in this context. By using a multiple space–time scale analysis, we review the derivation of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation from Maxwell’s equations supplemented by constitutive equations for Kerr materials. This fundamental equation describes the evolution of a slowly varying envelope of dispersive waves. This approximation has been widely used in the majority of systems, including plasma physics, fluid mechanics, and nonlinear fiber optics. The basic property of this generic model that governs the dynamics of many conservative systems is its integrability. In particular, we concentrate on a nonlinear regime where classical prototypes of rogue wave solutions, such as Akhmediev breathers, Peregrine, and Ma solitons are discussed as well as their experimental evidence in optics and hydrodynamics. The second part focuses on the generation of rogue waves in one- and two-dimensional dissipative optical systems. Specifically, we consider Kerr-based resonators for which we present a detailed derivation of the Lugiato–Lefever equation, assuming that the resonator length is shorter than the space scales of diffraction (or the time scale of the dispersion) and the nonlinearity. In addition, the system possesses a large Fresnel number, i.e., a large aspect ratio so that the resonator boundary conditions do not alter the central part of the beam. Dissipative structures such as solitons and modulational instability and their relation to frequency comb generation are discussed. The formation of rogue waves and the control employing time-delayed feedback are presented for both Kerr and semiconductor-based devices. The last part presents future perspectives on rogue waves to three-dimensional dispersive and diffractive nonlinear resonators.",

SLIM can study cell dynamics, cell growth and proliferation, cell migration, mass transport, etc. In clinical settings, SLIM can assist with cancer studies, reproductive technology, blood testing, etc. Finally, we review an emerging trend, where SLIM imaging in conjunction with artificial intelligence brings computational specificity and, in turn, offers new solutions to outstanding challenges in cell biology and pathology.",

As these neural networks are expanding their capabilities toward achieving state-of-the-art solutions for demanding statistical inference tasks in various applications, there appears to be a global need for low-power, scalable, and fast computing hardware beyond what existing electronic systems can offer. Optical computing might potentially address some of these needs with its inherent parallelism, power efficiency, and high speed.

    "abstract": "The advent of chirped-pulse amplification in the 1980s and femtosecond Ti:sapphire lasers in the 1990s enabled transformative advances in intense laser–matter interaction physics. Whereas most of experiments have been conducted in the limited near-infrared range of 0.8–1 μm, theories predict that many physical phenomena such as high harmonic generation in gases favor long laser wavelengths in terms of extending the high-energy cutoff. Significant progress has been made in developing few-cycle, carrier-envelope phase-stabilized, high-peak-power lasers in the 1.6–2 μm range that has laid the foundation for attosecond X ray sources in the water window. Even longer wavelength lasers are becoming available that are suitable to study light filamentation, high harmonic generation, and laser–plasma interaction in the relativistic regime. Long-wavelength lasers are suitable for sub-bandgap strong-field excitation of a wide range of solid materials, including semiconductors. In the strong-field limit, bulk crystals also produce high-order harmonics. In this review, we first introduce several important wavelength scaling laws in strong-field physics, then describe recent breakthroughs in short- (1.4–3 μm), mid- (3–8 μm), and long-wave (8–15 μm) infrared laser technology, and finally provide examples of strong-field applications of these novel lasers. Some of the broadband ultrafast infrared lasers will have profound effects on medicine, environmental protection, and national defense, because their wavelengths cover the water absorption band, the molecular fingerprint region, as well as the atmospheric infrared transparent window.",

    "abstract": "This tutorial-review on applications of artificial neural networks in photonics targets a broad audience, ranging from optical research and engineering communities to computer science and applied mathematics. We focus here on the research areas at the interface between these disciplines, attempting to find the right balance between technical details specific to each domain and overall clarity. First, we briefly recall key properties and peculiarities of some core neural network types, which we believe are the most relevant to photonics, also linking the layer's theoretical design to some photonics hardware realizations. After that, we elucidate the question of how to fine-tune the selected model's design to perform the required task with optimized accuracy. Then, in the review part, we discuss recent developments and progress for several selected applications of neural networks in photonics, including multiple aspects relevant to optical communications, imaging, sensing, and the design of new materials and lasers. In the following section, we put a special emphasis on how to accurately evaluate the complexity of neural networks in the context of the transition from algorithms to hardware implementation. The introduced complexity characteristics are used to analyze the applications of neural networks in optical communications, as a specific, albeit highly important example, comparing those with some benchmark signal processing methods. We combine the description of the well-known model compression strategies used in machine learning, with some novel techniques introduced recently in optical applications of neural networks. It is important to stress that although our focus in this tutorial-review is on photonics, we believe that the methods and techniques presented here can be handy in a much wider range of scientific and engineering applications.",

    "abstract": "Since the invention of the silicon subwavelength grating waveguide in 2006, subwavelength metamaterial engineering has become an essential design tool in silicon photonics. Employing well-established nanometer-scale semiconductor manufacturing techniques to create metamaterials in optical waveguides has allowed unprecedented control of the flow of light in photonic chips. This is achieved through fine-tuning of fundamental optical properties such as modal confinement, effective index, dispersion, and anisotropy, directly by lithographic imprinting of a specific subwavelength grating structure onto a nanophotonic waveguide. In parallel, low-loss mode propagation is readily obtained over a broad spectral range since the subwavelength periodicity effectively avoids losses due to spurious resonances and bandgap effects. In this review we present recent advances achieved in the surging field of metamaterial integrated photonics. After briefly introducing the fundamental concepts governing the propagation of light in periodic waveguides via Floquet–Bloch modes, we review progress in the main application areas of subwavelength nanostructures in silicon photonics, presenting the most representative devices. We specifically focus on off-chip coupling interfaces, polarization management and anisotropy engineering, spectral filtering and wavelength multiplexing, evanescent field biochemical sensing, mid-infrared photonics, and nonlinear waveguide optics and optomechanics. We also introduce a nascent research area of resonant integrated photonics leveraging Mie resonances in dielectrics for on-chip guiding of optical waves, with the first Huygens’ metawaveguide recently demonstrated. Finally, we provide a brief overview of inverse design approaches and machine-learning algorithms for on-chip optical metamaterials. In our conclusions, we summarize the key developments while highlighting the challenges and future prospects.",

The demand for such ultimate single-mode high-brightness semiconductor lasers is increasing for a wide variety of emerging applications including next-generation remote sensing for smart mobility and high-precision laser processing for smart manufacturing. Photonic-crystal surface-emitting lasers (PCSELs) show promise to meet these demands, based on their broad-area coherent two-dimensional (2D) resonance at a singularity (Γ) point of their 2D photonic band structure. In this tutorial paper, the lasing principle, theoretical analysis, and experimental demonstration of PCSELs are described. Recent progress in PCSEL development, including the formulation of a design guideline for realizing 100-W-to-kW-class single-mode operation, the experimental demonstration of a brightness of 1 GW cm –2 sr –1 , and an extension of the lasing wavelengths to telecommunication and mid-infrared wavelengths are also covered.",

The local field depends very sensitively on the microcopic environment in an optical medium. It is thus possible to achieve a significant control over the local field by intermixing homogeneous materials on a nanoscale to produce composite optical materials. A combination of local-field effects and nanostructuring provides new degrees of freedom for manipulating the optical properties of photonic materials. Especially interesting opportunities open up in the nonlinear optical regime where the material response depends on the local-field correction as a power law. The goal of this review is to present a conceptual overview of the influence of local-field effects on the optical properties of photonic materials, both homogeneous and composite. We also give a summary of recent achievements in controlling the optical properties by local-field effects and nanostructuring.",

Different methods to generate optical vortices have been devised to date. Among them, several are based on the exploitation of light–matter interaction in liquid-crystal media. This review focuses on the main mechanisms of vortex generation in liquid crystals, in particular on vortex generation induced by umbilics, that is, defects arising in homeotropically aligned nematic cells, which act as topological matter templates able to realize the conversion from spin to orbital angular momentum of an incoming Gaussian beam. Optical vortex induction in a photosensitive light valve is presented as a self-stabilizing mechanism leading to reconfigurable and programmable vortex arrays. On each lattice site, every matter vortex acts as a photonic spin-to-orbital momentum coupler, converting input arrays of circularly polarized beams into output arrays of vortex beams with topological charges consistent with the matter lattice symmetry.",

    "abstract": "Unlike conventional optics, plasmonics enables unrivaled concentration of optical energy well beyond the diffraction limit of light. However, a significant part of this energy is dissipated as heat. Plasmonic losses present a major hurdle in the development of plasmonic devices and circuits that can compete with other mature technologies. Until recently, they have largely kept the use of plasmonics to a few niche areas where loss is not a key factor, such as surface-enhanced Raman scattering and biochemical sensing. Here, we discuss the origin of plasmonic losses and various approaches to either minimize or mitigate them based on understanding of fundamental processes underlying surface plasmon modes excitation and decay. Along with the ongoing effort to find and synthesize better plasmonic materials, optical designs that modify the optical powerflow through plasmonic nanostructures can help in reducing both radiative damping and dissipative losses of surface plasmons. Another strategy relies on the development of hybrid photonic–plasmonic devices by coupling plasmonic nanostructures to resonant optical elements. Hybrid integration not only helps to reduce dissipative losses and radiative damping of surface plasmons, but also makes possible passive radiative cooling of nanodevices. Finally, we review emerging applications of thermoplasmonics that leverage Ohmic losses to achieve new enhanced functionalities. The most successful commercialized example of a loss-enabled novel application of plasmonics is heat-assisted magnetic recording. Other promising technological directions include thermal emission manipulation, cancer therapy, nanofabrication, nanomanipulation, plasmon-enabled material spectroscopy and thermo-catalysis, solar water treatment, and thermophotovoltaics.",

With the advent of nanotechnology, we now have the ability to create optical materials, which are designed from the bottom up, with dimensions of the order of the wavelength of light. While it has been known for some time that nanoparticles exhibit such exciting properties, recent (widespread) research in nanoparticles has significantly increased our understanding of how to fabricate and use nanoparticles for a myriad of enduring and emerging optical applications. Drastic modifications to the \"bulk\" optical properties of standard materials in these applications are possible, enabling \"nano-engineered\" optical properties with several degrees of design freedom, including material, size, morphology, surrounding media, and nearby structures. Understanding these sensitivities has led to optical control from the ultraviolet through the infrared spectrum. To highlight this, the following review provides a comprehensive snapshot of how these effects have been captured in models and experimentally demonstrated in terms of spectral selectivity in absorption, scattering, and emission. In addition, we discuss recent progress toward using nanoparticles in real applications, most commonly in fluid suspensions or solid thin films as a means to create the next generation of highly scalable and (potentially) low-cost spectrally selective optical materials.",

    "abstract": "We review recent developments in directly modulated lasers (DMLs) with low operating energy for datacom and computercom applications. Key issues are their operating energy and the cost for employing them in these applications. To decrease the operating energy, it is important to reduce the active volume of the laser while maintaining the cavity Q-factor or photon lifetime in the cavity. Therefore, how to achieve high-reflectivity mirrors has been the main challenge in reducing the operating energy. In terms of the required output power from the lasers, the required input power into the photodetector and the transmission distance determine the lower limit of laser active volume. Therefore, the operating energy and output power are in a trade-off relationship. In designing the lasers, the cavity volume, quantum well number, and optical confinement factor are critical parameters. For reducing the cost, it is important to fabricate a large-scale photonic integrated circuit (PIC) comprising DMLs, an optical multiplexer, and monitor photodetectors because the lower assembly cost reduces the overall cost. In this context, silicon (Si) photonics technology plays a key role in fabricating large-scale PICs with low cost, and heterogeneous integration of DMLs and Si photonics devices has attracted much attention. We will describe fabrication technologies for heterogeneous integration and experimental results for DMLs on a Si substrate.",

    "abstract": "This tutorial describes the application of digital holography to the terahertz spectral region and demonstrates how to reconstruct images of complex dielectric targets. Using highly coherent terahertz sources, high-fidelity amplitude and phase reconstructions are achieved, but because the millimeter-scale wavelengths approach the decimeter-sized targets and optical components, undesirable aperture diffraction degrades the quality of the reconstructions. Consequently, off-axis terahertz digital holography differs significantly from its visible light counterpart. This tutorial addresses these challenges within the angular spectrum method and the Fresnel approximation for digital hologram reconstruction, from which the longitudinal and transverse resolution limits may be specified. We observed longitudinal resolution ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" id=\"m1\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mi>λ</mml:mi> <mml:mo>/</mml:mo> <mml:mn>284</mml:mn> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> ) almost two times better than has been achieved with visible light digital holographic microscopy and demonstrate that submicrometer longitudinal resolution is possible using millimeter wavelengths for an imager limited ultimately by the phase stability of the terahertz source and/or receiver. Minimizing the number of optical components, using only large reflective optics, maximizing the angle of the off-axis reference beam, and judicious selection of spatial frequency filters all contribute to improve the quality of the reconstructed image. As in visible wavelength analog holography, the observed transverse resolution in terahertz digital holography is comparable to the wavelength but improves for features near the edge of the imaged object compared with features near the center, a behavior characterized by a modified description of the holographic transfer function introduced here. Holograms were recorded by raster scanning a sensitive superheterodyne receiver, and several visibly transparent and opaque dielectric structures were quantitatively examined to demonstrate the compelling application of terahertz digital holography for nondestructive test, evaluation, and analysis.",

The ever-increasing demand for high-capacity optical devices has prompted the use of physically orthogonal dimensions of light for optical multiplexing. Recent advances in nanotechnology, mainly stemming from functionalized nanomaterials and powerful nanofabrication tools, have propelled the fusion of optical multiplexing and nanophotonics (the study of light at nanoscale and of its interactions with nanostructures) by enabling ultrahigh-capacity information technology. This review aims to introduce the emerging concept of angular momentum (AM)-involved information optics and its implementation in nanophotonic devices. First, previous researches on the manipulation of spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM) by nanostructures will be reviewed. We then summarize the SAM multiplexing technology on the platform of metasurfaces. Particularly, we elaborately summarize our recent progress in the area of information optics, including OAM holography and on-chip AM multiplexing technology.

    "abstract": "Starting with a historical account of evolution in Raman spectroscopy, in this review we provide details of the advancements that have pushed detection limits to single molecules and enabled non-invasive molecular characterization of distinct organelles to provide next-generation bioanalytical assays and ultrasensitive molecular and cellular diagnostics. Amidst a growing number of publications in recent years, there is an unmet need for a consolidated review that discusses salient aspects of Raman spectroscopy that are broadly applicable in biosensing ranging from fundamental biology to disease identification and staging, to drug screening and food and agriculture quality control. This review offers a discussion across this range of applications and focuses on the convergent use of Raman spectroscopy, coupling it to bioanalysis, agriculture, and food quality control, which can affect human life through biomedical research, drug discovery, and disease diagnostics. We also highlight how the potent combination of advanced spectroscopy and machine-learning algorithms can further advance Raman data analysis, leading to the emergence of an optical Omics discipline, coined “Ramanomics.” Finally, we present our perspectives on future needs and opportunities.",

    "abstract": "Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), also known as white graphite, is a transparent layered crystal with a wide bandgap. Its crystal structure resembles graphite, featuring layers composed of honeycomb lattices held together through van der Waals forces. The layered crystal structure of hBN facilitates exfoliation into thinner flakes and makes it highly anisotropic in in-plane and out-of-plane directions. Unlike graphite, hBN is both insulating and transparent, making it an ideal material for isolating devices from the environment and acting as a waveguide. As a result, hBN has found extensive applications in optical devices, electronic devices, and quantum photonic devices. This comprehensive tutorial aims to provide readers with a thorough understanding of hBN, covering its synthesis, lattice and spectroscopic characterization, and various applications in optoelectronic and quantum photonic devices. This tutorial is designed for both readers without prior experience in hBN and those with expertise in specific fields seeking to understand its relevance and connections to others.",

    "abstract": "Since the development of laser light sources in the early 1960s, laser beams are everywhere. Laser beams are central in many industrial applications and are essential in ample scientific research fields. Prime scientific examples are optical trapping of ultracold atoms, optical levitation of particles, and laser-based detection of gravitational waves. Mathematically, laser beams are well described by Gaussian beam expressions. Rather well covered in the literature to date are basic expressions for scalar Gaussian beams. In the past, however, higher accuracy mathematics of scalar Gaussian beams and certainly high-accuracy mathematics of vectorial Gaussian beams were far less studied. The objective of the present review then is to summarize and advance the mathematics of vectorial Gaussian beams. When a weakly diverging Gaussian beam, approximated as a linearly polarized two-component plane wave, say (Ex,By), is tightly focused by a high-numerical-aperture lens, the wave is \"depolarized.\" Namely, the prelens (practically) missing electric field Ey,Ez components suddenly appear. This is similar for the prelens missing Bx,Bz components. In fact, for any divergence angle (θd<1), the ratio of maximum electric field amplitudes of a Gaussian beam Ex:Ez:Ey is roughly 1:θd2:θd4. It follows that if a research case involves a tightly focused laser beam, then the case analysis calls for the mathematics of vectorial Gaussian beams. Gaussian-beam-like distributions of the six electric–magnetic vector field components that nearly exactly satisfy Maxwell's equations are presented. We show that the near-field distributions with and without evanescent waves are markedly different from each other. The here-presented nearly exact six electric–magnetic Gaussian-beam-like field components are symmetric, meaning that the cross-sectional amplitude distribution of Ex(x,y) at any distance (z) is similar to the By(x,y) distribution, Ey(x,y) is similar to Bx(x,y), and a 90° rotated Ez(x,y) is similar to Bz(x,y). Components' symmetry was achieved by executing the steps of an outlined symmetrization procedure. Regardless of how tightly a Gaussian beam is focused, its divergence angle is limited. We show that the full-cone angle to full width at half-maximum intensity of the dominant vector field component does not exceed 60°. The highest accuracy field distributions to date of the less familiar higher-order Hermite–Gaussian vector components are also presented. Hermite–Gaussian E-B vectors only approximately satisfy Maxwell's equations. We have defined a Maxwell's-residual power measure to quantify the approximation quality of different vector sets, and each set approximately (or exactly) satisfies Maxwell's equations. Several vectorial \"applications,\" i.e., research fields that involve vector laser beams, are briefly discussed. The mathematics of vectorial Gaussian beams is particularly applicable to the analysis of the physical systems associated with such applications. Two user-friendly \"Mathematica\" programs, one for computing six high-accuracy vector components of a Hermite–Gaussian beam, and the other for computing the six practically Maxwell's-equations-satisfying components of a focused laser beam, supplement this review.",

    "abstract": "Dielectric laser accelerators (DLAs) are fundamentally based on the interaction of photons with free electrons, where energy and momentum conservation are satisfied by mediation of a nanostructure. In this scheme, the photonic nanostructure induces near-fields which transfer energy from the photon to the electron, similar to the inverse-Smith–Purcell effect described in metallic gratings. This, in turn, may provide ground-breaking applications, as it is a technology promising to miniaturize particle accelerators down to the chip scale. This fundamental interaction can also be used to study and demonstrate quantum photon-electron phenomena. The spontaneous and stimulated Smith–Purcell effect and the photon-induced near-field electron-microscopy (PINEM) effect have evolved to be a fruitful ground for observing quantum effects. In particular, the energy spectrum of the free electron has been shown to have discrete energy peaks, spaced with the interacting photon energy. This energy spectrum is correlated to the photon statistics and number of photon exchanges that took place during the interaction. We give an overview of DLA and PINEM physics with a focus on electron phase-space manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Photonic integrated circuits with second-order ( χ (2) ) nonlinearities are rapidly scaling to remarkably low powers. At this time, state-of-the-art devices achieve saturated nonlinear interactions with thousands of photons when driven by continuous-wave lasers, and further reductions in these energy requirements enabled by the use of ultrafast pulses may soon push nonlinear optics into the realm of single-photon nonlinearities. This tutorial reviews these recent developments in ultrafast nonlinear photonics, discusses design strategies for realizing few-photon nonlinear interactions, and presents a unified treatment of ultrafast quantum nonlinear optics using a framework that smoothly interpolates from classical behaviors to the few-photon scale. These emerging platforms for quantum optics fundamentally differ from typical realizations in cavity quantum electrodynamics due to the large number of coupled optical modes. Classically, multimode behaviors have been well studied in nonlinear optics, with famous examples including soliton formation and supercontinuum generation. In contrast, multimode quantum systems exhibit a far greater variety of behaviors, and yet closed-form solutions are even sparser than their classical counterparts. In developing a framework for ultrafast quantum optics, we identify what behaviors carry over from classical to quantum devices, what intuition must be abandoned, and what new opportunities exist at the intersection of ultrafast and quantum nonlinear optics. Although this article focuses on establishing connections between the classical and quantum behaviors of devices with χ (2) nonlinearities, the frameworks developed here are general and are readily extended to the description of dynamical processes based on third-order χ (3) nonlinearities.",

The spectra and eigenmode characteristics of extended non-Hermitian systems depend strongly on the boundary conditions. With periodic boundary conditions, the spectra can become complex, leading to band winding on the complex frequency plane. With open boundary conditions, the eigenmodes have spatial profiles that are localized at the boundary, an effect known as the non-Hermitian skin effect. Here we provide an overview of the band winding and skin effects in non-Hermitian photonics bands, focusing on one-dimensional cases and photonic applications.

    "abstract": "The dispersive properties of materials, i.e., their frequency-dependent response to the interaction with light, in most situations determines whether an optical process can be observed. Although one can always search for a specific material with the sought-after properties, this material might be far from optimum or might not even exist. Therefore, it is of great interest to develop methods that could tune the dispersive properties of a medium independently of the working frequency band. Pulses with angular dispersion, or pulse-front tilt, precisely allow us to achieve this goal. In this tutorial, we show the basics of how angular dispersion can manage to tune the dispersion parameters that characterize the propagation of light in a medium, thus permitting the observation and application of various optical processes in nonlinear and quantum optics that could not be realized otherwise. To keep the focus on first principles, the list of topics addressed is not exhaustive. More specifically, we consider the role of angular dispersion for pulse stretching and compression, broadband second-harmonic generation, the generation of temporal solitons in nonlinear χ(2) media, the tunable generation of terahertz waves by means of optical rectification of femtosecond pulses, and the tuning of the frequency correlations and of the bandwidth of entangled paired photons.",

    "abstract": "A landmark in the development of quantum electrodynamics was the discovery that emission–reabsorption of virtual photons modifies the value of energy levels in an atom from those computed by using Dirac's equation (Lamb shift). An early result of statistical quantum electrodynamics was that the exchange of virtual photons in an ensemble of identical atoms leads as well to a change in the frequency of the radiation emitted from this system (cooperative Lamb shift). Dicke's discovery that coherence effects lead to the shortening of the emission lifetime from a small sample by a factor equal to the number of atoms in the ensemble (superradiance or cooperative decay rate) was an early landmark in quantum optics. Both cooperative decay rate and cooperative Lamb shift were shown to have the same physical origin—the exchange of virtual photons, a process described by the Lienard–Wiechert dipole–dipole interaction. This effective potential is the kernel of the integral equation describing the dynamics of the system. This complex long-range kernel gives, for both cooperative quantities, strong dependence on the geometry of the atomic cloud. I summarize the known expressions for the initial cooperative decay rate and the cooperative Lamb shift in different geometries. The results for both the scalar photon and the vector photon (electrodynamics) theories for experimentally realizable systems of either uniform or phased polarization are given.",

    "abstract": "Stimulated Raman scattering is essentially a \"light amplification,\" and some of the most important applications are light amplifiers and laser sources. Important achievements have been obtained in the fields of fiber amplification and integrated photonics. However, photonics components, currently used in optical interconnects, are relatively large and not ideally suited to on-chip integration. A reduction in the size of integrated optical devices, while maintaining a high level of performance, is a key challenge in photonics. On this line of argument, the ability to construct nano-objects is expected to have a significant impact in the future, leading to the development of fully functional nanodevices, such as nanoscale optical sources. The aim of this work is to review accomplishments in the field of stimulated Raman scattering in nanostructures, to delineate the state of the art, and to identify the emerging trends and remaining challenges.",

    "abstract": "The theory of molecular nonlinear optics based on the sum-over-states (SOS) model is reviewed. The interaction of radiation with a single wtpisolated molecule is treated by first-order perturbation theory, and expressions are derived for the linear (αij) polarizability and nonlinear (βijk, γijkl) molecular hyperpolarizabilities in terms of the properties of the molecular states and the electric dipole transition moments for light-induced transitions between them. Scale invariance is used to estimate fundamental limits for these polarizabilities. The crucial role of the spatial symmetry of both the single molecules and their ordering in dense media, and the transition from the single molecule to the dense medium case (susceptibilities χij(1), χijk(2), χijkl(3)), is discussed. For example, for βijk, symmetry determines whether a molecule can support second-order nonlinear processes or not. For asymmetric molecules, examples of the frequency dispersion based on a two-level model (ground state and one excited state) are the simplest possible for βijk and examples of the resulting frequency dispersion are given. The third-order susceptibility is too complicated to yield simple results in terms of symmetry properties. It will be shown that whereas a two-level model suffices for asymmetric molecules, symmetric molecules require a minimum of three levels in order to describe effects such as two-photon absorption. The frequency dispersion of the third-order susceptibility will be shown and the importance of one and two-photon transitions will be discussed.",

Conventionally, both functions are implemented in physical optics. Throughout the digital age, however, joint design of physical sampling and electronic processing, e.g., computational imaging, has been increasingly applied to improve these functions. Over the past five years, deep learning has radically improved the capacity of computational imaging. Here we briefly review the development of artificial neural networks and their recent intersection with computational imaging. We then consider in more detail how deep learning impacts the primary strategies of computational photography: focal plane modulation, lens design, and robotic control. With focal plane modulation, we show that deep learning improves signal inference to enable faster hyperspectral, polarization, and video capture while reducing the power per pixel by <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\"><mml:mo>−</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>100</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo></mml:math> . With lens design, deep learning improves multiple aperture image fusion to enable task-specific array cameras. With control, deep learning enables dynamic scene-specific control that may ultimately enable cameras that capture the entire optical data cube (the “light field”), rather than just a focal slice. Finally, we discuss how these three strategies impact the physical camera design as we seek to balance physical compactness and simplicity, information capacity, computational complexity, and visual fidelity.",

    "abstract": "The nature of light, extending from the optical to the x-ray regime, is reviewed from a diffraction point of view by comparing field-based statistical optics and photon-based quantum optics approaches. The topic is introduced by comparing historical diffraction concepts based on wave interference, Dirac’s notion of photon self-interference, Feynman’s interference of space–time photon probability amplitudes, and Glauber’s formulation of coherence functions based on photon detection. The concepts are elucidated by a review of how the semiclassical combination of the disparate photon and wave concepts have been used to describe light creation, diffraction, and detection. The origin of the fundamental diffraction limit is then discussed in both wave and photon pictures. By use of Feynman’s concept of probability amplitudes associated with independent photons, we show that quantum electrodynamics, the complete theory of light, reduces in lowest order to the conventional wave formalism of diffraction. As an introduction to multi-photon effects, we then review fundamental one- and two-photon experiments and detection schemes, in particular the seminal Hanbury Brown–Twiss experiment. The formal discourse of the paper starts with a treatment of first-order coherence theory. In first order, the statistical optics and quantum optics formulations of coherence are shown to be equivalent. This is elucidated by a discussion of Zernike’s powerful theorem of partial coherence propagation, a cornerstone of statistical optics, followed by its quantum derivation based on the interference of single-photon probability amplitudes. The treatment is then extended to second-order coherence theory, where the equivalence of wave and particle descriptions is shown to break down. This is illustrated by considering two photons whose space–time probability amplitudes are correlated through nonlinear birth processes, resulting in entanglement or cloning. In both cases, the two-photon diffraction patterns are shown to exhibit resolution below the conventional diffraction limit, defined by the one-photon diffraction patterns. The origin of the reduction is shown to arise from the interference of two-photon probability amplitudes. By comparing first- and second-order diffraction, it is shown that the conventional first-order concept of partial coherence with its limits of chaoticity and first-order coherence has the second-order analogue of partial entanglement, with its limits corresponding to two entangled photons (“entangled biphotons”) and two cloned photons (“cloned biphotons”), the latter being second-order coherent. The concept of cloned biphotons is extended to the case of n cloned photons, resulting in a 1/n reduction of the diffraction limit. In the limit of nth-order coherence, all photons within the nth-order collective state are shown to propagate on particle like trajectories, reproducing the 0th-order ray-optics picture. These results are discussed in terms of the linearity of quantum mechanics and Heisenberg’s space–momentum uncertainty principle. A general concept of coherence based on photon density is developed that in first order is equivalent to the conventional wave-based picture.",

    "abstract": "Photonic integration has seen tremendous progress over the previous decade, and several integration platforms have reached industrial maturity. This evolution has prepared the ground for miniaturized photonic sensors that lend themselves to efficient analysis of gaseous and liquid media, exploiting large interactions lengths of guided light with surrounding analytes, possibly mediated by chemically functionalized waveguide surfaces. Among the various sensor concepts, phase-sensitive approaches are particularly attractive: offering a flexible choice of the operation wavelength, these schemes are amenable to large-scale integration on mature technology platforms such as silicon photonics or silicon nitride ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"> <mml:mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\"> <mml:msub> <mml:mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\"> <mml:mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\"> <mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">S</mml:mi> <mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> </mml:mrow> <mml:mn>3</mml:mn> </mml:msub> </mml:mrow> <mml:mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\"> <mml:msub> <mml:mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\"> <mml:mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\"> <mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">N</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> </mml:mrow> <mml:mn>4</mml:mn> </mml:msub> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> ) that have been developed in the context of tele- and data-communication applications. This paves the path toward miniaturized and robust sensor systems that offer outstanding scalability and that are perfectly suited for high-volume applications in life sciences, industrial process analytics, or consumer products. However, as the maturity of the underlying photonic integrated circuits (PICs) increases, system-level aspects of mass-deployable sensors gain importance. These aspects include, e.g., robust system concepts that can be operated outside controlled laboratory environments as well as readout schemes that can be implemented based on low-cost light sources, without the need for benchtop-type tunable lasers as typically used in scientific demonstrations. It is, thus, the goal of this tutorial to provide a holistic system model that allows us to better understand and to quantitatively benchmark the viability and performance of different phase-sensitive photonic sensor concepts under the stringent limitations of mass-deployable miniaturized systems. Specifically, we explain and formulate a generally applicable theoretical framework that allows for a quantitatively reliable end-to-end analysis of the overall signal chain. Building upon this framework, we identify and explain the most important technical parameters of the system, comprising the photonic sensor circuit, the light source, and the detector, as well as the readout and control scheme. We quantify and compare the achievable performance and the limitations that are associated with specific sensor structures based on Mach–Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) or high-Q optical ring resonators (RRs), and we condense our findings by formulating design guidelines both for sensor concepts. As a particularly attractive example, we discuss an MZI-based sensor implementation, relying on a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) as a power-efficient low-cost light source in combination with a simple and robust readout and control scheme. In contrast to RR-based sensor implementations, MZIs can be resilient to laser frequency noise, at the cost of a slightly lower sensitivity and a moderately increased footprint. To facilitate the application of our model, we provide a MATLAB-based application that visualizes the underlying physical principles and that can be readily used to estimate the achievable performance of a specific sensor system. The system-level design considerations are complemented by an overview of additional aspects that are important for successful sensor system implementation such as the design of the underlying waveguides, photonic system assembly concepts, and schemes for analyte handling.",

Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and maximum satisfiability (Max-SAT) are classes of NP-complete and NP-hard problems that are equally important and more practically relevant combinatorial optimization problems. Many approaches exist for solving Boolean SAT, such as quantum annealing and classical stochastic local search (SLS) solvers; however, they all are expected to require many steps to solve hard SAT problems and, thus, require large amounts of time and energy. In addition, a SAT problem can be converted into an Ising problem and solved by an Ising machine; however, we have found that this approach has drawbacks. As well as reviewing existing approaches to solving the SAT problem, we have extended the CIM algorithm and architecture to solve SAT and Max-SAT problems directly. This new technique is termed a coherent SAT solver (CSS). We have studied three implementations of the CSS, all-optical, hybrid optical–digital and all digital (cyber-CSS), and have compared the time-to-solution and energy-to-solution of three machines. The cyber-CSS, which is already implemented using a graphics processing unit (GPU), demonstrates competitive performance against existing SLS solvers such as probSAT. The CSS is also compared with another continuous-time SAT solver known as the CTDS, and the scaling behavior is evaluated for random 3-SAT problems. The hybrid optical–digital CSS is a more performant and practical machine that can be realized in a short term. Finally, the all-optical CSS promises the best energy-to-solution cost; however various technical challenges in nonlinear optics await us in order to build this machine.",

    "abstract": "Nonimaging optics is the theory of thermodynamically efficient optics and as such, depends more on thermodynamics than on optics. Historically, nonimaging optics that work as ideal concentrators have been discovered through such heuristic ideas as “edge ray involutes,” “string method,” “simultaneous multiple surface,” and “tailored edge ray concentrator,” without a consistent theoretical definition of what “ideal” means. In this tutorial, we provide a thermodynamic perspective of nonimaging optical designs to shine light on the commonality of all these designing ideas, or what “ideal” nonimaging design means. Hence, in this paper, a condition for the “best” design is proposed based purely on thermodynamic arguments, which we believe have profound consequences. Thermodynamics may also be the most intuitive way for a reader who is new to this subject to understand or study it within a certain framework, instead of learning from sporadic designing methodologies. This way of looking at the problem of efficient concentration and illumination depends on probabilities, the ingredients of entropy, and information theory, while “optics” in the conventional sense recedes into the background. We attempt to link the key concept of nonimaging optics, etendue, with the radiative heat transfer concept of view factor, which may be more familiar to some readers. However, we do not want to limit the readers to a single thermodynamic understanding of this subject. Therefore, two alternative perspectives of nonimaging optics will also be introduced and used throughout the tutorial: the definition of a nonimaging optics design according to the Hilbert integral, and the phase space analysis of the ideal design. The tutorial will be organized as follows: Section 1 highlights the difference between nonimaging and imaging optics, Section 2 describes the thermodynamic understanding of nonimaging optics, Section 3 presents the alternative phase space representation of nonimaging optics, Section 4 describes the most basic nonimaging designs using Hottel’s strings, Section 5 discusses the geometric flow line designing method, and Section 6 summarizes the various concepts of nonimaging optics.",

In particular, we study the sudden death of the entanglement in a two-atom system with a common reservoir.",

    "abstract": "Birefringence affects all the optical circuits both in free-space and guided-wave optics. It perturbs the state of polarization of the propagating light, causing unwanted detrimental effects in many practical situations. A retracing circuit offers the potentiality of compensating the birefringence, but it is not universal because the birefringence is of different kinds, that is, either linear or circular, as well as either reciprocal or nonreciprocal, and because the common mirror does not hold all the requested symmetries. This paper reviews the compensation techniques suitable for each kind of birefringence, taking into account the introduction of two further generalized mirrors, the mirrored Faraday rotator and the mirrored quarter-wave plate. The main retracing schemes are analyzed and presented with the help of the Poincaré sphere and the Jones matrices. Examples of full compensation of all the main cases of birefringence that occurs in practical optical circuits are given. The different compensation properties of the three mirrors can be interpreted by means of a unified vision in the abstract space related to the Poincaré sphere representation.",

    "abstract": "The Fourier optics technique is founded on the transfer function derived from the scalar wave equation and thus has traditionally been applied to monochromatic scalar fields propagating paraxially in isotropic lossless materials. We review scalar and vector diffraction theory to show that the scalar Fourier optics technique can be seamlessly extended to the case of time-dependent nonparaxial and evanescent vector fields propagating in anisotropic and/or absorbing materials. The missing piece is shown to be the Fourier-domain vector boundary conditions that have recently been derived from the real-domain vector Rayleigh–Sommerfeld diffraction integral. These boundary conditions, complemented by the anisotropic transfer functions provided by the roots of the Booker quartic, combine the rigor of Green's function integrals with the intuitive simplicity and general applicability of Fourier optics. We illustrate the power of this technique via analytically simple solutions to traditionally complex problems such as Fresnel transmission between arbitrary media, uniaxial conoscopy, and biaxial conical refraction. The accuracy of vector near-field diffraction is validated via comparison with the finite-difference time-domain method.",

We consider a device geometry similar to that used in well-known Bell state measurements, which we analyze using a conceptually transparent model of stochastic quantum trajectories; we use this to review photodetection, the most straightforward case, and then generalize to the diffusive trajectories from homodyne and heterodyne detection as well. Such quadrature measurement schemes are a realistic two-qubit extension of existing circuit QED experiments, which obtain quantum trajectories by homodyning or heterodyning a superconducting qubit’s spontaneous emission, or an adaptation of existing optical measurement schemes to obtain jump trajectories from emitters. We mention key results, presented from within a single theoretical framework, and draw connections to concepts in the wider literature on entanglement generation by measurement (such as path information erasure and entanglement swapping). The photon which-path information acquisition, and therefore the two-qubit entanglement yield, is tunable under the homodyne detection scheme we discuss, at best generating equivalent average entanglement dynamics as in the comparable photodetection case. In addition to deriving this known equivalence, we extend past analyses in our characterization of the measurement dynamics: we include derivations of bounds on the fastest possible evolution toward a Bell state under joint homodyne measurement dynamics and characterize the maximal entanglement yield possible using inefficient (lossy) measurements.",
