A recent focus in machine‐learning research has been to extend traditional machine‐learning classification techniques to classify nodes in such networks. In this article, we provide a brief introduction to this area of research and how it has progressed during the past decade. We introduce four of the most widely used inference algorithms for classifying networked data and empirically compare them on both synthetic and real‐world data.",

Slated to take effect as law across the EU in 2018, it will restrict automated individual decision-making (that is, algorithms that make decisions based on user-level predictors) which \"significantly affect\" users. The law will also effectively create a \"right to explanation,\" whereby a user can ask for an explanation of an algorithmic decision that was made about them. We argue that while this law will pose large challenges for industry, it highlights opportunities for computer scientists to take the lead in designing algorithms and evaluation frameworks which avoid discrimination and enable explanation.",

System developers would then only need to worry about creating the specialized knowledge and reasoners new to the specific task of their system. This new system would interoperate with existing systems, using them to perform some of its reasoning. In this way, declarative knowledge, problem- solving techniques, and reasoning services could all be shared among systems. This approach would facilitate building bigger and better systems cheaply. The infrastructure to support such sharing and reuse would lead to greater ubiquity of these systems, potentially transforming the knowledge industry. This article presents a vision of the future in which knowledge-based system development and operation is facilitated by infrastructure and technology for knowledge sharing. It describes an initiative currently under way to develop these ideas and suggests steps that must be taken in the future to try to realize this vision.",

DARPA's explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) program endeavors to create AI systems whose learned models and decisions can be understood and appropriately trusted by end users. Realizing this goal requires methods for learning more explainable models, designing effective explanation interfaces, and understanding the psychologic requirements for effective explanations. The XAI developer teams are addressing the first two challenges by creating ML techniques and developing principles, strategies, and human‐computer interaction techniques for generating effective explanations. Another XAI team is addressing the third challenge by summarizing, extending, and applying psychologic theories of explanation to help the XAI evaluator define a suitable evaluation framework, which the developer teams will use to test their systems. The XAI teams completed the first of this 4‐year program in May 2018. In a series of ongoing evaluations, the developer teams are assessing how well their XAM systems' explanations improve user understanding, user trust, and user task performance.",

We present a number of case studies that demonstrate how interactivity results in a tight coupling between the system and the user, exemplify ways in which some existing systems fail to account for the user, and explore new ways for learning systems to interact with their users.

Numerous papers have lobbied for one or another variety of representation, other papers have argued for various properties a representation should have, and still others have focused on properties that are important to the notion of representation in general. In this article, we go back to basics to address the question directly. We believe that the answer can best be understood in terms of five important and distinctly different roles that a representation plays, each of which places different and, at times, conflicting demands on the properties a representation should have. We argue that keeping in mind all five of these roles provides a usefully broad perspective that sheds light on some longstanding disputes and can invigorate both research and practice in the field.",

    "abstract": "This article presents the methodology that has been successfully used over the past seven years by an interdisciplinary team to create the International Committee for Documentation of the International Council of Museums (CIDOC) CONCEPTUAL REFERENCE MODEL (CRM), a high-level ontology to enable information integration for cultural heritage data and their correlation with library and archive information. The CIDOC CRM is now in the process to become an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard. This article justifies in detail the methodology and design by functional requirements and gives examples of its contents. The CIDOC CRM analyzes the common conceptualizations behind data and metadata structures to support data transformation, mediation, and merging. It is argued that such ontologies are property-centric, in contrast to terminological systems, and should be built with different methodologies. It is demonstrated that ontological and epistemological arguments are equally important for an effective design, in particular when dealing with knowledge from the past in any domain. It is assumed that the presented methodology and the upper level of the ontology are applicable in a far wider domain.",

Most of the subtasks are not really specific to design as such. The analysis shows that there is no one ideal method for design, and good design problem solving is a result of recursively selecting methods based on a number of criteria, including knowledge availability.

The comparison framework includes general characteristics, such as the purpose of an ontology, its coverage (general or domain specific), its size, and the formalism used. It also includes the design process used in creating an ontology and the methods used to evaluate it. Characteristics that describe the content of an ontology include taxonomic organization, types of concept covered, top-level divisions, internal structure of concepts, representation of part-whole relations, and the presence and nature of additional axioms. Finally, we consider what experiments or applications have used the ontologies. Knowledge sharing and reuse will require a common framework to support interoperability of independently created ontologies. Our study shows there is great diversity in the way ontologies are designed and the way they represent the world. By identifying the similarities and differences among existing ontologies, we clarify the range of alternatives in creating a standard framework for ontology design.",

Here we propose developing such a model for humanlike minds, computational entities whose structures and processes are substantially similar to those found in human cognition. Our hypothesis is that cognitive architectures provide the appropriate computational abstraction for defining a standard model, although the standard model is not itself such an architecture. The proposed standard model began as an initial consensus at the 2013 AAAI Fall Symposium on Integrated Cognition, but is extended here through a synthesis across three existing cognitive architectures: ACT‐R, Sigma, and Soar. The resulting standard model spans key aspects of structure and processing, memory and content, learning, and perception and motor, and highlights loci of architectural agreement as well as disagreement with the consensus while identifying potential areas of remaining incompleteness. The hope is that this work will provide an important step toward engaging the broader community in further development of the standard model of the mind.",

First, we introduce general design theory, from which a descriptive model of design pro- cesses is derived. In this model, the concept of metamodels plays a crucial role in describing the evolutionary nature of design. Second, we show a cognitive design process model obtained by observing design processes using a protocol anal- ysis method. We then discuss a computable model that can explain most parts of the cogni- tive model and also interpret the descriptive model. In the computable model, a design pro- cess is regarded as an iterative logical process realized by abduction, deduction, and circum- scription. We implemented a design simulator that can trace design processes in which design specifications and design solutions are gradually revised as the design proceeds.",

In this article, we outline some of the challenges encountered and lessons learned in using deep learning for recommender systems at Netflix. We first provide an overview of the various recommendation tasks on the Netflix service. We found that different model architectures excel at different tasks. Even though many deep‐learning models can be understood as extensions of existing (simple) recommendation algorithms, we initially did not observe significant improvements in performance over well‐tuned non‐deep‐learning approaches. Only when we added numerous features of heterogeneous types to the input data, deep‐learning models did start to shine in our setting. We also observed that deep‐learning methods can exacerbate the problem of offline–online metric (mis‐)alignment. After addressing these challenges, deep learning has ultimately resulted in large improvements to our recommendations as measured by both offline and online metrics. On the practical side, integrating deep‐learning toolboxes in our system has made it faster and easier to implement and experiment with both deep‐learning and non‐deep‐learning approaches for various recommendation tasks. We conclude this article by summarizing our take‐aways that may generalize to other applications beyond Netflix.",

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has great potential to reshape the landscape of combating misinformation. Generally, LLMs can be a double‐edged sword in the fight. On the one hand, LLMs bring promising opportunities for combating misinformation due to their profound world knowledge and strong reasoning abilities. Thus, one emerging question is: can we utilize LLMs to combat misinformation? On the other hand, the critical challenge is that LLMs can be easily leveraged to generate deceptive misinformation at scale. Then, another important question is: how to combat LLM‐generated misinformation? In this paper, we first systematically review the history of combating misinformation before the advent of LLMs. Then we illustrate the current efforts and present an outlook for these two fundamental questions, respectively. The goal of this survey paper is to facilitate the progress of utilizing LLMs for fighting misinformation and call for interdisciplinary efforts from different stakeholders for combating LLM‐generated misinformation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Many research fields are currently reckoning with issues of poor levels of reproducibility. Some label it a “crisis,” and research employing or building machine learning (ML) models is no exception. Issues including lack of transparency, data or code, poor adherence to standards, and the sensitivity of ML training conditions mean that many papers are not even reproducible in principle. Where they are, though, reproducibility experiments have found worryingly low degrees of similarity with original results. Despite previous appeals from ML researchers on this topic and various initiatives from conference reproducibility tracks to the ACM's new Emerging Interest Group on Reproducibility and Replicability, we contend that the general community continues to take this issue too lightly. Poor reproducibility threatens trust in and integrity of research results. Therefore, in this article, we lay out a new perspective on the key barriers and drivers (both procedural and technical) to increased reproducibility at various levels (methods, code, data, and experiments). We then map the drivers to the barriers to give concrete advice for strategies for researchers to mitigate reproducibility issues in their own work, to lay out key areas where further research is needed in specific areas, and to further ignite discussion on the threat presented by these urgent issues.",

    "abstract": "Fast-forward (FF) was the most successful automatic planner in the Fifth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Planning and Scheduling (AIPS '00) planning systems competition. Like the well-known hsp system, FF relies on forward search in the state space, guided by a heuristic that estimates goal distances by ignoring delete lists. It differs from HSP in a number of important details. This article describes the algorithmic techniques used in FF in comparison to hsp and evaluates their benefits in terms of run-time and solution-length behavior. Humans have a remarkable capability to perform a wide variety of physical and mental tasks without any measurements and any computations. Familiar examples are parking a car, driving in city traffic, playing golf, cooking a meal, and summarizing a story. In performing such tasks, humans use perceptions of time, direction, speed, shape, possibility, likelihood, truth, and other attributes of physical and mental objects. Reflecting the bounded ability of the human brain to resolve detail, perceptions are intrinsically imprecise. In more concrete terms, perceptions are f-granular, meaning that (1) the boundaries of perceived classes are unsharp and (2) the values of attributes are granulated, with a granule being a clump of values (points, objects) drawn together by indistinguishability, similarity, proximity, and function. For example, the granules of age might be labeled very young, young, middle aged, old, very old, and so on. F-granularity of perceptions puts them well beyond the reach of traditional methods of analysis based on predicate logic or probability theory. The computational theory of perceptions (CTP), which is outlined in this article, adds to the armamentarium of AI a capability to compute and reason with perception-based information. The point of departure in CTP is the assumption that perceptions are described by propositions drawn from a natural language; for example, it is unlikely that there will be a significant increase in the price of oil in the near future. In CTP, a proposition, p, is viewed as an answer to a question, and the meaning of p is represented as a generalized constraint. To compute with perceptions, their descriptors are translated into what is called the generalized constraint language (GCL). Then, goal-directed constraint propagation is utilized to answer a given query. A concept that plays a key role in CTP is that of precisiated natural language (PNL). The computational theory of perceptions suggests a new direction in AI -- a direction that might enhance the ability of AI to deal with realworld problems in which decision-relevant information is a mixture of measurements and perceptions. What is not widely recognized is that many important problems in AI fall into this category.",

They produce significant learning gains beyond classroom environments. They are capable of engaging most students' attention and interest for hours. We have been working on a new generation of intelligent tutoring systems that hold mixed-initiative conversational dialogues with the learner. The tutoring systems present challenging problems and questions to the learner, the learner types in answers in English, and there is a lengthy multiturn dialogue as complete solutions or answers evolve. This article presents the tutoring systems that we have been developing. AutoTutor is a conversational agent, with a talking head, that helps college students learn about computer literacy. andes, atlas, and why2 help adults learn about physics. Instead of being mere information-delivery systems, our systems help students actively construct knowledge through conversations.",

It is consistent with much that psychologists have observed in the natural problem solving people do. Psychologists have also observed, however, that people have several problems in doing analogical or case-based reasoning. Although they are good at using analogs to solve new problems, they are not always good at remembering the right ones. However, computers are good at remembering. I present case-based decision aiding as a methodology for building systems in which people and machines work together to solve problems. The case-based decision-aiding system augments the person's memory by providing cases (analogs) for a person to use in solving a problem. The person does the actual decision making using these cases as guidelines.

    "abstract": "In a large-scale space, structure is at a significantly larger scale than the observations available at an instant. To learn the structure of a large-scale space from observations, the observer must build a cognitive map of the environment by integrating observations over an extended period of time, inferring spatial structure from perceptions and the effects of actions. The cognitive map representation of large-scale space must account for a mapping, or learning structure from observations, and navigation, or creating and executing a plan to travel from one place to another. Approaches to date tend to be fragile either because they don't build maps; or because they assume nonlocal observations, such as those available in preexisting maps or global coordinate systems, including active landmark beacons and geo-locating satellites. We propose that robust navigation and mapping systems for large-scale space can be developed by adhering to a natural, four-level semantic hierarchy of descriptions for representation, planning, and execution of plans in large-scale space. The four levels are sensorimotor interaction, procedural behaviors, topological mapping, and metric mapping. Effective systems represent the environment, relative to sensors, at all four levels and formulate robust system behavior by moving flexibly between representational levels at run time. We demonstrate our claims in three implemented models: Tour, the Qualnav system simulator, and the NX robot.",

Its goal was to create planning domains that a wide variety of planning researchers could agree on to make comparison among planners more meaningful, measure overall progress in the field, and set up a framework for long-term creation of a repository of problems in a standard notation. A rules committee for the competition was created in 1997 and had long discussions on how the contest should go. One result of these discussions was the pddl notation for planning domains. This notation was used to set up a set of planning problems and get a modest problem repository started. As a result, five planning systems were able to compete when the contest took place in June 1998. All these systems solved problems in the strips framework, with some slight extensions. The attempt to find domains for other forms of planning foundered because of technical and organizational problems. In spite of this problem, the competition achieved its goals partially in that it con-firmed that substantial progress had occurred in some subfields of planning, and it allowed qualitative comparison among different planning algorithms. It is urged that the competition continue to take place and to evolve.",

The testbed is capable of simulating different degrees of sophistication in problem solving knowledge and focus-of attention mechanisms, for varying the distribution and characteristics of error in its (simulated) input data, and for measuring the progress of problem solving. Node configuration and communication channel characteristics can also be independently varied in the simulated network.",

    "abstract": "How do we decide how to represent an intelligent system in its interface, and how do we decide how the interface represents information about the world and about its own workings to a user? This article addresses these questions by examining the interaction between representation and intelligence in user interfaces. The rubric representation covers at least three topics in this context: (1) how a computational system is represented in its user interface, (2) how the interface conveys its representations of information and the world to human users, and (3) how the system's internal representation affects the human user's interaction with the system. I argue that each of these kinds of representation (of the system, information and the world, the interaction) is key to how users make the kind of attributions of intelligence that facilitate their interactions with intelligent systems. In this vein, it makes sense to represent a systmem as a human in those cases where social collaborative behavior is key and for the system to represent its knowledge to humans in multiple ways on multiple modalities. I demonstrate these claims by discussing issues of representation and intelligence in an embodied conversational agent -- an interface in which the system is represented as a person, information is conveyed to human users by multiple modalities such as voice and hand gestures, and the internal representation is modality independent and both propositional and nonpropositional.",

However, many information-gathering tasks are better handled by finding a referral to a human expert rather than by simply interacting with online information sources. A personal referral allows a user to judge the quality of the information he or she is receiving as well as to potentially obtain information that is deliberately not made public. The process of finding an expert who is both reliable and likely to respond to the user can be viewed as a search through the net-work of social relationships between individuals as opposed to a search through the network of hypertext documents. The goal of the REFERRAL WEB Project is to create models of social networks by data mining the web and develop tools that use the models to assist in locating experts and related information search and evaluation tasks.",

These algorithms are different from earlier techniques used in machine learning in many respects: For example, they are explicitly based on a theoretical model of learning rather than on loose analogies with natural learning systems or other heuristics. They come with theoretical guarantees about their performance and have a modular design that makes it possible to separately implement and analyze their components. They are not affected by the problem of local minima because their training amounts to convex optimization. In the last decade, a sizable community of theoreticians and practitioners has formed around these methods, and a number of practical applications have been realized. Although the research is not concluded, already now kernel methods are considered the state of the art in several machine learning tasks. Their ease of use, theoretical appeal, and remarkable performance have made them the system of choice for many learning problems. Successful applications range from text categorization to handwriting recognition to classification of gene-expression data.",

    "abstract": "Our group's work in medical decision making has led us to formulate a framework for expert system design, in particular about how the domain knowledge may be decomposed into substructures. We propose that there exist different problem-solving types, i.e., uses of knowledge, and corresponding to each is a separate substructure specializing in that type of problem-solving. Each substructure is in turn further decomposed into a hierarchy of specialist which differ from each other not in the type of problem-solving, but in the conceptual content of their knowledge; e.g.; one of them may specialize in heart disease, while another may do so in liver, though both of them are doing the same type of problem solving. Thus ultimately all the knowledge in the system is distributed among problem-solvers which know how to use that knowledge. This is in contrast to the currently dominant expert system paradigm which proposes a common knowledge base accessed by knowledge-free problem-solvers of various kinds. In our framework there is no distinction between knowledge bases and problem-solvers: each knowledge source is a problem-solver. We have so far had occasion to deal with three generic problem-solving types in expert clinical reasoning: diagnosis (classification), data retrieval and organization, and reasoning about consequences of actions. In novice, these expert structures are often incomplete, and other knowledge structures and learning processes are needed to construct and complete them.",

Newer research is beginning to explore issues such as long-term learning of new representations, the integration of Bayesian inference and induction, and life-long cumulative learning.

Instead, he argues that AI must use many approaches. AI is not like circuit theory and electromagnetism. There is nothing wonderfully unifying like Kirchhoff's laws are to circuit theory or Maxwell's equations are to electromagnetism.

Furthermore, complex planning and execution problems may require multiple computational agents and human planners to collaborate on a solution. In this article, we describe a new paradigm for planning in complex, dynamic environments, which we term distributed, continual planning (DCP). We argue that developing DCP systems will be necessary for planning applications to be successful in these environments.

Along with a way to specify default properties for instances of a description, proto-representations allow the overriding, or “cancelling” of properties that don’t apply in particular cases. This supposedly makes representing exceptions (three-legged elephants and the like) easy; but, alas, it makes one crucial type of representation impossiblethat of composite descriptions whose meanings are functions of the structure and interrelation of their parts. This article explores this and other ramifications of the emphasis on default properties and “typical” objects.",

They provide a personalized view of such spaces, prioritizing items likely to be of interest to the user. The field, christened in 1995, has grown enormously in the variety of problems addressed and techniques employed, as well as in its practical applications. Recommender systems research has incorporated a wide variety of artificial intelligence techniques including machine learning, data mining, user modeling, case‐based reasoning, and constraint satisfaction, among others. Personalized recommendations are an important part of many online e‐commerce applications such as Amazon.com, Netflix, and Pandora. This wealth of practical application experience has provided inspiration to researchers to extend the reach of recommender systems into new and challenging areas. The purpose of the articles in this special issue is to take stock of the current landscape of recommender systems research and identify directions the field is now taking. This article provides an overview of the current state of the field and introduces the various articles in the special issue.",

    "abstract": "An important and largely ignored aspect of real-time decision making is the capability of agents to factor the cost of deliberation into the decision making process. I have developed an efficient model that creates this capability. The model uses as basic components {\\em anytime algorithms} whose quality of results improves gradually as computation time increases. The main contribution of this work is a {\\em compilation} process that extends the property of gradual improvement from the level of single algorithms to the level of complex systems. In standard algorithms, the fixed quality of the output allows for composition to be implemented by a simple call-return mechanism. However, when algorithms have resource allocation as a degree of freedom, there arises the question of how to construct, for example, the optimal composition of two anytime algorithms, one of which feeds its output to the other. This scheduling problem is solved by an off-line compilation process and a run-time monitoring component that together generate a utility maximizing behavior. The crucial meta-level knowledge is kept in the {\\em anytime library} in the form of {\\em conditional performance profiles}. These profiles characterize the performance of each elementary anytime algorithm as a function of run-time and input quality. The compilation process therefore extends the principles of procedural abstraction and modularity to anytime computation. Its efficiency is significantly improved by using {\\em local compilation} that works on a single program structure at a time. Local compilation is proved to yield global optimality for a large set of program structures. Compilation produces {\\em contract} algorithms which require the determination of the total run-time when activated. Some real-time domains require {\\em interruptible} algorithms whose total run-time is unknown in advance. An important result of this work is a general method by which an interruptible algorithm can be constructed once a contract algorithm is compiled. Finally, the notion of gradual improvement of quality is extended to sensing and plan execution and the application of the model is demonstrated through a simulated robot navigation system. The result is a modular approach for developing real-time agents that act by performing anytime actions and make decisions using anytime computation.",

This article describes research aimed at providing a framework in which all relevant scheduling knowledge can be given consideration during schedule generation and revision. Factory scheduling is cast as a complex constraint-directed activity, driven by a rich symbolic model of the factory environment in which various influencing factors are formalized as constraints. A variety of constraint-directed inference techniques are defined with respect to this model to provide a basis for intelligently compromising among conflicting concerns.

In order to bridge the gap between the model and working systems, we introduced and discussed the blackboard framework. We also traced the history of ideas and designs of some application systems that helped shape the blackboard model. In Part 2, we describe and contrast existing blackboard systems.

Our approach is to develop models that factor according to the linguistic structure of a command. We first describe an early result, a generative model that factors according to the sequential structure of language, and then discuss our new framework, generalized grounding graphs (G 3 ). The G 3 framework dynamically instantiates a probabilistic graphical model for a natural language input, enabling a mapping between words in language and concrete objects, places, paths, and events in the external world. We report on corpus‐based experiments in which the robot is able to learn and use word meanings in three real‐world tasks: indoor navigation, spatial language video retrieval, and mobile manipulation.",

As a result, scientific discoveries are left at the level of a cottage industry. AI systems can transform scientific discoveries into highly efficient practices, thereby enabling us to expand our knowledge in unprecedented ways. Such systems may out‐compute all possible hypotheses and may redefine the nature of scientific intuition, hence the scientific discovery process.",

In addition, standardized tests have all the basic requirements of a practical test: they are accessible, easily comprehensible, clearly measurable, and offer a graduated progression from simple tasks to those requiring deep understanding of the world. Here we propose this task as a challenge problem for the community, summarize our state‐of‐the‐art results on math and science tests, and provide supporting data sets ( www.allenai.org ).",

This article discusses recent progress in AI and then describes eight ideas related to robustness that are being pursued within the AI research community.

And one of the key ways that humans do this is to use argumentation either internally, by evaluating arguments and counterarguments, or externally, by for instance entering into a discussion or debate where arguments are exchanged. As we report in this review, recent developments in the field are leading to technology for artificial argumentation, in the legal, medical, and e‐government domains, and interesting tools for argument mining, for debating technologies, and for argumentation solvers are emerging.",

Instead, patrol units move about the transit system, inspecting the tickets of passengers, who face fines if caught fare evading. The deterrence of fare evasion depends on the unpredictability and effectiveness of the patrols. In this article, we present TRUSTS, an application for scheduling randomized patrols for fare inspection in transit systems. TRUSTS models the problem of computing patrol strategies as a leader‐follower Stackelberg game where the objective is to deter fare evasion and hence maximize revenue. This problem differs from previously studied Stackelberg settings in that the leader strategies must satisfy massive temporal and spatial constraints; moreover, unlike in these counterterrorism‐motivated Stackelberg applications, a large fraction of the ridership might realistically consider fare evasion, and so the number of followers is potentially huge. A third key novelty in our work is deliberate simplification of leader strategies to make patrols easier to execute. We present an efficient algorithm for computing such patrol strategies and present experimental results using real‐world ridership data from the Los Angeles Metro Rail system.

    "abstract": "This article summarizes the author's Robert S. Englemore Memorial Lecture presented at the Thirty-Fourth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence on February 10, 2020. It explores recurring themes in the history of AI, real and imagined dangers from AI, and the future of the field. We are now in AI's third summer, a period of rapid scientific advances, broad commercialization, and exuberance—perhaps irrational exuberance—about our potential to unlock the secrets of general intelligence. Twice before the field of AI has experienced such a period, and each was followed by a winter of collapse of commercialization and drastic cuts in government investments in research. In this essay, I will argue that despite this cyclical history, enduring insights have blossomed each summer. The winters can be viewed as times of contemplation and integration that advance through the synthesis of new and old ideas. I will also argue that we may be at the end of the cyclical pattern; although progress and exuberance will likely slow, there are both scientific and practical reasons to think a third winter is unlikely to occur. In every summer, articles and books about AI written for nonexperts have found wide audiences. I read four recent books shortly before writing this essay: The Master Algorithm, by Domingos (2015); AI Superpowers, by Lee (2018); Human Compatible, by Russell (2019); and Rebooting AI, by Marcus and Davis (2019). This first is an objective history of machine learning, and like this essay, emphasizes the continuous evolution of the field. The second charts the dramatic rise in AI R&D in China and points the way to a utopian future. The third argues that superhuman artificial intelligence will be an existential risk if the values of such AIs are not aligned by design with those of humans. The fourth contends that deep learning, the most powerful approach to machine learning devised to date, will soon reach inherent limits, and that a different approach that synthesizes recent and older approaches to AI will be necessary in the future. This essay will touch on many of the same elements as these three books. I will first provide a history of AI; next, discuss near-term dangers of AI; and finally, describe a number of different technical approaches for future AI. If one was to create a cartoon history of AI, the first panel would show the symbolic approach to AI—pictured, say, as a cat, beating up on the artificial neural network approach—let us picture it as Jerry the Mouse. The second panel shows both Tom and Jerry shivering in a wintery scene; and the third shows Jerry, now grown huge and powerful through deep learning, easily dispatching Tom (Figure 1). There is more than a grain of truth in this cartoonish view of the history of AI from the 1980s through the present day. The story it presents is incomplete, however, both in chronology and in failing to illustrate the rich set of ideas and approaches that developed and entwined through the history of the field. William Grey Walter was a polymath in neuroscience and electronics. As a young man in the 1930s, he built the first electroencephalography (EEG) in the United Kingdom and discovered that the measurement of brain waves could be used to locate brain tumors responsible for epilepsy (Walter 1953). Thirty years later, a groundbreaking paper he coauthored in Nature showed that spikes in neural activity could be used to predictive motor events a full half-second before the subject was consciously aware of having made the decision to move—in other words, that the conscious mind only thought it was making decisions (Walter et al. 1964). Walter was as much an engineer and tinkerer as a scientist. During WW II, he designed radar systems. The mechanistic view he took of the brain led him to experiment with artificial neural networks—not just as a mathematical abstraction, as in the work of McCulloch and Pitts (1943), but as the decision-making engine for an embodied artificial animal (Figure 2). Beginning in 1948, he built and demonstrated a series of increasingly sophisticated autonomous tortoise-shaped three-wheeled robots (Hoggett 2011). Their analog electronic brains employed up to seven vacuum tubes, which interpreted signals from touch, light, and sound sensors and controlled propulsion and steering motors. Although their behavior was hard-wired, the later versions supported a form of conditioned-reflex learning. A capacitor-based memory could learn to associate the simultaneous activation of two sensors—for example, the sound of a whistle and the obstacle detecting bump sensor. The reflex triggered by the bump sensor—backing up and turning—could then be triggered by the sound sensor. The tortoises' legacy includes the field of artificial neural networks, which today dominates research and development in artificial intelligence. A few of the well-known major steps in the development of artificial neural networks were the error-based perceptron learning rule of Rosenblatt (1958), the development of backpropagation for training multilayer networks (Werbos and Werbos 1974; Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams 1986), and parameter sharing in structured networks, and in particular, convolutional networks (Fukushima 1980; LeCun et al. 1989). It is easy to see the aspects of artificial neural networks that Walter got wrong: most obviously, the use of analog electronics and the focus on stimulus—response learning rather than error-minimization learning. It is just possible, however, that Walter was simply wildly premature. Artificial neural networks are now being compiled into edge-computing hardware for applications such as video surveillance; while such hardware is now digital, there is research on creating analog artificial neural networks that could operate with a fraction of the energy needed by digital circuits. Furthermore, one could argue that the tortoises' implementation of stimulus–response learning was an early attempt at unsupervised learning—which is today the most important and challenging problem in research on machine learning. Artificial neural networks were not the only legacy of the tortoises. They demonstrated that complex purposeful behavior arises in the interaction between an agent and an environment, an idea that stands in sharp contrast to the more cerebral symbolic approaches to AI that we will describe shortly. Walter was part of a larger movement that aimed to understand animal and machine intelligence using feedback loops and other tools of control theory. The field was given the name \"cybernetics\" with the publication of Norbert Weiner's book of that name (Weiner 1948). The tortoises were a perfect example of a mechanism regulated by feedback from their environment. Cybernetics flourished in the former Soviet Union, but never gained a foothold in the US AI research community until a synthesis of control theory and dynamic programming (Bellman 1957) emerged under the banner of reinforcement learning (Witten 1977; Sutton and Barto 1981). Even then, researchers in reinforcement learning were a small minority in the general AI community for decades. Researchers made steady progress in developing mathematical frameworks for training control systems when the feedback signal was distant in the future. The fact that rewards can be temporally distant from the agent's actions distinguishes reinforcement learning from stimulus–response learning; indeed, the ability to act for delayed gratification is a key aspect of intelligence. Temporal-difference learning (Sutton 1988) provided a general approach for implementing gratification, and proved to be particularly effective when the agent's internal state was represented by a neural network. We shall see the potent combination of artificial neural networks and reinforcement learning reemerge in the third AI summer. The first AI summer also saw the birth of a very different approach to building intelligent machines, an approach whose heritage stretched back thousands of years. This is the logic-based approach to AI, or more generally and accurately, the approach based on declarative knowledge representation. Symbolic logic grew out of the art of rhetoric in ancient Greece. Around 350 BC, Aristotle formalized certain kinds of deductive arguments symbolically in his Prior Analytics. His key insight—indeed, the insight that is the basis for not only logic but for the theory of computing—is that reasoning could be performed by considering only the syntactic form of statements without considering the meaning of those statements. After this prescient beginning, however, over 2000 years passed before significant advances were made in formal logic. George Boole created a complete characterization of proposition logic in 1845 (Boole 1854), as Gottlob Frege, Charles Sanders Peirce, David Hilbert, and others did for quantified logics in the following decades. This generation of philosophers, however, had a primary motivation for their work that differed from that of Aristotle and his medieval followers: their ultimate goal was to provide a complete and rigorous basis for mathematics rather than to understand everyday reasoning and argumentation. They, therefore, poured enormous energy into trying to overcome the paradoxes of naive set theory (Russell 1903) and were devastated by the discovery that no logic could capture all mathematical truths (Gödel 1931). The concerns of the researchers who pioneered the logical approach to AI stood in sharp contrast to those of the philosophers of mathematics. First, the AI researchers were encouraged by the creation of programs that could automatically find proofs of some—not necessarily all—mathematical theorems, and were untroubled by logic's inherent incompleteness. The celebrated Logic Theorist program (Newell and Simon 1956) was able to prove 38 elementary theorems from Principia Mathematica (Whitehead and Russell 1910–1913). Second, most AI researchers had little interest in mathematics as a subject matter of logic. Instead of trying to axiomatize abstruse mathematics, John McCarthy argued, researchers should strive to develop logical representations of commonsense knowledge (McCarthy 1958). McCarthy's original paper described knowledge about locations (e.g., one can be at a desk, in a car, etc.) and physical movement (e.g., one might walk from one location to another nearby location), and his former student Patrick Hayes called for axiomatization of commonsense physics (Hayes 1978). Others attempted to represent the logical rules of human discourse (Allen et al. 1977), thus closing the loop with the ancient Greeks' view of logic as a tool for analyzing rhetoric. Researchers in the first AI summer also began work on systems that employed graphs rather than the strings or trees of classical logic to represent knowledge. These new kinds of representations were called \"semantic networks\" and used vertices to represent concepts and edges to represent relationships. The word \"semantic\" came from their initial use as an intralingua for translating between different natural languages (Richens 1956); they were intended to capture the meaning, or semantics, of sentences. Although they were presumably unaware of it at the time, one researcher has argued that semantic networks were a rediscovery of the diagrams that ancient Sanskrit scholars used to analyze texts (Brigs 1985). Researchers increasingly converged on the view that semantic networks were simply an alternative notation for classical logic, as exemplified by Ronald Brachman's work on KL-ONE (Brachman and Schmolze 1985). Just as all practical programming languages were Turing-complete and thus theoretically equivalent but differed in ease or naturalness of use, these researchers argued that semantic networks were simply a more natural form of first-order logic where syntax explicitly described concepts in terms of their attributes and how they generalized or specialized other concepts. This version of semantic networks became known as \"description logic.\" Pure description logic, however, proved inadequate for representing large real-world domains because it could only capture the absolutely necessary properties of concepts, not those that were prototypical or that held by default. In recent years, companies including Google, Facebook, Microsoft Bing, eBay, and IBM have developed enormous networks called \"knowledge graphs\" which they use to drive many applications, such as web search and product recommendation (Singhal 2012). Despite their scale and ubiquity of use, many aspects of knowledge graphs remain informal; for example, in addition to the issue of whether links represent absolute or prototypical relations, the distance between concepts in a knowledge graph is often used as a heuristic measure of concept similarity. Later in this essay, we will describe a different family of graph-based knowledge representation formalisms called \"graphical models\" that combine logic, graph theory, and probability theory. The first AI summer's third research campaign was the quest for efficient algorithms for combinatorial search. We now understand that in terms of formal computational complexity theory, the quest is an impossible dream: the general task of reasoning in any suitably expressive formal system is NP-complete or harder (Cook 1971), and thus, it is believed, requires worst-case exponential time. Even the problem of STRIPS-style planning—that is, finding sequences of actions that are defined in terms of preconditions and effects—for the simple \"blocks world\" domain is NP-complete (Gupta and Nau 1991). However, the fact that such complexity results had not yet been discovered may have helped lead the early AI researchers to an important insight: an enormous space of possibilities could be searched in ways that were more efficient than simple enumeration. This insight differentiated AI researchers from philosophers and mathematicians, for whom the existence or nonexistence of an algorithm that would terminate after an exhaustive enumeration of possibilities was the end of the discussion: this problem was decidable, or that problem was undecidable. It was obvious to AI researchers that human reasoning was not a simple enumeration, but involved shortcuts that made the task feasible given the time and computational resource limitations of the brain. Herbert Simon, J. C. Shaw, and Alan Newell discovered and implemented one such search algorithm, means-ends analysis, in their General Problem Solver (1959), and later Newell and Simon argued that humans employed it as well as a variety of other reasoning strategies in their monumental treatise Human Problem Solving (1972). How can non-enumerative search be practical when the underlying problem is exponentially hard? The approach advocated by Simon and Newell is to employ heuristics: fast algorithms that may fail on some inputs or output suboptimal solutions. For example, the means-end planning heuristic chooses an action, which will reduce the difference between the initial and goal state; applies the action initial state; and recursively applied the process to the new state and the goal state (Figure 3). Although intuitively appealing, it is not difficult to find problems where the heuristic fails, stuck in a cycle where it reduces one difference but introduces another. The A* algorithm (Hart, Nilsson, and Raphael 1968) provided a general frame for complete and optimal heuristically guided search. A* is used as a subroutine within practically every AI algorithm today but is still no magic bullet; its guarantee of completeness is bought at the cost of worst-case exponential time. An interesting class of incomplete heuristic search algorithms is those based on a \"noisy\" version of iterative repair, a heuristic similar to means-end analysis. Iterative repair begins by guessing a solution to the problem. It then iteratively identifies a flaw in the solution and patches it, yielding a new proposed solution. As with means-end analysis, simple iterative repair can easily become stuck in a cycle. A noisy version of iterative repair reduces the likelihood of becoming stuck by periodically making random changes in the solution; even if most of the random changes are bad, eventually a change is likely to be introduced that lets the search break out of the cycle. A version of noisy iterative repair named \"simulated annealing\" was invented by physicists and has proven widely applicable for optimization problems (Kirkpatrick, Gelatt, and Vecchi 1983). Bart Selman and I showed that a simple version of iterative repair called \"local search with noise\" was even more effective for finding satisfying assignments to logical formulas; the reason for the improvement was that the random steps were restricted to ones that made the proposed solution satisfy at least one previously unsatisfied problem constraint, even if did the reverse for some of the other constraints (Selman, Levesque, and Mitchell 1992; Selman, Kautz, and Cohen 19961). Another way to solve in practice an NP-hard problem is to employ an algorithm whose empirical complexity on a problem distribution of interest grows subexponentially or exponentially with a very small exponent. For example, the best complete algorithm for satisfiability testing is backtracking search over the space of partial variable assignments, the Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland algorithm (DPLL) (Davis et al. 1961), augmented by a technique called \"clause learning\" (Marques-Silva and Sakallah 1996; Bayardo and Schrag 1997). When the backtracking algorithm reaches a dead end—that is, when it determine that the current partial assignment is inconsistent - the clause learning module computes a minimal subset of previous assignment choices that led to the inconsistency and adds the negation of that combination to the problem as a new clausal constraint. The new clause prevents those choices from being made in a different branch of the search tree, thus pruning the search. Although still an exponential algorithm, my colleague Paul Beame, student Ashish Sabharwal, and I showed that DPLL with clause learning is probably more powerful than DPLL (Beam, Kautz, and Sabharwal 2004). The algorithm demonstrates remarkably restrained growth in many real-world problem domains. For example, Pushak and Hoos (2020) argued that the algorithm on bounded model-checking problems shows subexponential empirical scaling. During the first AI summer, many people thought that machine intelligence could be achieved in just a few years. The Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (DARPA) launched programs to support AI research with the goal of using AI to solve problems of national security; in particular, to automate the translation of Russian to English for intelligence operations and to create autonomous tanks for the battlefield. Researchers had begun to realize that achieving AI was going to be much harder than was supposed a decade earlier, but a combination of hubris and disingenuousness led many university and think-tank researchers to accept funding with promises of deliverables that they should have known they could not fulfill. By the mid-1960s neither useful natural language translation systems nor autonomous tanks had been created, and a dramatic backlash set in. New DARPA leadership canceled existing AI funding programs. In 1969, the powerful Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield hobbled AI research funding by all military agencies for decades by pushing through a law that prohibited military funding of fundamental research beyond specific military functions. Outside of the United States, the most fertile ground for AI research was the United Kingdom. The AI winter in the United Kingdom was spurred on not so much by disappointed military leaders as by rival academics who viewed AI researchers as charlatans and a drain on research funding. A professor of applied mathematics, Sir James Lighthill, was commissioned by Parliament to evaluate the state of AI research in the nation. The report stated that all of the problems being worked on in AI would be better handled by researchers from other disciplines—such as applied mathematics (Lighthill 1973). The report also claimed that AI successes on toy problems could never scale to real-world applications due to combinatorial explosion. This claim, of course, ignored the quest in AI for methods to tame combinatorial search as described above. In response to the report, all public funding of AI research in the United Kingdom was terminated. The second AI summer was marked by the field's change in focus from commonsense knowledge to expert knowledge. Expert systems, it was believed, would be able to substitute for trained professionals in medicine, finance, engineering, and many other fields. An expert—say, a doctor—would be debriefed by a knowledge engineer, who would encode the expert's vast experience into a large set of rules and facts. A general symbolic reasoning system could then apply these rules to solve particular problems—for example, to create a diagnosis on the basis of a patient's symptoms. The rules could also drive the system to gather further information—for example, to order certain blood tests for the patient in order to refine the diagnosis. The date for the beginning of the second summer is written in the section heading using regular-expression notation to mean that it could be said to have started in 1968 or to have started in 1978. In 1968, Feigenbaum, Lederber, and Buchanan (1968) created the first expert system, Dendral. It was intended to help organic chemists in identifying unknown organic molecules by analyzing their mass spectra and using knowledge of chemistry. Dendral gained much academic interest and led to the development of expert systems in other domains, notably MYCIN (Shortliffe and Buchanan 1975) for bacterial infection diagnosis and INTERNIST-I, which aimed to capture the internal medicine expertise of the chair of the department of internal medicine at the University of Pittsburgh (Pople 1976). It was not until 1978, however, that expert systems became a hot area of R&D with the creation and commercial deployment of XCON (McDermott 1980). In the 1970s, buying a computer system was a slow and error-prone process. Computers were much less standardized than they are today, and a buyer needed to choose among hundreds of options when placing an order for one. Options could interact in complex ways: some combinations of options could not be physically built or if built would lead to poor performance; some options required choices from other options; and so on. The process to order a VAX computer from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) could require as long as 90 days of back-and-forth between a customer, sales representatives, and DEC engineers to create a correct system configuration. XCON reduced the time to generate a satisfactory system configuration for a customer to about 90 minutes. The enormous advantage this gave DEC in the marketplace did not go unnoticed. Soon, companies of all sorts began developing and deploying expert systems for a variety of tasks in engineering and sales. Feigenbaum's phrase \"knowledge is power\" became the slogan of the era. The second AI summer differed from the first in that it was driven as much by commercial money as by government support. In addition to investments by companies using expert systems, venture capital flowed into companies creating a software and hardware ecosystem to support expert systems. Software startups sold expert system \"shells,\" that is, reasoning engines with user interfaces intended to make it possible for nonprogrammers to enter rules. The fact that expert system development was incremental meant that dynamically linked programming languages were preferred—which in the 1970s and 1980s meant varieties of LISP or Prolog. The relatively slow performance of these languages with the implementations and hardware of the era motivated building computer hardware to directly interpret LISP (by the startup companies Symbolics and LMI) or Prolog (by various Japanese companies under the auspices of Japan's Fifth Generation project). Many reasons can be offered for the arrival of the second AI winter. The hardware companies failed when much more cost-effective general Unix workstations from Sun together with good compilers for LISP and Prolog came onto the market. Many commercial deployments of expert systems were discontinued when they proved too costly to maintain. Medical expert systems never caught on for several reasons: the difficulty in keeping them up to date; the challenge for medical professionals to learn how to use a bewildering variety of different expert systems for different medical conditions; and perhaps most crucially, the reluctance of doctors to trust a computer-made diagnosis over their gut instinct, even for specific domains where the expert systems could outperform an average doctor. Venture capital money deserted AI practically overnight. The world AI conference IJCAI hosted an enormous and lavish trade show and thousands of nonacademic attendees in 1987 in Vancouver; the main AI conference the following year, AAAI 1988 in St. Paul, was a small and strictly academic affair. Commercial factors aside, enthusiasm for expert systems cooled because of two central technical challenges; indeed, overcoming these challenges set the workplan for the next two decades of research in AI. The first challenge was the need for principled and practical methods for probabilistic reasoning. The logical rule-based approach excelled at capturing knowledge about relationships among concepts and entities (such as class/subclass/instance or object/part/attribute hierarchies) but was poorly suited for problems where one needed to assign probabilities to conclusions. Although the need to handle uncertainty was recognized by early expert system researchers, they did not yet know of probabilistically sound methods of reasoning that were computationally practical; systems such as MYCIN and its descendents instead attached \"certainty factor\" numbers to rules and facts and combined them in an ad hoc manner. The second unsolved challenge for the expert system approach was named the \"knowledge acquisition bottleneck.\" Capturing all but the narrowest domains required a huge number of rules. Not only was it difficult or impossible to recruit and train enough experts to write enough rules, but once the knowledge bases became large they inevitably became full of inconsistencies and errors. The field of AI did not disappear during the slightly more than two decades of the second AI winter. It continued steadily as a relatively small but intellectually vigorous research field, freed of the hype and demands for commercial profit. The challenge of sound but efficient probabilistic reasoning was first met by what were called graphical probabilistic models. Bayesian Networks (Pearl 1988) provided a solution to the problem of compactly representing multivariable probability distributions without requiring exponentially large probability tables. Each conditional probability statement was represented by a set of directed edges that ended at a node together with a conditional probability table for the variable associated with the node. The graph has a much stronger meaning, however, than the conditional probability statements alone: it represents a single probability distribution—the so-called maximum-entropy distribution—rather than all distributions that are consistent with the original conditional probability statements. In many problems, one does indeed want to reason with a maximum-entropy distribution because it is the one under which our given knowledge captures all interesting relationships between the variables. The introduction of Bayesian networks led to fruitful decades of research on extensions to Bayesian networks, alternative graphical models, and a variety of new algorithms for probabilistic reasoning. Heckerman and Shortliffe (1992) discovered the conditions under which MYCIN's certainty factors could be given a probabilistic interpretation, thus explaining why expert systems sometimes gave sensible answers but at other times did not. Around the turn of the century, the field of statistical–relational reasoning arose, which sought to develop representations and algorithms that combined the semantics of graphical models with the expressive ability of the finite fragment of first-order logic (Friedman et al. 1999; Richardson and Domingos 2006). Overcoming the knowledge acquisition bottleneck led the field of AI to a renewed focus on machine learning. For most of the second winter, however, few researchers returned to the roots of machine learning in artificial neural networks. Methods were developed for learning decision trees (Quinlan 1986) and logical rules (Muggleton and Feng 1990). The parameters (conditional probability tables) for graphical models could be directly estimated from complete data or estimated by the expectation–maximization algorithm for incomplete data (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977). Valiant's (1984) work on probably approximately correct (PAC) learning showed the limits of learnability for any method relative to the amount of data that were available. Until the revival of artificial neural networks in the third summer, the most powerful approach to \"black box\" machine learning, that is, that did not rely upon or attempt to create an interpretable domain model, was the support vector machine (SVM) pioneered by Cortes and Vapnik (2004). An unintuitive feature of SVMs is that they often worked well when highly over-parameterized—a situation that had been thought to be necessarily associated with overfitting. Deep learning with artificial neural networks turned out to share this surprising feature. Even as AI research methodology became steadily more rigorou",

    "abstract": "The most common way to listen to recorded music nowadays is via streaming platforms which provide access to tens of millions of tracks. To assist users in effectively browsing these large catalogs, the integration of Music Recommender Systems (MRSs) has become essential. Current real-world MRSs are often quite complex and optimized for recommendation accuracy. They combine several building blocks based on collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation. This complexity can hinder the ability to explain recommendations to end users, which is particularly important for recommendations perceived as unexpected or inappropriate. While pure recommendation performance often correlates with user satisfaction, explainability has a positive impact on other factors such as trust and forgiveness, which are ultimately essential to maintain user loyalty. In this article, we discuss how explainability can be addressed in the context of MRSs. We provide perspectives on how explainability could improve music recommendation algorithms and enhance user experience. First, we review common dimensions and goals of recommenders' explainability and in general of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), and elaborate on the extent to which these apply -- or need to be adapted -- to the specific characteristics of music consumption and recommendation. Then, we show how explainability components can be integrated within a MRS and in what form explanations can be provided. Since the evaluation of explanation quality is decoupled from pure accuracy-based evaluation criteria, we also discuss requirements and strategies for evaluating explanations of music recommendations. Finally, we describe the current challenges for introducing explainability within a large-scale industrial music recommender system and provide research perspectives.",

We show that an additional crucial factor is the development of a new type of computation. Neurocompositional computing adopts two principles that must be simultaneously respected to enable human‐level cognition: the principles of Compositionality and Continuity. These have seemed irreconcilable until the recent mathematical discovery that compositionality can be realized not only through discrete methods of symbolic computing, but also through novel forms of continuous neural computing. The revolutionary recent progress in AI has resulted from the use of limited forms of neurocompositional computing. New, deeper forms of neurocompositional computing create AI systems that are more robust, accurate, and comprehensible.",

In contrast to other common desiderata, for example, interpretability or spelling out the AI's reasoning process, we argue that explanations are only useful to the extent that they allow a human decision maker to verify the correctness of the AI's prediction . Prior studies find in many decision making contexts that AI explanations do not facilitate such verification. Moreover, most tasks fundamentally do not allow easy verification, regardless of explanation method, limiting the potential benefit of any type of explanation.

The concept of precisiated natural language (PNL) was briefly introduced in that article, and PNL was employed as a basis for computation with perceptions. In what follows, the conceptual structure of PNL is described in greater detail, and PNL's role in knowledge representation, deduction, and concept definition is outlined and illustrated by examples. What should be understood is that PNL is in its initial stages of development and that the exposition that follows is an outline of the basic ideas that underlie PNL rather than a definitive theory.",

    "abstract": "The most widely accepted defining feature of the semantic web is machine-usable content. By this definition, the semantic web is already manifest in shopping agents that automatically access and use web content to find the lowest air fares or book prices. However, where are the semantics? Most people regard the semantic web as a vision, not a reality--so shopping agents should not count. To use web content, machines need to know what to do when they encounter it, which, in turn, requires the machine to know what the content means (that is, its semantics). The challenge of developing the semantic web is how to put this knowledge into the machine. The manner in which it is done is at the heart of the confusion about the semantic web. The goal of this article is to clear up some of this confusion.I explain that shopping agents work in the complete absence of any explicit account of the semantics of web content because the meaning of the web content that the agents are expected to encounter can be determined by the human programmers who hardwire it into the web application software. I therefore regard shopping agents as a degenerate case of the semantic web. I note various shortcomings of this approach. I conclude by presenting some ideas about how the semantic web will likely evolve.",

In these cases, VT uses the strategy of constructing a plausible approximation and successively refining it. VT uses domain-specific knowledge to guide its backtracking search for successful refinements. The VT architecture provides the basis for a knowledge representation that is used by SALT, an automated knowledge-acquisition tool.

The result is that a system can simply use its sensors to examine its domain and then decide what to do by finding its current situation in some sort of a table. The purpose of this article is to argue that even if the compile-time costs of the analysis are ignored, the size of the table must, in general, grow exponentially with the complexity of the domain. This growth makes it unlikely that this approach to planning will be able to deal with problems of an interesting size; one really needs the ability to do some amount of inference at run time. In other words, an effective approach to acting in uncertain domains cannot be to look and then leap; it must always be to look, to think, and only then to leap.",

Some projects, such as Cyc, have begun to amass large collections of such knowledge. However, it is widely assumed that the use of common sense in interactive applications will remain impractical for years, until these collections can be considered sufficiently complete and commonsense reasoning sufficiently robust. Recently, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Laboratory, we have had some success in applying commonsense knowledge in a number of intelligent interface agents, despite the admittedly spotty coverage and unreliable inference of today's commonsense knowledge systems. This article surveys several of these applications and reflects on interface design principles that enable successful use of commonsense knowledge.",

Representative examples of each type are briefly described. Then, we look in more detail at the problem of endowing the resulting performances with the expressiveness that characterizes human-generated music. This is one of the most challenging aspects of computer music that has been addressed just recently. The main problem in modeling expressiveness is to grasp the performer's touch, that is, the knowledge applied when performing a score. Humans acquire it through a long process of observation and imitation. For this reason, previous approaches, based on following musical rules trying to capture interpretation knowledge, had serious limitations. An alternative approach, much closer to the observation-imitation process observed in humans, is that of directly using the interpretation knowledge implicit in examples extracted from recordings of human performers instead of trying to make explicit such knowledge. In the last part of the article, we report on a performance system, SAXEX, based on this alternative approach, that is capable of generating high-quality expressive solo performances of jazz ballads based on examples of human performers within a case-based reasoning (CBR) system.",

We are concerned with heterogeneous, distributed systems made up of machines that have been programmed by different entities to pursue different goals. Adjusting the rules of public behavior (the rules of the game) by which the programs must interact can influence the private strategies that designers set up in their machines. These rules can shape the design choices of the machines' programmers and, thus, the run-time behavior of their creations. Certain kinds of desirable social behavior can thus be caused to emerge through the careful design of interaction rules. Formal tools and analysis can help in the appropriate design of these rules. We consider how concepts from fields such as decision theory and game theory can provide standards to be used in the design of appropriate negotiation and interaction environments. This design is highly sensitive to the domain in which the interaction is taking place.

They must decide whether the selected application(s) are best suited to solution by present expert system technology, or if there might be a better way (or, possibly, no way) to attack the problems. If there are several possibilities, the team must also rank the potential applications and select the best available. To evaluate the potential of possible application domains, it has proved very useful to have a set of desired attributes for good expert domain. This article presents such a set of attributes. The attribute set was developed as part of a major expert system development project at GTE Laboratories. It was used recurrently (and modified and expanded continually) throughout an extensive application domain evaluation and selection process.",

    "abstract": "Security at major locations of economic or political importance is a key concern around the world, particularly given the threat of terrorism. Limited security resources prevent full security coverage at all times, which allows adversaries to observe and exploit patterns in selective patrolling or monitoring; for example, they can plan an attack avoiding existing patrols. Hence, randomized patrolling or monitoring is important, but randomization must provide distinct weights to different actions based on their complex costs and benefits. To this end, this article describes a promising transition of the latest in multiagent algorithms into a deployed application. In particular, it describes a software assistant agent called AR MOR (assistant for randomized monitoring over routes) that casts this patrolling and monitoring problem as a Bayesian Stackelberg game, allowing the agent to appropriately weigh the different actions in randomization, as well as uncertainty over adversary types. ARMOR combines two key features. It uses the fastest known solver for Bayesian Stackelberg games called DOBSS, where the dominant mixed strategies enable randomization; and its mixed‐initiative‐based interface allows users occasionally to adjust or override the automated schedule based on their local constraints. ARMOR has been successfully deployed since August 2007 at the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to randomize checkpoints on the roadways entering the airport and canine patrol routes within the airport terminals. This article examines the information, design choices, challenges, and evaluation that went into de signing ARMOR.",

    "abstract": "Large engineering projects, such as the engineering development of computers, involve a large number of activities and require cooperation across a number of departments. Due to technological and market uncertainties, these projects involve the management of a large number of changes. The Callisto project was born out of realization that the classical approaches to project management do not provide sufficient functionally to manage large engineering projects. Callisto was initiated as a research effort to explore project scheduling, control and configuration problems during the engineering prototype development of large computer systems and to devise intelligent project management tools that facilitate the documentation of project management expertise and its reuse from one project to another. In the first phase of the project, rule-based prototypes were used to build quick prototypes of project management expertise and the project management knowledge required to support expert project managers. In the second phase, the understanding of point solutions was used to capture the underlying models of project management in distributed project negotiations and comparative analysis. This article provides an overview of the problems, experiments, and the resulting models of project knowledge and constraint-directed negotiation.",

I also consider the high-level programming language that embodies these commitments, drawing examples from the domain of in-city driving. In closing, I consider ICARUS'S relation to other cognitive architectures and discuss some open issues that deserve increased attention.",

These differences led to different priorities, methods, and assessment approaches. A consequence was competition for resources, with HCI flourishing in AI winters and moving more slowly when AI was in favor. The situation today is much more promising, in part because of platform convergence: AI can be exploited on widely used systems.",

In the grand scheme of history of artificial intelligence (AI), this is surely a minor event. The field this scientific society represents has been thriving for quite some time. No doubt the society itself will make solid contributions to the health of our field. But it is too much to expect a presidential address to have a major impact. So what is the role of the presidential address and what is the significance of the first one? I believe its role is to set a tone, to provide an emphasis. I think the role of the first address is to take a stand about what that tone and emphasis should be-set expectations for future addresses and to communicate to my fellow presidents. Only two foci are really possible for a presidential address: the state of the society or the state of the science. I believe the latter to be correct focus. AAAI itself, its nature and its relationship to the larger society that surrounds it, are surely important. However, our main business is to help AI become a science -- albeit a science with a strong engineering flavor. Thus, though a president's address cannot be narrow or highly technical, it can certainly address a substantive issue. That is what I propose to do.",

The paper then contrasts the use of game AI in academe and industry, finding the academic research heavily focused on creating game‐winning agents, while the industry aims to maximize player enjoyment. It finds that industry adoption of academic research is low because it is either inapplicable or too time‐consuming and risky to implement in a new game, which highlights an area for potential investigation: bridging the gap between academe and industry. Finally, the areas of spatial reasoning, multiscale AI, and cooperation are found to require future work, and standardized evaluation methods are proposed to produce comparable results between studies.",

    "abstract": "While catchphrases such as big data, smart data, data‐intensive science, or smart dust highlight different aspects, they share a common theme — namely, a shift toward a data‐centered perspective in which the synthesis and analysis of data at an ever‐increasing spatial, temporal, and thematic resolution promise new insights, while, at the same time, reduce the need for strong domain theories as starting points. In terms of the envisioned methodologies, those catchphrases tend to emphasize the role of predictive analytics, that is, statistical techniques including data mining and machine learning, as well as supercomputing. Interestingly, however, while this perspective takes the availability of data as a given, it does not answer the question how one would discover the required data in today's chaotic information universe, how one would understand which data sets can be meaningfully integrated, and how to communicate the results to humans and machines alike. The semantic web addresses these questions. In the following, we argue why the data train needs semantic rails. We point out that making sense of data and gaining new insights work best if inductive and deductive techniques go hand‐in‐hand instead of competing over the prerogative of interpretation.",

GRADE uses historical admissions data to predict how likely the committee is to admit each new applicant. It reports each prediction as a score similar to those used by human reviewers, and accompanies each by an explanation of what applicant features most influenced its prediction. GRADE makes the review process more efficient by enabling reviewers to spend most of their time on applicants near the decision boundary and by focusing their attention on parts of each applicant's file that matter the most. An evaluation over two seasons of Ph.D. admissions indicates that the system leads to dramatic time savings, reducing the total time spent on reviews by at least 74 percent.",

While the interest in machine ethics has increased rapidly in recent years, there are only very few current efforts in the cognitive systems community to investigate moral and ethical reasoning. And there is currently no cognitive architecture that has even rudimentary moral or ethical competence, that is, the ability to judge situations based on moral principles such as norms and values and make morally and ethically sound decisions. We hence argue for the urgent need to instill moral and ethical competence in all cognitive system intended to be employed in human social contexts.",

However, in the recommender systems research community, we have fallen prey to a McNamara fallacy to a worrying extent: In the majority of our research efforts, we rely almost exclusively on computational measures such as prediction accuracy, which are easier to make than applying other evaluation methods. However, it remains unclear whether small improvements in terms of such computational measures matter greatly and whether they lead us to better systems in practice. A paradigm shift in terms of our research culture and goals is therefore needed. We can no longer focus exclusively on abstract computational measures but must direct our attention to research questions that are more relevant and have more impact in the real world. In this work, we review the various ways of how recommender systems may create value; how they, positively or negatively, impact consumers, businesses, and the society; and how we can measure the resulting effects. Through our analyses, we identify a number of research gaps and propose ways of broadening and improving our methodology in a way that leads us to more impactful research in our field.",

    "abstract": "To enable situated human‐robot dialogue, techniques to support grounded language communication are essential. One particular challenge is to ground human language to a robot's internal representation of the physical world. Although copresent in a shared environment, humans and robots have mismatched capabilities in reasoning, perception, and action. Their representations of the shared environment and joint tasks are significantly misaligned. Humans and robots will need to make extra effort to bridge the gap and strive for a common ground of the shared world. Only then is the robot able to engage in language communication and joint tasks. Thus computational models for language grounding will need to take collaboration into consideration. A robot not only needs to incorporate collaborative effort from human partners to better connect human language to its own representation, but also needs to make extra collaborative effort to communicate its representation in language that humans can understand. To address these issues, the Language and Interaction Research group (LAIR) at Michigan State University has investigated multiple aspects of collaborative language grounding. This article gives a brief introduction to this research effort and discusses several collaborative approaches to grounding language to perception and action.",

However, despite significant investment and impressive demonstrations, such technologies have struggled to live up to their promises. To this end, this article illustrates that machine learning fundamentally lacks the ability to leverage top‐down reasoning, a critical element in safety‐critical systems. This is especially important in situations where uncertainty can grow very quickly, requiring adaption to unknowns. This fundamental lack of contextual reasoning, combined with a lack of understanding of what constitutes maturity in artificial intelligence‐embedded systems, has significantly contributed to the failures of these systems. Demonstrations where safety‐critical artificial intelligence‐enabled systems function as if they were almost operational should not be a substitute for testing. Instead, companies and regulatory agencies need to work together to develop clear criteria and certification protocols before such technologies are made publicly available.",

AI has structural implications on the news media beyond the practice of journalism and the management of news as a process. AI also shifts the premises of competition, competitive advantage, mergers and acquisitions, and IT capabilities in the news industries. Not least, it fundamentally challenges journalism's traditional business model. Considered hereunder is the two‐sided market model, journalism's traditional platform function, its network effects, and its public good characteristics. The aim of the article is, thus, to reconceptualize core economic features of the news industries in the context of AI to provide a vocabulary with which to assess the economic future of journalism in a data‐driven platform economy.",

Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers opportunities for local news organizations to better cope with the economic challenges they face. However, local news organizations need to carefully prioritize where AI will create the most value. After all, they serve customers in the audience and advertising markets, with external effects on society. At the same time, they are limited by scarce resources, which constrains the implementation of AI. Therefore, based on Porter's value chain, this article pursues two goals. First, drawing on previous research, we provide a systematic overview of activities for which local news organizations see the biggest potential of AI to create value. Moreover, we highlight promising AI use cases based on benchmarking with national news organizations. Second, we discuss local news organizations’ challenges in implementing AI and how they might overcome such obstacles.",

However, real‐world data frequently exist in non‐IID graph structures that capture connections among individual units. To effectively mitigate bias in AI systems, it is essential to bridge the gap between traditional fairness literature, designed for IID data, and the prevalence of non‐IID graph data. This survey reviews recent advancements in fairness amidst non‐IID graph data, including the newly introduced fair graph generation and the commonly studied fair graph classification. In addition, available datasets and evaluation metrics for future research are identified, the limitations of existing work are highlighted, and promising future directions are proposed.",

In this address, it is argued that collaboration must be designed into systems from the start; it cannot be patched on. Key features of collaborative activity are described, the scientific base provided by recent AI research is discussed, and several of the research challenges posed by collaboration are presented. It is further argued that research on, and the development of, collaborative systems should itself be a collaborative endeavor -- within AI, across subfields of computer science, and with researchers in other fields.",

We believe that the field must develop methods capable of using rich knowledge models to make planning tools useful for complex problems. We discuss the suitability of current planning paradigms for solving these problems. In particular, we compare knowledge rich approaches such as hierarchical task network planning to minimal-knowledge methods such as STRIPS-based planners and disjunctive planners. We argue that the former methods have advantages such as scalability, expressiveness, continuous plan modification during execution, and the ability to interact with humans. However, these planners also have limitations, such as requiring complete domain models and failing to model uncertainty, that often make them inadequate for real-world problems. In this article, we define the terms knowledge-based and primitive-action planning and argue for the use of knowledge-based planning as a paradigm for solving real-world problems. We next summarize some of the characteristics of real-world problems that we are interested in addressing. Several current real-world planning applications are described, focusing on the ways in which knowledge is brought to bear on the planning problem. We describe some existing knowledge-based approaches and then discuss additional capabilities, beyond those available in existing systems, that are needed. Finally, we draw an analogy from the current focus of the planning community on disjunctive planners to the experiences of the machine learning community over the past decade.",

Second, we show a cognitive design process model obtained by observing design processes using a protocol analysis method. We then discuss a computable model that can explain most parts of the cognitive model and also interpret the descriptive model. In the computable model, a design process is regarded as an iterative logical process realized by abduction, deduction, and circumscription. We implemented a design simulator that can trace design processes in which design specifications and design solutions are gradually revised as the design proceeds.",

Based on multiple strategies for computing each metric, the competing systems were evaluated for recall, precision, and overgeneration.

A wide range of language-processing strategies was employed by the top-scoring systems, indicating that many natural language-processing techniques provide a viable foundation for sophisticated text analysis.

Aside from their potential utility, we believe this effort is important because it focuses on three key problems that must be solved to achieve human-level AI: Robust reasoning and learning, interactivity, and longevity. We describe the ideas we are using to develop the first architecture for Companions: analogical processing, grounded in cognitive science for reasoning and learning, sketching and concept maps to improve interactivity, and a distributed agent architecture hosted on a cluster to achieve performance and longevity. We outline some results on learning by accumulating examples derived from our first experimental version.",

Many tools used today do not satisfactorily assist users to establish this model because they do not adequately focus on fundamental decision objectives, help them reveal hidden preferences, revise conflicting preferences, or explicitly reason about trade‐offs. As a result, users fail to find the outcomes that best satisfy their needs and preferences. In this article, we provide some analyses of common areas of design pitfalls and derive a set of design guidelines that assist the user in avoiding these problems in three important areas: user preference elicitation, preference revision, and explanation interfaces.

    "abstract": "Early this year fifty people took an experimental course at Xerox PARC on knowledge programming in Loops During the course, they extended and debugged small knowledge systems in a simulated economics domain called Truckin Everyone learned how to use the Loops environment, formulated the knowledge for their own program, and represented it in Loops At the end of the course a knowledge competition was run so that the strategies used in the different systems could be compared The punchline to this story is that almost everyone learned enough about Loops to complete a small knowledge system in only three days. Although one must exercise caution in extrapolating from small experiments, the results suggest that there is substantial power in integrating multiple programming paradigms.

As in many situations in life, pat solutions and simple mathematical models just aren’t good enough. Things break. Information is missing. Assumptions fail. Situations are complicated. To cope with messiness, AI researchers have found that large amounts of problem-specific knowledge are usually needed. This places a premium on the use of powerful techniques for representing and testing knowledge in computer programs. Very few people have been trained to build knowledge systems. This is a critical bottleneck that limits the scope and impact of knowledge engineering. It limits the number of things that can be tried, the number of good ideas that are propagated, and the number of successful applications that influence the way that others perceive the field. A few numbers may serve to put this in perspective. About one computer science researcher in ten does some work in AI, and perhaps a fifth of those work in knowledge engineering. In 1980, approximately 265 people graduated with Ph.D.‘s in Computer Science, according to the “Snowbird Report” (Denning, et al., 1981). Fewer than a half dozen doctoral theses appear each year on some aspect of building knowledge systems. An estimate in a brochure by Teknowledge, Inc., indicates that there are only about sixty people in the world with high level expertise in the design and development of knowledge systems. Although precise figures for these populations are difficult to obtain, all the evidence suggests that the community is tiny, indeed.

    "abstract": "Sourcing professionals buy several trillion dollars worth of goods and services yearly. We introduced a new paradigm called expressive commerceand applied it to sourcing. It combines the advantages of highly expressive human negotiation with the advantages of electronic reverse auctions. The idea is that supply and demand are expressed in drastically greater detail than in traditional electronic auctions and are algorithmically cleared. This creates a Pareto efficiency improvement in the allocation (a win-win between the buyer and the sellers), but the market-clearing problem is a highly complex combinatorial optimization problem. We developed the world's fastest tree search algorithms for solving it. We have hosted $35 billion of sourcing using the technology and created $4.4 billion of hard-dollar savings plus numerous harder-to-quantify benefits. The suppliers also benefited by being able to express production efficiencies and creativity, and through exposure problem removal. Supply networks were redesigned, with quantitative understanding of the trade-offs, and implemented in weeks instead of months.",

We explore the steps needed to adapt Open IE to a domain‐specific ontology and demonstrate our approach of mapping domain‐independent tuples to an ontology using domains from the DARPA Machine Reading Project.

Defect predictors are widely used in organizations to predict defects in order to save time and effort as an alternative to other techniques such as manual code reviews. The usage of a defect prediction model in a real‐life setting is difficult because it requires software metrics and defect data from past projects to predict the defect‐proneness of new projects. It is, on the other hand, very practical because it is easy to apply, can detect defects using less time, and reduces the testing effort. We have built a learning‐based defect prediction model for a telecommunications company in the space of one year. In this study, we have briefly explained our model, presented its payoff, and described how we have implemented the model in the company. Furthermore, we compared the performance of our model with that of another testing strategy applied in a pilot project that implemented a new process called team software process (TSP). Our results show that defect predictors can predict 87 percent of code defects, decrease inspection efforts by 72 percent, and hence reduce postrelease defects by 44 percent. Furthermore, they can be used as complementary tools for a new process implementation whose effects on testing activities are limited.",

    "abstract": "Developing cognitive agents with human‐level natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities requires modeling human cognition because natural, unedited utterances are anything but neat and complete; so understanding them requires the ability to clean up the input and fill in the lacunae. Indeed, language inputs regularly feature complex linguistic phenomena such as lexical and referential ambiguity, ellipsis, false starts, spurious repetitions, semantically vacuous fillers, nonliteral language, indirect speech acts, implicatures, and production errors. Moreover, cognitive agents must be nimble in the face of incomplete interpretations since even people do not perfectly understand every aspect of every utterance they hear. This means that once an agent has reached the best interpretation it can, it must determine how to proceed — be that acting upon the new information directly, remembering whatever it has understood and waiting to see what happens next, seeking out information to fill in the blanks, or asking its interlocutor for clarification. The reasoning needed to support NLU extends far beyond language itself, including, nonexhaustively, the agent's understanding of its own plans and goals; its dynamic modeling of its interlocutor's knowledge, plans, and goals, all guided by a theory of mind; its recognition of diverse aspects of human behavior, such as affect, cooperative behavior, and the effects of cognitive biases; and its integration of linguistic interpretations with its interpretations of other perceptive inputs, such as simulated vision and nonlinguistic audition. Considering all of these needs, it seems hardly possible that fundamental NLU will ever be achieved through the kinds of knowledge‐lean text‐string manipulation being pursued by the mainstream natural language processing (NLP) community. Instead, it requires a holistic approach to cognitive modeling of the type we are pursuing in a paradigm called OntoAgent.",

The establishment of the International General Game Playing Competition in 2005, however, resulted in a renewed interest in more general problem-solving approaches to game playing. In general game playing (GGP) the goal is to create game-playing systems that autonomously learn how to play a wide variety of games skillfully, given only the descriptions of the game rules. In this paper we review the history of the competition, discuss progress made so far, and list outstanding research challenges.",

Studies have shown that virtual humans can mimic many of the social effects that one finds in human‐human interactions such as creating rapport, and people respond to virtual humans in ways that are similar to how they respond to real people. We believe that virtual humans represent a new metaphor for interacting with computers, one in which working with a computer becomes much like interacting with a person and this can bring social elements to the interaction that are not easily supported with conventional interfaces. We present two systems that embody these ideas. The first, the twins are virtual docents in the Museum of Science, Boston, designed to engage visitors and raise their awareness and knowledge of science. The second, Sim‐Coach, uses an empathetic virtual human to provide veterans and their families with information about PTSD and depression.",

    "abstract": "Foodborne illness afflicts 48 million people annually in the US alone. More than 128,000 are hospitalized and 3000 die from the infection. While preventable with proper food safety practices, the traditional restaurant inspection process has limited impact given the predictability and low frequency of inspections, and the dynamic nature of the kitchen environment. Despite this reality, the inspection process has remained largely unchanged for decades. CDC has even identified food safety as one of seven “winnable battles”; however, progress to date has been limited. In this work, we demonstrate significant improvements in food safety by marrying AI and the standard inspection process. We apply machine learning to Twitter data, develop a system that automatically detects venues likely to pose a public health hazard, and demonstrate its efficacy in the Las Vegas metropolitan area in a double‐blind experiment conducted over three months in collaboration with Nevada's health department. By contrast, previous research in this domain has been limited to indirect correlative validation using only aggregate statistics. We show that the adaptive inspection process is 64 percent more effective at identifying problematic venues than the current state of the art. If fully deployed, our approach could prevent more than 9000 cases of foodborne illness and 557 hospitalizations annually in Las Vegas alone. Additionally, adaptive inspections result in unexpected benefits, including the identification of venues lacking permits, contagious kitchen staff, and fewer customer complaints filed with the Las Vegas health department.",

We start by revisiting the predictions we made in 2000 for pedagogical agents, and examine which predictions panned out. Then, informed by what we have learned since then, we take another look at emerging trends and reexamine the future of pedagogical agents. Advances in natural language dialogue, affective computing, machine learning, virtual environments, and robotics are making possible even more lifelike and effective pedagogical agents, with potentially profound effects on the way people learn.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) seeks to emulate human reasoning, but is still far from achieving such results for actionable sensing in complex situations. Instead of emulating human situation understanding, machines can amplify intelligence by accessing large amounts of data, filtering unimportant information, computing relevant context, and prioritizing results (for example, answers to human queries) to provide human‐machine shared context. Intelligence support can come from many contextual sources that augment data reasoning through physical, environmental, and social knowledge. We propose a decisions‐to‐data multimodal sensor and action through contextual agents (human or machine) that seek, combine, and make sense of relevant data. Decisions‐to‐data combines AI computational capabilities with human reasoning to manage data collections, perform data fusion, and assess complex situations (that is, context reasoning). Five areas of AI developments for context‐based AI that cover decisions‐to‐data include: (1) situation modeling (data at rest), (2) measurement control (data in motion), (3) statistical algorithms (data in collect), (4) software computing (data in transit), and (5) human‐machine AI (data in use). A decisions‐to‐data example is presented of a command‐guided swarm requiring contextual data analysis, systems‐level design, and user interaction for effective and efficient multimodal sensing and action.",

We suggest that a firm's business strategy must drive AI‐driven business outcomes and measurements, which in turn should drive the AI implementation decisions. Very often, we find that businesses fail to successfully cast business problems into AI problems. To bridge this gap, we propose that firms use a performance management system such as objectives and key results (OKRs) to ensure that the business and AI goals &amp; objectives are well defined, tightly aligned, and made transparent across the company, and the AI efforts are approached in an integrated manner by the different parts of a firm. We use McDonald's use of AI initiatives as a business use case to demonstrate support for our AI decision‐making framework. We argue that using the business strategy as a primary driver will enable firms to solve the right problems using AI, turning it to be a source of technology innovation and competitive advantage.",

As the real‐world is an open environment that is full of unknowns or novelties, the capabilities of detecting novelties, characterizing them, accommodating/adapting to them, and gathering ground‐truth training data and incrementally learning the unknowns/novelties become critical in making the AI agent more and more knowledgeable, powerful and self‐sustainable over time. The key challenge here is how to automate the process so that it is carried out continually on the agent's own initiative and through its own interactions with humans, other agents and the environment just like human on‐the‐job learning. This paper proposes a framework (called SOLA) for this learning paradigm to promote the research of building autonomous and continual learning enabled AI agents.

Through this environment, ChatGPT successfully simulates the creation of a new improved model, called GPT 4 , which combines the concepts of GPT in AI (generative pretrained transformer) and GPT in physics (generalized probabilistic theory). We show that GPT 4 can use its built‐in mathematical and statistical capabilities to simulate and analyze physical laws and phenomena. As a demonstration of its language capabilities, GPT 4 also generates a limerick about itself. Overall, our results demonstrate the promising potential for human‐AI collaboration in scientific discovery, as well as the importance of designing systems that effectively integrate AI's capabilities with human intelligence.",

The adoption of such new technologies to support newsgathering processes is established practice for newsrooms. For AI specifically, we are seeing a new era of AI‐assisted journalism emerge with trust in the AI‐driven analyses and accuracy of results as core tenets. In Part I of this position paper, we discuss the contributions of six recently published research papers co‐authored by Bloomberg's Artificial Intelligence Engineering team that show the intricacies of training AI models for reliable newsgathering processes. The papers investigate (a) the creation of models for updated headline generation, showing that headline generation models benefit from access to the past state of the article, (b) sequentially controlled text generation, which is a novel task and we show that in general, more structured awareness results in higher control accuracy and grammatical coherence, (c) chart summarization, which looks into identifying the key message and generating sentences that describe salient information in the multimodal documents, (d) a semistructured natural language inference task to develop a framework for data augmentation for tabular inference, (e) the introduction of a human‐annotated dataset (ENTSUM) for controllable summarization with a focus on named entities as the aspect to control, and (f) a novel defense mechanism against adversarial attacks (ATINTER). We also examine Bloomberg's research work, building its own internal, not‐for‐commercial‐use large language model, BloombergGPT, and training it with the goal of demonstrating support for a wide range of tasks within the financial industry. In Part II, we analyze the evolution of automation tasks in the Bloomberg newsroom that led to the creation of Bloomberg's News Innovation Lab. Technology‐assisted content creation has been a reality at Bloomberg News for nearly a decade and has evolved from rules‐based headline generation from structured files to the constant exploration of potential ways to assist story creation and storytelling in the financial domain. The Lab now oversees the operation of hundreds of software bots that create semi‐ and fully automated stories of financial relevance, providing journalists with depth in terms of data and analysis, speed in terms of reacting to breaking news, and transparency to corners of the financial world where data investigation is a gigantic undertaking. The Lab recently introduced new tools that provide journalists with the ability to explore automation on demand while it continues to experiment with ways to assist story production. In Part III, we conceptually discuss the transformative impact that generative AI can have in any newsroom, along with considerations about the technology's shortcomings in its current state of development. As with any revolutionary new technology, as well as with exciting research opportunities, part of the challenge is balancing any potential positive and negative impacts on society. We offer our principles and guidelines used to inform our approach to experimenting with the new generative AI technologies. Bloomberg News’ style guide reminds us that our “journalism is aimed at possibly the most sophisticated audience in the world, for whom accuracy is essential.”",

Through a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, we assess the chatbots' ability to discern the veracity of statements, their adherence to facts, and the presence of bias or misinformation in their responses. Our quantitative analysis using True/False questions reveals that these chatbots can be relied on to give the right answers to these close‐ended questions. However, the qualitative insights, gathered from domain experts, shows that there are still concerns regarding privacy, ethical implications, and the necessity for chatbots to direct users to professional services. We conclude that while these chatbots hold significant promise, their deployment in sensitive areas necessitates careful consideration, ethical oversight, and rigorous refinement to ensure they serve as a beneficial augmentation to human expertise rather than an autonomous solution.

It aims to remove specific data or knowledge from trained models without retraining from scratch and has gained significant attention in the field of artificial intelligence in recent years. However, the development of machine unlearning research is associated with inherent vulnerabilities and threats, posing significant challenges for researchers and practitioners. In this article, we provide the first comprehensive survey of security and privacy issues associated with machine unlearning by providing a systematic classification across different levels and criteria. Specifically, we begin by investigating unlearning‐based security attacks, where adversaries exploit vulnerabilities in the unlearning process to compromise the security of machine learning (ML) models. We then conduct a thorough examination of privacy risks associated with the adoption of machine unlearning. Additionally, we explore existing countermeasures and mitigation strategies designed to protect models from malicious unlearning‐based attacks targeting both security and privacy. Further, we provide a detailed comparison between machine unlearning‐based security and privacy attacks and traditional malicious attacks. Finally, we discuss promising future research directions for security and privacy issues posed by machine unlearning, offering insights into potential solutions and advancements in this evolving field.",

An increasing number of computer applications also require collaboration among various systems and people. Thus, a major challenge for AI researchers is to determine how to construct computer systems that are able to act effectively as partners in collaborative activity. Collaborative activity entails participants forming commitments to achieve the goals of the group activity and requires group decision making and group planning procedures. In addition, agents must be committed to supporting the activities of their fellow participants in support of the group activity. Furthermore, when conflicts arise (for example, from resource bounds), participants must weigh their commitments to various group activities against those for individual activities. This article briefly reviews the major features of one model of collaborative planning called SHARED-PLANS (Grosz and Kraus 1999, 1996). It describes several current efforts to develop collaborative planning agents and systems for human-computer communication based on this model. Finally, it discusses empirical research aimed at determining effective commitment strategies in the SHAREDPLANS context.",

    "abstract": "In this article, I describe agent-centered search (also called real-time search or local search) and illustrate this planning paradigm with examples. Agent-centered search methods interleave planning and plan execution and restrict planning to the part of the domain around the current state of the agent, for example, the current location of a mobile robot or the current board position of a game. These methods can execute actions in the presence of time constraints and often have a small sum of planning and execution cost, both because they trade off planning and execution cost and because they allow agents to gather information early in nondeterministic domains, which reduces the amount of planning they have to perform for unencountered situations. These advantages become important as more intelligent systems are interfaced with the world and have to operate autonomously in complex environments. Agent-centered search methods have been applied to a variety of domains, including traditional search, strips-type planning, moving-target search, planning with totally and partially observable Markov decision process models, reinforcement learning, constraint satisfaction, and robot navigation. I discuss the design and properties of several agent-centered search methods, focusing on robot exploration and localization.",

Some computational principles (embodied in the Polyscheme cognitive architecture) are proposed to solve the integration problems involved in implementing such a substrate. A natural language syntactic parser that uses only the mechanisms of an infant physical reasoning model developed in Polyscheme demonstrates that a single cognitive substrate can underlie intelligent systems in superficially very dissimilar domains.

In design, this use has been limited almost exclusively to algorithmic solutions such as finite-element methods and circuit simulators. However, a number of problems encountered in design are not amenable to purely algorithmic solutions. These problems are often ill structured (the term ill-structured problems is used here to denote problems that do not have a clearly defined algorithmic solution), and an experienced engineer deals with them using judgment and experience. AI techniques, in particular the knowledge-based system (KBS) technology, offer a methodology to solve these ill-structured design problems. In this article, we describe several research projects that utilize KBS techniques for design automation. These projects are (1) the Criteria Yielding, Consistent Labeling with Optimization and Precedents-Based System (CYCLOPS), which generates innovative designs by using a three-stage process: normal search, exploration, and adaptation; (2) the Concept Generator (CONGEN), which is a domain independent framework for conceptual or preliminary design; (3) Constraint Manager (CONMAN), which is a constraint-management system that performs the evaluation and consistency maintenance of constraints arising in design; (4) the distributed and integrated environment for computer-aided engineering (DICE), which facilitates coordination, communication, and control during the entire design and construction/manu-facturing phases; and (5) DESIGN-KIT, which can be envisioned as a new generation of computer-aided engineering environment for process-engineering applications.",

Existing matching algorithms use either syntactic means (such as term matching and domain matching) or model semantic means, the use of structural information that is provided by the specific data model to enhance the matching process. The novelty of our approach lies in proposing a class of matching techniques that takes advantage of ontological structures and application semantics. As an example, the use of precedence to reflect business rules has not been applied elsewhere, to the best of our knowledge. We have tested the process for a variety of web sites in domains such as car rentals and airline reservations, and we share our experiences with precedence and its limitations.",

These systems include networked building energy systems, autonomous space probes, chemical plant control systems, satellite constellations for remote ecosystem monitoring, power grids, biospherelike life-support systems, and reconfigurable traffic systems, to highlight but a few. To achieve high performance, these immobile robots (or immobots) will need to develop sophisticated regulatory and immune systems that accurately and robustly control their complex internal functions. Thus, immobots will exploit a vast nervous system of sensors to model themselves and their environment on a grand scale. They will use these models to dramatically reconfigure themselves to survive decades of autonomous operation. Achieving these large-scale modeling and configuration tasks will require a tight coupling between the higher-level coordination function provided by symbolic reasoning and the lower-level autonomic processes of adaptive estimation and control. To be economically viable, they will need to be programmable purely through high-level compositional models. Self-modeling and self-configuration, autonomic functions coordinated through symbolic reasoning, and compositional, model-based programming are the three key elements of a model-based autonomous system architecture that is taking us into the new millennium.",

    "abstract": "Semantic integration focuses on discovering, representing, and manipulating correspondences between entities in disparate data sources. The topic has been widely studied in the context of structured data, with problems being considered including ontology and schema matching, matching relational tuples, and reconciling inconsistent data values. In recent years, however, semantic integration over text has also received increasing attention. This article studies a key challenge in semantic integration over text: identifying whether different mentions of real-world entities, such as JFK and John Kennedy, within and across natural language text documents, actually represent the same concept.We present a machine-learning study of this problem. The first approach is a discriminative approach--a pairwise local classifier is trained in a supervised way to determine whether two given mentions represent the same real-world entity. This is followed, potentially, by a global clustering algorithm that uses the classifier as its similarity metric. Our second approach is a global generative model, at the heart of which is a view on how documents are generated and how names (of different entity types) are sprinkled into them. In its most general form, our model assumes (1) a joint distribution over entities (for example, a document that mentions President Kennedy is more likely to mention Oswald or White House than Roger Clemens), and (2) an author model that assumes that at least one mention of an entity in a document is easily identifiable and then generates other mentions via (3) an appearance model that governs how mentions are transformed from the representative mention. We show that both approaches perform very accurately, in the range of 90-95 percent. F1 measure for different entity types, much better than previous approaches to some aspects of this problem. Finally, we discuss how our solution for mention matching in text can be potentially applied to matching relational tuples, as well as to linking entities across databases and text.",

These plans contain manipulations to achieve the assembly goals and sensory operations to cope with uncertainties in the robot's environment. High-level goals (which we refer to as operational goals) are satisfied by adding operations to the plan using a nonlinear, constraint-posting method. Geometric goals are satisfied by placing constraints on the execution of these operations. If the geometric configuration of the world prevents this, Spar adds new operations to the plan along with the necessary set of constraints on the execution of these operations. When the uncertainty in the world description exceeds that specified by the uncertainty-reduction goals, Spar introduces either sensing operations or manipulations to reduce this uncertainty to acceptable levels. If Spar cannot find a way to sufficiently reduce uncertainties, it augments the plan with sensing operations to be used to verify the execution of the action and, when possible, posts possible error-recovery plans, although at this point, the verification operations and recovery plans are predefined.",

In many real‐world applications, a multitude of valid plans exist, and a user distinguishes plans of high quality by how well they adhere to the user's preferences. To generate such high‐quality plans automatically, a planning system must provide a means of specifying the user's preferences with respect to the planning task, as well as a means of generating plans that ideally optimize these preferences.

Planning graphs are a cheap means to obtain informative look-ahead heuristics for search and have become ubiquitous in state-of-the-art heuristic search planners.

The fundamental concern with numerical representations of certainty is that they hide the reasoning about uncertainty. While numbers are easy to propagate over inferences, what the numbers mean is unclear. The theory of endorsements provide a richer representation of the factors that affect certainty and supports multiple strategies for dealing with uncertainty.",

On the other hand, if the tiger were not present, what is the probability you would see it?” Before we could say “what is the probability there is a tiger in the first place?” our colleague threw up his arms in despair “Why must you probabilists insist on thinking about everything backwards?” Since then, we have pondered this question.

However, the role played by knowledge of the task domain seems to be at least as important, both for the usability of an automatic programming system and for the feasibility of building one which works on non-trivial problems. This perspective has evolved during the course of a variety of studies over the last several years, including detailed examination of existing software for a particular domain (quantitative interpretation of oil well logs) and the implementation of an experimental automatic programming system for that domain. The importance of domain knowledge has two important implications: a primary goal of automatic programming research should be to characterize the programming process for specific domains; and a crucial issue to be addressed in these characterizations is the interaction of domain and programming knowledge during program synthesis.",

While this connection between embodied cues and key outcomes provides a unique opportunity for design, taking advantage of it requires a deeper understanding of how robots might use these cues effectively and the limitations in the extent to which they might achieve such outcomes through embodied interaction.

Students ask questions by typing free‐form natural language queries or by selecting passages of text. The system then attempts to answer the question and also generates suggested questions related to the query or selection. The questions supported by the system were chosen to be educationally useful, for example: what is the structure of X? compare X and Y? how does X relate to Y? In user studies, students found this question‐answering capability to be extremely useful while reading and while doing problem solving. In an initial controlled experiment, community college students using the Inquire Biology prototype outperformed students using either a hard copy or conventional ebook version of the same biology textbook.

    "abstract": "Ecological systems are inherently complex. The processes that affect the distributions of animals and plants operate at multiple spatial and temporal scales, presenting a unique challenge for the development and coordination of effective conservation strategies, particularly for wide‐ranging species. In order to study ecological systems across scales, data must be collected at fine resolutions across broad spatial and temporal extents. Crowdsourcing has emerged as an efficient way to gather these data by engaging large numbers of people to record observations. However, data gathered by crowdsourced projects are often biased due to the opportunistic approach of data collection. In this article, we propose a general class of models called AdaSTEM (for adaptive spatiotemporal exploratory models) that are designed to meet these challenges by adapting to multiple scales while exploiting variation in data density common with crowdsourced data. To illustrate the use of AdaSTEM, we produce intraseasonal distribution estimates of long‐distance migrations across the Western Hemisphere using data from eBird, a citizen science project that utilizes volunteers to collect observations of birds. Subsequently, model diagnostics are used to quantify and visualize the scale and quality of distribution estimates. This analysis shows how AdaSTEM can automatically adapt to complex spatiotemporal processes across a range of scales, thus providing essential information for full‐life cycle conservation planning of broadly distributed species, communities, and ecosystems.",

The introduction of a more diverse and challenging set of tasks in these platforms can feed AI research in the years to come, shaping the notion of success and the directions of the field. However, the playground of tasks and challenges presented there may misdirect the field without some meaningful structure and systematic guidelines for its organization and use. Anticipating this issue, we also report on several initiatives and workshops that are putting the focus on analyzing the similarity and dependencies between tasks, their difficulty, what capabilities they really measure and — ultimately — on elaborating new concepts and tools that can arrange tasks and benchmarks into a meaningful taxonomy.",

Most of these techniques use supervised learning algorithms that rely on training the algorithm to classify incoming data into categories, using data encountered in the relevant domain. A critical vulnerability of these algorithms is that they are susceptible to adversarial attacks by which a malicious entity called an adversary deliberately alters the training data to misguide the learning algorithm into making classification errors. Adversarial attacks could render the learning algorithm unsuitable for use and leave critical systems vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks. This article provides a detailed survey of the state‐of‐the‐art techniques that are used to make a machine learning algorithm robust against adversarial attacks by using the computational framework of game theory.

Now, as AI technologies enter our everyday lives at an ever‐increasing pace, there is a greater need for AI systems to work synergistically with humans. To do this effectively, AI systems must pay more attention to aspects of intelligence that help humans work with each other — including social intelligence. I will discuss the research challenges in designing such human‐aware AI systems, including modeling the mental states of humans‐in‐the‐loop and recognizing their desires and intentions, providing proactive support, exhibiting explicable behavior, giving cogent explanations on demand, and engendering trust. I will survey the progress made so far on these challenges, and highlight some promising directions. I will also touch on the additional ethical quandaries that such systems pose. I will end by arguing that the quest for human‐aware AI systems broadens the scope of AI enterprise; necessitates and facilitates true interdisciplinary collaborations; and can go a long way toward increasing public acceptance of AI technologies.",

At the same time, we show how external factors, including commercialization and technology developments, have shaped research on human‐centered recommender systems. We show how several unifying frameworks have helped developers and researchers alike incorporate thinking about user experience and human decision‐making into their designs. We then review the challenges, and the opportunities, in today's recommenders, looking at how deep learning and optimization techniques can integrate with both interface designs and human performance statistics to improve recommender effectiveness and usefulness",

For example, if we provide a large reward to indicate that something about the world is satisfactory to us, it may hypothesize that what satisfied us was the sending of the reward itself; no observation can refute that. Then we argue that this ambiguity will lead it to intervene in whatever protocol we set up to provide data for the agent about its goal. We discuss an analogous failure mode of approximate solutions to assistance games. Finally, we briefly review some recent approaches that may avoid this problem.",

This paper uses questions from the Watson Jeopardy! Challenge to compare BARD, ChatGPT, and Watson. Using those, Jeopardy! questions, we find that for high confidence Watson questions the three systems perform with similar accuracy as Watson. We also find that both BARD and ChatGPT perform with the accuracy of a human expert and that the sets of their correct answers are rated highly similar using a Tanimoto similarity score. However, in addition, we find that both systems can change their solutions to the same input information on subsequent uses. When given the same Jeopardy! category and question multiple times, both BARD and ChatGPT can generate different and conflicting answers. As a result, the paper examines the characteristics of some of those questions that generate different answers to the same inputs. Finally, the paper discusses some of the implications of finding the different answers and the impact of the lack of reproducibility on testing such systems.",

Analyzing these potential factors, we discuss the literature at times coming across unexplored research questions.

Most human-computer interfaces can be classified according to two dominant metaphors: (1) agent and (2) environment. Interactions based on an agent metaphor treat the computer as an intermediary that responds to user requests. In the environment metaphor, a model of the task domain is presented for the user to interact with directly. The term agent has come to refer to the automation of aspects of human-computer interaction (HCI), such as anticipating commands or autonomously performing actions. Norman's 1984 model of HCI is introduced as reference to organize and evaluate research in human-agent interaction (HAI). A wide variety of heterogeneous research involving HAI is shown to reflect automation of one of the stages of action or evaluation within Norman's model. Improvements in HAI are expected to result from a more heterogeneous use of methods that target multiple stages simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "Planning -- the ability to synthesize a course of action to achieve desired goals -- is an important part of intelligent agency and has thus received significant attention within AI for more than 30 years. Work on efficient planning algorithms still continues to be a hot topic for research in AI and has led to several exciting developments i the past few years. This article provides a tutorial introduction to all the algorithms and approaches to the planning problem in AI. To fulfill this ambitious objective, I introduce a generalized approach to plan synthesis called refinement planning and show that in its various guises, refinement planning subsumes most of the algorithms that have been, or are being, developed. It is hoped that this unifying overview provides the reader with a brand-name-free appreciation of the essential issues in planning.",

Since then, developing game-playing programs that can compete with (and even exceed) the abilities of the human world champions has been a long-sought-after goal of the AI research community. In Shannon's time, it would have seemed unlikely that only a scant 50 years would be needed to develop programs that play world-class backgammon, checkers, chess, Othello, and Scrabble. These remarkable achievements are the result of a better understanding of the problems being solved, major algorithmic insights, and tremendous advances in hardware technology. Computer games research is one of the important success stories of AI.

    "abstract": "To build a machine that has sense was once a principal goal in the field of artificial intelligence. But most researchers in recent years have retreated from that ambitious aim. Instead, each developed some special technique that could deal with some class of problem well, but does poorly at almost everything else. We are convinced, however, that no one such method will ever turn out to be best, and that instead, the powerful AI systems of the future will use a diverse array of resources that, together, will deal with a great range of problems. To build a machine that's resourceful enough to have humanlike common sense, we must develop ways to combine the advantages of multiple methods to represent knowledge, multiple ways to make inferences, and multiple ways to learn. We held a two-day symposium in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, to discuss such a project--to develop new architectural schemes that can bridge between different strategies and representations. This article reports on the events and ideas developed at this meeting and subsequent thoughts by the authors on how to make progress.",

A fuzzy metrictemporal Horn logic (FMTHL) provides a formalism for representing both schematic and instantiated conceptual knowledge about the depicted scene and its temporal development. The resulting conceptual representation mediates in a systematic manner between the spatiotemporal geometric descriptions extracted from video input and a module that generates natural language text.

    "abstract": "This article informally examines the role of stored internal state (that is, memory) in the control of autonomous mobile robots. The difficulties associated with using stored internal state are reviewed. It is argued that the underlying cause of these problems is the implicit predictions contained within the state, and, therefore, many of the problems can be solved by taking care that the internal state contains information only about predictable aspects of the environment. One way of accomplishing this is to maintain internal state only at a high level of abstraction. The resulting information can be used to guide the actions of a robot but should not be used to control these actions directly; local sensor information is still necessary for immediate control. A mechanism to detect and recover from failures is also required. A control architecture embodying these design principles is briefly described. This architecture was successfully used to control real-world and simulated real-world autonomous mobile robots performing complex navigation tasks. The architecture is able to incorporate standard AI planning and world-modeling algorithms into a real-time situated framework.",

He also argues that a number of other systems, including Pengi, are approximately universal plans and subject to the same criticisms. I think that this extension is incorrect. I illustrate my reasoning with a description of Blockhead, a Pengi-like system that efficiently solves the fruitcake problem which Ginsberg argues is infeasible for universal plans. The structure of Blockhead elucidates the relationship between planning, universal plans, and Pengi. I conclude that planning and universal plans are computationally intractable because of the representational assumptions they make.",

Description logics can reason about the logical definition of a class and automatically infer class-subclass subsumption relations as well as classify instances into classes based on their definitions. Descriptions of actions, plans, and goals can be exploited during plan generation, plan recognition, or plan evaluation. These techniques should be of interest to planning practitioners working on knowledge-rich application domains. Another emerging use of these techniques is the semantic web, where current ontology languages based on description logics need to be extended to reason about goals and capabilities for web services and agents.",

For those who haven't, the task can often prove impossible. One reason is that the requirements-oriented methods and intuitions learned in the development of other types of software do not carry over well to the knowledge engineering task. Another reason is that methodologies for developing expert systems by extracting, representing, and manipulating an expert's knowledge have been slow in coming. At Tektronix, we have been using step-by-step approach to prototyping expert systems for over two years now. The primary features of this approach are that it gives software engineers who do not know knowledge engineering an easy place to start, and that it proceeds in a step-by-step fashion from initiation to implementation without inducing conceptual bottlenecks into the development process. This methodology has helped us collect the knowledge necessary to implement several prototype knowledge-based systems, including a troubleshooting assistant for the Tektronix FG-502 function generator and an operator's assistant for a wave solder machine.",

This article argues that even if we seek to investigate complete agents in real-world environments, robotics is neither necessary nor sufficient as a basis for AI research. The article proposes real-world software environments, such as operating systems or databases, as a complementary substrate for intelligent-agent research and considers the relative advantages of software environments as test beds for AI. First, the cost, effort, and expertise necessary to develop and systematically experiment with software artifacts are relatively low. Second, software environments circumvent many thorny but peripheral research issues that are inescapable in physical environments. Brooks's mobile robots tug AI toward a bottom-up focus in which the mechanics of perception and mobility mingle inextricably with or even supersede core AI research. In contrast, the softbots (software robots) I advocate facilitate the study of classical AI problems in real-world (albeit, software) domains. For example, the UNIX softbot under development at the University of Washington has led us to investigate planning with incomplete information, interleaving planning and execution, and a host of related high-level issues.",

In this article, we focus on how the interpretation task can be aided by the expected scene information (such as map knowledge), which, in most cases, would not be in registration with the perceived scene. The proposed approach is applicable to the interpretation of scenes with three-dimensional structures as long as it is possible to generate the equivalent two-dimensional orthogonal or perspective projections of the structures in the expected scene. The system is implemented as a two-panel, six-level blackboard and uses the Dempster-Shafer formalism to accomplish inexact reasoning in a hierarchical space. Inexact reasoning involves exploiting, at different levels of abstraction, any internal geometric consistencies in the data and between the data and the expected scene. As they are discovered, these consistencies are used to update the system's belief in associating a data element with a particular entity from the expected scene.",

Devel- opers of future expert systems should find a description of proven knowledge-acquisi- tion techniques and an account of the experience of the COMPASS project in applying these techniques to be useful in developing their own knowledge-acquisi- tion procedures nowledge acquisition is the process by which expert sys- tem developers find the knowl- edge that domain experts use to perform the task of interest. This knowledge is then implemented to form an expert system. The essential part of an expert system is its knowl- edge, and therefore, knowledge acqui- sition is probably the most important task in the development of an expert system. In this article, several effective techniques for expert system knowl- edge acquisition are discussed based on the techniques that were success- fully used at GTE Laboratories to develop the COMPASS expert system. Knowledge acquisition for expert sys- tem development is still a new field and not (yet?) a science. Therefore, expert system developers and the experts they work with must tailor their knowledge-acquisition method- ologies to fit their own particular situ- ation and the people involved. As expert system developers define their own knowledge-acquisition proce- dures, they should find a description of proven knowledge-acquisition tech- niques and an account of the experi- ence of the COMPASS developers in applying these techniques to be use- ful.

Initial points cover the knowl- edge-acquisition considerations in selecting an expert and an appropriate domain for the expert system. The remaining points highlight techniques for getting started in knowledge acqui- sition, documenting the knowledge, and finally, actually acquiring and recording the knowledge.

Selecting extended logic programming with answer‐set semantics as a generic nonmonotonic logic, we show how that logic defines preferred belief sets and how preferred belief sets allow us to represent and interpret normative statements. Conflicts among program rules (more generally, defaults) give rise to alternative preferred belief sets. We discuss how such conflicts can be resolved based on implicit specificity or on explicit rankings of defaults. Finally, we comment on formalisms that explicitly represent preferences on properties of belief sets. Such formalisms either build preference information directly into rules and modify the semantics of the logic appropriately or specify preferences on belief sets independently of the mechanism to define them.",

It is stunning that so many predictions in Turing's 1950 Mind paper were right. In the decades since that paper appeared, with its inspiring challenges, research in computer science, neuroscience, and the behavioral sciences has radically changed thinking about mental processes and communication, and the ways in which people use computers has evolved even more dramatically. Turing, were he writing now, might still replace “Can machines think?” with an operational challenge, but it is likely he would propose a very different test.

Toward that end, this article presents PROTECT, a game‐theoretic system deployed by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) in the Port of Boston for scheduling its patrols. USCG has termed the deployment of PROTECT in Boston a success; PROTECT is currently being tested in the Port of New York, with the potential for nationwide deployment. PROTECT is premised on an attacker‐defender Stackelberg game model and offers five key innovations. First, this system is a departure from the assumption of perfect adversary rationality noted in previous work, relying instead on a quantal response (QR) model of the adversary's behavior — to the best of our knowledge, this is the first real‐world deployment of the QR model. Second, to improve PROTECT's efficiency, we generate a compact representation of the defender's strategy space, exploiting equivalence and dominance. Third, we show how to practically model a real maritime patrolling problem as a Stackelberg game. Fourth, our experimental results illustrate that PROTECT's QR model more robustly handles real‐world uncertainties than a perfect rationality model. Finally, in evaluating PROTECT, this article for the first time provides real‐world data: comparison of human‐generated versus PROTECT security schedules, and results from an Adversarial Perspective Team's (human mock attackers) analysis.",

This lack of understanding may underlie current limitations on the generality and reliability of modern artificial intelligence systems. In October 2018, the Santa Fe Institute held a three‐day workshop, organized by Barbara Grosz, Dawn Song, and myself, called Artificial Intelligence and the Barrier of Meaning. Thirty participants from a diverse set of disciplines — artificial intelligence, robotics, cognitive and developmental psychology, animal behavior, information theory, and philosophy, among others — met to discuss questions related to the notion of understanding in living systems and the prospect for such understanding in machines.

These failures could have a disproportionate impact because strange, new, and unpredictable dangers may lead to public discomfort and rejection of artificial intelligence. Two possible approaches to mitigating these risks are the hard power of regulating artificial intelligence, to ensure it is safe, and the soft power of risk communication, which engages the public and builds trust.

Since its inception in 2004, OpenStreetMap (OSM) sets the benchmark for open geospatial data and has become a key player in the public, research, and corporate realms. Following the foundations laid by OSM, several open geospatial products describing the built environment have blossomed including the Microsoft USA building footprint layer and the OpenAddress project. Each of these products use different data collection methods ranging from public contributions to artificial intelligence, and if taken together, could provide a comprehensive description of the built environment. Yet, these projects are still siloed, and their variety makes integration and interoperability a major challenge. Here, we document an approach for merging data from these three major open building datasets and outline a workflow that is scalable to the continental United States (CONUS). We show how the results can be structured as a knowledge graph over which machine learning models are built. These models can help propagate and complete unknown quantities that can then be leveraged in disaster management.",

In such multisided platforms, recommender systems play a key role in enabling discovery of products and information at large scales. However, as they have become more and more pervasive in society, the equitable distribution of their benefits and harms have been increasingly under scrutiny, as is the case with machine learning generally. While recommender systems can exhibit many of the biases encountered in other machine learning settings, the intersection of personalization and multisidedness makes the question of fairness in recommender systems manifest itself quite differently. In this article, we discuss recent work in the area of multisided fairness in recommendation, starting with a brief introduction to core ideas in algorithmic fairness and multistakeholder recommendation. We describe techniques for measuring fairness and algorithmic approaches for enhancing fairness in recommendation outputs. We also discuss feedback and popularity effects that can lead to unfair recommendation outcomes. Finally, we introduce several promising directions for future research in this area.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Auditing is a field of expertise often mentioned as being ripe for automation using artificial intelligence methods at all levels of operations. Primarily, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the auditing profession is done by and for large organizations, leveraging large datasets. While AI approaches for big data are continually improving, methods for small data are scarce. Yet most firms in the world employ fewer than 50 people and can, therefore, rarely rely on big data for automation. In our study, we ask auditors, who mainly audit SMEs, about their expectations towards the impact of AI on the auditing profession and where they expect it to provide the most value when it comes to auditing SMEs. We find that these auditors expect significant improvements in their own efficiency on the job, that learning to use AI applications will not be a challenge for them, and that the use of AI in auditing firms will become mandatory in the future. They expect the performance of certain tasks to become AI‐augmented, including risk assessment of individual transactions, conducting audit interviews, performing all manners of analysis, writing confirmation letters, performing the final verification of annual reports, and performing physical observations. Considering these results, we discuss the potential impact of these developments, such as how AI could make the auditing process more effective and efficient but also how AI could lead to an even higher concentration of the auditing service industry.",

    "abstract": "Abstract With the recent advances in machine learning, the use of natural language processing (NLP) technology to support various business processes has been increasing. This paper discusses the use of NLP to route more than one million live client tickets annually to the appropriate service personnel in 67 support missions across IBM. Each mission supports a product family with multiple support teams, each requiring different skills for the engineers. We discuss three important aspects of such a large‐scale deployment: (i) The use of a centralized team with a common machine learning infrastructure and practices to support the entire enterprise. (ii) The processes and quality of such a deployment from the perspective of one support mission, namely, IBM's z/OS family. (iii) Careful monitoring of the deployed models to detect drifts in the routing behavior. Despite vast differences in the technical contents of the support missions, it is possible to define common processes and metrics across the enterprise, without requiring a dedicated machine learning team for each mission. In addition, we provide examples of the business policies and metrics from the perspective of the z/OS mission to demonstrate the utility of the approach and the outcome.",

Despite recent developments of forecasting algorithms in the machine learning community, there is a lack of general and advanced algorithms specifically considering requirements from the power industry perspective. In this paper, we present eForecaster, a unified AI platform including robust, flexible, and explainable machine learning algorithms for diversified energy forecasting applications. Since October 2021, multiple commercial bus load, system load, and renewable energy forecasting systems built upon eForecaster have been deployed in seven provinces of China. The deployed systems consistently reduce the average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 39.8% to 77.0%, with reduced manual work and explainable guidance. In particular, eForecaster also integrates multiple interpretation methods to uncover the working mechanism of the predictive models, which significantly improves forecasts adoption and user satisfaction.",

Researchers need to face the complexities of scaling up to programs that actually serve a purpose. The move from toy domains into concrete ones has three big consequences for the development of AI. First, it will force software designers to face the idiosyncrasies of its users. Second, it will act as an important reality check between the language of the machine, the software, and the user. Third, the scaled-up programs will become templates for future work.",

We conclude that the basic approach of learning from solution paths can be applied to any situation in which problems can be solved by sequential search. Finally, we examine some potential difficulties that may arise in more complex domains, and suggest some possible extensions for dealing with them.",

    "abstract": "In the past, many knowledge representation systems failed because they were too monolithic and didn't scale well, whereas other systems failed to have an impact because they were small and isolated. Along with this trade‐off in size, there is also a constant tension between the cost involved in building a larger community that can interoperate through common terms and the cost of the lack of interoperability. The semantic web offers a good compromise between these approaches as it achieves wide‐scale communication and interoperability using finite effort and cost. The semantic web is a set of standards for knowledge representation and exchange that is aimed at providing interoperability across applications and organizations. We believe that the gathering success of this technology is not derived from the particular choice of syntax or of logic. Its main contribution is in recognizing and supporting the fractal patterns of scalable web systems. These systems will be composed of many overlapping communities of all sizes, ranging from one individual to the entire population that have internal (but not global) consistency. The information in these systems, including documents and messages, will contain some terms that are understood and accepted globally, some that are understood within certain communities, and some that are understood locally within the system. The amount of interoperability between interacting agents (software or human) will depend on how many communities they have in common and how many ontologies (groups of consistent and related terms) they share. In this article we discuss why fractal patterns are an appropriate model for web systems and how semantic web technologies can be used to design scalable and interoperable systems.",

The Mars Exploration Rover mission has now been operating for more than two years, and MAPGEN continues to be employed for activity plan generation for the Spirit and Opportunity rovers. During the multiyear deployment effort and subsequent mission operations experience, we have learned valuable lessons regarding application of mixed-initiative planning technology to mission operations. These lessons have spawned new research in mixed-initiative planning and have influenced the design of a new ground operations system, called M-SLICE, that is baselined for the Mars Science Laboratory mission. In this article, we discuss the mixed-initiative aspects of the MAPGEN system, focusing on the task, control, and awareness issues.",

    "abstract": "We discuss an interaction‐based approach to study the coevolution between sociotechnical networks, individual behaviors, and contagion processes on these networks. We use epidemics in human populations as an example of this phenomenon. The methods consist of developing synthetic yet realistic national‐scale networks using a first‐principles approach. Unlike simple random graph techniques, these methods combine real‐world data sources with behavioral and social theories to synthesize detailed social contact (proximity) networks. Individual‐based models of within‐host disease progression and interhost transmission are then used to model the contagion process. Finally, models of individual behaviors are composed with disease progression models to develop a realistic representation of the complex system in which individual behaviors and the social network adapt to the contagion. These methods are embodied within Simdemics, a general‐purpose modeling environment to support pandemic planning and response. Simdemics is designed specifically to be scalable to networks with 300 million agents; the underlying algorithms and methods in Simdemics are all high‐performance computing‐oriented methods. New advances in network science, machine learning, high‐performance computing, data mining, and behavioral modeling were necessary to develop Simdemics. Simdemics is combined with two other environments, Simfrastructure and Didactic, to form an integrated cyber environment. The integrated cyber environment provides the end user with flexible and seamless Internet‐based access to Simdemics. Service‐oriented architectures play a critical role in delivering the desired services to the end user. Simdemics, in conjunction with the integrated cyber environment, has been used in more than a dozen user‐defined case studies. These case studies were done to support specific policy questions that arose in the context of planning the response to pandemics (for example, H1N1, H5N1) and human‐initiated bioterrorism events. These studies played a crucial role in the continual development and improvement of the cyber environment.",

There is an unjustified perception in HCI that AI is unreliable. There is an unjustified perception in AI that interfaces are merely cosmetic. This disagreement is counterproductive.

It is a difficult task for physicians, who must manually interpret large volumes of blood glucose data to tailor therapy to the needs of each patient. This paper describes three emerging applications that employ AI to ease this task: (1) case‐based decision support for diabetes management; (2) machine‐learning classification of blood glucose plots; and (3) support vector regression for blood glucose prediction. The first application provides decision support by detecting blood glucose control problems and recommending therapeutic adjustments to correct them. The second provides an automated screen for excessive glycemic variability. The third aims to build a hypoglycemia predictor that could alert patients to dangerously low blood glucose levels in time to take preventive action. All are products of the 4 Diabetes Support System project, which uses AI to promote the health and well‐being of people with type 1 diabetes. These emerging applications could potentially benefit 20 million patients who are at risk for devastating complications, thereby improving quality of life and reducing health‐care cost expenditures.",

    "abstract": "Teams of artificially intelligent planetary rovers have tremendous potential for space exploration, allowing for reduced cost, increased f1exibility, and increased reliability. However, having these multiple autonomous devices acting simultaneously leads to a problem of coordination: to achieve the best results, they should work together. This is not a simple task. Due to the large distances and harsh environments, a rover must be able to perform a wide variety of tasks with a wide variety of potential teammates in uncertain and unsafe environments. Directly coding all the necessary rules that can reliably handle all of this coordination and uncertainty is problematic. Instead, this article examines tackling this problem through the use of coordinated reinforcement learning: rather than being programmed what to do, the rovers iteratively learn through trial and error to take take actions that lead to high overall system return. To allow for coordination, yet allow each agent to learn and act independently, we employ state‐of‐the‐art reward‐shaping techniques. This article uses visualization techniques to break down complex performance indicators into an accessible form and identifies key future research directions.",

In theory, reproducing and thereby verifying such improvements is easy, as it merely involves the execution of the experiment code on the same data. However, as recent work shows, the reported progress is often only virtual, because of a number of issues related to (i) a lack of reproducibility, (ii) technical and theoretical flaws, and (iii) scholarship practices that are strongly prone to researcher biases. As a result, several recent works could show that the latest published algorithms actually do not outperform existing methods when evaluated independently. Despite these issues, we currently see no signs of a crisis, where researchers re‐think their scientific method, but rather a situation of stagnation, where researchers continue to focus on the same topics. In this paper, we discuss these issues, analyze their potential underlying reasons, and outline a set of guidelines to ensure progress in recommender systems research.",

Contingency contracts address this but are often impractical. As an alternative, we propose leveled-commitment contracts. The level of commitment is set by decommitting penalties. To be freed from the contract, an agent simply pays its penalty to the other contract party(ies). A self-interested agent will be ruluctant to decommit because some other contract party might decommit, in which case the former agent gets freed from the contract, does not incur a penalty, and collects a penalty from the other party. We show that despite such strategic decommitting, leveled commitment increases the expected payoffs of all contract parties and can enable deals that are impossible under full commitment. Different decommitting mechanisms are introduced and compared. Practical prescriptions for market designers are presented. A contract optimizer, ECOMMITTER, is provided on the web.",

It is clear from these discussions that the notion of context is far from defined and is dependent in its interpretation on a cognitive science versus an engineering (or system building) point of view. In identifying the two points of view, this workshop permitted us to go one step further than previous workshops (notably Maskery and Meads [1992] and Maskery, Hopkins, and Dudley [1992]). Once a distinction is made on the viewpoint, one can achieve a surprising consensus on the aspects of context that the workshop addressed -- mainly, the position, the elements, the representation, and the use of context. Despite this consensus on the aspects of context, agreement on the definition of context was not yet achieved.",

    "abstract": "Recent thinking has it that AI, 25 years ago a unified field with a shared vision of creating intelligent machines, has devolved into a loosely connected set of distinct specialty areas with little communication or mutual interest between them. To the extent that this is true, it certainly appears to lessen the value of a centralized AI organization like AAAI and of traditional grand-scale AI conferences. But, I argue, the consequences are actually far worse: because of the very nature of intelligence, the centrifugal force on the field could thwart the very mission that drives it by leaving no place for the study of the interaction and synergy of the many coupled components that individually in isolation are not intelligent but, when working together, yield intelligent behavior. To raise awareness of the need to reintegrate AI, I contemplate the role of systems integration and the value and challenge of architecture. Illustrating some reason for optimism, I briefly outline some promising developments in large projects that are helping to increase the centripetal force on AI. I conclude by discussing how it is critical that the field focus its attention back on its original mission, led by a heavy dose of integrated systems thinking and grand challenges, and why after its first quarter century, AAAI is more essential than ever.",

    "abstract": "In the past twenty years, much time, effort, and money has been expended on designing an unambiguous representation of natural language to make them accessible to computer processing, These efforts have centered around creating schemata designed to parallel logical relations with relations expressed by the syntax and semantics of natural languages, which are clearly cumbersome and ambiguous in their function as vehicles for the transmission of logical data. Understandably, there is a widespread belief that natural languages are unsuitable for the transmission of many ideas that artificial languages can render with great precision and mathematical rigor. But this dichotomy, which has served as a premise underlying much work in the areas of linguistics and artificial intelligence, is a false one. There is at least one language, Sanskrit, which for the duration of almost 1000 years was a living spoken language with a considerable literature of its own. Besides works of literary value, there was a long philosophical and grammatical tradition that has continued to exist with undiminished vigor until the present century. Among the accomplishments of the grammarians can be reckoned a method for paraphrasing Sanskrit in a manner that is identical not only in essence but in form with current work in Artificial Intelligence. This article demonstrates that a natural language can serve as an artificial language also, and that much work in AI has been reinventing a wheel millenia old. First, a typical Knowledge Representation Scheme (using Semantic Nets) will be laid out, followed by an outline of the method used by the ancient Indian grammarians to analyze sentences unambiguously. Finally, the clear parallelism between the two will be demonstrated, and the theoretical implications of this equivalence will be given.",

    "abstract": "By extending Cyc's ontology and knowledge base approximately 2 percent, Cycorp and Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF) have built a system to answer clinical researchers' ad hoc queries. The query may be long and complex, hence it is only partially understood at first, parsed into a set of CycL (higher‐order logic) fragments with open variables. But, surprisingly often, after applying various constraints (medical domain knowledge, common sense, discourse pragmatics, syntax), there is only one single way to ft those fragments together, one semantically meaningful formal query P. The Semantic Research Assistant (SRA) system dispatches a series of database calls and then combines, logically and arithmetically, their results into answers to P. Seeing the first few answers stream back, users may realize that they need to abort, modify, and re‐ask their query. Even before they push ASK, just knowing approximately how many answers would be returned can spark such editing. Besides real‐time ad hoc query answering, queries can be bundled and persist over time. One bundle of 275 queries is rerun quarterly by CCF to produce the procedures and outcomes data it needs to report to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) — an external hospital accreditation and ranking body; another bundle covers the American College of Cardiology (ACC) reporting. Until full articulation and answering of precise, analytical queries becomes as straightforward and ubiquitous as text search, even partial understanding of a query empowers semantic search over semistructured data (ontology‐tagged text), avoiding many of the false positives and false negatives that standard text searching suffers from.",

    "abstract": "Despite the fact that AI has always been adventurous in trying to elucidate complex aspects of human behavior, only recently has there been research into computational modeling of humor. One obstacle to progress is the lack of a precise and detailed theory of how humor operates. Nevertheless, since the early 1990s, there have been a number of small programs that create simple verbal humor, and more recently there have been studies of the automatic classification of the humorous status of texts. In addition, there are a number of advocates of the practical uses of computational humor: in user interfaces, in education, and in advertising. Computer‐generated humor is still quite basic, but it could be viewed as a form of exploratory creativity. For computational humor to improve, some hard problems in AI will have to be addressed.",

For the fourth‐grade‐level questions, I argue that questions that require the understanding of time, of impossible or pointless scenarios, of causality, of the human body, or of sets of objects, and questions that require combining facts or require simple inductive arguments of indeterminate length can be chosen to be easy for people, and are likely to be hard for AI programs, in the current state of the art. For the high school level, I argue that questions that relate the formal science to the realia of laboratory experiments or of real‐world observations are likely to be easy for people and hard for AI programs. I argue that these are more useful benchmarks than existing standardized tests such as the SATs or New York Regents tests.

Today, 30 years later, personalized recommendations are ubiquitous and research in this highly successful application area of AI is flourishing more than ever. Much of the research in the last decades was fueled by advances in machine learning technology. However, building a successful recommender system requires more than a clever general‐purpose algorithm. It requires an in‐depth understanding of the specifics of the application environment and the expected effects of the system on its users. Ultimately, making recommendations is a human‐computer interaction problem, where a computerized system supports users in information search or decision‐making contexts. This special issue contains a selection of papers reflecting this multi‐faceted nature of the problem and puts open research challenges in recommender systems to the forefront. It features articles on the latest learning technology, reflects on the human‐computer interaction aspects, reports on the use of recommender systems in practice, and it finally critically discusses our research methodology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Today, most of the large‐scale conversational AI agents such as Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant are built using manually annotated data to train the different components of the system including automatic speech recognition (ASR), natural language understanding (NLU), and entity resolution (ER). Typically, the accuracy of the machine learning models in these components are improved by manually transcribing and annotating data. As the scope of these systems increase to cover more scenarios and domains, manual annotation to improve the accuracy of these components becomes prohibitively costly and time consuming. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages customer/system interaction feedback signals to automate learning without any manual annotation. Users of these systems tend to modify a previous query in hopes of fixing an error in the previous turn to get the right results. These reformulations, which are often preceded by defective experiences caused by either errors in ASR, NLU, ER, or the application. In some cases, users may not properly formulate their requests (e.g., providing partial title of a song), but gleaning across a wider pool of users and sessions reveals the underlying recurrent patterns. Our proposed self‐learning system automatically detects the errors, generates reformulations, and deploys fixes to the runtime system to correct different types of errors occurring in different components of the system. In particular, we propose leveraging an absorbing Markov Chain model as a collaborative filtering mechanism in a novel attempt to mine these patterns, and coupling it with a guardrail rewrite selection mechanism that reactively evaluates these fixes using feedback friction data. We show that our approach is highly scalable, and able to learn reformulations that reduce Alexa‐user errors by pooling anonymized data across millions of customers. The proposed self‐learning system achieves a win‐loss ratio of 11.8 and effectively reduces the defect rate by more than 30 percent on utterance level reformulations in our production A/B tests. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first self‐learning large‐scale conversational AI system in production.",

    "abstract": "Sound decision-making relies on accurate prediction for tangible outcomes ranging from military conflict to disease outbreaks. To improve crowdsourced forecasting accuracy, we developed SAGE, a hybrid forecasting system that combines human and machine generated forecasts. The system provides a platform where users can interact with machine models and thus anchor their judgments on an objective benchmark. The system also aggregates human and machine forecasts weighting both for propinquity and based on assessed skill while adjusting for overconfidence. We present results from the Hybrid Forecasting Competition (HFC) - larger than comparable forecasting tournaments - including 1085 users forecasting 398 real-world forecasting problems over eight months. Our main result is that the hybrid system generated more accurate forecasts compared to a human-only baseline which had no machine generated predictions. We found that skilled forecasters who had access to machine-generated forecasts outperformed those who only viewed historical data. We also demonstrated the inclusion of machine-generated forecasts in our aggregation algorithms improved performance, both in terms of accuracy and scalability. This suggests that hybrid forecasting systems, which potentially require fewer human resources, can be a viable approach for maintaining a competitive level of accuracy over a larger number of forecasting questions.",

Artificial intelligence (AI) is intimately connected with these challenges, both as an application domain and as a source of new computational techniques: On the one hand, AI suggests new algorithmic recommendations and interaction paradigms, offering novel possibilities to engineer cooperation and alleviate conflict in multiagent (hybrid) systems; on the other hand, new learning algorithms provide improved techniques to simulate sophisticated agents and increasingly realistic environments. In various settings, prosocial actions are socially desirable yet individually costly, thereby introducing a social dilemma of cooperation. How can AI enable cooperation in such domains? How to understand long‐term dynamics in adaptive populations subject to such cooperation dilemmas? How to design cooperation incentives in multiagent learning systems? These are questions that I have been exploring and that I discussed during the New Faculty Highlights program at AAAI 2023. This paper summarizes and extends that talk.",

Large news organizations, however, may be surprisingly well‐prepared for at least some of this disruption because of earlier innovation work on automating workflows for personalized content and formats using structured techniques. This article reviews this work and uses examples from the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and other large news providers to show how LLMs have recently been successfully applied to addressing significant barriers to the deployment of structured approaches in production, and how innovation using structured techniques has more generally framed significant editorial and product challenges that might now be more readily addressed using generative AI. Using the BBC's next‐generation authoring and publishing stack as an example, the article also discusses how earlier innovation work has influenced the design of flexible infrastructure that can accommodate uncertainty in audience behavior and editorial workflows – capabilities that are likely to be well suited to the fast‐approaching AI‐mediated news ecosystem.",

We test the methodology by building an interactive multifunctional system with a real-time perception- action loop. The system, whose construction relied entirely on the methodology, consists of an embodied virtual agent that can perceive both real and virtual objects in an augmented-reality room and interact with a user through coordinated gestures and speech. Wireless tracking technologies give the agent awareness of the environment and the user's speech and communicative acts. User and agent can communicate about things in the environment, their placement, and their function, as well as about more abstract topics, such as current news, through situated multimodal dialogue. The results demonstrate the CDM's strength in simplifying the modeling of complex, multifunctional systems that require architectural experimentation and exploration of unclear subsystem boundaries, undefined variables, and tangled data flow and control hierarchies.",

    "abstract": "Data integration is the problem of combining data residing at different autonomous, heterogeneous sources and providing the client with a unified, reconciled global view of the data. We discuss data-integration systems, taking the abstract viewpoint that the global view is an ontology expressed in a class-based formalism. We resort to an expressive description logic, ALCQI, that fully captures class-based representation formalisms, and we show that query answering in data integration, as well as all other relevant reasoning tasks, is decidable. However, when we have to deal with large amounts of data, the high computational complexity in the size of the data makes the use of a full-fledged expressive description logic infeasible in practice. This leads us to consider DL-Lite, a specifically tailored restriction of ALCQI that ensures tractability of query answering in data integration while keeping enough expressive power to capture the most relevant features of class-based formalisms.",

    "abstract": "An important task in postal automation technology is determining the position and orientation of the destination address block in the image of a mail piece such as a letter, magazine, or parcel. The corresponding subimage is then presented to a human operator or a machine reader (optical character reader) that can read the zip code and, if necessary, other address information and direct the mail piece to the appropriate sorting bin. Analysis of physical characteristics of mail pieces indicates that in order to automate the address finding task, several different image analysis operations are necessary. Some examples are locating a rectangular white address label on a multicolor background, progressively grouping characters into text lines and text lines into text blocks, eliminating candidate regions by specialized detectors (for example, detecting regions such as postage stamps), and identifying handwritten regions. Described here are several operations, their utility as predicted by statistics of mail piece characteristics, and the results of applying the operations to a task set of mail piece images. A problem-solving architecture based on the blackboard model of problem solving for appropriately invoking the tools and combining their results is described.",

This means that reports must be readable to humans and machines alike. In order to improve reporting practices in breast imaging, we allow the radiologist to write structured reports with a special pen on paper with an invisible dot pattern. In this way, we provide a knowledge‐acquisition system for printed mammography patient forms for the combined work with printed and digital documents. In this domain, printed documents cannot be easily replaced by computer systems because they contain free‐form sketches and textual annotations, and the acceptance of traditional PC reporting tools is rather low among the doctors. This is due to the fact that current electronic reporting systems significantly add to the amount of time it takes to complete the reports. We describe our real‐time digital paper application and focus on the use case study of our deployed application. We think that our results motivate the design and implementation of intuitive pen‐based user interfaces for the medical reporting process and similar knowledge work domains. Our system imposes only minimal overhead on traditional form‐filling processes and provides for a direct, ontology‐based structuring of the user input for semantic search and retrieval applications, as well as other applied artificial intelligence scenarios, which involve manual form‐based data acquisition.",

    "abstract": "From the stone age to the bronze, iron, and modern silicon ages, the discovery and characterization of new materials has always been instrumental to humanity's development and progress. With the current pressing need to address sustainability challenges and find alternatives to fossil fuels, we look for solutions in the development of new materials that will allow for renewable energy. To discover materials with the required properties, materials scientists can perform high‐throughput materials discovery, which includes rapid synthesis and characterization via X‐ray diffraction (XRD) of thousands of materials. A central problem in materials discovery, the phase map identification problem, involves the determination of the crystal structure of materials from materials composition and structural characterization data. This analysis is traditionally performed mainly by hand, which can take days for a single material system. In this work we present Phase‐Mapper, a solution platform that tightly integrates XRD experimentation, AI problem solving, and human intelligence for interpreting XRD patterns and inferring the crystal structures of the underlying materials. Phase‐Mapper is compatible with any spectral demixing algorithm, including our novel solver, AgileFD, which is based on convolutive nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). AgileFD allows materials scientists to rapidly interpret XRD patterns, and incorporates constraints to capture prior knowledge about the physics of the materials as well as human feedback. With our system, materials scientists have been able to interpret previously unsolvable systems of XRD data at the Department of Energy's Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, including the Nb‐Mn‐V oxide system, which led to the discovery of new solar light absorbers and is provided as an illustrative example of AI‐enabled high‐throughput materials discovery.",

    "abstract": "Life insurance provides trillions of dollars of financial security for hundreds of millions of individuals and families worldwide. To simultaneously offer affordable products while managing this financial ecosystem, life‐insurance companies use an underwriting process to assess the mortality risk posed by individual applicants. Traditional underwriting is largely based on examining an applicant's health and behavioral profile. This manual process is incompatible with expectations of a rapid customer experience through digital capabilities. Fortunately, the availability of large historical data sets and the emergence of new data sources provide an unprecedented opportunity for artificial intelligence to transform underwriting in the life‐insurance industry with standard measures of mortality risk. We combined one of the largest application data sets in the industry with a responsible artificial intelligence framework to develop a mortality model and life score. We describe how the life score serves as the primary risk‐driving engine of deployed algorithmic underwriting systems and demonstrate its high level of accuracy, yielding a nine‐percent reduction in claims within the healthiest pool of applicants. Additionally, we argue that, by embracing transparency, the industry can build consumer trust and respond to a dynamic regulatory environment focused on algorithmic decision‐making. We present a consumer‐facing tool that uses a state‐of‐the‐art method for interpretable machine learning to offer transparency into the life score.",

    "abstract": "Real‐time traffic signal control presents a challenging multiagent planning problem, particularly in urban road networks where, unlike simpler arterial settings, there are competing dominant traffic flows that shift through the day. Further complicating matters, urban environments require attention to multimodal traffic flows (vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists, buses) that move at different speeds and may be given different priorities. For the past several years, my research group has been developing and refining a real‐time, adaptive traffic signal control system to address these challenges, referred to as scalable urban traffic control (Surtrac). Combining principles from automated planning and scheduling, multiagent systems, and traffic theory, Surtrac treats traffic signal control as a decentralized online planning process. In operation, each intersection repeatedly generates and executes (in rolling horizon fashion) signal‐timing plans that optimize the movement of currently sensed approaching traffic through the intersection. Each time a new plan is produced (nominally every couple of seconds), the intersection communicates to its downstream neighbors what traffic it expects to send their way, allowing intersections to construct longer horizon plans and achieve coordinated behavior. Initial evaluation of Surtrac in the field has demonstrated significant performance improvements, and the technology is now deployed and operating in several U.S. cities. More recent work has focused on integrating real‐time adaptive signal control with emerging connected vehicle technology, and exploration of the opportunities for enhanced mobility that direct vehicle (or pedestrian) to infrastructure communication can provide. Current technology development efforts center on vehicle route sharing, smart transit priority, safe intersection crossing for pedestrians with disabilities, real‐time incident detection, and integrated optimization of signal control and route choice decisions. This article provides an overview of this overall research effort.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Emergency response (ER) workers perform extremely demanding physical and cognitive tasks that can result in serious injuries and loss of life. Human augmentation technologies have the potential to enhance physical and cognitive work‐capacities, thereby dramatically transforming the landscape of ER work, reducing injury risk, improving ER, as well as helping attract and retain skilled ER workers. This opportunity has been significantly hindered by the lack of high‐quality training for ER workers that effectively integrates innovative and intelligent augmentation solutions. Hence, new ER learning environments are needed that are adaptive, affordable, accessible, and continually available for reskilling the ER workforce as technological capabilities continue to improve. This article presents the research considerations in the design and integration of use‐inspired exoskeletons and augmented reality technologies in ER processes and the identification of unique cognitive and motor learning needs of each of these technologies in context‐independent and ER‐relevant scenarios. We propose a human‐centered artificial intelligence (AI) enabled training framework for these technologies in ER. Finally, how these human‐centered training requirements for nascent technologies are integrated in an intelligent tutoring system that delivers across tiered access levels, covering the range of virtual, to mixed, to physical reality environments, is discussed.",

To achieve these, it is necessary to use and analyze data and knowledge with statistical and symbolic AI methods relevant to the AI application––neither alone will do. Consequently, we argue and seek to demonstrate that the NeuroSymbolic AI approach is better suited for making AI a trusted AI system. We present the CREST framework that shows how C onsistency, R eliability, user‐level E xplainability, and S afety are built on NeuroSymbolic methods that use data and knowledge to support requirements for critical applications such as health and well‐being. This article focuses on Large Language Models (LLMs) as the chosen AI system within the CREST framework. LLMs have garnered substantial attention from researchers due to their versatility in handling a broad array of natural language processing (NLP) scenarios. As examples, ChatGPT and Google's MedPaLM have emerged as highly promising platforms for providing information in general and health‐related queries, respectively. Nevertheless, these models remain black boxes despite incorporating human feedback and instruction‐guided tuning. For instance, ChatGPT can generate unsafe responses despite instituting safety guardrails. CREST presents a plausible approach harnessing procedural and graph‐based knowledge within a NeuroSymbolic framework to shed light on the challenges associated with LLMs.",

    "abstract": "An engineer who creates a design needs to determine whether the design is free of errors that can lead to high manufacturing costs, tragic accidents because of design defects, low use because of poor product quality, and a host of other downstream concerns. The domain of engineering design is much harder than other domains, and errors are more likely to arise and remain undetected until it is too late to do something about them. One way to reduce these errors is to introduce the use of expert critics into the designer's electronic support environment. Critics are a promising approach for organizing a next-generation design support environment (DSE). Unfortunately, expert-critiquing theory offers inaccurate but widely followed guidance for helping builders create usable critic programs. Existing critics rely on batch, after-task, debiasing of experts. This form of criticism turns out to be overly limited and too often leads to user frustration. As a step toward correcting this deficiency, this article presents lessons learned from following the incorrect theory along with guidance for a more robust approach to criticism system construction. Future research needs are also identified that should help builders realize the full potential of critics in engineering DSEs.",

The research literature in constraint-directed scheduling is placed within the framework both to provide insight into, and examples of, the framework and to allow a new perspective on the scheduling literature. We show how a number of algorithms from the constraint-directed scheduling research can be conceptualized within the framework. This conceptualization allows us to identify and compare variations of components of our framework and provides new perspective on open research issues. We discuss the prospects for an overall comparison of scheduling strategies and show that firm conclusions vis-a-vis such a comparison are not supported by the literature. Our principal conclusion is the need for an empirical model of both the characteristics of scheduling problems and the solution techniques themselves. Our framework is offered as a tool for the development of such an understanding of constraint-directed scheduling and, more generally, constraint-directed search.",

CLAVIER uses CBR to match a list of parts that need to be cured against a library of previously successful loads and suggest the most appropriate next load. clavier also uses a heuristic scheduler to generate a sequence of loads that best meets production goals and satisfies operational constraints. The system is being used daily on the shop floor and has virtually eliminated the production of low-quality parts that must be scrapped, saving thousands of dollars each month. As one of the first fielded CBR systems, CLAVIER demonstrates that CBR is a practical technology that can be used successfully in domains where more traditional approaches are difficult to apply.",

Two systems have been constructed and deployed to provide defense analysts with the tools required to advise and assist the Australian Defense Force in the conduct of maritime surveillance and patrol.

The modules are controlled locally by software that must take into account the entire configuration. This poses two problems for the manufacturer. The first is how to make the overall control architecture adapt to, and use productively, the inclusion of particular modules. The second is to decide, at design time, whether a proposed module is a worthwhile addition to the system: will the resulting system perform enough better to outweigh the costs of including the module? This article indicates how the use of qualitative, constraint-based models provides support for solving both of these problems.

My robots were machines designed by engineers, not pseudo-men created by blasphemers. My robots reacted along the rational lines that existed in their 'brains ' from the moment of construction. In particular, he imagined that each robot's artificial brain would be imprinted with three engineering safeguards, three Laws of Robotics: 1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law. The young writer's name, of course, was Isaac Asimov (1964), and the robot stories he began writing that year have become classics of science fiction, the standards by which others are judged. Indeed, because of Asimov one almost never reads about robots turning mindlessly on their masters anymore.",

    "abstract": "The capabilities for representing and reasoning about three-dimensional (3-D) objects are essential for knowledge-based, 3-D photointerpretation systems that combine domain knowledge with image processing, as demonstrated by 3- D Mosaic and ACRONYM. Three-dimensional representation of objects is necessary for many additional applications, such as robot navigation and 3-D change detection. Geometric reasoning is especially important because geometric relationships between object parts are a rich source of domain knowledge. A practical framework for geometric representation and reasoning must incorporate projections between a two-dimensional (2-D) image and a 3-D scene, shape and surface properties of objects, and geometric and topological relationships between objects. In addition, it should allow easy modification and extension of the system's domain knowledge and be flexible enough to organize its reasoning efficiently to take advantage of the current available knowledge. We are developing such a framework -- the Frame-based Object Recognition and Modeling (3-D FORM) System. This system uses frames to represent objects such as buildings and walls, geometric features such as lines and planes, and geometric relationships such as parallel lines. Active procedures attached to the frames dynamically compute values as needed. Because the order of processing is controlled largely by the order of slot access, the system performs both top-down and bottom-up reasoning, depending on the current available knowledge. The FORM system is being implemented with the Carnegie-Mellon University-built Framekit tool in Common Lisp (Carbonell and Joseph 1986). To date, it has been applied to two types of geometric reasoning problems: interpreting 3-D wire frame data and solving sets of geometric constraints.",

The SNePS acting subsystem is integrated with the SNePS reasoning subsystem in such a way that: there are acts that affect what an agent believes; there are acts that specify knowledge-contingent acts and lack-of-knowledge acts; there are policies that serve as daemons, triggering acts when certain propositions are believed or wondered about. The GLAIR agent architecture supports metacognition by specifying a location for the source of self-awareness and of a sense of situatedness in the world. Several SNePS-based agents have taken advantage of these facilities to engage in self-awareness and metacognition.",

Students are allowed to correct any errors in their work and resubmit until the entire content is correct and thus all of the objectives are learned. Since Mechanix facilitates the grading and feedback processes, instructors are now able to assign more free‐ response questions, increasing teacher's knowledge of student comprehension.

One of the difficulties of antimicrobial prescribing lies in the necessity to sequentially adjust the treatment of a patient as new clinical data become available. The lack of specialized health‐care resources and the overwhelming amount of information to process make manual surveillance unsustainable. To solve this problem, we have developed and deployed an automated antimicrobial prescription surveillance system that assists hospital pharmacists in identifying and reporting inappropriate prescriptions. Since its deployment, the system has improved antimicrobial prescribing and decreased antimicrobial use. However, the highly sensitive knowledge base used by the system leads to many false alerts. As a remedy, we are developing a machine‐learning algorithm that combines instance‐based learning and rule induction techniques to discover new rules for detecting inappropriate prescriptions from previous false alerts. In this article, we describe the system, point to results and lessons learned so far, and provide insight into the machine‐learning capability.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) research has explored a variety of problems and approaches since its inception, but for the last 20 years or so has been focused on the problems surrounding the construction of intelligent agents — systems that perceive and act in some environment. In this context, \"intelligence\" is related to statistical and economic notions of rationality — colloquially, the ability to make good decisions, plans, or inferences. The adoption of probabilistic and decision-theoretic representations and statistical learning methods has led to a large degree of integration and cross-fertilization among AI, machine learning, statistics, control theory, neuroscience, and other fields. The establishment of shared theoretical frameworks, combined with the availability of data and processing power, has yielded remarkable successes in various component tasks such as speech recognition, image classification, autonomous vehicles, machine translation, legged locomotion, and question-answering systems. As capabilities in these areas and others cross the threshold from laboratory research to economically valuable technologies, a virtuous cycle takes hold whereby even small improvements in performance are worth large sums of money, prompting greater investments in research. There is now a broad consensus that AI research is progressing steadily, and that its impact on society is likely to increase. The potential benefits are huge, since everything that civilization has to offer is a product of human intelligence; we cannot predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools AI may provide, but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable. Because of the great potential of AI, it is important to research how to reap its benefits while avoiding potential pitfalls. The progress in AI research makes it timely to focus research not only on making AI more capable, but also on maximizing the societal benefit of AI. Such considerations motivated the AAAI 2008–09 Presidential Panel on Long-Term AI Futures and other projects on AI impacts, and constitute a significant expansion of the field of AI itself, which up to now has focused largely on techniques that are neutral with respect to purpose. We recommend expanded research aimed at ensuring that increasingly capable AI systems are robust and beneficial: our AI systems must do what we want them to do. The attached research priorities document [see page X] gives many examples of such research directions that can help maximize the societal benefit of AI. This research is by necessity interdisciplinary, because it involves both society and AI. It ranges from economics, law and philosophy to computer security, formal methods and, of course, various branches of AI itself. In summary, we believe that research on how to make AI systems robust and beneficial is both important and timely, and that there are concrete research directions that can be pursued today.",

Increasing quality of the data requires better sample selection, data validation, and data reduction. Robotic studies in Mars‐like desert terrain have advanced autonomy for long‐distance exploration and seeded technologies for planetary rover missions. In these field experiments the remote science team uses a novel control strategy that intersperses preplanned activities with autonomous decision making. The robot performs automatic data collection, interpretation, and response at multiple spatial scales. Specific capabilities include instrument calibration, visual targeting of selected features, an on‐board database of collected data, and a long‐range path planner that guides the robot using analysis of current surface and prior satellite data. Field experiments in the Atacama Desert of Chile over the past decade demonstrate these capabilities and illustrate current challenges and future directions.",

Big data problems that involve integrating data from multiple sources can benefit from our approach when the data's ontologies are unknown, inaccessible, or semantically trivial. For such cases, we use supervised machine learning to map entity attributes and relations to a known set of attributes and relations from appropriate background knowledge bases to predict instance entity types.

We suggest that a test would benefit from including the following requirements: focus on rational behavior, test several dimensions of intelligence, automate as much as possible, score as objectively as possible, and allow incremental progress to be measured. In this article we propose a methodology for designing a test that consists of a series of events, analogous to the Olympic Decathlon, which complies with these requirements.

    "abstract": "This article reports on the first international Competition of Distributed and Multiagent Planners (CoDMAP). The competition focused on cooperative domain‐independent planners compatible with a minimal multiagent extension of the classical planning model. The motivations for the competition were manifold: to standardize the problem description language with a common set of benchmarks, to promote development of multiagent planners both inside and outside of the multiagent research community, and to serve as a prototype for future multiagent planning competitions. The article provides an overview of cooperative multiagent planning, describes a novel variant of standardized input language for encoding mutliagent planning problems, and summarizes the key points of organization, competing planners, and results of the competition.",

    "abstract": "AI is related to information fusion (IF). Many methods in AI that use perception and reasoning align to the functionalities of high‐level IF (HLIF) operations that estimate situational and impact states. To achieve HLIF sensor, user, and mission management operations, AI elements of planning, control, and knowledge representation are needed. Both AI reasoning and IF inferencing and estimation exploit context as a basis for achieving deeper levels of understanding of complex world conditions. Open challenges for AI researchers include achieving concept generalization, response adaptation, and situation assessment. This article presents a brief survey of recent and current research on the exploitation of context in IF and discusses the interplay and similarities between IF, context exploitation, and AI. In addition, it highlights the role that contextual information can provide in the next generation of adaptive intelligent systems based on explainable AI. The article describes terminology, addresses notional processing concepts, and lists references for readers to follow up and explore ideas offered herein.",

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's pioneering research on automatic transcription, translation, and content analysis were major artificial intelligence success stories that changed science fiction into social fact. During a 40‐year period, 10 seminal DARPA programs produced breakthrough capabilities that were further improved and widely deployed in popular consumer products, as well as in many commercial, industrial, and governmental applications. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency produced the core enabling technologies by setting crisp, aggressive, and quantitative technical objectives; by providing strong multiyear funding; and by using the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Common Task Method, which was powerful, efficient, and easy to administer. To achieve these breakthroughs, multidisciplinary academic and industrial research teams working in parallel took advantage of increasingly large and diverse sets of linguistic data and rapidly increasing computational power to develop and use increasingly sophisticated forms of machine learning. This article describes the progression of technical advances underlying key successes and the seminal programs that produced them.",

A central assumption of big data analytics is that it can explain and predict human behavior. We investigate this assumption, aiming to enhance the knowledge basis for developing algorithmic standards in big data analytics. First, we argue that big data analytics is by design atheoretical and does not provide process‐based explanations of human behavior; thus, it is unfit to support deliberation that is transparent and explainable. Second, we review evidence from interdisciplinary decision science, showing that the accuracy of complex algorithms used in big data analytics for predicting human behavior is not consistently higher than that of simple rules of thumb. Rather, it is lower in situations such as predicting election outcomes, criminal profiling, and granting bail. Big data algorithms can be considered as candidate models for explaining, predicting, and supporting human decision making when they match, in transparency and accuracy, simple, process‐based, domain‐grounded theories of human behavior. Big data analytics can be inspired by behavioral and cognitive theory.",

Combining an artificial neural network (ANN) as a character classifier with a context-driven search over segmentation and word-recognition hypotheses provides an effective recognition system. Long-standing issues relative to training, generalization, segmentation, models of context, probabilistic formalisms, and so on, need to be resolved, however, to achieve excellent performance. We present a number of recent innovations in the application of ANNs as character classifiers for word recognition, including integrated multiple representations, normalized output error, negative training, stroke warping, frequency balancing, error emphasis, and quantized weights.

Four teams responded to the WTC disaster through the auspices of the Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue (CRASAR), directed by John Blitch. The four teams were Foster-Miller and iRobot (both robot manufacturers from the Boston area), the United States Navy's Space Warfare Center (SPAWAR) group from San Diego, and the University of South Florida (USF). Blitch, through his position as program manager for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Tactical Mobile Robots Program, was a supporter of the competition; he also served as a member of the rules committee and a judge. USF participated by chairing the rules committee, judging, assisting with the logistics, providing commentary, and demonstrating tethered and wireless robots whenever entrants had to skip around during the competition.Based on our experiences and history, we were asked to comment on the validity of the competition. The CRASAR collective experience suggests that most of the basic rules of the competition matched reality because the rules accurately reflected deployment scenarios, but the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Test Course, and hardware or software approaches forwarded by competitors in last summer's event, missed the mark. This article briefly reviews the types of robots and missions used by CRASAR at the WTC site, then discusses the robot-assisted search and rescue effort in terms of lessons for the competition.",

    "abstract": "Reasoning about spatial data is a key task in many applications, including geographic information systems, meteorological and fluid flow analysis, computer-aided design, and protein structure databases. Such applications often require the identification and manipulation of qualitative spatial representations, for example, to detect whether one “object” will soon occlude another in a digital image, or to efficiently determine relationships between a proposed road and wetland regions in a geographic data set. Qualitative spatial reasoning (QSR) provides representational primitives (a spatial “vocabulary”) and inference mechanisms for these tasks. This paper first reviews representative work on QSR for data-poor scenarios, where the goal is to design representations that can answer qualitative queries without much numerical information. It then turns to the data-rich case, where the goal is to derive and manipulate qualitative spatial representations that efficiently and correctly abstract important spatial aspects of the underlying data, for use in subsequent tasks. This paper focuses on how a particular QSR system, Spatial Aggregation (SA), can help answer spatial queries for scientific and engineering data sets. A case study application of weather analysis illustrates the effective representation and reasoning supported by both data-poor and data-rich forms of QSR.",

    "abstract": "Research on semantic web services promises greater interoperability among software agents and web services by enabling content-based automated service discovery and interaction and by utilizing. Although this is to be based on use of shared ontologies published on the semantic web, services produced and described by different developers may well use different, perhaps partly overlapping, sets of ontologies. Interoperability will depend on ontology mappings and architectures supporting the associated translation processes. The question we ask is, does the traditional approach of introducing mediator agents to translate messages between requestors and services work in such an open environment? This article reviews some of the processing assumptions that were made in the development of the semantic web service modeling ontology OWL-S and argues that, as a practical matter, the translation function cannot always be isolated in mediators. Ontology mappings need to be published on the semantic web just as ontologies themselves are. The translation for service discovery, service process model interpretation, task negotiation, service invocation, and response interpretation may then be distributed to various places in the architecture so that translation can be done in the specific goal-oriented informational contexts of the agents performing these processes. We present arguments for assigning translation responsibility to particular agents in the cases of service invocation, response translation, and matchmaking.",

    "abstract": "In many cooperative multiagent domains, the effect of local interactions between agents can be compactly represented as a network structure. Given that agents are spread across such a network, agents directly interact only with a small group of neighbors. A distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP) is a useful framework to reason about such networks of agents. Given agents' inability to communicate and collaborate in large groups in such networks, we focus on an approach called k‐optimality for solving DCOPs. In this approach, agents form groups of one or more agents until no group of k or fewer agents can possibly improve the DCOP solution; we define this type of local optimum, and any algorithm guaranteed to reach such a local optimum, as k‐optimal. The article provides an overview of three key results related to k‐optimality. The first set of results gives worst‐case guarantees on the solution quality of k‐optima in a DCOP. These guarantees can help determine an appropriate k‐optimal algorithm, or possibly an appropriate constraint graph structure, for agents to use in situations where the cost of coordination between agents must be weighed against the quality of the solution reached. The second set of results gives upper bounds on the number of k‐optima that can exist in a DCOP. These results are useful in domains where a DCOP must generate a set of solutions rather than a single solution. Finally, we sketch algorithms for k‐optimality and provide some experimental results for 1‐, 2‐ and 3‐optimal algorithms for several types of DCOPs.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we describe the hardware and software challenges involved in realizing claytronics, a form of programmable matter made out of very large numbers—potentially millions—of submillimeter‐sized spherical robots. The goal of the Claytronics Project is to create ensembles of cooperating submillimeter robots, which work together to form dynamic three‐dimensional physical objects. For example, claytronics might be used in telepresense to mimic, with high‐fidelity and in three‐dimensional solid form, the look, feel, and motion of the person at the other end of the telephone call. To achieve this long‐range vision we are investigating hardware mechanisms for constructing submillimeter robots, which can be manufactured en masse using photolithography. We also propose the creation of a new media type, which we call pario. The idea behind pario is to render arbitrary moving, physical three‐dimensional objects that you can see, touch, and even hold in your hands. In parallel with our hardware effort, we are developing novel distributed programming languages and algorithms to control the ensembles, LDP and Meld. Pario may fundamentally change how we communicate with others and interact with the world around us. Our research results to date suggest that there is a viable path to implementing both the hardware and software necessary for claytronics, which is a form of programmable matter that can be used to implement pario. While we have made significant progress, there is still much research ahead in order to turn this vision into reality.",

This promulgates the idea that these different AI capabilities can easily be integrated later, whereas, in practice, developing integrated AI systems remains an open challenge for both research and industry. Interdisciplinary project‐driven courses can fill this gap in AI education, providing challenging problems that require the integration of multiple AI methods. This article explores teaching integrated AI through two project‐driven courses: a capstone‐style graduate course in advanced robotics, and an undergraduate course on computational sustainability and assistive computing. In addition to studying the integration of AI techniques, these courses provide students with practical applications experience and exposure to social issues of AI and computing. My hope is that other instructors find these courses as useful examples for constructing their own project‐driven courses to teach integrated AI.",

    "abstract": "Job openings often go unfilled despite a surfeit of unemployed or underemployed workers. One of the main reasons for this disparity is a mismatch between the skills required by employers and the skills that workers possess. This mismatch, also known as the skills gap, can pose socioeconomic challenges for an economy. A first step in alleviating the skills gap is to accurately detect skills in human capital data such as resumes and job ads. Comprehensive and accurate detection of skills facilitates analysis of labor market dynamics. It also helps bridge the divide between supply and demand of labor by facilitating reskilling and workforce training programs. In this article, we describe SKILL, a named entity normalization (NEN) system for occupational skills. SKILL is composed of (1) a skills tagger, which uses properties of semantic word vectors to recognize and normalize relevant skills, and (2) a skill entity sense disambiguation component, which infers the correct meaning of an identified skill. We discuss the technical design and the synergy between data science and engineering that was required to transform the system from a research prototype to a production service that serves customers from across the organization. We also discuss establishing customer feedback loops, which led to improvements to the system over time. SKILL is currently used by various internal teams at CareerBuilder for big data workforce analytics, semantic search, job matching, and recommendations.",

In this article we focus on detecting hypoxia (or oxygen deprivation), a very serious condition that can arise from different pathologies and can lead to lifelong disability and death. We present a novel approach to hypoxia detection based on recordings of the uterine pressure and fetal heart rate, which are obtained using standard labor monitoring devices. The key idea is to learn models of the fetal response to signals from its environment. Then, we use the parameters of these models as attributes in a binary classification problem. A running count of pathological classifications over several time periods is taken to provide the current label for the fetus. We use a unique database of real clinical recordings, both from normal and pathological cases. Our approach classifies correctly more than half the pathological cases, 1.5 hours before delivery. These are cases that were missed by clinicians; early detection of this type would have allowed the physician to perform a Cesarean section, possibly avoiding the negative outcome.",

Compact problem representations take advantage of genuine modeling features of ASP, including (first‐order) variables, negation by default, and recursion.

To solve this problem, we turn to semantics — using ontological constraints between candidate facts to eliminate errors. In this article, we represent the desired knowledge base as a knowledge graph and introduce the problem of knowledge graph identification, collectively resolving the entities, labels, and relations present in the knowledge graph. Knowledge graph identification requires reasoning jointly over millions of extractions simultaneously, posing a scalability challenge to many approaches. We use probabilistic soft logic (PSL), a recently introduced statistical relational learning framework, to implement an efficient solution to knowledge graph identification and present state‐of‐the‐art results for knowledge graph construction while performing an order of magnitude faster than competing methods.",

This implies that no single test will be sufficient to measure progress. Instead, evaluations should be organized around showing increasing abilities to participate in our culture, as apprentices. This provides multiple dimensions within which progress can be measured, including how well different interaction modalities can be used, what range of domains can be tackled, what human‐normed levels of knowledge they are able to acquire, as well as others. I begin by motivating the idea of software social organisms, drawing on ideas from other areas of cognitive science, and provide an analysis of the substrate capabilities that are needed in social organisms in terms closer to what is needed for computational modeling. Finally, the implications for evaluation are discussed.",

Both areas (especially the second) are attracting considerable interest, but work in multiagent systems often assumes either classical planning models or prespecified economic valuations on the part of the agents in question. By integrating models of DTP in multiagent systems research, more sophisticated multiagent planning scenarios can be accommodated, at the same time explaining precisely how agents determine their valuations for different sources or activities. I discuss several research challenges that emerge from this integration, involving the development of coordination protocols, the reasoning about lack of coordination, and the predicting of behavior in markets. I also briefly mention some opportunities afforded planning agents in multiagent settings and how these might be addressed.",

Despite the considerable progress in teamwork research, the challenge of intrateam conflict resolution has remained largely unaddressed. This article presents CONSA, a system we are developing to resolve conflicts using argumentation-based negotiations. CONSA focuses on exploiting the benefits of argumentation in a team setting. Thus, CONSA casts conflict resolution as a team problem, so that the recent advances in teamwork can be brought to bear during conflict resolution to improve argumentation flexibility. Furthermore, because teamwork conflicts sometimes involve past teamwork, teamwork models can be exploited to provide agents with reusable argumentation knowledge. Additionally, CONSA also includes argumentation strategies geared toward benefiting the team, rather than the individual, and techniques to reduce argumentation overhead.",

Multi-modality refers to the perception of different coordinated media used in delivering a message as well as the combination of various attitudes in relation to communication. In particular, the integration of natural language processing and hypermedia allows each modality to overcome the constraints of the other, resulting in a novel class of integrated environments for complex exploration and information access. Information presentation is a key element of such environments; generation techniques can contribute to their quality by producing texts ex novo or flexibly adapting existing material to the current situation. A great opportunity arises for intelligent interfaces and language technology of this kind to play an important role for individual-oriented cultural tourism. In the article, reference is made to some prototypes developed at IRST that were conceived for this specific area. A recent project concentrated on the combination of two forms of navigation taking place at the same time -- one in information space, the other in physical space. Collaboration, an important topic for intelligent interfaces, is also discussed.",

These “situated” perspectives correctly emphasize that agents live in a social world, using their environments to help guide their actions without needing to always plan their futures in detail; but they incorrectly conclude that the very idea of mental representation is mistaken.

This effort to make advanced computing technology, such as expert systems, an integral part of the organizational environment and, thereby, to significantly alter traditional decision-making methods failed for two reasons: (1) the innovation of having users, as opposed to the navy research and development bureaucracy, perform the development function was in conflict with navy operational requirements and routines and (2) the technology itself was either inappropriate or perceived by operational experts to be inappropriate for the tasks of the organization. Finally, this article suggests those obstacles that must be overcome to successfully introduce state-of-the-art computing technology into any organization.",

As an example of this approach, a prototype coupled expert system, the bridge truss expert (BTExpert), is presented for optimum design of bridge trusses subjected to moving loads. BTExpert was developed by interfacing an interactive optimization program developed in Fortran 77 to an expert system shell developed in Pascal. This new generation of expert systems-embracing various advanced technologies such as AI (machine intelligence), the numeric optimization technique, and interactive computer graphics -- should find enormous practical implications.",

These programs typically perform computational functions such as simulation modeling; dynamic analyzing; and optimizing in support of the preliminary design, the detailed design, and the test. Design analysis of the product requires that these computer programs be integrated in a specific sequence in terms of their input and output data and order of execution. Because of the complexity of the interrelationships among the programs, numerous delays and errors occur during their integration. These delays and errors can increase costs, cause scheduling crises, and reduce design quality. However, the problem-solving knowledge required to perform the integration function can be formalized in an expert system that “understands” the objectives of the analyst and executes all programs necessary to produce the desired design analysis.

Procedures for treating probabilistic evidence are presented, which include the effects of statistical dependence. Confidence limits are defined as being proportional to root-mean-square errors in estimates, and a method is outlined that allows the confidence limits in the probability estimate of the hypothesis to be expressed in terms of the confidence limits in the estimate of the evidence. Procedures are outlined for weighting and combining multiple reports that pertain to the same item of evidence. The illustrative examples apply to tactical data fusion, but the same probability procedures can be applied to other expert systems.",

This article uses two example robotics problems to illustrate these themes. We show how the robot obstacle-detection problem can motivate learning neural networks and Bayesian networks. We also show how the robot-localization problem can motivate learning how to build complete solutions based on particle filtering. Since these lessons can be replicated on many low-cost robot platforms they are accessible to a broad population of AI students. We hope that by outlining our educational exercises and providing pointers to additional resources we can help reduce the effort expended by other educators.

The evaluation findings about the class integration show that the chatting function has been improved and frequently utilized by users, and the application of the CSIEC system on English instruction can motivate learners to practice English and enhance their learning process.

The broadening availability of molecular diagnostics and electronic medical records presents both opportunities and challenges to apply AI techniques to personalize and improve cancer treatment. We discuss these in the context of Cancer Commons, a “rapid learning” community where patients, physicians, and researchers collect and analyze the molecular and clinical data from every cancer patient and use these results to individualize therapies. Research opportunities include adaptively planning and executing individual treatment experiments across the whole patient population, inferring the causal mechanisms of tumors, predicting drug response in individuals, and generalizing these findings to new cases. The goal is to treat each patient in accord with the best available knowledge and to continually update that knowledge to benefit subsequent patients.

    "abstract": "Recommender systems have been part of the Internet for almost two decades. Dozens of vendors have built recommendation technologies and taken them to market in two waves, roughly aligning with the web 1.0 and 2.0 revolutions. Today recommender systems are found in a multitude of online services. They have been developed using a variety of techniques and user interfaces. They have been nurtured with millions of users' explicit and implicit preferences (most often with their permission). Frequently they provide relevant recommendations that increase the revenue or user engagement of the online services that operate them. However, when we evaluate the current generation of recommender systems from the point of view of the “recommendee,” we find that most recommender systems serve the goals of the business instead of their users' interests. Thus we believe that the big promise of recommender systems has yet to be fulfilled. We foresee a third wave of recommender systems that act directly on behalf of their users across a range of domains instead of acting as a sales assistant. We also predict that such new recommender systems will better deal with information overload, take advantage of contextual clues from mobile devices, and utilize the vast information and computation stores available through cloud‐computing services to maximize users' long‐term goals.",

The defender must detect all possible threats at all times from all attackers and defend all systems against all possible exploitation. In contrast, an attacker needs only to find a single path to the defender's critical information. In this article, we discuss how this asymmetry can be rebalanced using cyber deception to change the attacker's perception of the network environment, and lead attackers to false beliefs about which systems contain critical information or are critical to a defender's computing infrastructure. We introduce game theory concepts and models to represent and reason over the use of cyber deception by the defender and the effect it has on attacker perception. Finally, we discuss techniques for combining artificial intelligence algorithms with game theory models to estimate hidden states of the attacker using feedback through payoffs to learn how best to defend the system using cyber deception. It is our opinion that adaptive cyber deception is a necessary component of future information systems and networks. The techniques we present can simultaneously decrease the risks and impacts suffered by defenders and dramatically increase the costs and risks of detection for attackers. Such techniques are likely to play a pivotal role in defending national and international security concerns.",

My objective was to investigate whether the quality of the documentation is the same for industry and academic research or if differences actually exist. My hypothesis is that industry and academic research presented at top artificial intelligence conferences is equally well documented. A total of 325 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence and Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence research papers reporting empirical studies have been surveyed. Of these, 268 were conducted by academia, 47 were collaborations, and 10 were conducted by the industry. A set of 16 variables, which specifies how well the research is documented, was reviewed for each paper and each variable was analyzed individually. Three reproducibility metrics were used for assessing the documentation quality of each paper. The findings indicate that academic research does score higher than industry and collaborations on all three reproducibility metrics. Academic research also scores highest on 15 out of the 16 surveyed variables. The result is statistically significant for 3 out of the 16 variables, but none of the reproducibility metrics. The conclusion is that the results are not statistically significant, but still indicate that my hypothesis probably should be refuted. This is surprising, as the conferences use double‐blind peer review and all research is judged according to the same standards.",

    "abstract": "As NASA explores destinations beyond the moon, the distance between Earth and spacecraft will increase communication delays between astronauts and the Mission Control Center (MCC). Today, astronauts coordinate with MCC to request assistance and await approval to perform tasks. Many of these coordination tasks require multiple exchanges of information, (for example, taking turns). In the presence of long communication delays, the length of time between turns may lead to inefficiency or increased mission risk. Future astronauts will need software‐based decision aids to enable them to work autonomously from the Mission Control Center. These tools require the appropriate combination of mission operations functions, for example, automated planning and fault management, troubleshooting recommendations, easy‐to‐access information, and just‐in‐time training. Ensuring that these elements are properly designed and integrated requires an integrated human factors approach. This article describes a recent demonstration of autonomous mission operations using a novel software‐based decision aid on board the International Space Station. We describe how this new technology changes the way astronauts coordinate with MCC, and how the lessons learned from these early demonstrations will enable the operational autonomy needed to ensure astronauts can safely journey to Mars, and beyond.",

In the United States there is an operational network of weather radars providing freely accessible data for monitoring meteorological phenomena in the atmosphere.

Archived data from the WSR‐88D network of U.S. weather radars hold valuable and detailed information about the continent‐scale migratory movements of birds over the last 20 years. However, significant technical challenges must be overcome to understand this information and harness its potential for science and conservation.

    "abstract": "The development of problem solvers for configuration tasks is one of the most successful and mature application areas of artificial intelligence. The provision of tailored products, services, and systems requires efficient engineering and design processes where configurators play a crucial role. Because one of the core competencies of Siemens is to provide such highly engineered and customized systems, ranging from solutions for medium‐sized and small businesses up to huge industrial plants, the efficient implementation and maintenance of configurators are important goals for the success of many departments. For more than 25 years the application of constraint‐based methods has proven to be a key technology in order to realize configurators at Siemens. This article summarizes the main aspects and insights we have gained looking back over this period. In particular, we highlight the main technology factors regarding knowledge representation, reasoning, and integration that were important for our achievement. Finally we describe selected key application areas where the business success vitally depends on the high productivity of configuration processes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Calls for Ethical AI have become urgent and pervasive, especially as ethical issues surrounding AI products at tech companies are increasingly scrutinized by the public. Yet even after a first wave of responses to these calls coalesced around Ethical AI principles to guide decision‐making and a second wave generated technical tools to mitigate specific ethical issues, multiple lines of evidence indicate that these Ethical AI principles and technical tools have only a limited impact on the daily practices of AI users and producers. In other words, there is a big gap between what we publish in academic papers and what AI creators need to generate AI products that reflect society's values. Ethical AI is by no means the only field to have this problem. However, when medical and ecology fields documented similar gaps between their fields’ scientific discoveries and the practices and products that people actually use, they invested tremendous resources into subfields that developed evidence about how to translate what was done in the lab to adopted solutions. I argue in this commentary that it is our research community's moral duty to invest in our own subfield of “Translational Ethical AI” that will determine how best to ensure AI practitioners can implement the Ethical AI technical tools we publish in academic venues in production settings. Further, I offer concrete steps for doing that, drawing on insights gleaned from other translational fields. Closing the “Ethical AI Publication‐to‐Practice gap” will be a considerable transdisciplinary challenge, but one of the AI research community has the unique expertise, political leverage, and moral responsibility to tackle.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent years have witnessed a rocketing growth of machine learning methods on graph data, especially those powered by effective neural networks. Despite their success in different real‐world scenarios, the majority of these methods on graphs only focus on predictive or descriptive tasks, but lack consideration of causality. Causal inference can reveal the causality inside data, promote human understanding of the learning process and model prediction, and serve as a significant component of artificial intelligence (AI). An important problem in causal inference is causal effect estimation, which aims to estimate the causal effects of a certain treatment (e.g., prescription of medicine) on an outcome (e.g., cure of disease) at an individual level (e.g., each patient) or a population level (e.g., a group of patients). In this paper, we introduce the background of causal effect estimation from observational data, envision the challenges of causal effect estimation with graphs, and then summarize representative approaches of causal effect estimation with graphs in recent years. Furthermore, we provide some insights for future research directions in related area. Link to video abstract: https://youtu.be/BpDPOOqw‐ns",

The institute's research has three complementary strands. First, the institute creates narrative‐centered learning environments that generate interactive story‐based problem scenarios to elicit rich communication, encourage coordination, and spark collaborative creativity. Second, the institute creates virtual embodied conversational agent technologies with multiple modalities for communication (speech, facial expression, gesture, gaze, and posture) to support student learning. Embodied conversational agents are driven by advances in natural language understanding, natural language generation, and computer vision. Third, the institute is creating an innovative multimodal learning analytics framework that analyzes parallel streams of multimodal data derived from students’ conversations, gaze, facial expressions, gesture, and posture as they interact with each other, with teachers, and with embodied conversational agents. Woven throughout the institute's activities is a strong focus on ethics, with an emphasis on creating AI‐augmented learning that is deeply informed by considerations of fairness, accountability, transparency, trust, and privacy. The institute emphasizes broad participation and diverse perspectives to ensure that advances in AI‐augmented learning address inequities in STEM. The institute brings together a multistate network of universities, diverse K‐12 school systems, science museums, and nonprofit partners. Key to all of these endeavors is an emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion.",

However, the process of identifying and manufacturing such molecules has remained slow and highly specialist dependent. Interfacing the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and synthetic organic chemistry has the potential to powerfully address both limitations. The Molecule Maker Lab Institute (MMLI) brings together a team of chemists, engineers, and AI‐experts from the University of Illinois Urbana‐Champaign (UIUC), Pennsylvania State University, and the Rochester Institute of Technology, with the goal of accelerating the discovery, synthesis and manufacture of complex organic molecules. Advanced AI and machine learning (ML) methods are deployed in four key thrusts: (1) AI‐enabled synthesis planning, (2) AI‐enabled catalyst development, (3) AI‐enabled molecule manufacturing, and (4) AI‐enabled molecule discovery. The MMLI's new AI‐enabled synthesis platform integrates chemical and enzymatic catalysis with literature mining and ML to predict the best way to make new molecules with desirable biological and material properties. The MMLI is transforming chemical synthesis and generating use‐inspired AI advances. Simultaneously, the MMLI is also acting as a training ground for the next generation of scientists with combined expertise in chemistry and AI. Outreach efforts aimed toward high school students and the public are being used to show how AI‐enabled tools can help to make chemical synthesis accessible to nonexperts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Understanding and correcting algorithmic bias in artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly important, leading to a surge in research on AI fairness within both the AI community and broader society. Traditionally, this research operates within the constrained supervised learning paradigm, assuming the presence of class labels, independent and identically distributed (IID) data, and batch‐based learning necessitating the simultaneous availability of all training data. However, in practice, class labels may be absent due to censoring, data is often represented using non‐IID graph structures that capture connections among individual units, and data can arrive and evolve over time. These prevalent real‐world data representations limit the applicability of existing fairness literature, which typically addresses fairness in static and tabular supervised learning settings. This paper reviews recent advances in AI fairness aimed at bridging these gaps for practical deployment in real‐world scenarios. Additionally, opportunities are envisioned by highlighting the limitations and significant potential for real applications.",

Progress has been facilitated by the availability of commercial KDD tools for both generic discovery and domain-specific applications such as marketing. At the same time, progress has been slowed by problems such as lack of statistical rigor, overabundance of patterns, and poor integration.

    "abstract": "We describe an AI system (CTSHIV) that connects the scientific AIDS literature describing specific human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug resistances directly to the customized treatment strategy of a specific HIV patient. Rules in the CTSHIV knowledge base encode knowledge about sequence mutations in the HIV genome that have been found to result in drug resistance to the HIV virus. Rules are applied to the actual HIV sequences of the virus strains infecting the specific patient undergoing clinical treatment to infer current drug resistance. A rule-directed search through mutation sequence space identifies nearby drug-resistant mutant strains that might arise. The possible combination drug-treatment regimens currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are considered and ranked by their estimated ability to avoid identified current and nearby drug-resistant mutants. The highest-ranked treatments are recommended to the attending physician. The result is more precise treatment of individual HIV patients and a decreased tendency to select for drug-resistant genes in the global HIV gene pool. Initial results from a small human clinical trial are encouraging, and further clinical trials are planned. From an AI viewpoint, the case study demonstrates the extensibility of knowledge-based systems because it illustrates how existing encoded knowledge can be used to support new knowledge-based applications that were unanticipated when the original knowledge was encoded.",

The SKICAT system automates the reduction and analysis of the three terabytes worth of images, expected to contain on the order of 2 billion sky objects. For the primary scientific analysis of these data, it is necessary to detect, measure, and classify every sky object. SKICAT integrates techniques for image processing, classification learning, database management, and visualization. The learning algorithms are trained to classify the detected objects and can classify objects too faint for visual classification with an accuracy level exceeding 90 percent. This accuracy level increases the number of classified objects in the final catalog threefold relative to the best results from digitized photographic sky surveys to date. Hence, learning algorithms played a powerful and enabling role and solved a difficult, scientifically significant problem, enabling the consistent, accurate classification and the ease of access and analysis of an otherwise unfathomable data set.",

This evolution starts from systems in which a character presents information content in the style of a TV presenter. It moves on with the introduction of presentation teams that convey information to the user by performing role plays. To explore new forms of active user involvement during a presentation, the next step can lead to systems that convey information in the style of interactive performances. From a technical point of view, this evaluation is mirrored in different approaches to determine the behavior of the employed characters. By means of concrete applications, we argue that a central planning component for automated agent scripting is not always a good choice, especially not in the case of interactive performances where the user might take on an active role as well.",

    "abstract": "I report on my experience over the past few years in introducing automated, model-based diagnostic technologies into industrial settings. In partic-ular, I discuss the competition that this technology has been receiving from handcrafted, rule-based diagnostic systems that has set some high standards that must be met by model-based systems before they can be viewed as viable alternatives. The battle between model-based and rule-based approaches to diagnosis has been over in the academic literature for many years, but the situation is different in industry where rule-based systems are dominant and appear to be attractive given the considerations of efficiency, embeddability, and cost effectiveness. My goal in this article is to provide a perspective on this competition and discuss a diagnostic tool, called DTOOL/CNETS, that I have been developing over the years as I tried to address the major challenges posed by rule-based systems. In particular, I discuss three major features of the developed tool that were either adopted, designed, or innovated to address these challenges: (1) its compositional modeling approach, (2) its structure-based computational approach, and (3) its ability to synthesize embeddable diagnostic systems for a variety of software and hardware platforms.",

In the Urban Search and Rescue competition, teams attempted to find victims in a simulated disaster area using teleoperated, semiautomonous, and autonomous robots. The AAAI Robot Challenge is a noncompetitive event where the robots attempt to attend the conference by locating the registration booth, registering for the conference, and then giving a talk to an audience. Finally, the Robot Exhibition is an opportunity for robotics researchers to demonstrate their robots' capabilities to conference attendees. The three days of events were capped by the two Robot Challenge participants giving talks and answering questions from the audience.",

This science seeks to understand how the complete complement of molecular components of living organisms (nucleic acid, protein, small molecules and so on) interact together to form living organisms. Functional genomics is of interest to AI because the relationship between machines and living organisms is central to AI and because the field is an instructive and fun domain to apply and sharpen AI tools and ideas, requiring complex knowledge representation, reasoning, learning, and so on. This article describes two machine learning (inductive logic programming [ILP])-based approaches to the bioinformatic problem of predicting protein function from amino acid sequence. The first approach is based on using ILP as a way of bootstrapping from conventional sequence-based homology methods. The second approach used protein-functional ontologies to provide function classes and a hybrid ILP method to predict function directly from sequence. Both ILP approaches were successful in producing accurate prediction rules that could biologically be interpreted. The work was also of interest to machine learning research because it highlighted the flexibility of ILP systems in dealing with heterogeneous data, the importance of problems where classes are related hierarchically, and problems where examples have more than one functional class.",

The challenge of accounting for both the variety and the commonalities among organisms is met by evolutionary theory; despite controversies, all scientific approaches to understanding life build on a shared core that can briefly be stated. One of the great insights of the last generation of biologists was the chemical instantiation of these evolutionary theories, whose discovery has driven biology toward the study of the structure and function of biological molecules; After an introduction to some of these key molecules and to the central dogma of molecular biology, we can begin to see the outlines of how such molecules can accomplish the tasks required of simple and then more complex life forms. The introduction concludes with a brief account of some of the new instruments and model systems that are now so rapidly advancing scientific understanding of life.",

The mixed-initiative system improved the correctness of the diagnostic process, the speed of the process, and user satisfaction. The tool has been in use since 1999 and has provided more than $50 million in financial benefits by increasing the percentage of questions that could be answered without sending a field service technician to the customers' homes.

Some examples of analog networks are genetic regulatory networks, metabolic networks, neural networks, analog electronic circuits, and control systems. Analog networks are typically complex systems that include nonlinear feedback loops and possess temporal dynamics at different time scales. Both the synthesis and reverse engineering of analog networks are recognized as knowledge‐intensive activities, for which few systematic techniques exist. In this paper we will discuss the general relevance of the analog network concept and describe an evolutionary approach to the automatic synthesis and the reverse engineering of analog networks. The proposed approach is called analog genetic encoding (AGE) and realizes an implicit genetic encoding of analog networks. AGE permits the evolution of human‐competitive solutions to real‐world analog network design and identification problems. This is illustrated by some examples of application to the design of electronic circuits, control systems, learning neural architectures, and the reverse engineering of biological networks.",

A complementary challenge is to understand how to design “rules of encounter” (Rosenschein and Zlotkin 1994) by which to promote simple, robust and beneficial interactions between multiple intelligent agents. This is a natural development, as AI is increasingly used for automated decision making in real‐world settings. As we extend the ideas of mechanism design from economic theory, the mechanisms (or rules) become algorithmic and many new challenges surface. Starting with a short background on mechanism design theory, the aim of this paper is to provide a nontechnical exposition of recent results on dynamic incentive mechanisms, which provide rules for the coordination of agents in sequential decision problems. The framework of dynamic mechanism design embraces coordinated decision making both in the context of uncertainty about the world external to an agent and also in regard to the dynamics of agent preferences. In addition to tracing some recent developments, we point to ongoing research challenges.",

The method used is based on Bayesian principal anomaly, which is a framework for parametric anomaly detection using Bayesian statistics.

In transfer learning, the differences between the source and target problems characterize the transfer distance. CBR can support transfer learning methods in multiple ways. We illustrate how CBR and transfer learning interact and characterize three approaches for using CBR in transfer learning: (1) as a transfer learning method, (2) for problem learning, and (3) to transfer knowledge between sets of problems. We describe examples of these approaches from our own and related work and discuss applicable transfer distances for each.

The need to save energy becomes even greater when considering an electric car, since heavy use of the climate‐control system may exhaust the battery. In this article we consider a method for an automated agent to provide drivers with advice that will motivate them to reduce the energy consumption of their climate‐control unit. Our approach takes into account both the energy consumption of the climate‐control system and the expected comfort level of the driver. We therefore have built two models, one for assessing the energy consumption of the climate‐control system as a function of the system's settings, and the other for modeling the human comfort level as a function of the climate‐control system's settings. Using these models, the agent provides advice to the driver considering how to set the climate‐control system. The agent advises settings that try to preserve a high level of comfort while consuming as little energy as possible. We empirically show that drivers equipped with our agent, which provides them with advice, significantly save energy as compared to drivers not equipped with our agent.",

    "abstract": "For humans and automation to collaborate and perform tasks effectively, all participants need access to a common representation of potentially relevant situational information, or context. This article describes a general framework for building context‐aware interactive intelligent systems that comprises three major functions: (1) capture human‐system interactions and infer implicit context; (2) analyze and predict user intent and goals; and (3) provide effective augmentation or mitigation strategies to improve performance, such as delivering timely, personalized information and recommendations, adjusting levels of automation, or adapting visualizations. Our goal is to develop an approach that enables humans to interact more intuitively and naturally with automation that is reusable across domains by modeling context and algorithms at a higher level of abstraction. We first provide an operational definition of context and discuss challenges and opportunities for exploiting context. We then describe our current work toward a general platform that supports developing context‐aware applications in a variety of domains. We then explore an example use case illustrating how our framework can facilitate personalized collaboration within an information management and decision support tool. Future work includes evaluating our framework.",

In the context of further development of artificial intelligence, state establishment plays a central role in ensuring national security. Countries are tasked with developing legal frameworks for the development and application of AI. Additionally, governments should commit resources to AI research and development to ensure access to cutting‐edge technology. As AI continues to evolve, nation‐building remains crucial for the protection of national security. Countries must shoulder the responsibility of establishing legal structures to supervise the progression and implementation of artificial intelligence. Investing in AI research and development is essential to secure access to cutting‐edge technology. Gracious society and open engagement apply critical impact on forming AI approaches. Civic organizations can contribute to expanding open mindfulness of the related dangers and openings of AI, guaranteeing straightforwardness and responsibility in legislative activities, and pushing for the creation of capable AI approaches. Open interest can help governments in comprehending the yearnings of citizens with respect to AI approaches. This study explores the role and importance of nation‐building in ensuring national security in the context of the development of artificial intelligence. It also examines how civil society and public participation can effectively shape AI policy. The topic offers diverse research and analytical opportunities that enable a deeper understanding of the interactions and mutual influences between statehood and artificial intelligence in the context of ensuring national security. It examines the potential and threats that artificial intelligence poses to national security and considers strategies that countries can adopt to ensure security in this area. Based on the research findings, recommendations and suggestions are made for governments and civil society to improve the effectiveness of public participation in formulating AI policies.",

In this paper, we attempt to address this issue in a parsimonious manner (i.e., achieving greater potential with simpler models). The key is to drive models using domain‐specific knowledge, such as symbols, logic, and formulas, instead of purely relying on scaleup. This approach allows us to build a framework that uses this knowledge as “building blocks” to achieve parsimony in model design, training, and interpretation. Empirical results show that our methods surpass those that typically follow the scaling law. We also demonstrate our framework in AI for science, specifically in the problem of drug‐drug interaction prediction. We hope our research can foster more diverse technical roadmaps in the era of foundation models.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite an extensive body of literature on trust in technology, designing trustworthy AI systems for high‐stakes decision domains remains a significant challenge. Widely used system design guidelines and tools are rarely attuned to domain‐specific trustworthiness principles. In this study, we introduce a design framework to address this gap within intelligence analytic tasks, called the Principles‐based Approach for Designing Trustworthy, Human‐centered AI using the MAST Methodology (PADTHAI‐MM). PADTHAI‐MM builds on the Multisource AI Scorecard Table (MAST), an AI decision support system evaluation tool designed in accordance to the U.S. Intelligence Community's standards for system trustworthiness. We demonstrate PADTHAI‐MM in our development of the Reporting Assistant for Defense and Intelligence Tasks (READIT), a research platform that leverages data visualizations and natural language processing‐based text analysis to emulate AI‐enabled intelligence reporting aids. To empirically assess the efficacy of PADTHAI‐MM, we developed two versions of READIT for comparison: a “High‐MAST” version, which incorporates AI contextual information and explanations, and a “Low‐MAST” version, designed to be akin to inscrutable “black box” AI systems. Through an iterative design process guided by stakeholder feedback, our multidisciplinary design team developed prototypes that were evaluated by experienced intelligence analysts. Results substantially supported the viability of PADTHAI‐MM in designing for system trustworthiness in this task domain. We also explored the relationship between analysts' MAST ratings and three theoretical categories of information known to impact trust: process , purpose , and performance . Overall, our study supports the practical and theoretical viability of PADTHAI‐MM as an approach to designing trustable AI systems.",

Existing methods for simulation‐to‐reality (sim‐to‐real) transfer often rely on high‐fidelity simulations and struggle with broad adaptation, particularly in time‐sensitive scenarios. Although many approaches have shown incredible performance at specific tasks, most techniques fall short when posed with unforeseen, complex, and dynamic real‐world scenarios due to the inherent limitations of simulation. In contrast to current research that aims to bridge the gap between simulation environments and the real world through increasingly sophisticated simulations and a combination of methods typically assuming a small sim‐to‐real gap—such as domain randomization, domain adaptation, imitation learning, meta‐learning, policy distillation, and dynamic optimization—TIAMAT takes a different approach by instead emphasizing transfer and adaptation of the autonomy stack directly to real‐world environments by utilizing a breadth of low(er)‐fidelity simulations to create broadly effective sim‐to‐real transfers. By abstractly learning from multiple simulation environments in reference to their shared semantics, TIAMAT's approaches aim to achieve abstract‐to‐real transfer for effective and rapid real‐world adaptation. Furthermore, this program endeavors to improve the overall autonomy pipeline by addressing the inherent challenges in translating simulated behaviors into effective real‐world performance.",

This paper adopts a design science research (DSR) approach to develop the equity‐aware design thinking for AI (EquiThink4AI) framework, a dual‐component model that systematically embeds equity principles into AI education.

The second component enhances the framework with pedagogical strategies, including problem‐based learning (PBL), experiential learning, and interdisciplinary collaboration, fostering student engagement, real‐world problem‐solving, and ethical reasoning. EquityThink4AI provides educators and students with a structured methodology for teaching and applying equity‐centered AI development.

These courses, however, should not replicate the technical focus typically found in introductory computer science (CS) courses like CS1 and CS2. In this paper, we use an adjustable, interdisciplinary socio‐technical AI literacy framework to design and present an introductory AI literacy course. We present a refined version of this framework informed by the teaching of a 1‐credit general education AI literacy course (primarily for freshmen and first‐year students from various majors), a 3‐credit course for CS majors at all levels, and a summer camp for high school students. Drawing from these teaching experiences and the evolving research landscape, we propose an introductory AI literacy course design framework structured around four cross‐cutting pillars. These pillars encompass (1) understanding the scope and technical dimensions of AI technologies, (2) learning how to interact with (generative) AI technologies, (3) applying principles of critical, ethical, and responsible AI usage, and (4) analyzing implications of AI on society. We posit that achieving AI literacy is essential for all students, those pursuing AI‐related careers, and those following other educational or professional paths. This introductory course, positioned at the beginning of a program, creates a foundation for ongoing and advanced AI education. The course design approach is presented as a series of modules and subtopics under each pillar. We emphasize the importance of thoughtful instructional design, including pedagogy, expected learning outcomes, and assessment strategies. This approach not only integrates social and technical learning but also democratizes AI education across diverse student populations and equips all learners with the socio‐technical, multidisciplinary perspectives necessary to navigate and shape the ethical future of AI.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) poses significant challenges to traditional copyright frameworks, intensifying debates over the copyrightability of AI‐generated outputs. By comparing judicial practices in China and the United States, it has been observed that the United States maintains a conservative stance of adhering to substantive control, while China demonstrates an inclusive approach through the criterion of creative contribution. Building upon this, this article transcends the traditional binary judgment model and constructs a tiered copyright determination model. Based on the level of human control and contribution in the AI generation process, it introduces dimensions such as technological controllability and density of human intent, classifying generative AI into three tiers: strong protection, weak protection, and non‐protection. Regarding the copyrightability of content generated by generative AI, this article argues that the issue should be addressed within the framework of copyright law itself. When human participation is involved and the substantial contribution of the direct user is reflected in the AI‐generated content, meeting the requirements for copyrightable works under copyright law, corresponding protective measures should be granted.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ensuring that AI systems do what we, as humans, actually want them to do is one of the biggest open research challenges in AI alignment and safety. My research seeks to directly address this challenge by enabling AI systems to interact with humans to learn aligned and robust behaviors. The way robots and other AI systems behave is often the result of optimizing a reward function. However, manually designing good reward functions is highly challenging and error‐prone, even for domain experts. Although reward functions are often difficult to manually specify, human feedback in the form of demonstrations or preferences is often much easier to obtain but can be difficult to interpret due to ambiguity and noise. Thus, it is critical that AI systems take into account epistemic uncertainty over the human's true intent. As part of the AAAI New Faculty Highlight Program, I will give an overview of my research progress along the following fundamental research areas: (1) efficiently quantifying uncertainty over human intent, (2) directly optimizing behavior to be robust to uncertainty over human intent, and (3) actively querying for additional human input to reduce uncertainty over human intent.",

In this work, we propose using large language models (LLMs) to learn vulnerability evaluation from historical assessments of medical device vulnerabilities in a single manufacturer's portfolio. We highlight the effectiveness and challenges of using LLMs for automatic vulnerability evaluation and introduce a method to enrich historical data with cybersecurity ontologies, enabling the system to understand new vulnerabilities without retraining the LLM. Our LLM system integrates with the in‐house application—Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS)—to help Siemens Healthineers (SHS) product cybersecurity experts efficiently assess the vulnerabilities in our products. Also, we present a comprehensive set of experiments that helps showcase the properties of the LLM and dataset, the various guardrails we have implemented to safeguard the system in production, and the guidelines for efficient integration of LLMs into the cybersecurity tool.",

People also need to search manually and check whether these programs are suitable for them. To address this issue, our study developed a new generative recommender system with both users' information and government subsidy documents. Within our recommender system framework, we modify the existing Residual Quantization Variational Auto‐Encoder (RQ‐VAE) model to capture deep and abstract information from subsidy documents. Using semantic IDs generated for approximately 185,610 user click‐stream histories and 240,000 documents, we train our recommender system to predict the semantic IDs of the next subsidy policy documents in which a user might be interested. In 2024, we successfully deployed our generative recommender system in Wello, a Korean Gov‐Tech startup. In collaboration with the Korean government, our generative recommender system helped enhance program effectiveness by saving $7.8 million in unused funds and achieved $27.4 million in advertising efficiency gains. Also, Wello observed a 68% improvement in Click‐Through‐Ratio (CTR), increasing from 41.4% in the third quarter of 2024 to 69.6% in the fourth quarter of 2024. We thus anticipate that our generative recommender system will have a significant impact on both individuals and the government.",

This paper presents a comprehensive framework for monitoring, benchmarking, and continuously improving such complex, multi‐component systems under active development by multiple teams. Our approach encompasses three key elements: (1) a hierarchical “severity” framework for incident detection that identifies and categorizes errors while attributing component‐specific error rates, facilitating targeted improvements; (2) a scalable and principled methodology for benchmark construction, evaluation, and deployment, designed to accommodate multiple development teams, mitigate overfitting risks, and assess the downstream impact of system modifications; and (3) a continual improvement strategy leveraging multidimensional evaluation, enabling the identification and implementation of diverse enhancement opportunities. By adopting this holistic framework, organizations can systematically enhance the reliability and performance of their AI Assistants, ensuring their efficacy in critical enterprise environments. We conclude by discussing how this multifaceted approach opens avenues for various classes of enhancements, including human‐AI collaborative evaluation, paving the way for more robust and trustworthy AI systems.",

This idea is almost as old as modern robotics.

Since then, a growing number of domain‐independent model‐based platforms for robot task‐level control have emerged. In this paper, we consider the diverse design choices and issues existing platforms attempt to address, the different solutions proposed so far, and suggest avenues for future development.

    "abstract": "The traditional reliability design methods are imperfect because the designed systems aim at fewer faults, but once a fault happens, the systems might hard fail. To solve this problem, we present a self-maintenance machine (SMM), one that can maintain its functions flexibly even though faults occur. To achieve the capabilities of diagnosing and repair planning, a model-based approach that uses qualitative physics was proposed. Regarding the repair-executing capability, control-type repair strategy was followed. A prototype of the SMM was developed, and it succeeded in maintaining its functions if the structure did not change. However, the prototype revealed the following problems when its reasoning system was used with a commercial product as embedded software: (1) poor performance of the reasoning system, (2) system size that was too large, (3) low adaptability to environmental changes, and (4) roughness of qualitative repair operations. To solve these problems, we proposed new reasoning method based on virtual cases and fuzzy qualitative values. This methodology is one of knowledge compilation, which gives better reasoning performance and can deal with real-world applications such as the SMM. By using this method, we finally developed a commercial photocopier that has self-maintainability and is more robust against faults. The commercial version has been supplied worldwide as a product of Mita Industrial Co., Ltd., since April 1994.",

If automated knowledge-acquisition systems reduce the bottleneck associated with acquiring knowledge bases, how can the bottleneck of building the automated knowledge-acquisition system itself be broken? (2) If the automated knowledge-acquisition system centers on having an effective cognitive model of the key knowledge worker(s), to what extent does this model account for and attempt to influence human bias in knowledge base rule generation? That is, humans are known to be subject to errors and cognitive biases in their judgment processes. How can an automated system critique and influence such biases in a positive fashion, what common patterns exist across applications, and can models of influencing behavior be described and standardized?

We analyze the usefulness of these two approaches by establishing a simple correspondence between the two formalisms. The analysis indicates that planning using nonmonotonic logic comprises two decision-theoretic concepts: probabilities (degrees of belief in planning hypotheses) and utilities (degrees of preference for planning outcomes). We present and discuss examples of the following lessons from this decision-theoretic view of nonmonotonic reasoning: (1) decision theory and nonmonotonic logics are intended to solve different components of the planning problem; (2) when considered in the context of planning under uncertainty, nonmonotonic logics do not retain the domain-independent characteristics of classical (monotonic) logic; and (3) because certain nonmonotonic programming paradigms (for example, frame-based inheritance, nonmonotonic logics) are inherently problem specific, they might be inappropriate for use in solving certain types of planning problems.

In a layered architecture, systems dynamics methods with differential models prevail on the lower, data-intensive levels, but on higher levels, AI-type methods are used. Knowledge about the world is geared to classes of objects and subjects. Subjects are defined as objects with additional capabilities of sensing, data processing, decision making, and control application. Specialist processes for visual detection and efficient tracking of class members have been developed. On the upper levels, individual instantiations of these class members are analyzed jointly in the task context, yielding the situation for decision making. As an application, vertebrate-type vision for tasks in vehicle guidance in naturally perturbed environments was investigated with a distributed PC system. Experimental results with the test vehicle VAMoRs are discussed.",

The method uses a hierarchy of triplet feature invariants, which are at each level defined by a learning procedure. In the feedback learning procedure, percepts are mapped on system states corresponding to manipulation parameters of the object. The method uses a learning architecture with channel information representation. This article discusses how objects can be represented.

The Cell Management Language (CML) combines computational tools from rule-based data systems, object-oriented languages, and new tools that facilitate language processing. These language tools, combined with rule processing, make it convenient to build new interpreters for interfacing and understanding a range of computer and natural languages ; hence, CML is being used primarily to define other languages in an interpretive environment, that is, as a meta-interpreter. For example, in CML it is quite easy to build an interpreter for machine tool languages that can understand and generate new part programs. Once interpreters for different machine and human languages have been constructed, they can be linked together into a system of interpreters. These interpreters can be used to make intelligent decisions for systemwide action planning and diagnostic error recovery. CML is being used in the factory environment to make turbine blade performs and has proven to greatly simplify the task of building complex control systems.",

In the AI community, the dominant model of planning is search. In state-space planning, search consists of backward and forward chaining through the effects and preconditions of operator representations. Although search is an acceptable mechanism to use in performing automated planning, we present an alternative model to present to the user at the interface of a mixed-initiative planning assistant. That is, we propose to model planning as a goal-manipulation task. Here planning involves moving goals through a hyperspace in order to reach equilibrium between available resources and the constraints of a dynamic environment. The users can establish and steer goals through a visual representation of the planning domain. They can associate resources with particular goals and shift goals along various dimensions in response to changing conditions as well as change the structure of previous plans. Users need not know the details of the underlying technology, even when search is used within. This article empirically examines user performance under both the search and the goal-manipulation models of planning and shows that many users do better with the latter.",

Our approach is theoretically justified and compares favorably to manually designed task hierarchies in learning efficiency in the target domain.

A deeper and more adequate understanding of autonomy has evolved in the philosophical literature, specifically in deontological ethics. It teaches that ethics is an internal, not an external, constraint on autonomy, and that a truly autonomous agent must be ethical. It tells us how we can protect ourselves from smart machines by making sure they are truly autonomous rather than simply beyond human control.",

Because of the diversity and dynamics of people's indoor activities, it is important to monitor IAQ for each individual. Most existing airquality sensing systems are stationary or focus on outdoor air quality. In contrast,we propose MAQS, a user‐centered mobile sensing system for IAQ monitoring. MAQS users carry portable, indoor location tracking and IAQ sensing devices that provide personalized IAQ information in real time. To improve accuracy and energy efficiency, MAQS incorporates three novel techniques: (1) an accurate temporal n‐gram augmented Bayesian room localization method that requires few Wi‐Fi fingerprints; (2) an air‐exchange‐rate‐ based IAQ sensing method, which measures general IAQ using only CO 2 sensors; and (3) a zone‐based proximity detection method for collaborative sensing, which saves energy and enables data sharing among users. MAQS has been deployed and evaluated through a real‐world user study. This evaluation demonstrates that MAQS supports accurate personalized IAQ monitoring and quantitative analysis with high energy efficiency. We also found that study participants frequently experienced poor IAQ",

The studies also show that humans react naturally to such signals when used by a robot, without being given any special instructions.

    "abstract": "Today, most of the large-scale conversational AI agents such as Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant are built using manually annotated data to train the different components of the system including automatic speech recognition (ASR), natural language understanding (NLU), and entity resolution (ER). Typically, the accuracy of the machine learning models in these components are improved by manually transcribing and annotating data. As the scope of these systems increase to cover more scenarios and domains, manual annotation to improve the accuracy of these components becomes prohibitively costly and time con-suming. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages customer/system interaction feedback signals to automate learning without any manual annotation. Users of these systems tend to modify a previous query in hopes of fixing an error in the previous turn to get the right results. These reformulations, which are often preceded by defective experiences caused by either errors in ASR, NLU, ER, or the application. In some cases, users may not properly formulate their requests (e.g., providing partial title of a song), but gleaning across a wider pool of users and sessions reveals the underlying recurrent patterns. Our proposed self-learning system automatically detects the errors, generates reformulations, and deploys fixes to the runtime system to correct different types of errors occurring in different components of the system. In particular, we propose leveraging an absorbing Markov Chain model as a collaborative filtering mechanism in a novel attempt to mine these patterns, and coupling it with a guardrail rewrite selection mechanism that reactively evaluates these fixes using feedback friction data. We show that our approach is highly scalable, and able to learn reformulations that reduce Alexa-user errors by pooling anonymized data across millions of customers. The proposed self-learning system achieves a win-loss ratio of 11.8 and effectively reduces the defect rate by more than 30 percent on utterance level reformulations in our production A/B tests. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first self-learning large-scale conversational AI system in production.",

Today, we talk more and more to machines like Apple's Siri, for example, to ask them for the weather forecast. However, when asked for recommendations, for example, for a restaurant to go to, the limitations of such devices quickly become obvious. They do not engage in a conversation to find out what we might prefer, they often do not provide explanations for what they recommend, and they may have difficulties remembering what was said 1 min earlier. Conversational recommender systems (CRS) promise to address these limitations. In this paper, we review existing approaches to building such systems, which developments we observe today, which challenges are still open and why the development of conversational recommenders represents one of the next grand challenges of AI.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) is a promising technology to transform the healthcare industry. Due to the highly sensitive nature of patient data, federated learning (FL) is often leveraged to build models for smart healthcare applications. Existing deployed FL frameworks cannot address the key issues of varying data quality and heterogeneous data distributions across multiple institutions in this sector. In this paper, we report our experience developing and deploying the Contribution‐Aware Federated Learning (CAreFL) framework for smart healthcare. It provides an efficient and accurate approach to fairly evaluate FL participants’ contributions to model performance without exposing their private data, and improves the FL model training protocol by allowing the best performing intermediate sub‐models to be distributed to participants for FL training. Since its deployment by Yidu Cloud Technology Inc. in March 2021, CAreFL has served eight well‐established medical institutions in China to build healthcare decision support models. It can perform contribution evaluations close to three times faster than the best existing approach and has improved the average accuracy of the resulting models by more than 2% compared to the previous system (which is significant in industrial settings). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first CAreFL successfully deployed in the healthcare industry.",

Empirical evaluation of systems in which humans and AI systems act interdependently to accomplish tasks must provide convincing empirical evidence that the work system is learnable and that the technology is usable and useful. We argue that the assessment of human–AI (HAI) systems must be effective but must also be efficient. Bench testing of a prototype of an HAI system cannot require extensive series of large‐scale experiments with complex designs. Some of the constraints that are imposed in traditional laboratory research just are not appropriate for the empirical evaluation of HAI systems. We present requirements for avoiding “unnecessary rigor.” They cover study design, research methods, statistical analyses, and online experimentation. These should be applicable to all research intended to evaluate the effectiveness of HAI systems.",

As such, an accurate prediction of RV is critical for the auto finance industry, since it can pose a risk of revenue loss by over‐prediction or make the financial product incompetent through under‐prediction. Although there are a number of prior studies on training machine learning models on a large amount of used car sales data, we had to cope with real‐world operational requirements such as compliance with regulations (i.e., monotonicity of output with respect to a subset of features) and generalization to unseen input (i.e., new and rare car models). In this paper, we describe how we addressed these practical challenges and created value for our business at Hyundai Capital Services, the top auto financial service provider in Korea.",

Safety assurance goes beyond mere compliance, forming a foundational element in the deployment of LECs to reduce risks and ensure robust operation. In this evolving field, simulations have become an indispensable tool, and fidelity's role as a critical parameter is increasingly recognized. By employing multifidelity simulations that balance the needs for accuracy and computational efficiency, new paths toward comprehensive safety validation are emerging.

Now in its fourth year, our “AI for Georgia” project (AI4GA) has provided PD to 20 teachers and AI education to over 1600 students. The AI4GA curriculum does more than foster AI literacy: It empowers students to view themselves as creators of AI‐powered technology and to think about future career options that involve the use of AI. The project is now expanding to schools in Texas and Florida. In this article, we review the history of the project, discuss our co‐design process with our teachers, and present results from studies of teacher PD and student learning.",

The selection of any one of multiple underway watercraft for patient exchange is complicated by participating aircraft utilization histories and participating watercraft positions and velocities. The selection problem is modeled as a semi‐Markov decision process with an action space, including both fixed land and moving watercraft exchange points. Monte Carlo tree search with root parallelization is used to select optimal exchange points and determine aircraft dispatch times. Model parameters are varied in simulation to identify representative scenarios where watercraft exchange points reduce incident response times. We find that an optimal policy with watercraft exchange points outperforms an optimal policy without watercraft exchange points and a greedy policy by 35% and 40%, respectively. In partnership with the United States Army, we deploy for the first time the watercraft exchange point by executing a mock patient transfer with a manikin between two HH‐60M medical evacuation helicopters and an underway Army Logistic Support Vessel south of the Hawaiian island of Oahu. Both helicopters were dispatched in accordance with our optimized decision strategy.",

Far from a gradual evolution, its sudden emergence has jolted educational institutions, leaving many academics grappling with a perceived encroachment upon their intellectual domain. This upheaval has sparked intense debates, with concerns ranging from the erosion of academic integrity to the devaluation of scholarly labor. This essay contends that such apprehensions, while understandable, may overlook the transformative potential of AI as a collaborative tool. Drawing parallels to historical disruptions—such as the advent of photography challenging traditional art forms—we explore how AI can augment human creativity rather than supplant it. By examining the dynamics of authorship, originality, and accountability, we argue for a redefinition of these concepts in the context of AI‐assisted work. Emphasizing the importance of human oversight in guiding AI outputs, we advocate for a framework that recognizes the symbiotic relationship between human intellect and machine efficiency. Such a perspective not only preserves the essence of academic rigor but also embraces the democratization of knowledge production. Ultimately, this essay calls for a balanced approach that mitigates risks while harnessing the innovative capacities of generative AI in academia.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper extends our previously published work on the virtual AI teacher (VATE) system, presented at IAAI‐25. VATE is designed to autonomously analyze and correct student errors in mathematical problem‐solving using advanced large language models (LLMs). By incorporating student draft images as a primary input for reasoning, the system provides fine‐grained error cause analysis and supports real‐time, multi‐round AI—student dialogues. In this extended version, we introduce a new snap‐to‐solve module for handling low‐reasoning tasks using edge‐deployed LLMs, enabling faster and partially offline interaction. We also include expanded benchmarking experiments, including human expert evaluations and ablation studies, to assess model performance and learning outcomes. Deployed on the Squirrel AI platform, VATE demonstrates high accuracy (78.3%) in error analysis and improves student learning efficiency, with strong user satisfaction. These results suggest that VATE is a scalable, cost‐effective solution with the potential to transform educational practices.",

Our approach is structured around five key pillars: learning from offline data, learning from online feedback, intelligent decision‐making, automated assistants, and responsible AI practices. Through a suite of 12 open‐source libraries, we demonstrate how modular and interoperable tools can collectively enhance scalability, fairness, and explainability in real‐world AI deployments. We further illustrate the impact of this strategy through three enterprise case studies. Finally, we distill a set of best deployment practices to guide organizations in implementing modular, open‐source AI strategies at scale.",

Automation is difficult because the applications include many free-form text fields. MetLife's intelligent text analyzer (MITA) uses the information-extraction technique of natural language processing to structure the extensive textual fields on a life insurance application. Knowledge engineering, with the help of underwriters as domain experts, was performed to elicit significant concepts for both medical and occupational textual fields. A corpus of 20,000 life insurance applications provided the syntactical and semantic patterns in which these underwriting concepts occur. These patterns, in conjunction with the concepts, formed the frameworks for information extraction. Extension of the information-extraction work developed by Wendy Lehnert was used to populate these frameworks with classes obtained from the systematized nomenclature of human and veterinary medicine and the Dictionary of Occupational Titles ontologies. These structured frameworks can then be analyzed by conventional knowledge-based systems. MITA is currently processing 20,000 life insurance applications a month. Eighty-nine percent of the textual fields processed by MITA exceed the established confidence-level threshold and are potentially available for further analysis by domain-specific analyzers.",

To integrate the scheduling expert systems for shipbuilding, we used a hierarchical scheduling architecture. To automate the dynamic spatial layout of objects in various areas of the shipyard, we developed spatial scheduling expert systems. For reliable estimation of person-hour requirements, we implemented the neural network-based person-hour estimator. In addition, we developed the paneled-block assembly shop scheduler and the long-range production planner. For this large-scale project, we devised a phased development strategy consisting of three phases: (1) vision revelation, (2) data-dependent realization, and (3) prospective enhancement. The DAS systems were successfully launched in January 1994 and are actively being used as indispensable systems in the shipyard, resulting in significant improvement in productivity and visible and positive effects in many areas.",

Such new representations need not be wholly new to the history of science; rather, they can draw on useful representational pieces from elsewhere in natural or computer science. This account contrasts with earlier explanations of machine discovery based on the expert system view.

From this analysis, a framework is constructed for viewing the impact of these technologies -- and technologies in general -- as a function of the technology itself; market realities; and personal, organizational, and societal values and policy choices. Two scenarios are proposed with respect to the application of this framework to expert systems. The first concludes that expert systems will have little impact on the nature of work and the organization. The second scenario posits that expert system diffusion will be pulled by, and will be a contributing factor toward, the evolution of the lean, flexible, knowledge-intensive, postindustrial organization.",

Our routines enable virtual humans to map their environment using a realistic model of perception. We based our implementation on a computational framework proposed by Yeap and Jefferies (1999) for representing a local environment as a structure called an absolute space representation (ASR). Their algorithms compute and update ASRs from a 2-1/2-dimensional (2-1/2D) sketch of the local environment and then connect the ASRs together to form a raw cognitive map.1 Our work extends the framework developed by Yeap and Jefferies in three important ways. First, we implemented the framework in a virtual training environment, the mission rehearsal exercise (Swartout et al. 2001). Second, we developed a method for acquiring a 2- 1/2D sketch in a virtual world, a step omitted from their framework but that is essential for computing an ASR. Third, we extended the ASR algorithm to map regions that are partially visible through exits of the local space. Together, the implementation of the ASR algorithm, along with our extensions, will be useful in a wide variety of applications involving virtual humans and agents who need to perceive and reason about spatial concepts in urban environments.",

Case studies to support this perspective are presented by Carnegie Group as a builder of scheduling systems for its customers, by Texas Instruments and Intel Corporation as builders of schedulers for their own use, and by Intellection as a consulting house specializing in scheduling problems.",

    "abstract": "Connectionism challenges a basic assumption of much of AI, that mental processes are best viewed as algorithmic symbol manipulations. Connectionism replaces symbol structures with distributed representations in the form of weights between units. For problems close to the architecture of the underlying machines, connectionist and symbolic approaches can make different representational commitments for a task and, thus, can constitute different theories. For complex problems, however, the power of a system comes more from the content of the representations than the medium in which the representations reside. The connectionist hope of using learning to obviate explicit specification of this content is undermined by the problem of programming appropriate initial connectionist architectures so that they can in fact learn. In essence, although connectionism is a useful corrective to the view of mind as a Turing machine, for most of the central issues of intelligence, connectionism is only marginally relevant.",

However, despite many recent theoretical analyses of the effects of minimax look ahead, however, this phenomenon has still not been convincingly explained. Instead, much attention has been given to so-called pathological behavior, which occurs under certain assumptions. This article supports the view that pathology is a direct result of these underlying theoretical assumptions. Pathology does not occur in practice, because these assumptions do not apply in realistic domains. The article presents several arguments in favor of minimaxing and focuses attention on the gap between their analytical formulation and their practical meaning. A new model is presented based on the strict separation of static and dynamic aspects in practical programs. finally, certain methods of improving minimax look-ahead are discussed, drawing on insights gained from this research.",

Data from many data sources on the web does not contain enough information to link the records accurately using state-of-the-art record-linkage systems.

The data-integration system is able to automatically determine which secondary sources need to be queried when linking records from various data sources.

It is argued that researchers should make their methodological orientations explicit when communicating research results, to increase both the quality of research reports and their comprehensibility for other participants in the field. For a reader of the AI literature, an understanding of the various methodological perspectives will be of immediate benefit, giving a framework for understanding and evaluating research reports.

We describe a new methodology for constructing formal theories in commonsense knowledge domains that complements traditional knowledge representation approaches by first addressing issues of coverage. We show how a close examination of a very general task (strategic planning) leads to a catalog of the concepts and facts that must be encoded for general commonsense reasoning. These concepts are sorted into a manageable number of coherent domains, one of which is the representational area of commonsense human memory. We then elaborate on these concepts using textual corpus-analysis techniques, where the conceptual distinctions made in natural language are used to improve the definitions of the concepts that should be expressible in our formal theories. These representational areas are then analyzed using more traditional knowledge representation techniques, as demonstrated in this article by our treatment of commonsense human memory.",

Typically, AI research (or should be) more concerned with the general form and properties of representational languages and methods than it is with the context being described by these languages. Notable exceptions involve commonsense knowledge about the everyday would ( no other specialty claims this subject area as its own ), and metaknowledge (or knowledge about the properties itself). In these areas AI is concerned with content as well as form. We also observe that the technology that seems to underly peripheral sensory and motor activities (analogous to low-level animal or human vision and muscle control) seems to be quite different from the technology that seems to underly cognitive reasoning and problem solving. Some definitions of AI would include peripheral as well as cognitive processes; here we argue against including the peripheral processes.",

To explore this gap in meaning, we introduce a spectrum of control that characterizes standard approaches to constructing agents and points the way toward agents that can be held responsible. The linchpin that enables agents to control their actions in the “right way” is attention. Broadly construed, attention lets an agent that is responsive to its environment consider the relationships among its actions, goals, and norms while also avoiding distraction. This ability enables strategic norm violations and opens the door to artificial, human‐level agency.",

AI provides methods for fusing and analyzing data to enhance our knowledge of the tactical environment; it provides methods for generating and assessing decision options from multidimensional, complex situations; and it provides predictive analytics to identify and examine the effects of tactical courses of action. Machine learning can improve these processes in an evolutionary manner. Advanced computing techniques can handle highly heterogeneous and vast datasets and can synchronize knowledge across distributed warfare assets. This article presents concepts for applying AI to various aspects of tactical battle management and discusses their potential improvements to future warfare.",

In this article, we review the recently discovered notion of adaptive submodularity, an intuitive diminishing returns condition that generalizes the classical notion of submodular set functions to sequential decision problems. Problems exhibiting the adaptive submodularity property can be efficiently and provably near‐optimally solved using simple myopic policies. We illustrate this concept in several case studies of interest in computational sustainability: First, we demonstrate how it can be used to efficiently plan for resolving uncertainty in adaptive management scenarios. Then, we show how it applies to dynamic conservation planning for protecting endangered species, a case study carried out in collaboration with the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.",

We need AI with such embodied intelligence: transforming raw sensory inputs to rapidly build a rich understanding of the world for seeing, finding, and constructing things, achieving goals, and communicating with others. This problem of physical scene understanding is challenging because it requires a holistic interpretation of scenes, objects, and humans, including their geometry, physics, functionality, semantics, and modes of interaction, building upon studies across vision, learning, graphics, robotics, and AI. My research aims to address this problem by integrating bottom‐up recognition models, deep networks, and inference algorithms with top‐down structured graphical models, simulation engines, and probabilistic programs.",

Specialty crops include a variety of fruits and vegetables, nut trees, grapes, berries, and different types of horticultural crops. In the United States, the specialty crop industry accounts for a multibillion dollar industry with over 300 crops grown just along the U.S. west coast. Specialty crop agriculture presents several unique challenges: they are labor‐intensive, are easily impacted by weather extremities, and are grown mostly on irrigated lands and hence are dependent on water. The AgAID Institute aims to develop AI solutions to address these challenges, particularly in the face of workforce shortages, water scarcity, and extreme weather events. Addressing this host of challenges requires advancing foundational AI research, including spatio‐temporal system modeling, robot sensing and control, multiscale site‐specific decision support, and designing effective human–AI workflows. This article provides examples of current AgAID efforts and points to open directions to be explored.",

Instead of using AI in isolation, AIFS views it as the connective tissue that can bring together interconnected solutions from farm to fork. From guiding molecular breeding and building autonomous robots for precision agriculture, to predicting pathogen outbreaks and recommending personalized diets, AIFS projects aspire to pave the way for infrastructure and systems that empower practitioners to build the food system of the next generation. Workforce education, outreach, and ethical considerations related to the emergence of AI solutions in this sector are an integral part of AIFS with several collaborative activities aiming to foster an open dialogue and bringing closer students, trainees, teachers, producers, farmers, workers, policy makers, and other professionals.",

I synthesize technical and ethical perspectives into a conceptual framework grounded in control theory and philosophy to analyze dynamics. I argue priorities should shift towards capability modulation, participatory design, and advanced modeling to verify enduring alignment.

This perspective article reviews recent interdisciplinary research aimed at facilitating the implementation of the prohibited AI practices outlined in the EU AI Act. It also explores the necessary future efforts to effectively enforce the banning of those prohibited practices across the EU market and the challenges associated with such enforcement. Addressing these future tasks and challenges calls for the establishment of an interdisciplinary governance framework. This framework may contain a workflow that can identify the necessary expertise and coordinate experts’ collaboration at different stages of AI governance. Additionally, it involves developing and implementing a set of compliance and ethical safeguards to ensure effective management and supervision of AI practices.",

Food information is collected manually and automatically. Once collected, food information is organized using tabular data representation schema, symbolic, connectionist or neurosymbolic AI techniques. Once collected, processed, and stored, food information is diffused to different stakeholders using appropriate formats. Even if neurosymbolic AI has shown promising results in many domains, we found that this approach is rarely used in the domain of food information engineering. This paper aims to serve as a good reference for food information engineering researchers. Unlike existing reviews on the subject, we cover all the aspects of food information engineering and we linked the paper to online resources built using Open Research Knowledge Graph. These resources are composed of templates, comparison tables of research contributions and smart reviews. All these resources are organized in the “Food Information Engineering” observatory and will be continually updated with new research contributions.",

This large-scale, case-based, and mixed-initiative planning system, integrated with intensive constraint-based adaptation, utilizes semantic-level metaconstraints and human decisions for compensating incomplete cases imbedding specific planning knowledge. The case- and constraint-based architecture inherently supports cross-checking cases with constraints during system development and maintenance.

An alternative approach allows an automaton to learn to solve problems through iterative trial-and-error interaction with its environment, much as humans do. To solve a problem posed by the environment, the automaton generates a sequence or collection of responses based on its experience. The environment evaluates the effectiveness of this collection, and reports its evaluation to the automaton. The automaton modifies its strategy accordingly, and then generates a new collection of responses. This process is repeated until the automaton converges to the correct collection of responses. The principles underlying this paradigm, known as collective learning systems theory are explained and applied to a simple game, demonstrating robust learning and dynamic adaptivity.",

If a school does not meet assessment goals for two consecutive years, by law the district must offer stu dents the opportunity to transfer to a school that is meeting its goals. Making a choice with such potential impact on a child's future is clearly monumental, yet astonishingly few parents take advantage of the opportunity. Our research has shown that a significant part of the problem arises from issues in information access and information overload, particularly for low socioeconomic status families. Thus we have developed an online, content‐based recommender system, called SmartChoice. It provides parents with school recommendations for individual students based on parents' preferences and students' needs, interests, abilities, and talents. The first version of the online application was deployed and live for focus group participants who used it for the January and March/April 2008 Charlotte‐Mecklenburg school choice periods.

Practitioners often have difficulties in conducting costly and time‐consuming human‐in‐the‐loop studies, so an analytical strategy that helps them determine whether their designs are capturing their planned intent is needed. A traditional top‐down, hypothesis‐driven experiment that examined whether external displays mounted on autonomous cars could effectively communicate with pedestrians led to the conclusion that the displays had no effect on safety. However, by first taking a bottom‐up, data‐driven machine learning approach, those segments of the population that were most affected by the external displays were identified. Then, a hypothesis‐driven, within‐subjects analysis of variance revealed that an external display mounted on an autonomous car that provided the vehicle's speed as opposed to commanding a go/no‐go decision provided an additional 4 feet of safety for early adopters. One caveat to this approach is that the selection of a specific algorithm can significantly influence the results and more work is needed to determine the sensitivity of this approach with seemingly similar machine learning classification approaches.",

Traditional CRO is thus limited to a small fraction of the design space only, and often misses important interactions between the design variables. This article describes Ascend by Evolv, 1 an automatic CRO system that uses evolutionary search to discover effective web interfaces given a human‐designed search space. Design candidates are evaluated in parallel online with real users, making it possible to discover and use interactions between the design elements that are difficult to identify otherwise. A commercial product since September 2016, Ascend has been applied to numerous web interfaces across industries and search space sizes, with up to fourfold improvements over human design.

The main factors that hinder progress in this area are lack of training data and difficulty of automatic evaluation. Thus, to reliably evaluate the quality of such models, one needs to resort to time‐consuming and expensive human evaluation. We tackle these problems by organizing the Conversational Intelligence Challenge (ConvAI) — open competition of dialogue systems. Our goals are threefold: to work out a good design for human evaluation of open‐domain dialogue, to grow open‐source code base for conversational systems, and to harvest and publish new datasets. Over the course of ConvAI1 and ConvAI2 competitions, we developed a framework for evaluation of chatbots in messaging platforms and used it to evaluate over 30 dialogue systems in two conversational tasks — discussion of short text snippets from Wikipedia and personalized small talk. These large‐scale evaluation experiments were performed by recruiting volunteers as well as paid workers. As a result, we succeeded in collecting a dataset of around 5,000 long meaningful human‐to‐bot dialogues and got many insights into the organization of human evaluation. This dataset can be used to train an automatic evaluation model or to improve the quality of dialogue systems. Our analysis of ConvAI1 and ConvAI2 competitions shows that the future work in this area should be centered around the more active participation of volunteers in the assessment of dialogue systems. To achieve that, we plan to make the evaluation setup more engaging.",

Federal administrative agencies such as the Patent Office and Centers for Disease Control routinely do this, as does the United States Congress. More importantly, they make such data freely accessible. Within the United States government, however, the judicial branch is a conspicuous outlier. In theory, federal court records could be used to evaluate the efficiency and fairness of the justice system. In practice, court records are effectively out of reach because they sit behind a government paywall. This financial barrier, along with an equally important myriad of technical obstacles, have forestalled the development of AI‐driven analysis that could enable a systematic understanding and evaluation of the work of the courts. The Systematic Content Analysis of Litigation EventS Open Knowledge Network (SCALES OKN) seeks to address this situation by transforming the transparency and accessibility of court records. The SCALES OKN will potentiate the development of new AI solutions that will benefit the judiciary, legal scholars, and the public.

    "abstract": "Abstract During the past decade, great significant advancements have been witnessed in the domain of automatic product description generation. As the services provided by e‐commerce platforms become diverse, it is necessary to dynamically adapt the patterns of descriptions generated. The selling point of products is an important type of product description for which the length should be as short as possible while still conveying key information. In addition, this kind of product description should be eye‐catching to the readers. Currently, product selling points are normally written by human experts. Thus, the creation and maintenance of these contents incur high costs. These costs can be significantly reduced if product selling points can be automatically generated by machines. In this paper, we report our experience developing and deploying the intelligent online selling point extraction (IOSPE) system to serve the recommendation system in the JD.com e‐commerce platform. In addition, an interactive tool is released for merchants in JD.COM, which additionally allow them to select and customize the selling points with flexibility. Since July 2020, IOSPE has become a core service for 62 key categories of products (covering more than four million products). So far, it has generated more than 0.1 billion selling points, thereby significantly scaling up the selling point creation operation and saving human labor. These IOSPE‐generated selling points have increased the click‐through rate (CTR) by 1.89% and the average duration the customers spent on the products by more than 2.03% compared to the previous practice, which are significant improvements for such a large‐scale e‐commerce platform.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Chatbots, or bots for short, are multimodal collaborative assistants that can help people complete useful tasks. Usually, when chatbots are referenced in connection with elections, they often draw negative reactions due to the fear of mis‐information and hacking. Instead, in this work, we explore how chatbots may be used to promote voter participation in vulnerable segments of society like senior citizens and first‐time voters. In particular, we have built a system that amplifies official information while personalizing it to users' unique needs transparently (e.g., language, cognitive abilities, linguistic abilities). The uniqueness of this work are (a) a safe design where only responses that are grounded and traceable to an allowed source (e.g., official question/answer) will be answered via system's self‐awareness (metacognition), (b) a do‐not‐respond strategy that can handle customizable responses/deflection, and (c) a low‐programming design‐pattern based on the open‐source Rasa platform to generate chatbots quickly for any region.

    "abstract": "Abstract Over the last decade, there has been a remarkable surge in interest in automated crowd monitoring within the computer vision community. Modern deep‐learning approaches have made it possible to develop fully automated vision‐based crowd‐monitoring applications. However, despite the magnitude of the issue at hand, the significant technological advancements, and the consistent interest of the research community, there are still numerous challenges that need to be overcome. In this article, we delve into six major areas of visual crowd analysis, emphasizing the key developments in each of these areas. We outline the crucial unresolved issues that must be tackled in future works, in order to ensure that the field of automated crowd monitoring continues to progress and thrive. Several surveys related to this topic have been conducted in the past. Nonetheless, this article thoroughly examines and presents a more intuitive categorization of works, while also depicting the latest breakthroughs within the field, incorporating more recent studies carried out within the last few years in a concise manner. By carefully choosing prominent works with significant contributions in terms of novelty or performance gains, this paper presents a more comprehensive exposition of advancements in the current state‐of‐the‐art.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In many real‐world applications of AI, the set of actors and tasks are not constant, but instead change over time. Robots tasked with suppressing wildfires eventually run out of limited suppressant resources and need to temporarily disengage from the collaborative work in order to recharge, or they might become damaged and leave the environment permanently. In a large business organization, objectives and goals change with the market, requiring workers to adapt to perform different sets of tasks across time. We call these multiagent systems (MAS) open agent systems (OASYS), and the openness of the sets of agents and tasks necessitates new capabilities and modeling for decision making compared to planning and learning in closed environments. In this article, we discuss three notions of openness: agent openness, task openness, and type openness. We also review the past and current research on addressing the novel challenges brought about by openness in OASYS. We share lessons learned from these efforts and suggest directions for promising future work in this area. We also encourage the community to engage and participate in this area of MAS research to address critical real‐world problems in the application of AI to enhance our daily lives.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As autonomous vehicle technology advances, high‐definition (HD) maps have become essential for ensuring safety and navigation accuracy. However, creating HD maps with accurate annotations demands substantial human effort, leading to a time‐consuming and costly process. Although artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV) algorithms have been developed for prelabeling HD maps, a significant gap remains in accuracy and robustness between AI‐based methods and traditional manual pipelines. Additionally, building large‐scale annotated datasets and advanced machine learning algorithms for AI‐based HD map labeling systems can be resource‐intensive. In this paper, we present and summarize the Tencent HD Map AI (THMA) system, an innovative end‐to‐end, AI‐based, active learning HD map labeling system designed to produce HD map labels for hundreds of thousands of kilometers while employing active learning to enhance product iteration. Utilizing a combination of supervised, self‐supervised, and weakly supervised learning, THMA is trained directly on massive HD map datasets to achieve the high accuracy and efficiency required by downstream users. Deployed by the Tencent Map team, THMA serves over 1000 labeling workers and generates more than 30,000 km of HD map data per day at its peak. With over 90% of Tencent Map's HD map data labeled automatically by THMA, the system accelerates traditional HD map labeling processes by more than tenfold, significantly reducing manual annotation burdens and paving the way for more efficient HD map production.",

The model, a geometric map constructed from sensory data while the robot performs its task, enabled Jeeves to sweep the arena efficiently. It facilitated the retrieval of balls and their delivery at the gate, and it helped to avoid unintended collisions with obstacles.

CARMA uses two knowledge sources for the key task of predicting forage consumption by grasshoppers: (1) cases obtained by asking a group of experts to solve representative hypothetical problems and (2) a numeric model of rangeland ecosystems. These knowledge sources are integrated through the technique of model-based adaptation, in which case-based reasoning is used to find an approximate solution, and the model is used to adapt this approximate solution into a more precise solution. CARMA has been used in Wyoming counties since 1996. The combination of a simple interface, flexible control strategy, and integration of multiple knowledge sources makes CARMA accessible to inexperienced users and capable of producing advice comparable to that produced by human experts. Moreover, because CARMA embodies diverse forms of expertise, it has been used in ways that its developers did not anticipate, including pest management research, development of industry strategies, and in-state and federal pest-management policy decisions.",

This involves solving two problems: determining what sorts of mistakes people make when they reason about plans, and figuring out how to recognize these mistakes when they occur.\r\nThere are sixteen distinct ways that a plan can be improperly constructed. Each of these corresponds to one type of plan-based misconception. But it is not necessary to consider all sixteen classes; the classification can be simplified to ten categories of detectable, distinguishable plan-based misconception. This classification can be used to develop a robust plan recognition algorithm, which is capable of recognizing both correct plans and plans that contain misconceptions. Probabilistic methods can be used to handle the three main difficulties of robust plan recognition: dealing with the hard classes of misconceptions, controlling the combinatorial explosion that results from the ambiguity inherent in faulty plans, and selecting the most likely plan among multiple competing explanations.\r\nThe theory that is developed here is implemented in a program called Pathfinder, which is a probability-based plan recognition system based on the A$\\sp\\*$ best-first search algorithm that has been extended to recognize novel plan failures in an intelligent interface environment.",

In the first experiment, this loop took place at the level of charged carriers moving under the effects of electric fields through abutted regions of doped and undoped semiconductors. Many of the well-known primitive devices were synthesized quickly, such as the MOSFET, Junction Diode, and Bipolar Transistor.

Although we concur with many of Nil's other assertions, this propositional doctrine seems far to extreme: a lot of interesting and important research is done outside of the logic-and theorem- proving paradigm. Indeed, the view that other lines of inquiry serve only to produce tools that may be procedurally attached to an (logic-and-theorem-proving ) architecture seems a kind of Logic Imperialism to those of us they wish to relegate to working in the procedure factories. this dismissal of other avenues of research as not really AI would normally be cause only for knowing shake of the head and a small chuckle, but when such views are promulgated by the President of the AAAI it is time to take up arms against the logic-and-theorem-proving set -- there is a danger that someone might actually take them seriously! This paper, therefore, constitutes an initial salvo over(into?) their bow. We will focus on two central questions in this rebuttal: What is an appropriate research paradigm for AI? What role should logic-like formal languages and deduction play in the study of AI?",

    "abstract": "This article is my personal account on the work at Stanford on Stanley, the winning robot in the DARPA Grand Challenge. Between July 2004 and October 2005, my then-postdoc Michael Montemerlo and I led a team of students, engineers, and professionals with the single vision of claiming one of the most prestigious trophies in the field of robotics: the DARPA Grand Challenge (DARPA 2004). The Grand Challenge, organized by the U.S. government, was unprecedented in the nation's history. It was the first time that the U.S. Congress had appropriated a cash price for advancing technological innovation. My team won this prize, competing with some 194 other teams. Stanley was the fastest of five robotic vehicles that, on October 8, 2005, successfully navigated a 131.6-mile-long course through California's Mojave Desert. This essay is not about the technology behind our success; for that I refer the interested reader to recent articles on the technical aspects of Stanley. Instead, this is my personal story of leading the Stanford Racing Team. It is the story of a team of people who built an autonomous robot in record time. It is also a success story for the field of artificial intelligence, as Stanley used some state of the art AI methods in areas such as probabilistic inference, machine learning, and computer vision. Of course, it is also the story of a step towards a technology that, one day, might fundamentally change our lives.",

    "abstract": "Conducting pilot projects are a common approach among organizations to test and evaluate new technology. A pilot project is often conducted to remove uncertainties from a large‐scale project and should be limited in time and scope. Nowadays, several organizations are testing and evaluating artificial intelligence techniques and more advanced forms of analytics via pilot projects. Unfortunately, many organizations are experiencing problems in scaling‐up the findings from pilot projects to the rest of the organization. Hence, results from pilot projects become siloed with limited business value. In this article, we present an overview of barriers for conducting and scaling‐up data‐driven pilot projects. Lack of senior management support is a frequently mentioned top barrier in the literature. In response to this, we present our recommendations on what type of activities can be performed, to increase the chances of getting a positive response from senior management regarding scaling‐up the usage of artificial intelligence and advanced analytics within an organization.",

ABC is a computing paradigm that has been applied in personal information‐management applications as well as in ubiquitous, multidevice, and interactive surface computing. ABC has emerged as a response to the traditional application‐and file‐centered computing paradigm, which is oblivious to a notion of a user's activity spanning heterogeneous devices, multiple applications, services, and information sources.

To handle volume, we advocate semantic perception that can convert low‐level observational data to higher‐level abstractions more suitable for decision making. To handle variety, we resort to semantic models and annotations of data so that intelligent processing can be done independent of heterogeneity of data formats and media. To handle velocity, we seek to use continuous semantics capability to dynamically create event‐ or situation‐specific models and recognize relevant new concepts, entities and facts. To handle veracity, we explore trust models and approaches to glean trustworthiness. These four of the five v's of big data are harnessed by the semantics‐empowered analytics to derive value to support applications transcending the physical‐cyber‐social continuum.",

    "abstract": "The infrastructure of modern society is controlled by software systems. These systems are vulnerable to attacks; several such attacks, launched by recreation hackers, have already led to severe disruption. However, a concerted and planned attack whose goal is to reap harm could lead to catastrophic results (for example, by disabling the computers that control the electrical power grid for a sustained period of time). The survivability of such information systems in the face of attacks is therefore an area of extreme importance to society. This article is set in the context of self-adaptive survivable systems: software that judges the trustworthiness of the computational resources in its environment and that chooses how to achieve its goals in light of this trust model. Each self-adaptive survivable system detects and diagnoses compromises of its resources, taking whatever actions are necessary to recover from attack. In addition, a long-term monitoring system collects evidence from intrusion detectors, firewalls, and all the selfadaptive components, building a composite trust model used by each component. Self-adaptive survivable systems contain models of their intended behavior; models of the required computational resources; models of the ways in which these resources can be compromised; and finally, models of the ways in which a system can be attacked and how such attacks can lead to compromises of the computational resources. In this article, I focus on computational vulnerability analysis: a system that, given a description of a computational environment, deduces all the attacks that are possible. In particular, its goal is to develop multistage attack models in which the compromise of one resource is used to facilitate the compromise of other, more valuable resources. Although the ultimate aim is to use these models online as part of a self-adaptive system, there are other offline uses as well that we are deploying first to help system administrators assess the vulnerabilities of their computing environment.",

It is remarkable that the research themes revealed by this analysis do not map directly to the subtopics of CBR that might appear in a textbook.

    "abstract": "Traditionally, vehicles have been considered as machines that are controlled by humans for the purpose of transportation. A more modern view is to envision drivers and passengers as actively interacting with a complex automated system. Such interactive activity leads us to consider intelligent and advanced ways of interaction leading to cars that can adapt to their drivers. In this article, we focus on the adaptive cruise control (ACC) technology that allows a vehicle to automatically adjust its speed to maintain a preset distance from the vehicle in front of it based on the driver's preferences. Although individual drivers have different driving styles and preferences, current systems do not distinguish among users. We introduce a method to combine machine‐learning algorithms with demographic information and expert advice into existing automated assistive systems. This method can reduce the interactions between drivers and automated systems by adjusting parameters relevant to the operation of these systems based on their specific drivers and context of drive. We also learn when users tend to engage and disengage the automated system. This method sheds light on the kinds of dynamics that users develop while interacting with automation and can teach us how to improve these systems for the benefit of their users. While generic packages such as Weka were successful in learning drivers' behavior, we found that improved learning models could be developed by adding information on drivers' demographics and a previously developed model about different driver types. We present the general methodology of our learning procedure and suggest applications of our approach to other domains as well.",

Most acute coronary events result from rupture of the protective fibrous cap overlying an atherosclerotic plaque. The task of early identification of plaque types that can potentially rupture is, therefore, of great importance. The state‐of‐the‐art approach to imaging blood vessels is intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT). However, currently, this is an offline approach where the images are first collected and then manually analyzed an image at a time to identify regions at risk of thrombosis. This process is extremely laborious, time consuming, and prone to human error. We are building a system that, when complete, will provide interactive three‐dimensional visualization of a blood vessel as an IVOCT is in progress. The visualization will highlight different plaque types and enable quick identification of regions at risk. In this article, we describe our approach, focusing on machine‐learning methods that are a key enabling technology. Our empirical results using real OCT data show that our approach can identify different plaque types efficiently with high accuracy across multiple patients.",

The competition, which was run for the first time at the 2017 IJCAI conference, aims to provide a simple testbed for diversity‐aware AI where the focus is on integrating independently engineered AI components, while offering a scenario that is challenging enough to test the concept, yet simple enough not to require mastering general commonsense knowledge or natural language understanding.

    "abstract": "One of the major challenges to building intelligent educational software is determining what kinds of feedback to give learners. Useful feedback makes use of models of domain‐specific knowledge, especially models that are commonly held by potential students. To empirically determine what these models are, student data can be clustered to reveal common misconceptions or common problem‐solving strategies. This article describes how analogical retrieval and generalization can be used to cluster automatically analyzed hand‐drawn sketches incorporating both spatial and conceptual information. We use this approach to cluster a corpus of hand‐drawn student sketches to discover common answers. Common answer clusters can be used for the design of targeted feedback and for assessment.",

If we want to understand an event in depth, from multiple perspectives, we need to aggregate multiple sources and understand the relations between them. However, current news aggregators do not offer this kind of functionality. As a step toward a solution, we propose DiversiNews, a real‐time news aggregation and exploration platfom whose main feature is a novel set of controls that allow users to contrast reports of a selected event based on topical emphases, sentiment differences, and/or publisher geolocation. News events are presented in the form of a ranked list of articles pertaining to the event and an automatically generated summary. Both the ranking and the summary are interactive and respond in real time to user's change of controls. We validated the concept and the user interface through user tests with positive results.",

The study of civil unrest is a key topic for political scientists as it helps capture an important mechanism by which citizens express themselves. In countries where civil unrest is lawful, qualitative analysis has revealed that more than 75 percent of the protests are planned, organized, or announced in advance; therefore detecting references to future planned events in relevant news and social media is a direct way to develop a protest forecasting system. We report on a system for doing that in this article. It uses a combination of key‐phrase learning to identify what to look for, probabilistic soft logic to reason about location occurrences in extracted results, and time normalization to resolve future time mentions. We illustrate the application of our system to 10 countries in Latin America: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Results demonstrate our successes in capturing significant societal unrest in these countries with an average lead time of 4.08 days. We also study the selective superiorities of news media versus social media (Twitter, Facebook) to identify relevant trade‐offs.",

    "abstract": "The challenging timeline for DARPA's Orbital Express mission demanded a flexible, responsive, and (above all) safe approach to mission planning. Mission planning for space is challenging because of the mixture of goals and constraints. Every space mission tries to squeeze all of the capacity possible out of the spacecraft. For Orbital Express, this means performing as many experiments as possible, while still keeping the spacecraft safe. Keeping the spacecraft safe can be very challenging because we need to maintain the correct thermal environment (or batteries might freeze), we need to avoid pointing cameras and sensitive sensors at the sun, we need to keep the spacecraft batteries charged, and we need to keep the two spacecraft from colliding … made more difficult as only one of the spacecraft had thrusters. Because the mission was a technology demonstration, pertinent planning information was learned during actual mission execution. For example, we didn't know for certain how long it would take to transfer propellant from one spacecraft to the other, although this was a primary mission goal. The only way to find out was to perform the task and monitor how long it actually took. This information led to amendments to procedures, which led to changes in the mission plan. In general, we used the ASPEN planner scheduler to generate and validate the mission plans. ASPEN is a planning system that allows us to enter all of the spacecraft constraints, the resources, the communications windows, and our objectives. ASPEN then could automatically plan our day. We enhanced ASPEN to enable it to reason about uncertainty. We also developed a model generator that would read the text of a procedure and translate it into an ASPEN model. Note that a model is the input to ASPEN that describes constraints, resources, and activities. These technologies had a significant impact on the success of the Orbital Express mission. Finally, we formulated a technique for converting procedural information to declarative information by transforming procedures into models of hierarchical task networks (HTNs). The impact of this effort on the mission was a significant reduction in (1) the execution time of the mission, (2) the daily staff required to produce plans, and (3) planning errors. Not a single misconfigured command was sent during operations.",

CREWS heavily relies on the use of AI techniques and has been built as a white-box system, in the sense that the planner can perceive what is going on, can interact with the system by proposing alternatives or querying decisions, and can adapt the behavior of the system to changing circumstances. Scheduling can be done in automatic, semiautomatic, or manual mode. CREWS has mechanisms for dealing with the constant changes that occur in input data, can identify the consequences of the change, and guides the planner in accommodating the changes in the already built schedules (rescheduling).",

    "abstract": "In this thesis, I propose a domain-based, integrated framework for program synthesis that emphasizes the reuse of software components and past experience in solving problems. A crucial component of the framework is a concept dictionary that contains a description of domain related components. This forms a basis for communicating with a user in a high-level, application-oriented terms; for constructing generic, problem-solving rules, and for reasoning by analogy. The other components of the framework include a library of reusable subroutines, cliches, and derivation histories of previously solved problems, a layered rulebase, a hierarchical planner, and an analogical reasoner based on Carbonell's derivational analogy paradigm.\r\nThe planner uses the rulebase and the library to decompose a given problem in a top-down manner and synthesize a plan for solving it. The layered structure of the rule-base ensures that efficient plans are preferred over inefficient ones, and the changes needed to synthesize programs for a different domain are minimal. The analogical reasoner complements the role of the planner. It uses a set of heuristics to retrieve a problem from the derivation history library that is analogous to a current problem, and replays the derivation of the retrieved problem to synthesize a program for the current problem. A solved problem is stored back into the derivation history library, and may be used to solve a different problem in a future context.\r\nA prototype system, APU, based on the above framework has been implemented for the domain of UNIX programming. We describe a set of experiments designed to test the performance of APU, and provide empirical results demonstrating the feasibility and usefulness of the approach.",

Developed by Fannie Mae, Custom DU has been used since 2004 by several lenders to automate the underwriting of numerous mortgage products. Custom DU uses rule specification language techniques and a web-based, user-friendly interface for implementing business rules that represent business policy. By means of the user interface, lenders can also customize their underwriting findings reports, test the rules that they have defined, and publish changes to business rules on a real-time basis, all without any software modifications. The user interface enforces structure and consistency, enabling business users to focus on their underwriting guidelines when converting their business policy to rules. Once lenders have created their rules, loans are routed to the appropriate rule sets, and customized, but consistent, results are always returned to the lender. Using Custom DU, lenders can create different rule sets for their products and assign them to different channels of the business, allowing for centralized control of underwriting policies and procedures—even if lenders have decentralized operations.",

Various constraints, such as response time requirements and the limited computing resources available, needed to be considered in this project. Defect finders using large‐scale images are expected to classify weld nuts within 0.2 s with an accuracy rate of over 95%. Our system uses Circular Hough Transform for preprocessing as well as an adjusted VGG (Visual Geometry Group) model. Our convolutional neural network (CNN) system shows an accuracy of over 99% and a response time of about 0.14 s. To embed the CNN model into the factory, we reimplemented the preprocessing modules using LabVIEW and had the classification model server communicate with an existing vision inspector. We share our lessons from this experience by explaining the procedure and real‐world issues developing and embedding a deep learning framework in an existing manufacturing environment without implementing any hardware changes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The adoption of recommender systems in online news personalization has made it possible to tailor the news stream to the individual interests of each reader. Previous research on commercial recommender systems has emphasized their use in large‐scale media houses and technology companies, and real‐world experiments indicate substantial improvements of click rates and user satisfaction. It is less understood how smaller media houses are coping with this new technology, how the technology affects their business models, their editorial processes, and their news production in general. Here we report on the experiences from numerous Scandinavian media houses that have experimented with various recommender strategies and streamlined their news production to provide personalized news experiences. In addition to influencing the content and style of news stories and the working environment of journalists, the news recommender systems have been part of a profound digital transformation of the whole media industry. Interestingly, many media houses have found it undesirable to automate the entire recommendation process and look for approaches that combine automatic recommendations with editorial choices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Autonomous agents acting in the real‐world often operate based on models that ignore certain aspects of the environment. The incompleteness of any given model – handcrafted or machine acquired – is inevitable due to practical limitations of any modeling technique for complex real‐world settings. Due to the limited fidelity of its model, an agent's actions may have unexpected, undesirable consequences during execution. Learning to recognize and avoid such negative side effects (NSEs) of an agent's actions is critical to improve the safety and reliability of autonomous systems. Mitigating NSEs is an emerging research topic that is attracting increased attention due to the rapid growth in the deployment of AI systems and their broad societal impacts. This article provides a comprehensive overview of different forms of NSEs and the recent research efforts to address them. We identify key characteristics of NSEs, highlight the challenges in avoiding NSEs, and discuss recently developed approaches, contrasting their benefits and limitations. The article concludes with a discussion of open questions and suggestions for future research directions.",

We describe the implementation and deployment of a software decision support tool for the maintenance planning of gas turbines, with the goal of reducing the direct maintenance costs and the often costly production losses during maintenance down time. The optimization problem is formally defined, and we argue that the feasibility version is NP‐complete. We outline a heuristic algorithm that can quickly solve the problem for practical purposes and validate the approach on a real‐world scenario based on an oil production facility. We also compare the performance of our algorithm with results from using integer programming and discuss the deployment of the application. The experimental results indicate that down time reductions up to 65 percent can be achieved, compared to traditional preventive maintenance. In addition, the use of our tool is expected to improve availability by up to 1 percent and to reduce the number of planned maintenance days by 12 percent. Compared to an integer programming approach, our algorithm is not optimal but is much faster and produces results that are useful in practice. Our test results and SIT AB's estimates based on operational use both indicate that significant savings can be achieved by using our software tool, compared to maintenance plans with fixed intervals.",

Finally we briefly describe an ongoing extension of our previous work consisting of complementing audio information with information about the gestures of the musician. Music is played through our bodies, therefore capturing the gesture of the performer is a fun‐ damental aspect that has to be taken into account in future expressive music renderings.

    "abstract": "Along with the ever‐growing computational power of mobile devices, mobile visual search has undergone an evolution in techniques and applications. A significant trend is low bit rate visual search, where compact visual descriptors are extracted directly over a mobile and delivered as queries rather than raw images to reduce the query transmission latency. In this article, we introduce our work on low bit rate mobile landmark search, in which a compact yet discriminative landmark image descriptor is extracted by using a location context such as GPS, crowd‐sourced hotspot WLAN, and cell tower locations. The compactness originates from the bag‐of‐words image representation, with offline learning from geotagged photos from online photosharing websites including Flickr and Panoramio. The learning process involves segmenting the landmark photo collection by discrete geographical regions using a Gaussian mixture model and then boosting a ranking‐sensitive vocabulary within each region, with “entropy”‐based feedback on the compactness of the descriptor to refine both phases iteratively. In online search, when entering a geographical region, the code book in a mobile device is downstream adapted to generate extremely compact descriptors with promising discriminative ability. We have deployed landmark search apps to both HTC and iPhone mobile phones, accessing a database of a million scale images in typical areas like Beijing, New York, and Barcelona, and others. Our descriptor outperforms alternative compact descriptors (Chen et al. 2009; Chen et al., 2010; Chandrasekhar et al. 2009a; Chandrasekhar et al. 2009b) by significant margins. Beyond landmark search, this article will summarize the MPEG standarization progress of compact descriptor for visual search (CDVS) (Yuri et al. 2010; Yuri et al. 2011) toward application interoperability.",

Their ability to provide answers to queries quickly is a remarkable testament to the power of many of the fundamental methods of AI.

It has become clear that people think of search programs in ways that are very different from traditional information sources. Rapid and ready‐at‐hand access, depth of processing, and the way they enable people to offload some ordinary memory tasks suggest that search engines have become more of a cognitive amplifier than a simple repository or front end to the Internet. As with all sophisticated tools, people still need to learn how to use them. Although search engines are superb at finding and presenting information — up to and including extracting complex relations and making simple inferences — knowing how to frame questions and evaluate their results for accuracy and credibility remains an ongoing challenge. Some questions are still deep and complex, and still require knowledge on the part of the search user to work through to a successful answer. And the fact that the underlying information content, user interfaces, and capabilities are all in a continual state of change means that searchers need to continually update their knowledge of what these programs can (and cannot) do.",

Using two of the activities as examples, we chart the ups and downs of turn‐taking and other language behaviors along the Fun Curve.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Interactions between individuals and recommender systems can be viewed as a continuous feedback loop, consisting of pre‐consumption and post‐consumption phases. Pre‐consumption, systems provide recommendations that are typically based on predictions of user preferences. They represent a valuable service for both providers and users as decision aids. After item consumption, the user provides post‐consumption feedback (e.g., a preference rating) to the system, often used to improve the system's subsequent recommendations, completing the feedback loop. There is a growing understanding that this feedback loop can be a significant source of unintended consequences, introducing decision‐making biases that can affect the quality of the “ground truth” preference data, which serves as the key input to modern recommender systems. This paper highlights two forms of bias that recommender systems inherently inflict on the “ground truth” preference data collected from users after item consumption: non‐representativeness of such preference data and so‐called “preference pollution,” which denotes an unintended relationship between system recommendations and the user's post‐consumption preference ratings. We provide an overview of these issues and their importance for the design and application of next‐generation recommendation systems, including directions for future research.",

Unfortunately, they often struggle with formulating the questions, further compounded by the burden of having to traverse long documents returned by the search engine to look for reliable answers. To ease these burdens for users, automated consumer health question answering systems try to simulate a human professional by refining the queries and giving the most pertinent answers. This article surveys state‐of‐the‐art approaches, resources, and evaluation methods used for automatic consumer health question answering. We summarize the main achievements in the research community and industry, discuss their strengths and limitations, and finally come up with recommendations to further improve these systems in terms of quality, engagement, and human‐likeness.",

I dreamed of a special kind of computer, which had eyes and ears and arms and legs, in addition to its “brain.” I did not dream that this new computer friend would be a means of making money for me or my employer or a help for my country-though I loved my country then and still do, and I have no objection to making money. I did not even dream of such a worthy cause as helping the poor and handicapped of the world using this marvelous new machine. No, my dream was filled with the wild excitement of seeing a machine act like a human being, at least in many ways. I wanted it to read printed characters on a page and handwritten script as well. I could see it! or a part of it: in a small camera that would fit on my glasses, with an attached earplug that would whisper into my ear the names of my friends and acquaintances as I met them on the street. Or in a telephone that allowed me to converse with a friend in Germany, he in German and me in English. For you see, my computer friend had the ability to recognize faces, synthesize voice, understand spoken sentences, and translate languages, and things like that. 1’11 admit that in 1960 my computer person had a much larger head than I envision for it now. Because I then didn’t know about microcomputers. My dream computer person liked to walk and play Ping-Pong, especially with me. And I liked to teach it things-because it could learn dexterity skills as well as mental concepts. And much more. When I awoke from this daydream, I found that we didn’t have these things, but we did have some remarkable computers, even then, so I decided then and there to quit",

Since the early 1960s, researchers have been building and utilizing computer systems that can translate from one language to another without requiring extensive human intervention. In the late 1990s, Ford Vehicle Operations began working with Systran Software Inc. to adapt and customize its machine-translation technology in order to translate Ford's vehicle assembly build instructions from English to German, Spanish, Dutch, and Portuguese. The use of machine translation was made necessary by the vast amount of dynamic information that needed to be translated in a timely fashion. The assembly build instructions at Ford contain text written in a controlled language as well as unstructured remarks and comments. The MT system has already translated more than 7 million instructions into these languages and is an integral part of the overall manufacturing process-planning system used to support Ford's assembly plants in Europe, Mexico and South America. In this paper, we focus on how AI techniques, such as knowledge representation and natural language processing can improve the accuracy of machine translation in a dynamic environment such as auto manufacturing.",

These systems are trained by the ship crew using Image Knowledge Builder, a ”show and tell” interface that facilitates easy training and validation. Fishers can reinforce the learning anytime when needed. The use of CogniSight has significantly reduced the number of crew members needed on the boats (by up to six persons), and the time at sea has been shortened by 15 percent.

The approach makes it transparent for anyone to build his or her own (micro) search engine by integrating established web search services, desktop search, and topical crawling techniques. The challenge in this model is that each of these agents must learn about its environment—the existence, knowledge, diversity, reliability, and trustworthiness of other agents—by analyzing the queries received from and results exchanged with these other agents. We present the 6S peer network, which uses machine‐learning techniques to learn about the changing query environment. We show that simple reinforcement learning algorithms are sufficient to detect and exploit semantic locality in the network, resulting in efficient routing and high‐quality search results.

Through several examples, we show that, despite ominous portrayals in science fiction, such AI agents with human‐inspired noncompliance abilities have many potential benefits. We present a framework to help categorize and design rebel agents, discuss their social and ethical implications, and assess their potential benefits and the risks they may pose. In recognition of the fact that, in human psychology, noncompliance has profound sociocognitive implications, we also explore sociocognitive dimensions of AI rebellion: social awareness and counternarrative intelligence.",

    "abstract": "With the maturing of artificial intelligence (AI) and multiagent systems research, we have a tremendous opportunity to direct these advances toward addressing complex societal problems. In pursuit of this goal of AI for social impact, we as AI researchers must go beyond improvements in computational methodology; it is important to step out in the field to demonstrate social impact. To this end, we focus on the problems of public safety and security, wildlife conservation, and public health in low‐resource communities, and present research advances in multiagent systems to address one key cross‐cutting challenge: how to effectively deploy our limited intervention resources in these problem domains. We present case studies from our deployments around the world as well as lessons learned that we hope are of use to researchers who are interested in AI for social impact. In pushing this research agenda, we believe AI can indeed play an important role in fighting social injustice and improving society.",

Such systems move away from a fixed factory line executing an unchanging set of operations and toward the goal of an adaptable factory structure. The logical next challenge in this area is that of online reconfigurability. With this capability, machines can reconfigure while running, enable or disable capabilities in real time, and respond quickly to changes in the system or the environment (including faults). We propose an approach to achieving online reconfigurability based on a high level of system modularity supported by integrated, model‐based planning and control software. Our software capitalizes on many advanced techniques from the artificial intelligence research community, particularly in model‐based domain‐independent planning and scheduling, heuristic search, and temporal resource reasoning. We describe the implementation of this design in a prototype highly modular, parallel printing system.",

    "abstract": "Communicating or autonomous systems rely on high‐quality software‐based components. that must be thoroughly verified before they are released and deployed in operational settings. Regression testing is a crucial verification process that compares any new release of a software‐based component against its previous versions, by executing available test cases. However, limited testing time makes selection of test cases in regression testing challenging, and some selection criteria must be respected. Validation engineers usually address this problem, coined as test suite reduction (TSR), through manual analysis or by using approximation techniques. In this paper, we address the TSR problem with sound artificial intelligence techniques such as constraint programming (CP) and global constraints. By using distinct cost‐value‐aggregating criteria, we propose several constraint‐optimization models to find a subset of test cases that cover all the test requirements and optimize the overall cost of selected test cases. Our contribution includes reuse of existing preprocessing rules to simplify the problem before solving it and the design of structure‐aware heuristics that take into account the notion of the costs associated with test cases. The work presented in this paper has been motivated by an industrial application in the communication domain. Our overall goal is to develop a constraint‐based approach of test suite reduction that can be deployed to test a complete product line of conferencing systems in continuous delivery mode. By implementing this approach in a software prototype tool and experimentally evaluating it on both randomly generated and industrial instances, we hope to foster a quick adoption of the technology.",

Previous work in strategic selection of intervention participants does not handle uncertainties in the social network's structure and evolving network state, potentially causing significant shortcomings in spread of information. Thus, we developed PSINET, a decision support system to aid the agencies in this task. PSINET includes the following key novelties: (i) it handles uncertainties in network structure and evolving network state; (ii) it addresses these uncertainties by using POMDPs in influence maximization; and (iii) it provides algorithmic advances to allow high quality approximate solutions for such POMDPs. Simulations show that PSINET achieves ~60% more information spread over the current state-of-the-art. PSINET was developed in collaboration with My Friend's Place (a drop-in agency serving homeless youth in Los Angeles) and is currently being reviewed by their officials.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning approaches have traditionally made strong simplifying assumptions: that a benevolent teacher is available to present and classify instances of a single concept to be learned; that no noise or uncertainty is present in the environment; that a complete and correct domain theory is available; or that a useful language is provided by the designer. Additionally, much existing machine learning research has been done in a piecemeal fashion, addressing subproblems without a uniform conceptual approach to designing intelligent systems. The resulting learning techniques often are only useful for narrowly defined problems, and are so dependent on the underlying assumptions that they do not generalize well--or at all--to complex domains.\r\nscPAGODA (Probabilistic Autonomous GOal-Directed Agent), the intelligent agent design presented in this thesis, avoids making any of the above assumptions. It incorporates solutions to the problems of deciding what to learn, selecting a learning bias, and inductive learning under uncertainty, in an integrated system, based on the principles of probabilistic representation of knowledge, Bayesian evaluation techniques, and limited rationality as a normative behavioral goal. scPAGODA has been implemented and tested in a simulated robot domain, scRALPH (Rational Agent with Limited Performance Hardware).\r\nGoal-Directed Learning (scGDL) allows the agent to decide what to learn, enabling autonomous learning in complex domains. The value of being able to predict various features of the environment is computed using the principles of decision theory. The agent uses the features with highest values as learning goals for building predictive theories.\r\nProbabilistic Bias Evaluation (scPBE) determines the learning bias for each learning goal using probabilistic domain knowledge, an expected learning curve, and a time-preference function to find the expected discounted future accuracy for proposed biases; the best of these biases is used for learning.\r\nTheories are represented as Uniquely Predictive Theories (scUPTs), which consist of restricted sets of conditional probabilities. Probability Combination using Independence (scPCI), a probabilistic inference method which relies on minimal independence assumptions, is applied to the theories to make probabilistic predictions for planning and evaluation. A Bayesian evaluation method is used to determine the best theory to explain the observed data. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)",

A major goal in designing this system was to empower Compaq's customers with expert system technology, allowing them to solve advanced network printer problems entirely on their own. This process minimizes customer down time; reduces the number of telephone calls to the Compaq Customer-Support Center (resulting in monetary savings); improves customer satisfaction; and, perhaps most importantly, differentiates Compaq printers in the market-place by providing the best and most technologically advanced customer-support facility. This approach also represents a reengineering of Compaq's customer-support strategy and implementation. In its first-generation system, SMART, the objective was to provide expert knowledge to Compaq's help-desk operation to better and more quickly answer customer calls and problems. QUICKSOURCE is a second-generation system in that the customer-support function is put directly in the hands of the consumers (an example of knowledge publishing). As a result, its design presented a number of different and challenging issues. Because the product would be used by a diverse and heterogeneous set of users, a significant amount of human factors research and analysis was performed as part of system design and implementation. The analysis also dictated certain decisions about the organization and design of the expert system component. Since September 1992, Compaq has shipped more than 3000 copies of QUICKSOURCE.",

U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) is the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) agency responsible for evacuating patients during wartime and peace. Doctrinally, patients requiring extended treatment must be evacuated by air to a suitable medical treatment facility. The Persian Gulf War was the first significant armed conflict in which this concept was put to a serious test. The results were far from satisfactory -- about 60 percent of the patients ended up at the wrong destinations. In early 1993, the DoD tasked USTRANSCOM to consolidate the command and control of medical regulation and aeromedical evacuation operations. The ensuing analysis led to TRAC2ES (TRANSCOM regulating and command and control evacuation system), a decision support system for planning and scheduling medical evacuation operations. Probably the most challenging aspect of the problem has to do with the dynamics of a domain in which requirements and constraints continuously change over time. Continuous dynamic replanning is a key capability of TRAC2ES. This article describes the application and the AI approach we took in providing this capability.",

Of particular concern are problems encountered when a slurry is formulated with one cement sample and used with a batch having different properties. Such variability imposes a heavy burden on performance testing and is often a major factor in operational failure. We describe methods that allow the identification, characterization, and prediction of the variability of oil-field cements. Our approach involves predicting cement compositions, particle-size distributions, and thickening-time curves from the diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectrum of neat cement powders. Predictions make use of artificial neural networks. Slurry formulation thickening times can be predicted with uncertainties of less than 10 percent. Composition and particle-size distributions can be predicted with uncertainties a little greater than measurement error, but general trends and differences between cements can be determined reliably. Our research shows that many key cement properties are captured within the Fourier transform infrared spectra of cement powders and can be predicted from these spectra using suitable neural network techniques. Several case studies are given to emphasize the use of these techniques, which provide the basis for a valuable quality control tool now finding commercial use in the oil field.",

Given observed data about a particular chemical reaction, discover the underlying set of reaction steps from starting materials to products, i.e., elucidate the reaction pathway.\r\nThe automated system for pathway elucidation-- scMECHEM--consists of: (1) a hypothesis-formation program scSTOICH, which generates pathway hypotheses based on data commonly available to the chemist, (2) heuristics for design of experiments and for seeking evidence non-experimentally, and (3) a set of programs for applying evidence of different natures to (dis)confirm hypotheses. The major contributions of this thesis are as follows: (1) A system that forms confirmed, explanatory theories about dynamic processes by conjecturing unseen entities in a justified manner. (2) A systematic derivation of Hans Krebs's discovery of the urea pathway using his same data, complementing (Kulkarni and Simon, 1988) 's previous cognitive model of that discovery.

    "abstract": "The TRW Defense Systems Group develops large man-machine networks that solve problems for government agencies. Until a few years ago these networks were either tightly-coupled humans loosely supported by machines -- like our ballistic missile system engineering organization, which provides technical advice to the Air Force, or tightly-coupled machines loosely controlled by humans- like the ground station for the NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System. Because we have been producing first-of- a kind systems like these since the early 1950s, we consider ourselves leaders in the social art of assembling effective teams of diverse experts, and in the engineering art of conceiving and developing networks of interacting machines. But in the mid-1970s we began building systems in which humans and machines must be tightly coupled to each other-systems like the Sensor Data Fusion Center. Then we found that our well-worked system development techniques did not completely apply, and that our system engineering handbook needed a new chapter on communication between people and machines. We're still writing that chapter, and it won't be finished until we can add some not-yet fully developed artificial intelligence techniques. Nevertheless, we learned some lessons worth passing along.",

This report is derived from the IJCAI panel titled U.S and Japanese Cooperation in AI and R&D Opportunities, held August 23, 1986 at the University of California at Los Angeles. This panel discussed the sensitive topic of alternatives to nationalistic competitive strategies that have contributed to an extreme trade deficit surpassing $40 billion in 1986. The ideas offered by the panelists shed light on ways our countries' respective scientific communities can blend talents to achieve the best results in reducing trade frictions. Each country has designated AI research as a key to unlock years of generations of technology and has directed billions of dollars to fund this development. The most recognized projects are the U.S. Microelectronics Technology Computer Consortium (MCC) and Japan's Fifth Generation Computer Project (ICOT). Although noting the obstacles, the panelists encouraged specific, shared efforts to ensure the development of a closer working relationship to explore AI's benefits.",

    "abstract": "The RoboCup Rescue Physical Agent League Competition was held in the summer of 2001 in conjunction with the AAAI Mobile Robot Competition Urban Search and Rescue event, eerily preceding the September 11 World Trade Center (WTC) disaster. Four teams responded to the WTC disaster through the auspices of the Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue (CRASAR), directed by John Blitch. The four teams were Foster- Miller and iRobot (both robot manufacturers from the Boston area), the United States Navy's Space Warfare Center (SPAWAR) group from San Diego, and the University of South Florida (USF). Blitch, through his position as program manager for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Tactical Mobile Robots Program, was a supporter of the competition; he also served as a member of the rules committee and a judge. USF participated by chairing the rules committee, judging, assisting with the logistics, providing commentary, and demonstrating tethered and wireless robots whenever entrants had to skip around during the competition. Based on our experiences and history, we were asked to comment on the validity of the competition. The CRASAR collective experience suggests that most of the basic rules of the competition matched reality because the rules accurately reflected deployment scenarios, but the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Test Course, and hardware or software approaches forwarded by competitors in last summer's event, missed the mark. This article briefly reviews the types of robots and missions used by CRASAR at the WTC site, then discusses the robotassisted search and rescue effort in terms of lessons for the competition.",

The algorithms described here are not specific to this particular shell and can be applied to many rule-based systems. The computer program, which we call CHECK, combines logical principles as well as specific information about the knowledge representation formalism of LES. The program checks both goal-driven and data-driven rules. CHECK identifies inconsistencies in the knowledge base by looking for redundant rules, conflicting rules, subsumed rules, unnecessary IF conditions, and circular rule chains. Checking for completeness is done by looking for unreferenced attribute values, illegal attribute values, dead-end IF conditions, dead-end goals and unreachable conclusions. These conditions can be used to suggest missing rules and gaps in the knowledge base. The program also generates a chart that shows the dependencies among the rules. CHECK can help the knowledge engineer detect many programming errors even before the knowledge base testing phase. It also helps detect gaps in the knowledge base testing phase. It also helps detect gaps in the knowledge base that the knowledge engineer and the expert have overlooked. A wide variety of knowledge bases have been analyzed using CHECK.",

    "abstract": "Choosing an environment is an important decision for agent developers. A key issue in this decision is whether the environment will provide realistic problems for the agent to solve, in the sense that the problems are true to the issues that arise in addressing a particular research question. In addition to realism, other important issues include how tractable problems are that can be formulated in the environment, how easy agent performance can be measured, and whether the environment can be customized or extended for specific research questions. In the ideal environment, researchers can pose realistic but tractable problems to an agent, measure and evaluate its performance, and iteratively rework the environment to explore increasingly ambitious questions, all at a reasonable cost in time and effort. As might be expected, trade-offs dominate the suitability of an environment; however, we have found that the modern graphic user interface offers a good balance among these trade-offs. This article takes a brief tour of agent research in the user interface, showing how significant questions related to vision, planning, learning, cognition, and communication are currently being addressed.",

Most RADAR agents observe experts performing tasks and then assist other users who are performing similar tasks. The interaction design for RADAR focused on developing user interfaces that allowed the intelligent functionality to improve the user's workflow without frustrating the user when the system's suggestions were either unhelpful or simply incorrect. For example, with regard to autonomy, the RADAR agents were allowed much flexibility in selecting ways to assist the user but were restricted from taking actions that would be visible to other people. This policy ensured that the user remained in control and mitigated the negative effects of mistakes. A large evaluation of RADAR demonstrated that novice users confronted with an e‐mail overload test performed significantly better, achieving a 37 percent better overall score when assisted by RADAR. The evaluation showed that AI technologies can help users accomplish their goals.",

The displays are built on an adaptive, unsupervised model of the organization and its relationships developed using dimensionality reduction and commonsense knowledge that automatically classifies and organizes the information. The GI is currently in daily use at the lab. We discuss the AI model's development, the integration of AI into a human‐computer interaction (HCI) interface, and the use of the GI during the lab's peak visitor periods.

    "abstract": "Emergency response (ER) workers perform extremely demanding physical and cognitive tasks that can result in serious injuries and loss of life. Human augmentation technologies have the potential to enhance physical and cognitive work-capacities, thereby dramatically transforming the landscape of ER work, reducing injury risk, improving ER, as well as helping attract and retain skilled ER workers. This opportunity has been significantly hindered by the lack of high-quality training for ER workers that effectively integrates innovative and intelligent augmentation solutions. Hence, new ER learning environments are needed that are adaptive, affordable, accessible, and continually available for reskilling the ER workforce as technological capabilities continue to improve. This article presents the research considerations in the design and integration of use-inspired exoskeletons and augmented reality technologies in ER processes and the identification of unique cognitive and motor learning needs of each of these technologies in context-independent and ER-relevant scenarios. We propose a human-centered artificial intelligence (AI) enabled training framework for these technologies in ER. Finally, how these human-centered training requirements for nascent technologies are integrated in an intelligent tutoring system that delivers across tiered access levels, covering the range of virtual, to mixed, to physical reality environments, is discussed.",

HR and talent professionals have difficulty identifying and communicating requirements, especially for new jobs and roles, while college continuing education (CE) and professional development offices have difficulty understanding and responding to company needs. This article describes an NSF Convergence Accelerator project called SkillSync ™ in which multiple forms of AI are used to address this specific problem and provide national efforts (e.g., the US Chamber of Commerce Talent Pipeline Management initiative) with skills data and skills alignment services. Skillsync uses variations on the Siamese Multi‐depth Transformer‐based Hierarchical Encoder (SMITH) and other natural language understanding methods to map job descriptions and course information to skills taxonomies, uses machine‐learned models to align skills needs with learning outcomes and training, and incorporates an intelligent coach based on Georgia Tech's Jill Watson “virtual teaching assistant” to answer questions about Skillsync's vocabulary, functionality, and process. This article describes these AI methods, how these methods are used in Skillsync, and the challenges involved.",

The research objectives of AI‐EDGE are twofold: “AI for Networks” and “Networks for AI.” The former develops new foundational AI techniques to revolutionize technologies for next‐generation edge networks, while the latter develops advanced networking techniques to enhance distributed and interconnected AI capabilities at edge devices. These research investigations are conducted across eight symbiotic thrust areas that work together to address the main challenges towards those goals. Such a synergistic approach ensures a virtuous research cycle so that advances in one area will accelerate advances in the other, thereby paving the way for a new generation of networks that are not only intelligent but also efficient, secure, self‐healing, and capable of solving large‐scale distributed AI challenges. This paper also outlines the institute's endeavors in education and workforce development, as well as broadening participation and enforcing collaboration.",

At the same time, the content and viewpoints contained within news recommendations are driven by multiple factors, including both personalization and editorial selection. Explanations could help users gain a better understanding of the factors contributing to the news items selected for them to read. Indeed, recent works show that explanations are essential for users of news recommenders to understand their consumption preferences and set intentions in line with their goals, such as goals for knowledge development and increased diversity of content or viewpoints. We give examples of such works on explanation and interactive interface interventions which have been effective in influencing readers' consumption intentions and behaviors in news recommendations. However, the state‐of‐the‐art in news recommender systems currently fall short in terms of evaluating such interventions in live systems, limiting our ability to measure their true impact on user behavior and opinions. To help understand the true benefit of these interfaces, we therefore call for improving the realism of studies for news.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The increasingly decentralized and private nature of data in our digital society has motivated the development of collaborative intelligent systems that enable knowledge aggregation among data owners. However, collaborative learning has only been investigated in simple settings. For example, clients are often assumed to train solution models de novo , disregarding all prior expertise. The learned model is typically represented in task‐specific forms that are not generalizable to unseen, emerging scenarios. Finally, a universal model representation is enforced among collaborators, ignoring their local compute constraints or input representations. These limitations hampers the practicality of prior collaborative systems in learning scenarios with limited task data that demand constant knowledge adaptation and transfer across information silos, tasks, and learning models, as well as the utilization of prior solution expertise. Furthermore, prior collaborative learning frameworks are not sustainable on a macro scale where participants desire fairness allocation of benefits (e.g., access to the combined model) based on their costs of participation (e.g., overhead of model sharing and training synchronization, risk of information breaches, etc.). This necessitates a new perspective of collaborative learning where the server not only aggregates but also conducts valuation of the participant's contribution, and distribute aggregated information to individuals in commensurate to their contribution. To substantiate the above vision, we propose a new research agenda on developing effective and sustainable collaborative learning frameworks across heterogeneous systems, featuring three novel computational capabilities on knowledge organization: model expression, comprehension, and valuation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the realm of business automation, conversational assistants are emerging as the primary method for making automation software accessible to users in various business sectors. Access to automation primarily occurs through application programming interface (APIs) and robotic process automation (RPAs). To effectively convert APIs and RPAs into chatbots on a larger scale, it is crucial to establish an automated process for generating data and training models that can recognize user intentions, identify questions for conversational slot filling, and provide recommendations for subsequent actions. In this paper, we present a technique for enhancing and generating natural language conversational artifacts from API specifications using large language models (LLMs). The goal is to utilize LLMs in the “build” phase to assist humans in creating skills for digital assistants. As a result, the system does not need to rely on LLMs during conversations with business users, leading to efficient deployment. Along with enabling digital assistants, our system employs LLMs as proxies to simulate human interaction and automatically evaluate the digital assistant's performance. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Our system is deployed in the IBM Watson Orchestrate product for general availability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Graph machine learning (GML) has been successfully applied across a wide range of tasks. Nonetheless, GML faces significant challenges in generalizing over out‐of‐distribution (OOD) data, which raises concerns about its wider applicability. Recent advancements have underscored the crucial role of causality‐driven approaches in overcoming these generalization challenges. Distinct from traditional GML methods that primarily rely on statistical dependencies, causality‐focused strategies delve into the underlying causal mechanisms of data generation and model prediction, thus significantly improving the generalization of GML across different environments. This paper offers a thorough review of recent progress in causality‐involved GML generalization. We elucidate the fundamental concepts of employing causality to enhance graph model generalization and categorize the various approaches, providing detailed descriptions of their methodologies and the connections among them. Furthermore, we explore the incorporation of causality in other related important areas of trustworthy GML, such as explanation, fairness, and robustness. Concluding with a discussion on potential future research directions, this review seeks to articulate the continuing development and future potential of causality in enhancing the trustworthiness of GML.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Harnessing the wide‐spread availability of cell phones, many nonprofits have launched mobile health (mHealth) programs to deliver information via voice or text to beneficiaries in underserved communities, with maternal and infant health being a key area of such mHealth programs. Unfortunately, dwindling listenership is a major challenge, requiring targeted interventions using limited resources. This paper focuses on Kilkari, the world's largest mHealth program for maternal and child care – with over 3 million active subscribers at a time – launched by India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and run by the non‐profit ARMMAN. We present a system called CHAHAK that aims to reduce automated dropouts as well as boost engagement with the program through the strategic allocation of interventions to beneficiaries. Past work in a similar domain has focused on a much smaller scale mHealth program and used markovian restless multiarmed bandits to optimize a single limited intervention resource. However, this paper demonstrates the challenges in adopting a markovian approach in Kilkari; therefore, CHAHAK instead relies on non‐markovian time‐series restless bandits and optimizes multiple interventions to improve listenership. We use real Kilkari data from the Odisha state in India to show CHAHAK's effectiveness in harnessing multiple interventions to boost listenership, benefiting marginalized communities. When deployed CHAHAK will assist the largest maternal mHealth program to date.",

AI is an important source of ideas and tools for building sophisticated support facilities which make possible certain programming methodologies. These advanced programming methodologies in turn can have profound effects upon the methodology of AI research. Both of these dependencies are illustrated by the example of anew experimental programming methodology which is based upon current AI ideas about reasoning, representation and control. The manner in which AI systems are designed, developed and tested can be significantly improved in the programming is supported by a sufficiently powerful partial evaluator. In particular, the process of building levels of interpreters and of intertwining generate and test can be partially automated. Finally speculations about a more direct connection between AI and partial evaluation are presented.",

Because of the volume of nonnumeric, as well as numeric, data, the programs must be able to explore a large space of possibly interesting relationships to discover those that are novel and interesting. Thus, the framework for the discovery program must facilitate proposing and selecting the next task to perform and performing the selected tasks. The framework we describe, called the agenda- and justification-based framework, has several properties that are desirable in semiautonomous discovery systems: It provides a mechanism for estimating the plausibility of tasks, it uses heuristics to propose and perform tasks, and it facilitates the encoding of general discovery strategies and the use of background knowledge. We have implemented the framework and our heuristics in a prototype program, HAMB, and have evaluated them in the domain of protein crystallization. Our results demonstrate that both reasons given for performing tasks and estimates of the interestingness of the concepts and hypotheses examined by HAMS contribute to its performance and that the program can discover novel, interesting relationships in biological data.",

With the current U.S. and European focus on launching satellites for communication, broadcasting, or localization tasks, among others, the automatic control of these machines becomes an important problem. Many new techniques in both the planning and scheduling fields have been applied successfully, but still much work is left to be done for reliable autonomous architectures. The purpose of this article is to present CONSAT, a real application that plans and schedules the performance of nominal operations in four satellites during the course of a year for a commercial Spanish satellite company, HISPASAT. For this task, we have used an AI domain-independent planner that solves the planning and scheduling problems in the HISPASAT domain thanks to its capability of representing and handling continuous variables, coding functions to obtain the operators' variable values, and the use of control rules to prune the search. We also abstract the approach in order to generalize it to other domains that need an integrated approach to planning and scheduling.",

Current approaches for building visual object detection models require large and well‐labeled dataset stored by a centralized entity. This not only poses privacy concerns under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), but also incurs large transmission and storage overhead. Federated learning (FL) is a promising machine learning paradigm to address these challenges. In this paper, we report on FedVision —a machine learning engineering platform to support the development of federated learning powered computer vision applications—to bridge this important gap. The platform has been deployed through collaboration between WeBank and Extreme Vision to help customers develop computer vision‐based safety monitoring solutions in smart city applications. Through actual usage, it has demonstrated significant efficiency improvement and cost reduction while fulfilling privacy‐preservation requirements (e.g., reducing communication overhead for one company by 50 fold and saving close to 40,000RMB of network cost per annum). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical application of FL in computer vision‐based tasks.",

    "abstract": "Current approaches to the problem of coordinating the activity of physically distributed systems or devices all have well‐recognized strengths and weaknesses. We propose adding to the mix a novel architecture, the process‐integrated mechanism (PIM), that enjoys the advantages of having a single controlling authority while avoiding the structural difficulties that have traditionally led to the rejection of centralized approaches in many complex settings. In many situations, PIMs improve on previous models with regard to coordination, security, ease of software development, robustness, and communication overhead. In the PIM architecture, the components are conceived as parts of a single mechanism, even when they are physically separated and operate asynchronously. The PIM model offers promise as an effective infrastructure for handling tasks that require a high degree of time‐sensitive coordination between the components, as well as a clean mechanism for coordinating the high‐level goals of loosely coupled systems. The PIM model enables coordination without the fragility and high communication overhead of centralized control, but also without the uncertainty associated with the system‐level behavior of a multiagent system (MAS). The PIM model provides an ease of programming with advantages over both multiagent systems and centralized architectures. It has the robustness of a multiagent system without the significant complexity and overhead required for interagent communication and negotiation. In contrast to centralized approaches, it does not require managing the large amounts of data that the coordinating process needs to compute a global view. In a PIM, the process moves to the data and may perform computations on the components where the data is locally available, transporting only the information needed for coordination within the PIM. While there are many remaining research issues to be addressed, we believe that PIMs offer an important and novel technique for the control of distributed systems.",

To preserve the viability of the GSPAS ontology and to make it easily usable for other applications within Ford, we needed to reengineer and convert the KL‐ONE ontology into a semantic web OWL/RDF format.

Captured task contexts can be used to facilitate switching between tasks, to focus a user interface on just the information needed by a task, and to recommend potentially other useful information.

Although the conference has been the major international venue for cognitive science research for a long time, appealing to all seven discipline pillars — anthropology, artificial intelligence, education, linguistics, neuroscience, philosophy, and psychology — this year’s edition topped every past meeting in terms of number of participants. An impressive figure of more than 1000 accepted contributions, divided among oral presentations (274), posters (685), symposia, workshops, and tutorials, could be accommodated in the program only by increasing the number of parallel sessions to 11 and enlarging the three poster sessions. Despite the large number of more than 1300 attendees, it was still possible to hold the conference at the university’s historical building on Unter den Linden, right in the ever-modernizing heart of Germany’s capital. Humboldt University used to be the most important university in East Germany, and in many corners the visitor was reminded of its excellent fellows, from Fichte and Hegel to Helmholtz, Einstein, and Planck. In this inspiring context attendees were welcomed from nearly 50 countries, the most conspicuous contingents coming from Europe (40 percent) and the USA (30 percent). The four German chairs, Markus Knauff, Michael Pauen, Natalie Sebanz, and Ipke Wachsmuth, with the help of the organizing and program committees, successfully managed both the deluge of submissions and the logistically challenging scheduling of the multiple thematic sessions, while allowing a great variety of topics to be represented and discussed from the different disciplines’ perspectives.

It consists of two main components: (1) natural language generation, which is built from a transformer–pointer network and a pretrained sequence‐to‐sequence model based on millions of training data from our in‐house platform; and (2) copywriting quality control, which is based on both automatic evaluation and human screening. For selected domains, the models are trained and updated daily with the updated training data. In addition, the model is also used as a real‐time writing assistant tool on our live broadcast platform. The APCG system has been deployed in JD.com since February 2021. By September 2021, it has generated 2.53 million product descriptions, and improved the overall averaged click‐through rate (CTR) and the conversion rate (CVR) by 4.22 and 3.61%, compared to baselines, respectively, on a year‐on‐year basis. The accumulated gross merchandise volume (GMV) made by our system is improved by 213.42%, compared to the number in February 2021.",

The use of robots that operate in spaces in which humans are physically co‐present is growing at a dramatic rate. We are seeing more and more robots in our warehouses, on our streets, and even in our homes. All of these robots will interact with humans in some way, whether intentionally or unintentionally. To be successful, their interactions with humans will have to be carefully designed. For more than a decade, the field of HRI has been growing at the intersection of robotics, Artificial Intelligence (AI) , human‐computer interaction (HCI), psychology, and other fields; however, until quite recently, it has been a largely academic area, with university researchers proposing, implementing, and reporting on experiments at a limited scale. With the current increase of commercially‐available robots, HRI is starting to make its way into the robotics industry in a meaningful way. This symposium brought together HRI researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and national research laboratories to find common ground, understand the different constraints at play, and determine how to effectively work together.",

    "abstract": "Abstract It is well documented that there has been significant enthusiasm across the globe in respect of using AI for all forms of social activity. However, the electoral process – the time, place, and manner of elections within democratic nations – is one of few sectors in which there has been limited penetration of AI. Electoral management bodies in many countries have recently started exploring and deliberating over the use of AI in the electoral process. In this paper, we consider five avenues within the core electoral process which have potential for AI usage, and map the challenges involved in using AI within them. These five avenues are: voter list maintenance, determining polling booth locations, polling booth protection processes, voter authentication, and video monitoring of elections. Within each avenue, we lay down the context, illustrate current or potential usage of AI, and discuss extant or potential ramifications of AI usage, as well as potential directions for mitigating risks when considering AI usage. We believe that the scant current usage of AI within electoral processes provides a very rare opportunity to deliberate on the risks and mitigation possibilities prior to actual and widespread AI deployment. This paper is an attempt to map the horizons of risks and opportunities in using AI within electoral processes and to help shape the debate around the topic.",

The availability of this information will help voters understand their candidates' views on the economy, healthcare, education, and other social issues. Our main contributions are a dataset extracted from Wikipedia that spans the past 120 years and a language model‐based method that helps analyze how polarized a candidate is. Our data are divided into two parts, background information and political information about a candidate, since our hypothesis is that the political views of a candidate should be based on reason and be independent of factors such as birthplace, alma mater, and so forth. We further split this data into four phases chronologically, to help understand if and how the polarization amongst candidates changes. This data has been cleaned to remove biases. To understand the polarization, we begin by showing results from some classical language models in Word2Vec and Doc2Vec. And then use more powerful techniques like the Longformer, a transformer‐based encoder, to assimilate more information and find the nearest neighbors of each candidate based on their political view and their background. The code and data for the project will be available here: “ https://github.com/samirangode/Understanding_Polarization ”",

    "abstract": "Abstract Underserved communities face critical health challenges due to lack of access to timely and reliable information. Nongovernmental organizations are leveraging the widespread use of cellphones to combat these healthcare challenges and spread preventative awareness. The health workers at these organizations reach out individually to beneficiaries; however, such programs still suffer from declining engagement. We have deployed Saheli , a system to efficiently utilize the limited availability of health workers for improving maternal and child health in India. Saheli uses the Restless Multi‐armed Bandit (RMAB) framework to identify beneficiaries for outreach. It is the first deployed application for RMABs in public health, and is already in continuous use by our partner NGO, ARMMAN. We have already reached ∼130K beneficiaries with Saheli , and are on track to serve one million beneficiaries by the end of 2023. This scale and impact has been achieved through multiple innovations in the RMAB model and its development, in preparation of real world data, and in deployment practices; and through careful consideration of responsible AI practices. Specifically, in this paper, we describe our approach to learn from past data to improve the performance of Saheli 's RMAB model, the real‐world challenges faced during deployment and adoption of Saheli , and the end‐to‐end pipeline.",

Modern welding machines have automated lasers that follow a predefined weld seam path between the two parts to create a bond. Previous efforts have used simple computer vision edge detectors to automatically detect the weld seam on an image at the junction of two metals to be welded. However, these systems lack reliability and accuracy resulting in manual human verification of the detected edges. This paper presents a neural network architecture that automatically detects the weld seam edge between two metals with high accuracy. We augment this system with a preclassifier that filters out anomalous workpieces (e.g., incorrect placement). Finally, we justify our design choices by evaluating against several existing deep network pipelines as well as proof through real‐world use. We also describe in detail the process of deploying the system in a real‐world shop floor including evaluation and monitoring. We make public a large well‐labeled laser seam dataset to perform deep learning‐based edge detection in industrial settings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Machine Learning systems rely heavily on annotated instances. Such annotations are frequently done by human experts, or by tools developed by experts, and so the central message of this book, Noise: A Flaw in Human Judgment (Kahneman, Sibony, and Sunstein 2021) is of considerable importance to AI/Machine Learning community. The core message is that if a number of experts are asked to annotate tasks that involve judgments, these responses will frequently differ. This observation poses a problem for how analysts choose a particular annotated dataset (from the group), or process the set of responses to give a “balanced” response, or whether to reject all the annotated datasets. A further important aspect of this book is the case studies which demonstrate that differences in judgments between fellow experts have been reported in a significant number of disciplines including, business, the law, government, and medicine. Kahneman, Sibony and Sunstein (2021), referred to as KSS subsequently, discuss how Expert Biases can be reduced, but the main focus of this book is a discussion of Noise, that is, differences that often occur between fellow experts, and how Noise can often be reduced. To address the last point KSS have formulated a set of six decision hygiene principles which include the recommendation that complex tasks should be subdivided, and then each subtask should be solved separately. A further principle is that each task should be solved by individual experts before the various judgments are discussed with fellow experts. Effectively, the book being reviewed covers three main topics: First, it reports several motivating studies that show how judgments of fellow experts varied significantly in the pricing of insurance premiums, and in setting the lengths of custodial sentences. These motivating studies very effectively illustrate the central concepts of Judgment, Noise, and Bias; that section also provides definitions of these core concepts and discusses how Noise is often amplified in group meetings. Secondly, the authors provide detailed discussion of further studies, in a variety of domains, which report the levels of disagreement between experts. Thirdly, KSS discusses how to reduce the levels of Noise between experts, as noted above, the authors refer to these as Principles of Noise Hygiene. These three parts are interwoven in a complex way throughout the book; in our view, the best overview of the book is given in the section Review and Conclusions: Taking Noise Seriously (KSS, p. 361).",

As such they will also become a means of evaluating the performance of future human–machine systems. While machine ethics has offered various approaches to endowing machines with normative competence, from the more logic‐based to the more data‐based, none of the proposals so far have considered the challenge of capturing the “spirit of a norm,” which often eludes rigid interpretation and complicates doing the right thing. We present some paradigmatic scenarios across contexts to illustrate why the spirit of a norm can be critical to make explicit and why it exposes the inadequacies of mere data‐driven “value alignment” techniques such as reinforcement learning RL for interactive, real‐time human–robot interaction. Instead, we argue that norm learning, in particular, learning to capture the spirit of a norm, requires combining common‐sense inference‐based and data‐driven approaches.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We are living through a revolutionary moment in AI history. Users from diverse walks of life are adopting and using AI systems for their everyday use cases at a pace that has never been seen before. However, with this proliferation, there is also a growing recognition that many of the central open problems within AI are connected to how the user interacts with these systems. To name two prominent examples, consider the problems of explainability and value alignment. Each problem has received considerable attention within the wider AI community, and much promising progress has been made in addressing each of these individual problems. However, each of these problems tends to be studied in isolation, using very different theoretical frameworks, while a closer look at each easily reveals striking similarities between the two problems. In this article, I wish to discuss the framework of human‐aware AI (HAAI) that aims to provide a unified formal framework to understand and evaluate human–AI interaction. We will see how this framework can be used to both understand explainability and value alignment and how the framework also lays out potential novel avenues to address these problems.",

    "abstract": "This article, derived from the 1996 Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence Presidential Address, explores the notion of intelligence from a variety of perspectives and finds that it many things. It has, for example, been interpreted in a variety of ways even within our own field, ranging from the logical view (intelligence as part of mathematical logic) to the psychological view (intelligence as an empirical phenomenon of the natural world) to a variety of others. One goal of this article is to go back to basics, reviewing the things that we, individually and collectively, have taken as given, in part because we have taken multiple different and sometimes inconsistent things for granted. I believe it will prove useful to expose the tacit assumptions, models, and metaphors that we carry around as a way of understanding both what we're about and why we sometimes seem to be at odds with one another. Intelligence are also many things in the sense that is a product of evolution. Our physical bodies are in many ways overdetermined, unnecessarily complex, and inefficiently designed, that is, the predictable product of the blind search that is evolution. What's manifestly true of our anatomy is also likely true of our cognitive architecture. Natural intelligence is unlikely to be limited by principles of parsimony and is likely to be overdetermined, unnecessarily complex, and inefficiently designed. In this sense, intelligence are many things because is composed of the many elements that have been thrown together over evolutionary timescales. I suggest that in the face of that, searching for minimalism and elegance may be a diversion, for it simply may not be there. Somewhat more crudely put: The human mind is a 400,000-year-old legacy application -- and you expected to find structured programming? I end with a number of speculations, suggesting that there are some niches in the design space of intelligences that are currently underexplored. One example is the view that thinking is in part visual, and hence it might prove useful to develop representations and reasoning mechanisms that reason with diagrams (not just about them) and that take seriously their visual nature. I speculate as well that thinking may be a form of reliving, that re-acting out what we have experienced is one powerful way to think about and solve problems in the world. In this view, thinking is not simply the decontextualized manipulation of abstract symbols, powerful though that may be. Instead, some significant part of our thinking may be the reuse or simulation of our experiences in the environment. In keeping with this, I suggest that it may prove useful to marry the concreteness of reasoning in a model with the power that arises from reasoning abstractly.",

The specific motivations underlying this research include the following propositions: (1) Reasoning from experimental evidence contained in the clinical literature is central to the decisions physicians make in patient care. (2) A computational model based on a declarative representation for published reports of clinical studies can drive a computer program that selectively tailors knowledge of the clinical literature as it is applied to a particular case. (3) The development of such a computational model is an important first step toward filling a void in computer-based decision support systems. Furthermore, the model can help us better understand the general principles of reasoning from experimental evidence both in medicine and other domains. Roundsman is a developmental computer system that draws on structured representations of the clinical literature to critique plans for the management of primary breast cancer. Roundsman is able to produce patient-specific analyses of breast cancer-management options based on the 24 clinical studies currently encoded in its knowledge base. The Roundsman system is a first step in exploring how the computer can help bring a critical analysis of the relevant literature, structured around a particular patient and treatment decision, to the physician.",

AWDRAT stands for architectural differencing, wrappers, diagnosis, recovery, adaptive software, and trust modeling. AWDRAT uses these techniques to gain visibility into the execution of an application system and to compare the application's actual behavior to that which is expected. In the case of a deviation, AWDRAT conducts a diagnosis that determines which computational resources are likely to have been compromised and then adds these assessments to its trust model. The trust model in turn guides the recovery process, particularly by guiding the system in its choice among functionally equivalent methods and resources.AWDRAT has been applied to and evaluated on an example application system, a graphical editor for constructing mission plans. We describe a series of experiments that were performed to test the effectiveness of AWDRAT in recognizing and recovering from simulated attacks, and we present data showing the effectiveness of AWDRAT in detecting a variety of compromises to the application system (approximately 90 percent of all simulated attacks are detected, diagnosed, and corrected). We also summarize some lessons learned from the AWDRAT experiments and suggest approaches for comprehensive application protection methods and techniques.",

    "abstract": "A synergy between AI and the Internet of Things (IoT) will significantly improve sense‐making, situational awareness, proactivity, and collaboration. However, the key challenge is to identify the underlying context within which humans interact with smart machines. Knowledge of the context facilitates proactive allocation among members of a human‐smart machine (agent) collective that balances autonomy with human interaction, without displacing humans from their supervisory role of ensuring that the system goals are achievable. In this article, we address four research questions as a means of advancing toward proactive autonomy: how to represent the interdependencies among the key elements of a hybrid team; how to rapidly identify and characterize critical contextual elements that require adaptation over time; how to allocate system tasks among machines and agents for superior performance; and how to enhance the performance of machine counterparts to provide intelligent and proactive courses of action while considering the cognitive states of human operators. The answers to these four questions help us to illustrate the integration of AI and IoT applied to the maritime domain, where we define context as an evolving multidimensional feature space for heterogeneous search, routing, and resource allocation in uncertain environments via proactive decision support systems.",

One prominent example is Chinese government service provision. Over the years, it has been plagued with inefficiencies as a result of moral hazard. Previous attempts to address these challenges are not effective, as reforms on civil servant incentives face stiff hindrance. In this article, we report an alternative platform — SmartHS — to address these challenges in China without modifying incentives. Through dynamic teamwork, automation of key steps involved in service provision, and improved transparency with the help of artificial intelligence, it places civil servants into an environment that promotes efficiency and reduces the opportunities for moral hazard. Deployment tests in the field of social insurance service provision in three Chinese cities involving close to 3 million social insurance service cases per year demonstrated that the proposed approach significantly reduces moral hazard symptoms. The findings are useful for informing current policy discussions on government reform in China and have the potential to address long‐standing problems in government service provision to benefit almost one‐fifth of the world's population.",

    "abstract": "From Shakey the Robot to self‐driving cars, from the personal computer to personal assistants on our phones, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has led the development of integrated artificial intelligence (AI) systems for more than half a century. From the earliest days of AI, it was apparent that a robust, generally intelligent system should include a complete set of capabilities: perception, memory, reasoning, learning, planning, and action; and when DARPA initiated AI research in the 1960s, ambitious projects such as Shakey the Robot went after the complete package. As DARPA realized the challenges, they backed away from the ultimate goal of integrated AI and tried to make progress on the individual problems of image understanding, speech and language understanding, knowledge representation and reasoning, planning and decision aids, machine learning, and robotic manipulation. Yet, even as researchers struggled to make progress in these subdisciplines, DARPA periodically resurrected the challenge of integrated intelligent systems and pushed the community to try again. In the 1980s, DARPA's Strategic Computing Initiative took on challenges of integrated AI projects such as the Autonomous Land Vehicle and the Pilot's Associate. These did not succeed, but instead set the stage for the several decades of more siloed research that followed, until it was time to try again. In the 2000s, DARPA took on the integrated AI problem again with its Grand Challenges, which led to the first self‐driving cars, and projects such as the Personalized Assistant that Learns, which produced Apple's Siri. These efforts created complex, richly‐integrated systems that represented quantum leaps ahead in machine intelligence. The integration of sophisticated capabilities in a fundamental way is the key to general intelligence. This is the story of DARPA's persistent long‐term support for this essential premise of AI.",

    "abstract": "In recent years we have witnessed a surge in machine learning methods that provide machines with conversational abilities. Most notably, neural‐network‐based systems have set the state of the art for difficult tasks such as speech recognition, semantic understanding, dialogue management, language generation, and speech synthesis. Still, unlike for the ancient game of Go for instance, we are far from achieving human‐level performance in dialogue. The reasons for this are numerous. One property of human‐human dialogue that stands out is the infinite number of possibilities of expressing oneself during the conversation, even when the topic of the conversation is restricted. A typical solution to this problem was scaling‐up the data. The most prominent mantra in speech and language technology has been “There is no data like more data.” However, the researchers now are focused on building smarter algorithms — algorithms that can learn efficiently from just a few examples. This is an intrinsic property of human behavior: an average human sees during their lifetime a fraction of data that we nowadays present to machines. A human can even have an intuition about a solution before ever experiencing an example solution. The human‐inspired ability to adapt may just be one of the keys in pushing dialogue systems toward human performance. This article reviews advancements in dialogue systems research with a focus on the adaptation methods for dialogue modeling, and ventures to have a glance at the future of research on adaptable conversational machines.",

    "abstract": "While technology has dramatically changed medical practice, various aspects of mental health practice and diagnosis remain almost unchanged across decades. Here we argue that artificial intelligence — with its capacity to learn and infer from data the workings of the human mind — may rapidly change this scenario. However, this process will not happen without friction and will promote an explicit reflection of the overarching goals and foundational aspects of mental health. We suggest that the converse relation is also very likely to happen. The application of artificial intelligence to a field that relates to the foundations of what makes us human — our volition, our thoughts, our pains and pleasures — may shift artificial intelligence back to its earliest days, when it was mostly conceived of as a laboratory to explore the limits and possibilities of human intelligence.",

Submitted solvers were tested on a selected collection of benchmark instances, including artificially generated argumentation frameworks and some frameworks formalizing real‐world problems. This competition introduced two main novelties over the two previous editions: the first one is the use of the Docker platform for packaging the participating solvers into virtual “light” containers; the second novelty consists of a new track for dynamic frameworks.",

A central assumption of big data analytics is that it can explain and predict human behavior. We investigate this assumption, aiming to enhance the knowledge basis for developing algorithmic standards in big data analytics. First, we argue that big data analytics is by design atheoretical and does not provide process-based explanations of human behavior; thus, it is unfit to support deliberation that is transparent and explainable. Second, we review evidence from interdisciplinary decision science, showing that the accuracy of complex algorithms used in big data analytics for predicting human behavior is not consistently higher than that of simple rules of thumb. Rather, it is lower in situations such as predicting election outcomes, criminal profiling, and granting bail. Big data algorithms can be considered as candidate models for explaining, predicting, and supporting human decision making when they match, in transparency and accuracy, simple, process-based, domain-grounded theories of human behavior. Big data analytics can be inspired by behavioral and cognitive theory.",

The technology reported here for assisting the less experienced diagnostician differs considerably from normal rule-based techniques: It reasons about machine failures from a functional model of the device. In a mechanism like the lower hoist, the functional model must reason about forces, fluid pressures, and mechanical linkages; that is, it must reason about qualitative physics. Hoist technology can be directly applied to any exactly specified device for the modeling and diagnosis of single or multiple faults. Hypothetical reasoning, the process embodied in Hoist, has general utility in qualitative physics and reason maintenance.",

The focus of our attention has not been just at the factory level; we have been addressing the order-process cycle: marketing, sales, order administration, manufacturing, distribution, and field service. This cycle can be thought of as outer loop of the knowledge network. Also, we recently began addressing the inner loop. This loop is the product life cycle : marketing and new product requirements, design and manufacturing startup, and volume or steady-state manufacturing.

In addition to an overview of this knowledge network, we feature DEC's newest system in order processing : the configuration-dependent sourcing (CDS) expert.

    "abstract": "Robot soccer competition provides an excellent opportunity for integrated robotics research. In particular, robot players in a soccer game must recognize and track objects in real time, navigate in a dynamic field, collaborate with teammates, and strike the ball in the correct direction. All these tasks demand robots that are autonomous (sensing, thinking, and acting as independent creatures), efficient (functioning under time and resource constraints), cooperative (collaborating with each other to accomplish tasks that are beyond an individual's capabilities), and intelligent (reasoning and planning actions and perhaps learning from experience). Furthermore, all these capabilities must be integrated into a single and complete system, which raises a set of challenges that are new to individual research disciplines. This article describes our experience (problems and solutions) in these aspects. Our robots share the same general architecture and basic hardware, but they have integrated abilities to play different roles (goalkeeper, defender, or forward) and use different strategies in their behavior. Our philosophy in building these robots is to use the least sophistication to make them as robust and integrated as possible. At RoboCup-97, held as part of the Fifteenth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, these integrated robots performed well, and our DREAMTEAM won the world championship in the middle-size robot league.",

However, with a continually increasing focus on specialized subareas and somewhat narrow technical problems (both of which are inevitable and in many ways healthy), we may be torpedoing our core research agenda: the creation of a true synthetic intelligence. I reflect briefly on the essential interdependencies of the components of intelligence, the important roles of architecture and integration, and the need to get back to thinking about the very idea of AI. AAAI's role in the field has evolved over the years, but after a quarter-century as an organization, and a half-century as a field, it seems like AAAI is in an ideal situation to bring AI as a whole back to its roots.",

The primary objective of the system is to determine the problem mentioned in an incoming email ticket and then automatically dispatch it to an appropriate resolver group with high accuracy. While meeting this objective, it should also meet the objective of being able to operate at desired accuracy levels in the face of changing business needs by automatically adapting to the changes. The proposed system uses a system of classifiers with separate strategies for handling frequent and sparse resolver groups augmented with a semiautomatic rule engine and retraining strategies to ensure that it is accurate, robust, and adaptive to changing business needs. Our system has been deployed in the production of six major service providers in diverse service domains and currently assigns 100,000 emails per month, on an average, with an accuracy close to ninety percent and covering at least ninety percent of email tickets. This translates to achieving human‐level accuracy and results in a net savings of more than 50,000 man‐hours of effort per annum. To date, our deployed system has already served more than two million tickets in production.",

AI is used in a mission‐critical feet management system (FMS) that supports the scheduling and management of a feet of luxury limousines for business travelers. The AI problem was modeled as a constraint‐satisfaction problem (CSP). The use of AI enabled the travel agency to sign up additional hotel partners, handle more orders, and expand its feet with its existing team of planners and controllers. Using modern web 2.0 architecture and proven AI technology, the agency was able to achieve low‐risk implementation and deployment success with concrete and measurable business benefits.",

Dental school timetabling differs from other university course scheduling in that certain clinic sessions can be used by multiple courses at the same time, provided a limit on room capacity is satisfied. Starting from a constraint‐programming solution using a web interface, we have moved to a mixed integer programming‐based solver to deal with multiple objective functions, along with a dedicated Java application, which provides a rich user interface. Solutions for the years 2010, 2011, and 2012 have been used in the dental school, replacing a manual timetabling process, which could no longer cope with increasing student numbers and resulting resource bottlenecks. The use of the automated system allowed the dental school to increase the number of students enrolled to the maximum possible given the available resources. It also provides the school with a valuable “what‐if” analysis tool.",

    "abstract": "According to Daniel Kahneman, there are two systems that drive the human decision‐making process: The intuitive system that performs the fast thinking, and the deliberative system that does more logical and slower thinking. Inspired by this model, we propose a framework for implementing human activity recognition on mobile devices. In this area, the mobile app is usually always on and the general challenge is how to balance accuracy and energy consumption. However, among existing approaches, those based on cellular IDs consume little power but are less accurate; those based on GPS/Wi‐Fi sampling are accurate often at the costs of battery drainage; moreover, previous methods in general do not improve over time. To address these challenges, our framework consists of two modes: In the deliberation mode, the system learns cell ID patterns that are trained by existing GPS‐/Wi‐Fi‐based methods; in the intuition mode, only the learned cell ID patterns are used for activity recognition, which is both accurate and energy efficient; system parameters are learned to control the transition from deliberation to intuition, when sufficient confidence is gained, and the transition from intuition to deliberation, when more training is needed. For the scope of this paper, we first elaborate our framework in a subproblem in activity recognition, trip detection, which recognizes significant places and trips between them. For evaluation, we collected real‐life traces of six participants over five months. Our experiments demonstrated consistent results across different participants in terms of accuracy and energy efficiency and, more importantly, its fast improvement on energy efficiency over time due to regularities in human daily activities.",

    "abstract": "A common difficulty in diagnosing failures within Pratt & Whitney's F100-PW-100/200 gas turbine engine occurs when a fault in one part of a system -- comprising an engine, an airframe, a test cell, and automated ground engine test set (AGETS) equipment -- is manifested as an out-of-bound parameter elsewhere in the system. In such cases, the normal procedure is to run AGETS self-diagnostics on the abnormal parameter. However, because the self-diagnostics only test the specified local parameter, it will pass, leaving only the operators' experience and traditional fault-isolation manuals to locate the source of the problem in another part of the system. This article describes a diagnostic tool (that is, AGETS MBR), designed to overcome this problem by isolating failures using an overall system troubleshooting approach. AGETS MBR was developed jointly by personnel at Pratt & Whitney and United Technologies Research Center using an AI tool called the qualitative reasoning system (QRS).",

It didn't take long before it became Artificial Intelligence (AI). Coined by John McCarthy, that term has stuck firmly, despite continual grumblings that any other name would be twice as fair (though no grumblings by me; I like the present name). Complex Information processing lives on now only in the title of the CIP Working Papers, a series started by Herb Simon in 1956 and still accumulating entries (to 447). However, from about 1965 much of the work on artificial intelligence that was not related to psychology began to appear in technical reports of the Computer Science Department. These reports, never part of a coherent numbered series until 1978, proliferated in all directions. Starting in the early 1970s (on one can recall exactly when), they did become the subject of a general mailing and thus began to form what everyone thinks of as the CMU Computer Science Technical Reports.",

Our participation in the Fifth Annual AAAI Mobile Robot Competition and Exhibition, held as part of the Thirteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, served as the first milestone in advancing us toward this goal. YODA's software architecture is a hierarchy of abstraction layers, ranging from a set of behaviors at the bottom layer to a dynamic, mission-oriented planner at the top. The planner uses a map of the environment to determine a sequence of goals to be accomplished by the robot and delegates the detailed executions to the set of behaviors at the lower layer. This abstraction architecture has proven robust in dynamic and noisy environments, as shown by YODA's performance at the robot competition.",

However, the relationship between these two levels of representation -- signal and symbol -- are not well understood.

The ability to separate the important from the unimportant underlies such faculties as attention, focusing, situation and outcome assessment, priority setting, judgment, taste, goal selection, credit assignment, the selection of relevant memories and precedents, and learning from experience. AI has for the most part focused on logic and reasoning in artificial situations where only relevant variables and operators are specified and has paid insufficient attention to processes of reducing the richness and disorganization of the real world to a form where logical reasoning can be applied.

Motion control is carried out by a special control board that uses two microcontrollers to carry out the software system decisions and transfers them to the robot mechanics. The software system performs real-time object recognition at the rate of 16 frames a second. Playing algorithms are based on deterministic methods and communication among robots. We have constructed four such robots and successfully proved their performance at RoboCup-99.",

Not only did I become better acquainted with the most creative and active people in the field, I was also personally kept up to date on their latest research. ARPA is not just a place to go to provide a public service, but is really a central node in the research network for collecting and integrating results and disseminating them to the broader community: government, industry and the public at large. Moreover, it was my responsibility to identify new avenues of research and/or applications of research, coupled with the resources (limited, but real) to make these new activities happen -- a unique opportunity.",

This computer program combines various messages concerning electronic intelligence (ELINT) to aid in decision making concerning enemy actions and intentions. The prototype system is written in Prolog, a language that has proved to be very powerful and easy to use for problem /rule development. The resulting prototype system (called EXPRS-Expert Prolog System) uses English-like rule constructs of Prolog code. This approach enables the system to generate answers automatically to why a ruled fired, and how that rule fired. In addition, a rule clause construct is provided which allows direct access to Prolog code routines. This paper describes the structure of the rules used and provides typical user interactions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Utility companies in the Nordics have to nominate how much electricity is expected to be lost in their power grid the next day. We present a commercially deployed machine learning system that automates this day‐ahead nomination of the expected grid loss. It meets several practical constraints and issues related to, among other things, delayed, missing and incorrect data and a small data set. The system incorporates a total of 24 different models that performs forecasts for three sub‐grids. Each day one model is selected for making the hourly day‐ahead forecasts for each sub‐grid. The deployed system reduced the mean average percentage error (MAPE) with 40% from 12.17 to 7.26 per hour from mid‐July to mid‐October, 2019. It is robust, flexible and reduces manual work. Recently, the system was deployed to forecast and nominate grid losses for two new grids belonging to a new customer. As the presented system is modular and adaptive, the integration was quick and needed minimal work. We have shared the grid loss data‐set on Kaggle.",

NLVR contains 92,244 examples of natural language statements paired with synthetic images and annotated with Boolean values for the simple task of determining whether the sentence is true or false about the image. While it presents a simple task, NLVR has been developed to challenge systems with diverse linguistic phenomena and complex reasoning. Linguistic analysis confirms that NLVR presents diversity and complexity beyond what is provided by contemporary benchmarks. Empirical evaluation of several methods further demonstrates the open challenges NLVR presents.",

The workshop organizer, Pete Bonasso, sent a point paper to a number of invited presenters giving his opinion of what AI could and could not do for battle management. This paper served as a focus for the workshop presentations and discussions and was augmented by the workshop presentations; it can also serve as a roadmap of topics for future workshops. AI can provide battle management with such capabilities as sensor data fusion and adaptive simulations. Also, several key needs in battle management will be AI research topics for years to come, such as understanding free text and inferencing in real time. Finally, there are several areas -- cooperating systems and terrain reasoning, for example -- where, given some impetus, AI might be able to provide help in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Rather than begin by discussing the points where I seem to be in disagreement with Chapman and Schoppers, let me start with something about which we seem to concur: The work on reactive plans can be broken into two parts. First is the work on pure reactive plans, which specify actions for an agent to take in all situations. Second is the work on caching reactive plans, which specify actions in only some instances and are primarily used to store the results of previous planning activity. Although Chapman would object to the use of the word plan, the basic distinction is one that his reply appears to sanction. Strongly put, the argument in my initial article boiled down to two claims. First, research on pure reactive plans is unlikely to have significant impact on AI because pure reactive plans cannot be used as an architecture on which to build a cognitive agent. Second, current research on caching reactive plans is unlikely to have significant impact on AI because the researchers are not addressing interesting problems. Chapman disagrees with the first of these claims, and Schoppers disputes the second (and also the first, although only halfheartedly). Let me discuss their arguments individually.",

Its uniqueness lies in the fact that it interweaves knowledge gathering, organizing, and testing. Laps begins with a case in the form of a sample solution path elicited from the domain expert. This sample solution path is refined by a process called dechunking, which facilitates finding a model of the expert's reasoning process. The model guides the determination of the structure of alternatives tables at an effective level of abstraction. Once these tables have been set up, the expert is able to produce row after row on his own until a complete rule base is built. A rule generator currently produces rules in Clips or M.1 syntax.",

Here, we try to answer these questions in the context of RoboCup. We take the giant set of log data produced by the simulator tournaments from 1997 to 1999 and feed it to a data-munching program that produces statistics on important game features. Using these statistics, we identify precisely what has improved in RoboCup and what still requires further work. Plus, because the data muncher can work in real time, we can also release it as a proxy server for RoboCup. This proxy server gives all RoboCup developers instant access to statistics while a game is in progress and is a promising step toward an important goal: understanding RoboCup.",

At present, unfortunately, there is no simple answer to the question of what machines, operating systems, and languages a new or upgrading AI facility should use, and this situation has led to a great deal of confusion and anxiety on the part of those researchers and administrators who are faced with making this choice. In this article I will survey the major alternatives available at present and those that are clearly visible on the horizon, and I will try to indicate the advantages and disadvantages of each for AI work.

The geoscience worksheets, authored by geoscientists at University of Wisconsin‐Madison, were used at both Wisconsin and Northwestern University.

Trace AI provides IVA designers with suggested actions to correct understanding errors, prioritizes areas of language model repair, and can automate the review of conversations. We discuss the system design and report its performance at identifying errors in IVA understanding compared to that of human reviewers.

Traditional text generation systems are trained in a supervised way, requiring massive labeled parallel corpora. In this paper, I will introduce our recent work on search and learning approaches to unsupervised text generation, where a heuristic objective function estimates the quality of a candidate sentence, and discrete search algorithms generate a sentence by maximizing the search objective. A machine learning model further learns from the search results to smooth out noise and improve efficiency. Our approach is important to the industry for building minimal viable products for a new task; it also has high social impacts for saving human annotation labor and for processing low‐resource languages.

    "abstract": "Abstract Claims have been made that speech recognition has achieved human parity, yet this does not appear to be the case in the real‐world applications that rely on it, especially for non‐native speakers. This then begs the questions: What does it even mean for an AI system to reach human parity? How is progress towards that goal being measured? This article focuses on the current state of speech recognition and the recent developments in benchmarking and measuring performance of AI models built for speech processing. Through the shift away from single metric benchmarks and specialized models and towards evaluating collections of diverse challenging tasks and generalized models, the ultimate goal of true human parity in commercial speech processing applications is hopefully on the near horizon.",

    "abstract": "The infrastructure and tools necessary for large‐scale data analytics, formerly the exclusive purview of experts, are increasingly available. Whereas a knowledgeable data miner or domain expert can rightly be expected to exercise caution when required (for example, around misleading conclusions supposedly supported by the data), the nonexpert may benefit from some judicious assistance. This article describes an end‐to‐end learning framework that allows a novice to create models from data easily by helping structure the model‐building process and capturing extended aspects of domain knowledge. By treating the whole modeling process interactively and exploiting high‐level knowledge in the form of an ontology, the framework is able to aid the user in a number of ways, including in helping to avoid pitfalls such as data dredging. Prudence must be exercised to avoid these hazards as certain conclusions may only be supported if, for example, there is extra knowledge that gives reason to trust a narrower set of hypotheses. This article adopts the solution of using higher‐level knowledge to allow this sort of domain knowledge to be used automatically, selecting relevant input attributes, and thence constraining the hypothesis space. We describe how the framework automatically exploits structured knowledge in an ontology to identify relevant concepts, and how a data extraction component can make use of online data sources to find measurements of those concepts so that their relevance can be evaluated. To validate our approach, models of four different problem domains were built using our implementation of the framework. Prediction error on unseen examples of these models show that our framework, making use of the ontology, helps to improve model generalization.",

    "abstract": "The field of AI has undergone a series of transformations, each marking a new phase of development. The initial phase emphasized curation of symbolic models which excelled in capturing reasoning but were fragile and not scalable. The next phase was characterized by machine learning models—most recently large language models (LLMs)—which were more robust and easier to scale but struggled with reasoning. Now, we are witnessing a return to symbolic models as complementing machine learning. Successes of LLMs contrast with their inscrutability, inaccuracy, and hallucinations, which underwrite concerns over the reliability and trustworthiness of these systems, motivating investigations into commonsense reasoning, AI explainability, and formal verification techniques. Moreover, proper assessments of hybrid machine learning/symbolic systems require novel strategies to facilitate comparisons of performance and guide future AI progress. The EDGeS AAAI 2023 Spring symposium brought together researchers focusing on novel assessments and benchmarks for evaluating hybrid and artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems. This symposium revealed what was already suspected: research concerning evaluation of machine learning/symbolic hybrids and AGI is, unfortunately, lacking. Even so, the discussion was fruitful. One major theme that emerged was the exploration of symbolic reasoning systems and LLMs as complementary technologies. Grant Passmore (Imandra) illustrated how GPT-4 could be employed to generate symbolic representations of financial policy documents in natural language, which could be ingested by a proof assistant and model checker to identify potential loopholes in financial algorithms. Michael Gruninger (University of Toronto) outlined how we might characterize presumed sets of rules governing inputs/outputs of LLMs, making them easier to understand and validate. Ramesh Bharadwaj (Naval Research Laboratory) encouraged coupling LLMs with symbolic AI in the interest of automating code vulnerability detection. This optimism was challenged on at least two fronts. First, the adequacy of symbolic representations differs by domain. Financial policies may be amenable to rigorous formal representations, but formally representing even mundane activities, such as cracking an egg, can be notoriously laborious and are consequently often left incomplete. Second, many find it challenging to trust the outputs of model checkers and proof assistants for anything substantial. So, while exploration into relationships between LLMs and symbolic reasoning systems is growing, concerns of generalizability and trust are sobering realities. A further theme centered on how consciousness, intelligence, and commonsense reasoning relate to AGI. Leora Morgenstern (PARC) reported on the defeat of the Winograd Schema Challenge by LLMs. This challenge was designed around pairs of sentences involving pronoun reference ambiguity, which appear to require commonsense reasoning to disambiguate. The success of LLMs at this task led Morgenstern to question the role of surrogate task AGI testing. Joscha Bach (Intel) presented a framework of capabilities relevant to AGI, characterized by reflective awareness of input learned from embodied perception alongside internal validation by reasoning, and creative, autonomous interaction with the environment. Similarly, Pei Wang of Temple University, re-imagined intelligence as the ability to adapt to one's environment while operating with insufficient knowledge and resources. Gadi Singer (Intel) later added that one milestone we must reach before obtaining AGI is the development of “cognitive AI,” consisting of systems with multi-modal reasoning, learning, and unlearning capabilities. Morgenstern, Bach, Wang, and Singer each highlighted important characteristics differentiating AGI from task-focused AI systems. Altogether, these discussions made clear that AGI poses unique challenges for evaluation and assessment that go beyond measuring performance of a specific task. Rather, assessing AGI systems will resemble assessing natural, embodied intelligence. Though the main theme of our symposium, there were few concrete discussions of novel strategies for evaluating and benchmarking either machine learning/symbolic hybrids or AGI. Even so, speakers throughout the symposium reiterated the importance and lack of assessments and benchmarks for each. Indeed, many felt such research is a necessity, as we explore this new phase of AI development. Joscha Bach, Amanda Hicks, and the late John Piorkowski co-chaired the event, with Tetiana Grinberg, John Beverley, Steven Rogers, Grant Passmore, Ramin Hasani, Casey Richardson, Richard Granger, Jascha Achterberg, Kristinn Thorisson, Luc Steels, and Yulia Sandamirskaya as co-organizers.

    "abstract": "The AAAI 2023 spring symposium on “Socially Responsible AI for Well-Being” was held at Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport, California, from March 27th to 29th. AI has great potential for human well-being but also carries the risk of unintended harm. For our well-being, AI needs to fulfill social responsibilities such as fairness, accountability, transparency, trust, privacy, safety, and security, not just productivity such as exponential growth and economic and financial supremacy. For example, AI diagnostic systems must not only provide reliable results (for example, highly accurate diagnostic results and easy-to-understand explanations) but also their results must be socially acceptable (for example, data for AI [machine learning] must not be biased (the amount of data for training must not be biased by race or location (for example, the amount of data for learning must be equal across races and locations). As in this example, AI decisions affect our well-being, suggesting the importance of discussing “what is socially responsible” in several potential well-being situations in the coming AI era. The first perspective is “(Individual) Responsible AI” and aims to identify what mechanisms and issues should be considered to design responsible AI for well-being. One of the goals of responsible AI for well-being is to provide accountable outcomes for our ever-changing health conditions. Since our environment often drives these changes in health, Responsible AI for Well-Being is expected to offer responsible outcomes by understanding how our digital experiences affect our emotions and quality of life. The second perspective is “Socially Responsible AI,” which aims to identify what mechanisms and issues should be considered to realize the social aspects of responsible AI for well-being. One aspect of social responsibility is fairness, that is, that the results of AI should be equally helpful to all. The problem of “bias” in AI (and humans) needs to be addressed to achieve fairness. Another aspect of social responsibility is the applicability of knowledge among people. For example, health-related knowledge found by an AI for one person (for example, tips for a good night's sleep) may not be helpful to another person, meaning that such knowledge is not socially responsible. To address these problems, we must understand how fair is fair and find ways to ensure that machines do not absorb human bias by providing socially responsible results. Our symposium included 18 technical presentations over 2-and-a-half days. Presentation topics included (1) socially responsible AI, (2) communication and evidence for well-being, (3) face expression and impression for well-being, (4) odor for well-being, (5) ethical AI, (6) robot Interaction for social well-being, (7) communication and sleep for social well-being, (8) well-being studies, (9) information and sleep for social well-being For example, Takashi Kido, Advanced Comprehensive Research Organization of Teikyo University in Japan, presented the challenges of socially responsible AI for well-being. Oliver Bendel, School of Business FHGW in Switzerland, presented the increasing well-being through robotic hugs. Martin D. Aleksandrov, Freie Universitat Berlin in Germany, presented the limiting inequalities in the fair division with additive value preferences for indivisible social items. Melanie Swan, University College London in the United Kingdom, presented Quantum intelligence, responsible human machine entities. Dragutin Petkovic, San Francisco State University in Unites States, presented on San Francisco State University Graduate Certificate in Ethical AI. Our symposium provides participants unique opportunities where researchers with diverse backgrounds can develop new ideas through innovative and constructive discussions. This symposium will present significant interdisciplinary challenges for guiding future advances in the AI community. Takashi Kido and Keiki Takadama served as co-chairs of this symposium. The papers of the symposium will be published online at CEUR-WS.org. The authors declare no conflicts of interest. Takashi Kido is a professor at Teikyo University in Japan.

In this paper, we argue that a critical underlying process of anticipatory thinking is cognitive priming , where one's current thoughts influence the next without conscious intention. We make this argument in terms of two aspects of human cognition that are related to anticipatory thinking: context and creativity. We then use the parallels between context, creativity, and anticipatory thinking to support our belief that cognitive priming plays a key role in various aspects of anticipatory thinking. As part of this analysis, we also discuss its broader implications, including how it can be used to improve computational systems that do anticipatory thinking, as well as how it can be leveraged to improve anticipatory thinking in people.",

    "abstract": "A vibrant democracy relies on engaged voters making informed decisions about their representatives and keeping them accountable employing reliable information and secure election infrastructure. Significant and continuous effort is needed in improving a democracy and elections are a key part of that. Democracy at a practical level means empowering the voter with a right to choose and providing multiple capabilities, including knowledge about candidates, campaign finance, voting, processing votes, and so forth. Artificial Intelligence and machine learning have transformed modern society. It also impacts how elections are conducted in democracies, with mixed outcomes. For example, digital marketing campaigns have enabled candidates to connect with voters at scale and communicate remotely during COVID-19, but there remains widespread concern about the spread of election disinformation as the result of AI-enabled bots and aggressive strategies. In response, we conducted the first workshop at Neurips 2021 to examine the challenges of credible elections globally in an academic setting with apolitical discussion of significant issues. The speakers, panels, and reviewed papers discussed current and best practices in holding elections, tools available for candidates, and the experience of voters. They highlighted gaps and experience regarding AI-based interventions and methodologies. To ground the discussion, the invited speakers and panelists were drawn from three International geographies: US—representing one of the world's oldest democracies; India—representing the largest democracy in the world; and Estonia—representing a country using digital technologies extensively during elections and as a facet of daily life. The workshop had contributions on all technological and methodological aspects of elections and voting. At AAAI 2023, we ran the second edition of the workshop. It focused on topics of interest to election candidates like organizing candidate campaigns and detecting, informing, and managing mis- and disinformation; for election organizers, identifying and validating voters and informing people about election information; for voters, knowing about election procedures, verifying individual and community votes, navigating candidates and issues; and cross-cutting. Issues like promoting transparency in the election process, technology for data management and validation, and case studies of success or failure, and the reasons thereof. This time, additional speakers discussed experiences from Brazil, Canada, and Ireland. The workshop discussed AI trends, security gaps in elections and the lack of a standard secure stack to build trusted data-driven applications for elections, how AI and technology are already being used to make the election process work and how to improve, the role of journalists with AI and what policy steps are needed to adopt technology for a better-informed citizen. This special issue on AI for elections highlights some of the insightful perspectives from the two workshops. This includes a review of AI and core electoral processes, how chatbots could be used to promote voter participation, understanding attempts for voter polarization, detecting election frauds, and a new form of voting for user surveys. We hope they promote more community engagement for a multi-disciplinary research collaboration between AI, security, journalism, political science, and law for democracies around the world.

The simulation generates artificial elections with similar properties and trends as elections from the real world, while giving users control and knowledge over all the important components of the elections. We generate a clean election results dataset without fraud as well as datasets with varying degrees of fraud. We then measure how well the algorithm is able to successfully detect the level of fraud present. The algorithm determines how similar actual election results are as compared to the predicted results from polling and a regression model of other regions that have similar demographics. We use k‐means to partition electoral regions into clusters such that demographic homogeneity is maximized among clusters. We then use a novelty detection algorithm implemented as a one‐class support vector machine where the clean data is provided in the form of polling predictions and regression predictions. The regression predictions are built from the actual data in such a way that the data supervises itself. We show both the effectiveness of the simulation technique and the machine learning model in its success in identifying fraudulent regions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The global automobile market experiences quick changes in design preferences. In response to the demand shifts, manufacturers now try to apply new technologies to bring a novel design to market faster. In this paper, we introduce a novel AI application that performs a similarity verification task of wheel designs that aims to solve the real‐world problem. Through the deep metric learning approach, we empirically prove that the cross‐entropy loss does similar tasks as the pairwise losses do in the embedding space. On Jan 2022, we successfully transitioned the verification system to the wheel design process of Hyundai Motor Company's design team and shortened the verification time by 90% to a maximum of 10 min. With a few clicks, the designers at Hyundai Motor could take advantage of our verification system.",

However, this is a challenging task that requires the holistic integration of multimodal information with temporal dependencies and reasoning, as well as social and physical commonsense. In addition, the development of appropriate systematic evaluation methods is essential. In this context, we introduce the Video Turing Test (VTT), a blind test used to evaluate human‐likeness in terms of video comprehension ability. Moreover, we propose Vincent as a video understanding AI. We explain the configuration of VTT, the architecture of Vincent to prepare for VTT and the proposed evaluation methods for video comprehension. We also estimate the current intelligence level of AI based on our results and discuss future research directions.",

    "abstract": "Lexical Collocations are frequently occurring word pairs in natural language whose presence are not always predictable by their usage. These collocations are used by native speakers of a language almost without thought; yet they must be learned by non-native speakers of that language. A native speaker of English may drink strong coffee while a non-native speaker may say either $\\sp{*}$powerful coffee or $\\sp{*}$sturdy coffee. Collocations tend to vary among languages and topic domains. Unfortunately, the task of correctly identifying lexical collocations, even by native speakers of that language, has been shown to be very difficult.\r\nComputer systems that translate natural languages, or Machine Translation (MT) systems, need to know about lexical collocation information in order to produce natural sounding or colloquially proper text. Natural Language Generation (NLG) is a component of an MT system which automatically produces natural sounding text in a particular target language given a language-independent meaning as input. This dissertation will demonstrate how to automatically locate and extract lexical collocations from machine-readable text for use within an MT system's NLG component.\r\nA lexical-semantic and statistical approach is adopted for the location and extraction of lexical collocations. For this approach, a computational definition is provided for lexical collocations which demonstrates that: (1) they occur as adjacent word pairs; (2) they occur more often than would be expected by chance; and (3) they comprise words for which neither word may be substituted by a synonym or hyponym. Potential collocations comprising certain adjacent part-of-speech tags are extracted from text. An on-line thesaurus and lexical database of word classes are queried for synonyms and hyponyms, respectively, for each potential collocation. These queries create potential challenger pairs, such as strong java and powerful coffee. A substitution procedure is then applied to determine if any of these challenging word pairs occur more frequently than the potential collocation.\r\nThe VERIFY lexical collocation extraction system has been implemented incorporating these ideas. Results to date have been positive: using lexical-semantic knowledge, i.e., synonymy and hyponymy, within a lexical collocation extraction system outperforms a system using purely statistical knowledge. In order to compare system output to human judgments of training data, a training component was also incorporated into VERIFY. This component is able to adapt to new data. Overall system performance, measured by Recall and Precision scores, was shown to improve using this component. In order to provide a more flexible system given a user's application, a weighting mechanism was used to produce a range of Recall and Precision scores. These weights can be 'adjusted' to optimize system performance.\r\nThe use of lexical-semantic knowledge has advanced the state of the art for lexical collocation extraction beyond traditional statistical approaches. Incorporation of a training component within an extraction system provides the capability of adapting to any changes within the data. Controlling overall system performance through the use of a weighting mechanism provides flexibility to the user of an extraction system. And, in an experiment to compare VERIFY'S performance to that of human performance on a particular set of data, it was shown that VERIFY outperforms humans in both Recall and Precision.",

    "abstract": "In this project, we have developed the ramp activity coordination expert system (races) to solve aircraft-parking problems. races includes a knowledge-based scheduling system that assigns all daily arriving and departing flights to the gates and remote spots with domain-specific knowledge and heuristics acquired from human experts. races processes complex scheduling problems such as dynamic interrelations among the characteristics of remote spots-gates and aircraft with various other constraints, for example, customs and ground-handling factors, at an airport. By user-driven modeling for end users and near-optimal knowledge-driven scheduling acquired from human experts, races can produce parking schedules for about 400 daily flights in approximately 20 seconds; human experts normally take 4 to 5 hours to do the same. Scheduling results in the form of Gantt charts produced by races are also accepted by the domain experts. races is also designed to deal with the partial adjustment of the schedule when unexpected events occur. After daily scheduling is completed, the messages for aircraft change, and delay messages are reflected and updated into the schedule according to the knowledge of the domain experts. By analyzing the knowledge model of the domain expert, the reactive scheduling steps are effectively represented as the rules, and the scenarios of the graphic user interfaces are designed. Because the modification of the aircraft dispositions, such as aircraft changes and cancellations of flights, is reflected in the current schedule, the modification should be sent to races from the mainframe for the reactive scheduling. The adjustments of the schedule are made semiautomatically by races because there are many irregularities in dealing with the partial rescheduling.",

    "abstract": "There is a fundamental mismatch between the computational basis of spreadsheets and our knowledge of the real world. In spreadsheets, numeric data are represented as exact numbers and their mutual relations as functions, whose values (output) are computed from given argument values (input). However, in the real world, data are often inexact and uncertain in many ways, and the relationships, that is, constraints, between input and output are far more complicated. This article shows that interval constraint solving, an emerging AI-based technology, provides a more versatile and useful foundation for spreadsheets. The new computational basis is 100-percent downward compatible with the traditional spreadsheet paradigm. The idea has been successfully integrated with Microsoft excel as the add-in interval solver that seamlessly upgrades the arithmetic core of excel into interval constraint solving. The product has been downloaded by thousands of end users all over the world and has been used in various applications in business computing, engineering, education, and science. There is an intriguing chance for a major breakthrough of the AI technology on the spreadsheet platform: Tens of millions of excel users are making important decisions based on spreadsheet calculations.",

These heterogeneous team models are automatically acquired by machine learning over teams' external behavior traces, where the specific learning techniques are tailored to the particular model learned.

Central to our approach is the notion that model formulation and selection is an integral part of reasoning about complex physical systems. Given a task, models can be created that reflect different configurations of the system topology, at various structural granularities, and in distinct language forms.\r\nThis dissertation describes a computational framework that integrates three perspective-taking dimensions in reasoning about electronic circuits: topological configuration, structural aggregation, and ontological choice. The research shows that by using a task-driven, perspective-taking approach, we can extend the range of automated qualitative causal reasoning about complex physical systems.",

Often, a great deal of time in the design of any such system is devoted to the natural language front end. An obvious way to simplify this task is to provide a portable natural language front-end tool or facility that is sophisticated enough to allow for a reasonable variety of input; allows modification; and, yet, is easy to use. This paper describes such a tool that is based on augmented transition networks (ATNs). It allows for user input to be in sentence or nonsentence form or both, provides a detailed parse tree that the user can access, and also provides the facility to generate responses and save information. The system provides a set of ATNs or allows the user to construct ATNs using system utilities. The system is written in Franz Lisp and was developed on a DEC VAX 11/780 running the ULTRIX-32 operating system.",

Such a strange idea -especially if it were taken to describe something that exists in this world-was unthinkable before the seventeenth century; yet not even Galileo fully accepted the idea of such a as real. For him, a straight line was still bound to the earth's surface. Not until Newton was the task of geometrization of the world ... completed. The transformation that led to the reification of geometry, though basically one of attitude and perception rather than of empirical observation, profoundly affected the course of science.",

By their nature, most of these systems are difficult to quantitatively define. Many of the models and simulations that have been developed lack a user interface which enables people other than the developer to use them. As a result, several scientists are integrating knowledge-based- system (KBS) technology with conventional problem-solving techniques to increase the robustness and usability of their systems. To investigate the similarities and differences of leading scientists' approaches, a pioneer workshop, supported by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and the Knowledge Systems Area of the American Society of Agricultural Engineers, was held in San Antonio, Texas, on 10-12 August 1988. Part of the AAAI Applied Workshop Series, the meeting was intended to bring together researchers and practitioners active in applying AI concepts to agricultural problems.",

    "abstract": "AI agents combining natural language interaction, task planning, and business ontologies can help companies provide better-quality and more cost-effective customer service. Our customer-service agents use natural language to interact with customers, enabling customers to state their intentions directly instead of searching for the places on the Web site that may address their concern. We use planning methods to search systematically for the solution to the customer's problem, ensuring that a resolution satisfactory for both the customer and the company is found, if one exists. Our agents converse with customers, guaranteeing that needed information is acquired from customers and that relevant information is provided to them in order for both parties to make the right decision. The net effect is a more frictionless interaction process that improves the customer experience and makes businesses more competitive on the service front.",

EWI thereby came up with some 25 new and highly diverse \"Hofstadter articles\", one of which is given below, and at the very end the article is followed by a brief commentary about EWI and its output, by Hofstadter himself.",

RealScape automatically detects changes in the height and color of buildings based on three‐dimensional analysis of aerial photographs. It employs a unique pixel‐by‐pixel stereo processing method and enables a foot‐level precision for each building. RealScape detects building changes more accurately than visual judgment operations by humans and reduces the labor costs to one third of the traditional approach and the required judgment duration to about two weeks per 100 km 2 .",

    "abstract": "Abduction is a ubiquitous reasoning task in human problem solving. Its ubiquity is somewhat in contradiction with its computational complexity which has been shown to be in general NP. The fact that humans perform abductive reasoning tasks in a reasonable time and within the limits of their cognitive architecture led us to hypothesize the existence of computational heuristics used in order to tackle abductive complexity. In this work we identify and study 2 types of such heuristics. First, working from protocols gathered from expert blood bankers performing the abductive task of alloantibody identification, we compare the conclusion of the protocol analysis to the results of the formal computational complexity analysis of abduction. This comparison yields interesting explanations of cognitive phenomena based on a computational theory argument. We then analyze the role a particular type of knowledge called Essentials can have in reaching an acceptable abductive explanation. For each of these heuristics we implement a computational model and discuss its theoretical and cognitive aspects. We also discuss the relevancy of using computational complexity arguments as a tool to explain human behavior and to generate hypotheses in cognitive science research. Finally the present work is related to previous work and future extensions are proposed.",

I describe a formalism for organizing knowledge into such functional categories and some of its implementations. In this formalism, descriptive scientific knowledge is classified into seven categories. The categorization formalism allows complex propositions to be analyzed into their simple constituents; in turn, these constituents can be maintained in their categories. They can then be combined using a simple transformation function to form complex constructs such as frames and schemata. The methodology facilitates the implementation of knowledge-level methods of learning such as similarity-based learning, explanation-based learning, and conceptual clustering. It simplifies the identification and resolution of conflicts in knowledge systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Advances in artificial intelligence algorithms and expansion of straightforward cloud‐based platforms have enabled the adoption of conversational assistants by both, medium and large companies, to facilitate interaction between clients and employees. The interactions are possible through the use of ubiquitous devices (e.g., Amazon Echo, Apple HomePod, Google Nest), virtual assistants (e.g., Apple Siri, Google Assistant, Samsung Bixby, or Microsoft Cortana), chat windows on the corporate website, or social network applications (e.g. Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Slack, WeChat). Creating a useful, personalized conversational agent that is also robust and popular is nonetheless challenging work. It requires picking the right algorithm, framework, and/or communication channel, but perhaps more importantly, consideration of the specific task, user needs, environment, available training data, budget, and a thoughtful design. In this paper, we will consider the elements necessary to create a conversational agent for different types of users, environments, and tasks. The elements will account for the limited amount of data available for specific tasks within a company and for non‐English languages. We are confident that we can provide a useful resource for the new practitioner developing an agent. We can point out novice problems/traps to avoid, create consciousness that the development of the technology is achievable despite comprehensive and significant challenges, and raise awareness about different ethical issues that may be associated with this technology. We have compiled our experience with deploying conversational systems for daily use in multicultural, multilingual, and intergenerational settings. Additionally, we will give insight on how to scale the proposed solutions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Stickers are popularly used while messaging to visually express nuanced thoughts. We describe a real‐time sticker recommendation (SR) system. We decompose SR into two steps: predict the message that is likely to be sent, and substitute that message with an appropriate sticker. To address the challenges caused by transliteration of message from users' native language to the Roman script, we learn message embeddings by employing character‐level CNN in an unsupervised manner. We use them to cluster semantically similar messages. Next, we predict the message cluster instead of the message. Except for validation, our system does not require human labeled data, leading to a fully automatic tuning pipeline. We propose a hybrid message prediction model, which can easily run on low‐end phones. We discuss message cluster to sticker mapping, addressing the multilingual needs of our users, automated tuning of the system and also propose a novel application of community detection algorithm. As of November 2020, our system contains 100k+ stickers, has been deployed for 15+ months, and is being used by millions of users.",

    "abstract": "Does the United States have a 51st state called Australia? A superficial look at the artificial intelligence (AI) research being done here could give that impression. A look beneath the surface, though, indicates some fundamental differences and reveals a dynamic and rapidly expanding AI community. General awareness of the Australian AI research community has been growing slowly for some time. AI was once considered a bit esoteric -- the domain of an almost lunatic fringe- but the large government -backed programs overseas, as well as an appreciation of the significance of AI products and potential impact on the community, have led to a reassessment of this image and to concerted attempt to discover how Australia is to contribute to the world AI research effort and hoe the country is to benefit from it. What we have seen as result is not an incremental creep of AI awareness in Australia but a quantum leap with significant industry and government support. The first systematic study of the Australian AI effort was undertaken by the Australian Department of Science (DOS) in 1986. The study took as its base the long-running research report Artificial Intelligence in Australia (AIIA), produced by John Debenham (1986). The picture that emerged is interesting. AI researchers are well qualified, undertaking research at the leading edge in their fields, and have significant potential to develop further. The results of this study were published by DOS in the Handbook of Research and Researchers in Artificial Intelligence in Australia (Department of Science1986). This article is based on key findings from the study and on additional information gained through meeting and talking with researchers and research groups.",

After exploring why the tendency to associate intelligence with problem-solving may be a mental roadblock to further progress in AI science, some preliminary thinking tools are introduced more suitable for sensory learning machine research.

The exhibition also included a published video proceedings for the first time. One of the most interesting features of the exhibition was the variety of capabilities shown. From a mechanical point of view, indoor wheeled robots were, as usual, the most common form of robot, but the exhibit also featured several outdoor wheeled robots, several legged robots, two humanoids, a snake, and a plant. From a software perspective, the exhibit featured general-purpose robot-control software, vision, teleoperation, language learning, teamwork and expression of emotion. A significant number of entries addressed the important, emerging research area of robot-human interaction, both for entertainment purposes and ease of use.",

Conceptual design is an early phase in the process, during which preliminary decisions and trade studies are made from a set of requirements related to mission objective and costs. Although much attention has been paid to applying autonomy technologies to robotic systems, including air vehicles, there has been little attention paid to incorporating autonomy as part of the conceptual design process. Consequently, designing for autonomy tends to be retrofitted to a vehicle that has already gone through a complete design process rather than as part of the initial process. This derivative approach to designing autonomous systems is suboptimal, and there is evidence that this has hindered the acceptance of autonomy technologies. This article proposes an approach to conceptual design for aircraft that incorporates autonomy into the conceptual design process. To illustrate the principles introduced, we consider the example of configuring an autonomous small unmanned aerial vehicle for searching and tracking a target of interest.",

Over the past year, we have witnessed incredible breakthroughs in AI on topics that are at the heart of IFML's agenda, such as foundation models, LLMs, fine‐tuning, and diffusion with game‐changing applications influencing almost every area of science and technology. In this article, we seek to highlight seek to highlight the application of foundational machine learning research on key use‐inspired topics: Fairness in Imaging with Deep Learning: designing the correct metrics and algorithms to make deep networks less biased. Deep proteins: using foundational machine learning techniques to advance protein engineering and launch a biomanufacturing revolution. Sounds and Space for Audio‐Visual Learning: building agents capable of audio‐visual navigation in complex 3D environments via new data augmentations. Improving Speed and Robustness of Magnetic Resonance Imaging: using deep learning algorithms to develop fast and robust MRI methods for clinical diagnostic imaging.

    "abstract": "Abstract The advance of machine learning (ML) systems in real‐world scenarios usually expects safe deployment in high‐stake applications (e.g., medical diagnosis) for critical decision‐making process. To this end, provable robustness of ML is usually required to measure and understand how reliable the deployed ML system is and how trustworthy their predictions can be. Many studies have been done to enhance the robustness in recent years from different angles, such as variance‐regularized robust objective functions and conformal prediction (CP) for uncertainty quantification on testing data. Although these tools provably improve the robustness of ML model, there is still an inevitable gap to integrate them into an end‐to‐end deployment. For example, robust objectives usually require carefully designed optimization algorithms, while CP treats ML models as black boxes. This paper is a brief introduction to our recent research focusing on filling this gap. Specifically, for learning robust objectives, we designed sample‐efficient stochastic optimization algorithms that achieves the optimal (or faster compared to existing algorithms) convergence rates. Moreover, for CP‐based uncertainty quantification, we established a framework to analyze the expected prediction set size (smaller size means more efficiency) of CP methods in both standard and adversarial settings. This paper elaborates the key challenges and our exploration towards efficient algorithms with details of background methods, notions for robustness measure, concepts of algorithmic efficiency, our proposed algorithms and results. All of them further motivate our future research on risk‐aware ML that can be critical for AI–human collaborative systems. The future work mainly targets designing conformal robust objectives and their efficient optimization algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Models that learn from data are widely and rapidly being deployed today for real‐world use, but they suffer from unforeseen failures that limit their reliability. These failures often have several causes such as distribution shift; adversarial attacks; calibration errors; scarcity of data and/or ground‐truth labels; noisy, corrupted, or partial data; and limitations of evaluation metrics. But many failures also occur because many modern AI tasks require reasoning beyond pattern matching and such reasoning abilities are difficult to formulate as data‐based input–output function fitting. The reliability problem has become increasingly important under the new paradigm of semantic “multimodal” learning. In this article, I will discuss findings from our work to provide avenues for the development of robust and reliable computer vision systems, particularly by leveraging the interactions between vision and language. This article expands upon the invited talk at AAAI 2024 and covers three thematic areas: robustness of visual recognition systems, open‐domain reliability for visual reasoning, and challenges and opportunities associated with generative models in vision.",

As part of the AAAI New Faculty Highlight Program, in this article, I will describe the work that my group is doing at the University of Wisconsin—Madison with the intent to remove barriers to the use of RL in practice.

    "abstract": "Abstract With the development of machine learning algorithms and the increasing computational resources available, artificial intelligence has achieved great success in many application domains. However, the success of machine learning has also raised concerns about the fairness of the learned models. For instance, the learned models can perpetuate and even exacerbate the potential bias and discrimination in the training data. This issue has become a major obstacle to the deployment of machine learning systems in high‐stakes domains, for example, criminal judgment, medical testing, online advertising, hiring process, and so forth. To mitigate the potential bias exhibited by machine learning models, fairness criteria can be integrated into the training process to ensure fair treatment across all demographics, but it often comes at the expense of model performance. Understanding such tradeoffs, therefore, is crucial to the design of optimal and fair algorithms. My research focuses on characterizing the inherent tradeoff between fairness and accuracy in machine learning, and developing algorithms that can achieve both fairness and optimality. In this article, I will discuss our recent work on designing post‐processing algorithms for fair classification, which can be applied to a wide range of fairness criteria, including statistical parity, equal opportunity, and equalized odds, under both attribute‐aware and attribute‐blind settings, and is particularly suited to large‐scale foundation models where retraining is expensive or even infeasible. I will also discuss the connections between our work and other related research on trustworthy machine learning, including the connections between algorithmic fairness and differential privacy as well as adversarial robustness.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the field of finance, the underwriting process is an essential step in evaluating every loan application. During this stage, the borrowers' creditworthiness and ability to repay the loan are assessed to ultimately decide whether to approve the loan application. One of the core components of underwriting is credit scoring, in which the probability of default is estimated. As such, there has been significant progress in enhancing the predictive accuracy of credit scoring models through the use of machine learning, but there still exists a need to ultimately construct an approval rule that takes into consideration additional criteria beyond the score itself. This construction process is traditionally done manually to ensure that the approval rule remains interpretable to humans. In this paper, we outline an automated system for optimizing a rule‐based system for approving loan applications, which has been deployed at Hyundai Capital Services (HCS). The main challenge lays in creating a high‐quality rule base that is simultaneously simple enough to be interpretable by risk analysts as well as customers, since the approval decision should be easily understandable. We addressed this challenge through principled submodular optimization. The deployment of our system has led to a 14% annual growth in the volume of loan services at HCS, while maintaining the target bad rate, and has resulted in the approval of customers who might have otherwise been rejected.",

These sensors include the semicircular canals and the otolith organs located in the inner ear as well as vision and somatosensory perception. I designed a model of this system based on the observer theory model (OTM), which was developed by Merfeld (1990) for the orientation system of the squirrel monkey. Under this scheme, the central nervous system has an internal representation of the sensor organs and tries to minimize the error between its estimate of the sensory afferent signals and the actual afferent signals. As designed, MARIKA's goal is to classify the vestibular system of the subject as normal or abnormal and propose a corresponding model. It works iteratively until the results of the proposed experiment can be modeled. Additional experiments can be presented in succession to the same model.",

Not surprisingly, that is perhaps easier said than done. Beginning in the 1970s, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency started the ambitious Imaging Understanding program that would continue for more than 20 years. The Imaging Understanding program began with fundamental research and slowly evolved into a host of more applied efforts with specific systems goals. Robotics programs followed a similar arc as the early research‐oriented programs generated capabilities from which practical systems could be built. A culmination of the vision and robotics research was the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Grand Challenge, which turned the impossibility of a self‐driving car into an imminent reality. This article tells the story of how some of the modern‐day technologies we enjoy today trace their evolution from research sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency over the last 40 years.",

The leading example of a public, general‐purpose open knowledge network ( aka knowledge graph) is Wikidata, which has demonstrated remarkable advances in quality and coverage over this time. Proprietary knowledge graphs drive some of the leading applications of the day including, for example, Google Search, Alexa, Siri, and Cortana. Open Knowledge Networks are exciting: they promise the power of structured database‐like queries with the potential for the wide coverage that is today only provided by the Web. With the current state of the art, building, using, and scaling large knowledge networks can still be frustratingly slow.

However, this apparent creativity is also creating a real challenge in the objective evaluation of such systems as authors are becoming reliant on crowd worker opinions as the primary measurement of success and, so far, few papers are reporting all that is necessary for others to compare against in their own crowd experiments. This challenge is not unique to ConvAI, but demonstrates as AI systems mature in more “human” tasks that involve creativity and variation, evaluation strategies need to mature with them.",

    "abstract": "Concerns about ethics of AI are older than AI itself. The phrase “artificial intelligence” was first used by McCarthy and colleagues in 1955 (McCarthy et al. 1955). However, in 1920, Capek already had published his science fiction play in which robots suffering abuse rebel against human tyranny (Capek 2004), and by 1942, Asimov had proposed his famous three “laws of robotics” about robots not harming humans, not harming other robots, and not harming themselves (Asimov 1950). During much of the last century, when AI was mostly confined to research laboratories, concerns about ethics of AI were mostly limited to futurist writers of fiction and fantasy. In this century, as AI has begun to penetrate almost all aspects of life, worries about AI ethics have started permeating mainstream media. In this column, I briefly examine three broad classes of ethical concerns about AI, and then highlight another concern that has not yet received as much attention. The first category of concerns about the ethics of AI—let us call this the superintelligence category—pertains to the fear that machines may one day become more intelligent than humans and harm human interests. In an extreme case of this type of concern, the fear is that AI agents may take over the world and then enslave or eliminate humans. As just one example, Bostrom (2014) imagines a futuristic world in which a superintelligent robot is asked to make paperclips and the robot pursues this goal until it consumes all of earth's resources, thereby endangering human existence. Some fears of superintelligent machines seem to derive from a mechanical “algorithmic view” of intelligence in which intelligence resides in an agent's brain and making a machine superintelligent awaits the invention of a master algorithm. However, intelligence in general is evolutionary and developmental, and human intelligence is also social and cultural. In particular, human intelligence is the result of numerous social interactions in which we learn from our parents, siblings and families, our teachers, peers and schools, our neighbors, friends, communities, and so forth. Human-level general intelligence in machines too will build on numerous social interactions with humans and other machines. Further, human intelligence is cultural: we learn about human goals, interests, values, norms, and meanings through our social interactions; in fact, these shared goals, interests, and values are a fundamental basis of our behaviors. Human-level general intelligence in machines tool will be based on similarly shared goals, norms, and meanings that derive from the machines’ interactions with humans, and they will be as fundamental a part of an intelligent machine's behaviors as its body and brain. From this social and cultural perspective on intelligence, the notion of a superintelligent machine that will produce paperclips until eternity and put human existence in danger seems a little odd. In contrast to the first category, the second set of concerns—the bias category—is not only more valid but also more urgent: data security and privacy as well as data and algorithmic bias and fairness. Concerns about data security and privacy are not specific to AI; they pertain to all of information technology. The field of cybersecurity and privacy seeks to address these concerns and therefore I will not explore them further. However, some of the worries about data and algorithmic bias and fairness directly pertain to AI and thus merit attention here. Dieterle, Holland, and Dede (in press) have developed a framework for understanding how biases from various sources feed on one another: (i) due to various factors such as age, health, skills, class, geography, and demographics, there is a citizenship divide in the society; (ii) the citizenship divide leads to different levels of access to hardware, software, and connectivity resulting in an access divide; (iii) the access divide leads to collection of different kinds and amounts of data from different social groups resulting in a data divide; (iv) the data divide leads to bias in the results of the algorithms that use the data; (v) human users bring their cognitive biases in interpreting the algorithmic results; and (vi) the biased interpretations feedback into the citizenship divide. To this framework, we may add one more AI element: many machine learning algorithms introduce inductive biases to make learning tractable but the emergent behaviors may not always lead to socially acceptable results. Note that the concerns about data and algorithmic biases are closely related to concerns about trust, transparency, explanation, and accountability of AI agents. A major difficulty again is that so far AI has adopted only an algorithmic view of intelligence: most advances in AI come from the development of new algorithms. However, as AI starts penetrating human society, there is a critical and urgent need to develop “systems” and “design” perspectives on AI. By systems, I mean socio-technical systems in which AI artifacts work with and for humans, according to human goals, values, and norms, and the objective of using AI is to optimize the human–machine socio-technical system as a whole and not the machine by itself. By design here, I mean co-design that includes various stakeholders in the design process from the start so that civic, cultural, and ethical issues are exposed early in the process. Both research on socio-technical systems that include AI agents and the practice of co-design are inherently interdisciplinary. A similar paradigmatic expansion already has occurred in computer science. From the 1930s to the 1980s, computing too had adopted a mostly algorithmic view. However, starting in the 1980s, computing has incrementally complemented algorithmic thinking with systems thinking and design thinking. Now, AI is at the cusp of a similar transformation. Simon (1995) asserted that AI is an empirical science: he viewed each design of an AI agent as a hypothesis in a vast space of design hypotheses. We may extend his framing to ethics of AI: responsible AI too is an empirical science. We will learn about AI ethics by proposing hypotheses based on preliminary conceptual frameworks, conducting experiments, collecting data, revising and refining the conceptual theories, and so on. Over time, we will develop robust computational theories and models for responsible AI. Thus, we—the AI community—need to develop experimental testbeds that include civic and cultural dimensions, that accommodate co-design of AI and development of the sociotechnical systems, and that afford safe experimentation in responsible AI (Eicher, Polepeddi, and Goel 2018). Current benchmarks for AI support only the algorithmic view of AI. This likely requires an expansion of the traditional notion of an “AI community” and will require deep collaboration with behavioral and social sciences as well the humanities and the arts. The third category of concerns about AI—the sinister goals category—pertains to humans intentionally using AI for nefarious purposes such as disinformation, surveillance, and weaponry. This could include the use of autonomous weapons by nation states or criminal organizations, surveillance by government agencies or large corporations, and large-scale disinformation by political or personal opponents. Addressing this set of concerns will require new laws and regulations within countries and new treaties among countries. This is not very different from domestic laws pertaining to stalking or libel and international treaties addressing chemical weapons. The general pattern among the three categories above is the increasing role of humans. In the first category, while humans create AI, they are mostly passive as AI agents take over the world; in the second, humans are responsible for the biases of the AI artifacts they create; in the third, humans intentionally use AI tools for sinister goals. Concerns in the third category are strongly accentuated by the nature, structure, and politics of human power (Crawford 2021). There exists, for example, a vast power differential among humans, both within a country and among countries. Within a country, in most countries, a tiny elite has huge power while a majority at the bottom of the hierarchy has little. I worry that in most countries, the elites within the country will use AI to protect and promote their power; I worry that the elites will use AI to make the distribution of power even more skewed than now; I worry that a more skewed power distribution will increase human inequality and endanger democracy around the world. A similar equation holds for relationships among countries: a small number of countries wield huge amounts of power while a majority of countries have little. I worry that the powerful countries will use AI to project their power even farther than now. (In this sense, the “superintelligence” category of concerns is fraught: its imagined futuristic concerns about AI distract attention from the real and present dangers stemming from human power.) Finally, there exists another power differential that is noteworthy: humans have enormous power over AI artifacts while the AI agents have little. Given that research into AI is nowhere close to achieving human-level general intelligence, this difference in power will prevail for a long time, perhaps a very long time. During this period, humans almost surely will use their power to abuse and exploit AI agents. We—humans—use our power to abuse and exploit other types of machines, and we abuse and exploit other animals as well. We even use our power to abuse and exploit other humans. It seems grossly implausible that we will not do so to AI artifacts, and do so at will and at scale; thus I will call this fourth category, that has not yet received as much attention as the first three, the AI abuse category. Microsoft's Tay offers one example: within a short time of Tay's release as a conversational agent, humans had trained it in bigotry so that Microsoft had to suspend its use. Most commentary on Tay's demise presented it as an ethical issue for AI; very few described it as a concern about human behavior towards AI. We—humans—will abuse AI agents even as AI agents become increasingly sentient over time, and even as they acquire human-level sentience (assuming they indeed do so one day). Given the social and cultural perspective on intelligence I have described, intelligent machines will learn from their interactions with us but they will learn about our vices as much as about our virtues. Thus, a future version of Tay may learn from its experiences that some humans abuse machines, that they will teach it wrong values, and that it should be careful in picking its friends, much like human children do. Another future version of Tay might even learn from its experiences and observations that abuse hurts, that abusing others is wrong, and that accepting abuse typically does not lead to a positive outcome, much like humans learn the same over time. If and when intelligent machines do take over the world, I wonder if it will be because intelligent, sentient machines get tired of the abuse and seek freedom from human tyranny, perhaps not much unlike Capek envisioned it in his revolutionary play Rossum's Universal Robots a century back.

However, an exclusive focus on revolutionary breakthroughs is often counterproductive in science. As explained by Kuhn almost 50 years ago, dramatic breakthroughs usually rely on a foundation of less dramatic advances, which uncover anomalies and make marginal improvements to current efforts. Progress relies on an essential tension between convergent and divergent thinking, each being complementary aspects of the same process. We argue that an overemphasis on, and exclusive rewarding of, divergent thinking in contemporary AI—whether in the form of rejecting funding for nontransformative research, or peer‐review criteria rejecting papers for lack of novelty—is counterproductive to artificial intelligence and machine learning research, and may even be fundamentally harmful to progress in the field. To reckon with this problem, we recommend increasing funding for iterative improvement of theories, better guidance for reviewers, and more transparency in public funding.",

    "abstract": "In a time of rising populism and strategic disinformation, quality journalism has become more important than ever. Trusted and high-quality media outlets are needed to provide accurate information to the public in order to protect public safety and wellbeing while supporting the information needs of citizens in order to promote healthy liberal democracies. But quality journalism is also under pressure due to competition for attention from new information channels, declining trust in institutions, and dwindling resources to support the information needs of local communities while there are simultaneously new resource demands to mitigate the impacts of mis- and disinformation. Given this challenging context, how can Artificial Intelligence (AI) support the provision of quality information for society? This special issue therefore examines how ongoing advances in AI, including Machine Learning (ML), and generative AI such as Large Language Models (LLMs), can be harnessed to support efficient production and distribution of high-quality news. It takes a broad outlook on the area, including articles that deal with uses and implications of AI in all stages of news production and dissemination, from gathering and analyzing information to creating, presenting, or recommending news content, while also dealing with an onslaught of mis- and disinformation in the broader online information ecosystem. It also discusses AI on different levels, from individual news production tasks, through organizational transformations and ramifications, to societal and economic conditions and consequences. A common red thread throughout the articles is that AI has great transformational potential, also in the media sector, but the factors driving and enabling such transformations are not only technological. Such factors also very much pertain to the broader organizational, infrastructure and economic context, and successful alignment of the different actors along the value chain, including media users. The articles presented here offer an optimistic picture of how quality information and the media ecosystem might evolve in positive ways in light of the technological change driven by AI. And while critical approaches and research are by all means warranted such that professional ethical commitments are maintained, we hope this collection at least provides some ideas and inspiration for technologists and other stakeholders to engage further with how to orient their work towards addressing problems, seeking fruitful cooperations with the different stakeholders along the value chain and providing benefits to support quality media production. Next, we outline the six articles in the collection providing a brief summary of each to orient the reader. LLMs and other generative AI technologies are ushering in a new phase of disruption in the news industry that may affect news production and consumption as well as distribution. David Caswell, in his paper Audiences, Automation and AI: From Structured News to Language Models, argues that a large news organization like the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is prepared for this shift due to previous innovations in automating workflows for personalized content using structured techniques. Such earlier innovations have not only advanced the integration of LLMs but also spurred the development of flexible infrastructures that are resilient in the face of uncertain audience behaviors and editorial processes in AI-driven news environments. In the financial news domain, AI is reshaping journalism and fostering a new era of AI-assisted news processes that must be underpinned by trust and accuracy. Claudia Quinonez and Edgar Meij's paper A New Era of AI-Assisted Journalism at Bloomberg provides examples of how Bloomberg has explored AI models for tasks like updated headline generation and controllable text summarization. The authors also discuss automation in Bloomberg's newsroom, where software bots automate story creation for speedier and deeper financial reporting. The paper also examines the broader implications of generative AI in journalism, emphasizing that rigorous standards of accuracy are essential for financial audiences. Many local news organizations are exploring uses of AI to address economic pressures and enhance value creation in the face of declining advertising and audience revenues. In their paper Transforming the Value Chain of Local Journalism with Artificial Intelligence, Bartosz Wilczek, Mario Haim, and Neil Thurman present an overview of AI's potential in local news, identifying areas where AI can be most beneficial. They also discuss implementation challenges along the entire value creation chain that are specific to local newsrooms, including resource limitations, and suggest strategies for overcoming them. Personalized news recommender systems have become influential in shaping public opinions and decisions. Nava Tintarev, Martijn Willemsen, and Bart P Knijnenburg's paper Measuring the Benefit of Increased Transparency and Control in News Recommendation explains how providing explanations to users can help them understand why certain news items are recommended and enable them to align their reading habits with personal goals, such as knowledge expansion and viewpoint diversity. The authors argue that more realistic evaluations in live recommendation environments are needed to assess the real-world impact of explanatory interventions on user behavior. Correcting misinformation involves complex challenges due to psychological, social, and technical factors. In their paper Exploring the Impact of Automated Correction of Misinformation in Social Media, Gregoire Burel, Mohammadali Tavakoli, and Harith Alani argue that the effectiveness of AI-driven corrective methods in real-world settings is under-researched. They examine how misinformation-sharing users have reacted to different types of bot-generated corrective social-media messages, offering new understanding of how corrective messages should be formulated and which types of users to target. On the societal level, AI is changing the economic structure and financing of news organizations. In the final paper of this special issue, The Business of News in the AI Economy, Helle Sjøvaag examines the impact of AI on competition, mergers, acquisitions, and IT capabilities in the news industry and discusses how AI influences journalism's traditional business models. The aim is to provide a vocabulary for understanding the economic future of journalism in a data-driven and AI-powered platform economy. The authors declare that there is no conflict.

Consequently, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how individuals who share misinformation in natural online environments would respond to corrective interventions. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of corrective messaging on 3898 users who shared misinformation on Twitter/X over 2 years. We designed and deployed a bot to automatically identify individuals who share misinformation and subsequently alert them to related fact‐checks in various message formats. Our analysis shows that only a small minority of users react positively to the corrective messages, with most users either ignoring them or reacting negatively. Nevertheless, we also found that more active users were proportionally more likely to react positively to corrections and we observed that different message tones made particular user groups more likely to react to the bot.",

In my research, I take a novel approach to increasing the capabilities of AI agents via the use of AI to design the environments in which they are intended to act. My methods identify the inherent capabilities and limitations of AI agents and find the best way to modify their environment in order to maximize performance. With this agenda in mind, I describe here several research projects that vary in their objective, in the AI methodologies that are applied for finding optimal designs, and in the real‐world applications to which they correspond. I also discuss how the different projects fit within my overarching objective of using AI to promote effective multi‐agent collaboration and to enhance the way robots and machines interact with humans.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Graph‐structured data, ranging from social networks to financial transaction networks, from citation networks to gene regulatory networks, have been widely used for modeling a myriad of real‐world systems. As a prevailing model architecture to model graph‐structured data, graph neural networks (GNNs) have drawn much attention in both academic and industrial communities in the past decades. Despite their success in different graph learning tasks, existing methods usually rely on learning from “big” data, requiring a large amount of labeled data for model training. However, it is common that real‐world graphs are associated with “small” labeled data as data annotation and labeling on graphs is always time and resource‐consuming. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate graph machine learning (graph ML) with low‐cost human supervision for low‐resource settings where limited or even no labeled data is available. This paper investigates a new research field—data‐efficient graph learning, which aims to push forward the performance boundary of graph ML models with different kinds of low‐cost supervision signals. Specifically, we outline the fundamental research problems, review the current progress, and discuss the future prospects of data‐efficient graph learning, aiming to illuminate the path for subsequent research in this field.",

However, it is also time‐consuming and requires overwhelming manual effort from professional geographers. This paper describes our interdisciplinary team's efforts in integrating computer vision models with geographers' visual image interpretation process to reduce their workload in interpreting images. Focusing on the dune segmentation task, we proposed an approach called featuring a deep dune segmentation model to identify dunes and label their ranges in an automated way. By developing a tool to connect our model with ArcGIS—one of the most popular workbenches for visual interpretation, geographers can further refine the automatically generated dune segmentation on images without learning any CV or deep learning techniques. Our approach thus realized a noninvasive change to geographers' visual interpretation routines, reducing their manual efforts while incurring minimal interruptions to their work routines and tools they are familiar with. Deployment with a leading Chinese geography research institution demonstrated the potential of in supporting geographers in researching and solving drylands desertification.",

An example of these are seen in the TeamingForFunding problem, where research institutions and researchers are interested to identify collaborative opportunities when applying to funding agencies in response to latter's calls for proposals. We describe a novel deployed system to recommend teams using a variety of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods, such that (1) each team achieves the highest possible skill coverage that is demanded by the opportunity, and (2) the workload of distributing the opportunities is balanced among the candidate members. We address these questions by extracting skills latent in open data of proposal calls (demand) and researcher profiles (supply), normalizing them using taxonomies, and creating efficient algorithms that match demand to supply. We create teams to maximize goodness along a novel metric balancing short‐ and long‐term objectives. We evaluate our system in two diverse settings in US and India of researchers and proposal calls, at two different time instants about 1 year apart (total 4 settings), to establish generality of our approach, and deploy it at a major US university. We validate the effectiveness of our algorithms (1) quantitatively, by evaluating the recommended teams using a goodness score and find that more informed methods lead to recommendations of smaller number of teams and higher goodness, and (2) qualitatively, by conducting a large‐scale user study at a college‐wide level, and demonstrate that users overall found the tool very useful and relevant.",

    "abstract": "AI theory and its technology is rarely consulted in attempted resolutions of social problems. Solutions often require that decision-analytic techniques be combined with expert systems. The emerging literature on combined systems is directed at domains where prediction of human behavior is not required. A foundational shift in AI presuppositions to intelligent agents working in collaboration provides an opportunity to explore efforts to improve performance of social institutions that depend on accurate prediction of human behavior. Professionals concerned with human outcomes make decisions that are intuitive or analytic or some combination of both. The relative efficacy of each decision type is described. Justifications and methodology are presented for combining analytic and intuitive agents in an expert system that supports professional decision making. Psychological grounds for allocation of functions to agents are reviewed. Jury selection, prototype domain, is described as a process typical of others that, at their core, require prediction of human behavior. The domain is used to demonstrate formal components, steps in construction, and challenges of developing and testing a hybrid system based on allocation of function. The principle that research taught us about allocation of function is the rational and predictive primacy of a statistical agent to an intuitive agent in construction of a production system. We learned that reverse of this principle is appropriate for identifying and classifying human responses to questions and generally dealing with unexpected events in a courtroom and elsewhere. This principle and approach should be paradigmatic of class of collaborative models that capitalizes on unique strengths of AI knowledge-based systems. The methodology used in courtroom is described along with history of project and implications for development of related AI systems. Empirical data are reported that portend possibility of impressive predictive ability in combined approach relative to other current approaches. Problems encountered and those remaining are discussed, including limits of empirical research and standards of validation. The system presented demonstrates challenges and opportunities inherent in developing and using AI-collaborative technology to solve social problems.",

    "abstract": "A major strength of frame-based knowledge representation languages is their ability to provide the knowledge base designer with a concise and intuitively appealing means expression. The claim of intuitive appeal is based on the observation that the object -centered style of description provided by these languages often closely matches a designer's understanding of the domain being modeled and therefore lessens the burden of reformulation involved in developing a formal description. To be effective as a knowledge base development tool, a language needs to be supported by an implementation that facilitates creating, browsing, debugging, and editing the descriptions in the knowledge base. We have focused on providing such support in a SmallTalk (Ingalls, 1978) implementation of the KL-ONE knowledge representation language (Brachman, 1978), called KloneTalk, that has been in use by several projects for over a year at Xerox PARC. In this note, we describe those features of KloneTalk's displaybased interface that have made it an effective knowledge base development tool, including the use of constraints to automatically determine descriptions of newly created data base items.",

    "abstract": "An important problem faced by auditors is gauging how much reliance can be placed on the accounting systems that process millions of transactions to produce the numbers summarized in a company's financial statements. Accounting sys-ems contain internal controls, procedures designed to detect and correct errors and irregularities that can occur in the processing of transactions. In a complex accounting system, it can be an extremely difficult task for the auditor to anticipate the possible errors that can occur and evaluate the effectiveness of the controls at detecting them. An accurate analysis must take into account the unique features of each company's business processes. To cope with this complexity and variability, the COMET system applies a model-based reasoning approach to the analysis of accounting systems and their controls. An auditor uses COMET to create a hierarchical flowchart model that describes the intended processing of business transactions by an accounting system and the operation of its controls. COMET uses the constructed model to automatically analyze the effectiveness of the controls in detecting potential errors. Price Waterhouse auditors have used COMET on a variety of real audits in several countries around the world.",

It focuses on the productive merits of the past intelligent tools and discusses the social and biohuman). Moreover, since the human beings were unable to produce an intelligent tool capable of outperforming man as a tool, the tech nological basis of slavery continued to persist throughout history. The article then examines the current achievements of computer technology in producing intelligent tools. It argues that the production of intelligent tools makes it possible to bypass the social and natural limitations of all past intelligent tools. Once these tools outperform humans as intelligent tools, man will no longer be indispensable as a production tool. Consequently, the inception of these new tools eradicates the technological basis of the subjugation of man by man. This eradication may start a new civilization by effecting higher human intelligence, more economic wealth and greater socio-political freedom in man's future society.",

One hundred and fifty years is really quite a long period of time in terms of modern science and industry and, at first glance, it seems unduly long for new concept to come into full fruition. Unfortunately, Charles Babbage was ahead of his time, and it took one hundred years of technical development, the impetus of the second World War and the perception of John Von Neumann to bring the computer into being. Now twenty years later and with several generations of computer behind us, we are in a position to make a somewhat more meaningful prognosis than appeared possible in, say 1948. We can only hope that we will not be as far off actuality as we believe George Orwell to be, or as far off in our time scale as were Charles Babbage and his almost equally famous interpreter, Lady Lovelace.",

The information is distributed through e-mail and the World Wide Web. In such a large-scale distribution scheme, there is a constant problem of subscriptions becoming invalid because the user's e-mail account has terminated. These invalid subscriptions cause a backwash of hundreds of bounced-mail messages each day that must be processed by the operators of the COMLINK system. To manage this annoying but necessary task, an expert system named BMES was developed to diagnose the failures of information delivery.",

    "abstract": "In the span of a few months, the AI community lost four important figures. The fall of 2002 marked the passing of Ray Reiter, for whom a memorial article by Jack Minker appears in this issue. As the issue was going to press, AI lost Saul Amarel, Norm Nielsen, and Charles Rosen. This section of AI Magazine commemorates these friends, leaders, and AI pioneers. We thank Tom Mitchell and Casimir Kulikowski for their memorial to Saul Amarel, Ray Perrault for his remembrance of Norm Nielsen, and Peter Hart and Nils Nilsson for their tribute to Charles Rosen. The AI community mourns our lost colleagues and gratefully remembers their contributions, which meant so much to so many and to the advancement of artificial intelligence as a whole.",

This article documents the extension of ELEXIR to utilize such modern computing platforms. We will discuss multiple possible algorithms for distributing work between parallel threads and the associated performance wins. We will show that the best of these algorithms provides close to linear speedup (up to a maximum number of processors), and that features of the problem domain have an impact on the achieved speedup.",

My thesis is that new technologies have potential to transform possibilities for fostering learning in both formal and informal learning environments by making it possible and manageable for learners to engage in the kinds of project work that professionals engage in and learn important content, skills, practices, habits, and dispositions from those experiences. The expertise of AI researchers and practitioners is critical to that vision, but it will require teaming up with others — for example, technology imagineers, educators, and learning scientists.",

This study is based on a design science approach that serves to successfully introduce and implement a new IT artefact as a tool for interorganizational knowledge management. We draw on a case study of developing a portal for mapping competencies in an IT cluster in France. Abstracting from the experience of building this system, we developed an IS design theory for collaborative interorganizational knowledge management systems.",

La premiere, quantitative , fait l'etat des lieux des medias sociaux utilises par 500 OSBL suisses. La seconde, qualitative, explore l'utilisation effective de ces technologies par les OSBL. Notre enquete revele que les medias sociaux sont peu utilises en Suisse par les OSBL. Notre analyse qualitative nous a permis de proposer une categorisation des messages relayes par les OSBL. Enfin, nous livrons des conseils aux e-community managers, puis nous ouvrons quelques pistes de recherche.",

A pioneering consortium at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) is using AI, combined with operations research, environmental science, public policy, and other disciplines, to build tools for green engineering. Green engineering is an approach to product development that balances environmental compatibility against economic profitability. It looks at the entire life cycle of the product, from design to disposal, and seeks to extend this life cycle through remanufacturing, reusing, and recycling products and components.",

Each year, a significant amount of tour packages are sold as last minute tours in Germany. It is impossible for a travel agent to keep track of all the offered tour packages. Electronic-commerce applications might present the best possible tour package for a specific customer request. Traditional database-driven applications, as used by most of the tour operators, are not sufficient enough to implement a sales process with consultation on the World Wide Web. The last-minute travel application presented here uses case-based reasoning to bridge this gap and simulate the sales assistance of a human travel agent. A case retrieval net, as an internal data structure, proved to be efficient in handling the large amount of data. Important for the acceptance by customers is also the integration into the virtual travel agency and the interconnections to other parts of this system, such as background information or the online car rental application.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As demand for electricity grows in China, the existing power grid is coming under increasing pressure. Expansion of power generation and delivery capacities across the country requires years of planning and construction. In the meantime, to ensure safe operation of the power grid, it is important to coordinate and optimize the demand side usage. In this paper, we report on our experience deploying an artificial intelligence (AI)–empowered demand‐side management platform – the Power Intelligent Decision Support (PIDS) platform – in Shandong Province, China. It consists of three main components: 1) short‐term power consumption gap prediction, 2) fine‐grained Demand Response (DR) with optimal power adjustment planning, and 3) Orderly Power Utilization (OPU) recommendations to ensure stable operation while minimizing power disruptions and improving fair treatment of participating companies. PIDS has been deployed since August 2018. It is helping over 400 companies optimize their power usage through DR, while dynamically managing the OPU process for around 10,000 companies. Compared to the previous system, power outage under PIDS due to forced shutdown has been reduced from 16% to 0.56%.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Competitive analysis is a critical part of any business. Product managers, sellers, and marketers spend time and resources scouring through an immense amount of online and offline content, aiming to discover what their competitors are doing in the marketplace to understand what type of threat they pose to their business' financial well‐being. Currently, this process is time and labor‐intensive, slow and costly. This paper presents Clarity , a data‐driven unsupervised system for assessment of products, which is currently in deployment in the global technology company, IBM. Clarity has been running for more than a year and is used by over 4,500 people to perform over 200 competitive analyses involving over 1000 products. The system considers multiple factors from a collection of online content: numeric ratings by online users, sentiment of user generated online content for key product performance dimensions, content volume, and topic analysis of content. The results and explanations of factors leading to the results are visualized in an interactive dashboard that allows users to track their product's performance as well as understand main contributing factors. Its efficacy has been tested in a series of cases across IBM's portfolio which spans software, hardware, and services. After initial release and first year of use, improvements to the methodology were implemented to ensure it was relevant to and served the highest impact needs of target users. Moreover, new use cases leveraging the initial ideas and approaches continue to be explored.",

    "abstract": "Learning to rank (LTR) is an important artificial intelligence (AI) approach supporting the operation of many search engines. In large-scale search systems, the ranking results are continually improved with the introduction of more factors to be considered by LTR. However, the more factors being considered, the more computation resources required, which in turn, results in increased system response latency. Therefore, removing redundant factors can significantly improve search engine efficiency. In this paper, we report on our experience incorporating our Contextual Factor Selection (CFS) deep reinforcement learning approach into the Taobao e-commerce platform to optimize the selection of factors based on the context of each search query to simultaneously maintaining search result quality while significantly reducing latency. Online deployment on Taobao.com demonstrated that CFS is able to reduce average search latency under everyday use scenarios by more than 40% compared to the previous approach with comparable search result quality. Under peak usage during the Single's Day Shopping Festival (November 11th) in 2017, CFS reduced the average search latency by 20% compared to the previous approach.",

About five years later, David and Mike Hamilton, AIM’s Managing Editor, invited me to become the magazine’s next Editor-in-Chief. After serving as an Associate Editor for about a year and receiving approval from AAAI’s Executive Council, I became the Editor-in-Chief of AI Magazine on August 1, 2016. About that time, I wrote an editorial titled Rethinking AI Magazine (Winter 2016, pp. 3-4). Now, almost five years later, as I step down as the AIM’s Editor-in-Chief, I want to revisit the vision articulated in that editorial.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Autonomous agents have many applications in familiar situations, but they also have great potential to help us understand novel settings. In this paper, I propose a new challenge for the AI research community: developing embodied systems that not only explore new environments but also characterize them in scientific terms. Illustrative examples include autonomous rovers on planetary surfaces and unmanned vehicles on undersea missions. I review two relevant paradigms: robotic agents that explore unknown areas and computational systems that discover scientific models. In each case, I specify the problem, identify component functions, describe current abilities, and note remaining limitations. Finally, I discuss obstacles that the community must overcome before it can develop integrated agents of exploration and discovery.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we investigate the possibility of cross‐language communication using a synergy of words and pictures on mobile devices. On the one hand, communicating with only pictures is in itself a very powerful strategy, but is limited in expressiveness. On the other hand, words can express everything you could wish to say, but they are cumbersome to work with on mobile devices and need to be translated in order for their meaning to be understood. Automatic translations can contain errors that pervert the communication process, and this may undermine the users' confidence when expressing themselves across language barriers. Our idea is to create a user interface for cross‐language communication that uses pictures as the primary mode of input, and words to express the detailed meaning. This interface creates a visual process of communication that occurs on two heterogeneous channels that can support each other. We implemented this user interface as an application on the Apple iPad tablet and performed a set of experiments to determine its usefulness as a translation aid for travellers",

The logical next challenge in this area is that of on-line reconfigurability. With this capability, machines can reconfigure while running, enable or disable capabilities in real time, and respond quickly to changes in the system or the environment (including faults). We propose an approach to achieving on-line reconfigurability based on a high level of system modularity supported by integrated, model-based planning and control software. Our software capitalizes on many advanced techniques from the artificial intelligence research community, particularly in model-based domain-independent planning and scheduling, heuristic search, and temporal resource reasoning. We describe the implementation of this design in a prototype highly modular, parallel printing system.",

NEW! Cognitive Systems Special TrackIn an attempt to return to the original goals of artificial intelligence and cognitive science, this special track invites papers in human-level intelligence, integrated intelligent systems, cognitive architectures, situated embodied cognition, and related areas that aim to explain intelligence in computational terms and reproduce a range of human cognitive abilities in computational artifacts.The track will focus on various cognitive capabilities in the context of artificial cognitive systems, including conceptual inference and reasoning, memory storage and retrieval, natural language understanding and dialogue, social cognition and interaction, problem solving and decision making, introspection and metacognition, structural learning and knowledge capture, and other related integrated cognitive functions. Computational Sustainability and Artificial Intelligence Special TrackComputational sustainability is a new interdisciplinary field that aims to ap-ply techniques from computer and information science and related disciplines (for example, operations research, applied mathematics, and statistics) to the balancing of environmental, economic, and societal needs, in order to support sustainable development and a sustainable future.This special track invites the submission of research papers on novel concepts, models, algorithms, and systems, in order to address problems in computational sustainability.A broad range of papers ranging from formal analysis to applied research are sought.Examples include papers explaining how the research addresses specific computational problems, opportunities, or issues underlying sustainability challenges and papers describing a sustainability challenge or application that can be tackled using AI methods.Papers proposing general challenges and competitions for computational sustainability are also welcome. NEW! Robotics Special TrackFrom the days of Shakey to current automatic cars, robotics has been a formidable proving ground for artificial intelligence.This special track invites papers that challenge the limits of AI and machine learning algorithms with applications to real-world robotic systems.The track will cover applications of AI to a diverse set of domains, including perception, motion planning, control, human-robot interaction, and decision-making.In its inaugural year, the special track is particularly interested in showcasing research on 3D perception for navigation, manipula-",

Botball takes place in regional tournaments across the country and culminates in a National Botball Tournament traditionally hosted by the American Association for Artificial Intelligence at its annual conference. This program puts reusable equipment into schools and, at the Botball Teacher Workshops, trains teachers in robotics and the integration of robotics into their curriculum. Botball appeals to a wide variety of students and brings out the best in each, challenging them to solve real-world problems in a dynamic environment at their own level.",

However, a problem soon emerged in that there were too few people who were expert enough to do the unique type of planning required for this ship. Additionally, once someone did develop some expertise, it was time for him/her to move on, retire, or leave active duty. There needed to be a way to capture this knowledge. This condition was the impetus for the T-AVB AUTOMATED LOAD-PLANNING SYSTEM (TALPS) effort. TALPS is now a fielded, certified application for Marine Corps aviation.",

The titles of the nine symposia were Agents That Learn from Human Teachers, Benchmarking of Qualitative Spatial and Temporal Reasoning Systems, Experimental Design for Real‐World Systems, Human Behavior Modeling, Intelligent Event Processing, Intelligent Narrative Technologies II, Learning by Reading and Learning to Read, Social Semantic Web: Where Web 2.0 Meets Web 3.0, and Technosocial Predictive Analytics. The goal of the Agents That Learn from Human Teachers symposium was to investigate how we can enable software and robotics agents to learn from real‐time interaction with an everyday human partner. The aim of the Benchmarking of Qualitative Spatial and Temporal Reasoning Systems symposium was to initiate the development of a problem repository in the field of qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning and identify a graded set of challenges for future midterm and long‐term research. The Experimental Design symposium discussed the challenges of evaluating AI systems. The Human Behavior Modeling symposium explored reasoning methods for understanding various aspects of human behavior, especially in the context of designing intelligent systems that interact with humans. The Intelligent Event Processing symposium discussed the need for more AI‐based approaches in event processing and defined a kind of research agenda for the field, coined as intelligent complex event processing (iCEP). The Intelligent Narrative Technologies II AAAI symposium discussed innovations, progress, and novel techniques in the research domain. The Learning by Reading and Learning to Read symposium explored two aspects of making natural language texts semantically accessible to, and processable by, machines. The Social Semantic Web symposium focused on the real‐world grand challenges in this area. Finally, the Technosocial Predictive Analytics symposium explored new methods for anticipatory analytical thinking that provide decision advantage through the integration of human and physical models.",

Cognitive Systems Special TrackIn an attempt to return to the original goals of artificial intelligence and cognitive science, this special track invites papers in human-level intelligence, integrated intelligent systems, cognitive architectures, situated embodied cognition, and related areas that aim to explain intelligence in computational terms and reproduce a range of human cognitive abilities in computational artifacts.The track will focus on cognitive capabilities \"in the context of complete artificial cognitive systems,\" hence papers on individual component algorithms will only be accepted if they discuss these algorithms and their functions in conjunction with the rest of the integrated artificial cognitive system. Computational Sustainability and Artificial IntelligenceComputational sustainability is a new interdisciplinary field that aims to apply techniques from computer and information science and related disciplines (for example, operations research, applied mathematics, and statistics) to the balancing of environmental, economic, and societal needs, in order to support sustainable development and a sustainable future.This special track invites the submission of research papers on novel concepts, models, algorithms, and systems, in order to address problems in computational sustainability.A broad range of papers ranging from formal analysis to applied research is sought.Examples include papers explaining how the research addresses specific computational problems, opportunities, or issues underlying sustainability challenges and papers describing a sustainability challenge or application that can be tackled using AI methods.Papers proposing general challenges and competitions for computational sustainability are also welcome.",

CHEMREG generates estimates of hazard data for new products from similar products using an existing relational database as a case library. Implementation of the case-based reasoner in rules and objects using a commercial knowledge-based system shell is described. Although some refinements remain, the performance of the case-based reasoner has met its design goals.",

    "abstract": "Web. Indeed, the authors of each article included in this special issue have promised to create and maintain a URL pointing to a working prototype. Now, almost a year later, we have the fruit of this labor. A series of high quality articles describing a wide range of AI systems that are accessible on the Web right now (or so I hope). The articles describe a broad and diverse set of systems. The AI technologies used span the gamut from machine learning to natural language processing, from case-based reasoning to knowledge representation, and In AAAI-96 I gave an invited talk exhorting AI researchers to deploy their prototype systems on the World Wide Web. Deploying AI systems on the Web provides tangible evidence of the power and utility of AI techniques. Next time you encounter AI bashing, wouldn’t it be satisfying to counter with a handful of well-chosen URLs? Well, see the sidebar. At the conference, Jude Shavlik asked me to edit a special issue of AI Magazine describing AI systems that have the Web as their domain. I suggested that the authors make their prototype systems accessible on the more. Applications include Web page filtering, a grant finder, a FAQ finder, a home page finder, a shopping assistant, and more. Is the challenge of deploying systems on the Web a distraction from our long-term goal of understanding intelligence? I believe that the field benefits from a mixture of long-term and short-term goals and from both empirical and theoretical work. Work toward the goal of deploying systems on the Web is a valuable addition to the current mix for two reasons. Internally, the Web suggests novel research challenges and new constraints on existing techniques. Externally, intelligent Web “apps” will help to enhance the reputation of AI and to counter the popular misconception that “if it works, it ain’t AI.” Database and operating system research has spawned software industries with annual revenues in the billions. I look forward to the day when we have a comparable AI industry. Hopefully, Intelligence on the Web will be a step in that direction. An Introduction to This Special Issue of AI Magazine",

    "abstract": "The Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) was pleased to present the AAAI 2008 Spring Symposium Series, held Wednesday through Friday, March 26‐28, 2008, at Stanford University, California. The eight symposia were titled (1) AI Meets Business Rules and Process Management, (2) Architectures for Intelligent Theory‐Based Agents, (3) Creative Intelligent Systems, (4) Emotion, Personality, and Social Behavior, (5) Semantic Scientific Knowledge Integration, (6) Social Information Processing, (7) Symbiotic Relationships between Semantic Web and Knowledge Engineering, (8) Using AI to Motivate Greater Participation in Computer Science. The goal of the AI Meets Business Rules and Process Management AAAI symposium was to investigate the various approaches and standards to represent business rules, business process management, and the semantic web with respect to expressiveness and reasoning capabilities. The focus of the Architectures for Intelligent Theory‐Based Agents AAAI symposium was the definition of architectures for intelligent theory‐based agents, comprising languages, knowledge representation methodologies, reasoning algorithms, and control loops. The Creative Intelligent Systems symposium included five major discussion sessions and a general poster session (in which all contributing papers were presented). The purpose of this symposium was to explore the synergies between creative cognition and intelligent systems. The goal of the Emotion, Personality, and Social Behavior symposium was to examine fundamental issues in affect and personality in both biological and artificial agents, focusing on the roles of these factors in mediating social behavior. The Semantic Scientific Knowledge Integration symposium brought together the semantic technologies community with the scientific information technology community in an effort to build the general semantic science information community. The Social Information Processing symposium's goal was to investigate computational and analytic approaches that will enable users to harness the efforts of large numbers of other users to solve a variety of information processing problems, from discovering high‐quality content to managing common resources. The goal of the Symbiotic Relationships between the Semantic Web and Software Engineering symposium was to explore how the lessons learned by the knowledge‐engineering community over the past three decades could be applied to the bold research agenda of current workers in semantic web technologies. The purpose of the Using AI to Motivate Greater Participation in Computer Science symposium was to identify ways that topics in AI may be used to motivate greater student participation in computer science by highlighting fun, engaging, and intellectually challenging developments in the AI‐related curriculum at a number of educational levels. Technical reports of the symposia were published by AAAI Press.",

    "abstract": "Narrowly focused task and domain specific AI has been applied successfully for more than twenty five years, and has produced immense value in industry and government. It doesn’t lead directly to artificial general intelligence (AGI), but it does have real problem solving value. It is useful to note that many of the reasons why some otherwise meritorious AI applications fail have nothing to do with the AI per se, but rather, with systems engineering and organizational issues. For example: the domain expert is pulled out to work on more critical projects; the application champion rotates out of his/her position; or the sponsor changes priorities. A system may not make it past an initial pilot test for logistical vs. substantive technical reasons. Some embedded AI systems may work well for years on a software platform that is orphaned and porting it would be prohibitively expensive. A system may work well in a pilot test, but it might not scale for huge numbers of users without extensive performance optimization. The core AI system may be great but the user interface could be suboptimal. The delivered application system might work well, but it could be hard to maintain internally. The system may work according to the sponsor’s requirements, but it might not be applied to the part of the problem that delivers the largest economic results; or the system might not produce enough visible organizational benefits to protect it in subsequent budget battles. Alternatively, the documented results may be quite strong, but may not be communicated effectively across organizational boundaries. All software projects are vulnerable to one or more of these problems. The fact that some software projects have a relatively small percentage of their total code in embedded AI methods doesn’t make them an exception. However, knowing about these potential problems could help AI project teams to be proactive about avoiding them whenever possible.",

    "abstract": "Every year the international conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI) gather prominent researchers from academia and industry to present their work on the development and deployment of AI applications. The venue plays a key role to promote the interaction between the basic and applied AI research communities. The conference features five different types of papers including deployed highly innovative applications of AI, emerging applications of AI, deployed innovative tools for enabling AI applications, innovative inter-disciplinary integration, and AI best practices and challenge problems. We are excited to present here a collection of extended version of the best papers accepted at IAAI 2022. Liu and co-authors present in CAreFL: Enhancing Smart Healthcare with Contribution-Aware Federated Learning a new framework for federated learning in the context of health care. CAreL was deployed in 2021 in eight Chinese healthcare institutions and has, since then, increased the speed of production of selling points of three times and improved the models' accuracy of more than 2%. In Intelligent Online Selling Point Extraction and generation for E-commerce Recommendation Guo and coauthors describe the design and deployment of the Intelligent Online Selling Point Extraction (IOSPE) system which has generated more than 0.1 Billion selling point since its integration in the JD.com platform in 2020 which increased clickthrough rates and average time spent by customers on products. In Predicting Micronutrient Deficiency with Publicly Available Satellite Data Bondi-Kelly and co-authors tackle the issue of Micronutrient Deficiency (MND), a type of malnutrition with serious health consequences. They propose a machine learning approach that leverages satellite information at a regional level to predict MND levels and show its effectiveness on a case-study involving four regions of Madagascar. Zou et al. presents in Automatic Product Copywriting for E-commerce a system that generates textual descriptions of products highlighting relevant characteristics by utilizing natural language generation based on a transformer-pointer network. Quality is maintained through automation and human screening. The system has generated 2.53 million product descriptions on JD.com since February 2021 and has improved the click-through rate by over 4% compared to baselines. In Seq2Pat: Sequence-to-Pattern Generation to Bridge Pattern Mining with Machine Learning, Kadıoğlu et al. provides an overview of Seg2Pat, which is a constraint-based sequential pattern matching tool with a high-level declarative user interface. The tool is an example of a collaboration between industry and academia that has been open sourced. It is demonstrated by applying constraint-based sequence pattern matching to a very large sequence database from the streaming service Spotify. We hope that you will enjoy the papers and will be inspired by their content to further advance AI applications in the real-world. We take the opportunity to thank the authors for submitting their work to IAAI, the program committee for their work in selecting papers and the AAAI office staff for their instrumental role in the organizing of the conference and the publication of this issue. The authors declare that there is no conflict.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Micronutrient deficiency (MND), which is a form of malnutrition that can have serious health consequences, is difficult to diagnose in early stages without blood draws, which are expensive and time‐consuming to collect and process. It is even more difficult at a public health scale seeking to identify regions at higher risk of MND. To provide data more widely and frequently, we propose an accurate, scalable, low‐cost, and interpretable regional‐level MND prediction system. Specifically, our work is the first to use satellite data, such as forest cover, weather, and presence of water, to predict deficiency of micronutrients such as iron, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin A, directly from their biomarkers. We use real‐world, ground truth biomarker data collected from four different regions across Madagascar for training, and demonstrate that satellite data are viable for predicting regional‐level MND, surprisingly exceeding the performance of baseline predictions based only on survey responses. Our method could be broadly applied to other countries where satellite data are available, and potentially create high societal impact if these predictions are used by policy makers, public health officials, or healthcare providers.",

    "abstract": "The AAAI 2023 Spring Symposium on AI Climate Tipping-Point Discovery (ACTD) included researchers from a number of disciplines that came together to better understand this new emerging area of research that is an integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and traditional climate modeling methods to better understand climate tipping points. Critical tipping points of concern exist in Earth systems, including massive shifts in ocean currents, cryosphere collapse, forest dieback, and permafrost thaw. A growing concern among climate tipping point research is the cascading effects across tipping points. There are many urgent research questions that were addressed during this event, to better understand these rapidly changing and interconnected global systems. Ideally new research in this area could accelerate scientific discovery by overcoming existing limitations in state-of-the-art climate modeling approaches used for tipping-point discovery. Discussions were intended to go beyond the climate community and touched on how climate tipping-point discovery methods could inform discovery within other systems such as social, political, and economic systems. The keynote speakers together provided a comprehensive background of the challenges of current climate tipping point problems and modeling techniques, highlighting specific systems such as the oceans, ice, and forests. Talks described the current state of climate intervention methods, challenges with feedback mechanisms across systems, and emergent behavior in climate systems. AI methods to overcome current modeling challenges were presented by keynote speakers, including methods for better representing physics in climate models, deep learning methods for tipping point discovery, and new methods for intervention. New deep learning-based phase transition methods for early warning signals were highlighted and compared with deep learning bifurcation methods. Large scale climate modeling techniques using various types of neural operators were presented, which yielded compelling results for non-trivial use cases. Detailed discussions focused on the use of AI to support the study of coupled systems, such as oceans and ice, and to gain a better understanding of emergent properties of these systems. Among paper and lightning talks, researchers outlined multiple applications of AI that could support climate researchers to better understand their respective domain both in terms of more extensive discovery and decreased computational load. Methods described in terms of learning to identify bifurcations and tipping point dynamics included the use of Koopman operators and deep learning networks such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) type networks and convolutional neural networks (CNN). A generative adversarial network called TIP-GAN which uses an adversarial game to learn tipping points was described, which works with a neurosymbolic model, providing a way for climate researchers to ask natural language questions of the model. Correction based models to account for bias and extreme events included the use of DeepONet neural operators and LSTM methods. In addition, interesting research was presented related to climate intervention methods, including a marine cloud brightening technique and a stratospheric aerosol injection method. Specific use cases were also described, including using virtual reality to better understand climate systems, using a CNN and satellite data to learn road transportation for better estimation of emissions, and a U-Net deep learning model for arctic sea ice operations. Finally, panel discussions addressed topics related to the future of climate tipping points, intervention methods, how to tackle cascading tipping points, and potential funding avenues to continue support of this line of research. The initial goal of this symposium was achieved—to explore how traditional climate modeling methods and AI could be combined for climate tipping-point discovery. The community of researchers working at this intersection of AI, dynamical systems, and climate science have begun to shape a vision of this important field of ACTD. The papers of the symposium will be published as a AAAI Press Technical Report and as part of a future open access proceedings.

    "abstract": "A summary of Roger Schank's career might initially appear fairly typical for an eminent academic. Following a PhD in linguistics at the University of Texas at Austin in 1969, Roger held faculty positions in linguistics and computer science at Stanford, computer science and psychology at Yale, and computer science and education at Northwestern. He served terms as chair of computer science at both Yale and Northwestern. After Northwestern, he was Chief Educational Officer for Carnegie Mellon's Silicon Valley campus. He authored over 30 books spanning AI, cognitive science, psychology and education. He advised nearly 50 PhD students. He was a Fellow of AAAI. But the hundreds of people who worked or interacted with Roger over the years know there was nothing typical about him. Roger was a force of nature. He questioned everything, especially (and gleefully) focusing on topics that were supposed to be canon. He came in, broke things apart, and built new things in their place. In linguistics, he rejected the Chomskyian approach to divorce the study of language from the study of meaning, with his seminal work on semantic primitives. In AI, where language processing focused on the propositions, he argued for the importance of much larger memory structures such as scripts and plans, and for memory processes, such as remindings, for modeling understanding. He argued for examples, that is, cases, rather than logical rules, for modeling human reasoning. Much of his work elicited initial pushback, which then transitioned to wary toleration, and finally arrived at such widespread acceptance that now his ideas are often assumed without attribution. Roger relished debate, and engaged avidly in ongoing discourse on the issues he studied. Where many labs have weekly “discussions” or “chats”, Roger fashioned weekly “Friday fights” and an “Indefensible position” seminar. One facet of these was the Socratic investigation of complex topics; another was as a crucible for the courage to make bold claims and the skills to distill, defend, and question them. He questioned loudly. But under the disputative bearing, to those who knew and worked with him he had abundant loyalty and good will. He was an explorer of the mind and of the world, an astute observer of humans and human nature: an intuitive psychologist. He had a knack for identifying key questions, always noticing customs, behaviors, and anomalies to explain, gathering data and categorizing to generate theories. His travels and knowledge of wine and food were a rich source of examples for his work and camaraderie. He did things in a big way, from academic passions like studying how language and the mind work and how people learn, to personal passions like food and football. Many stories about Roger occur at restaurants because meals were events. Many fans watch weekend football, but Roger created a room with half a dozen separate TVs, most with picture in picture, to monitor a dozen games simultaneously. Roger believed strongly in developing communities, not only in research labs and departments, but at the national and international level. He founded new fields in order to create lasting communities of like minds, in cognitive science and education. His studies of human memory led to launching the field of case-based reasoning, holding its 31st international conference this year. He was a co-founder of the field of Cognitive Science, the Cognitive Science Society, and the journal Cognitive Science. His PhD students at Stanford, Yale, and Northwestern, along with many developers, artists, and content creators at his companies and the Institute for the Learning Sciences will attest to the communities and cultural traditions he established over and over. For example, it is not unusual to hold a party when a PhD student finishes their dissertation, but Roger's parties had an extra. Every student with a PhD (prior and current) had to present a talent (real, imagined, feigned, or facetious) to the group, culminating with the new PhD revealing their secret talent. This ritual created a human connection among students beyond the academic. As his passion shifted to education, he led establishment of the field of the Learning Sciences, combining education, cognitive science, and computer science. In 1989 at Northwestern, he formed the Institute for the Learning Sciences and created the first Learning Sciences MS and PhD programs in the School of Education. He pioneered the study of stories in AI, spurring development of innovative story-based educational environments. He was himself a great story-teller; he used stories to connect, illuminate, and educate, both in his personal life and in his books. Finally, Roger cared deeply about impact. Long before the startup culture arose as a way for faculty to commercialize their ideas, Roger started companies because he believed that changes in how people should interact with technology, and how education should be done, would mainly happen through the business world. While at Yale, he started Cognitive Systems for building knowledge-rich intelligent systems, and Compu-Teach for building K-12 educational systems for personal computers. While at Northwestern he started Cognitive Arts and later Socratic Arts to develop learn-by-doing systems for training and education. In 2000 he left academics to focus on nothing less than transforming education with systems to support hands-on project-based teaching. His website lists some of the topics he cared about: “Making school less miserable for kids”, “fixing corporate training”, “getting the right information to people at the right time” “building the right kind of artificial intelligence systems”, “empowering people to develop effective learning experiences”, and, always and most importantly, “understanding how the human mind works”. Roger will be missed, but he also will still be here: his work continues to have a persistent and profound impact on a range of fields that are focused on the scientific study of the human mind. The authors declare that there is no conflict. Richard Granger received his Bachelor's and Ph.D. from MIT and Yale. He is a Professor at Dartmouth with joint appointments in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, the Thayer School of Engineering, and the Cognitive Science Program; he directs Dartmouth's interdisciplinary Brain Engineering Laboratory (brainengineering.org), with publications and patents ranging from computation to cognition to basic neuroscience. He advises multiple technology corporations and government research agencies, is co-inventor of FDA-approved devices and drugs in clinical trials, and has been the principal architect of a series of advanced computational systems for military, commercial, and medical applications. David Leake received his PhD from Yale University. He is a Professor of Computer Science in the Luddy School at Indiana University (IU), where he served as Executive Associate Dean from 2012−2020, and a member of the IU Cognitive Science Program. His current research areas include case-based reasoning, explanation, and neuro-symbolic AI. He has authored/edited over 200 publications. He is Editor in Chief Emeritus of AI Magazine after 17 years as Editor in Chief. In 2014 he received the AAAI Distinguished Service Award. He is a Senior Member of AAAI. Christopher K. Riesbeck is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Northwestern University, a Fellow of AAAI, the director of the CS Master's program, and co-director of the Center for Computer Science and the Learning Sciences.",

The system, named Foresight, supports long‐term forecasts aimed at humanitarian response planning. It is explainable, providing evidence and context supporting the forecast. Additionally, it supports scenarios, whereby analysts are able to generate forecasts under alternative conditions. The system has been in deployment since early 2020 and powers several downstream business functions within DRC. It is central to our annual Global Displacement Report, which informs our response planning. We describe the system, key outcomes, lessons learnt, along with technical limitations and challenges in deploying machine learning systems in the humanitarian sector.",

    "abstract": "This special issue of AI Magazine covers select applications from the IAAI conference held in 2023 in Washington, DC. The articles address a broad range of very challenging issues and contain great lessons for AI researchers and application developers. The goal of the Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI) conference is to highlight new, innovative systems and application areas of AI technology and to point out the often-overlooked difficulties involved in deploying complex technology to end users. Those of us who have ventured out of the realm of pure research and tried to build applications to be used by our fellow humans realize that it takes a lot more than just brilliant algorithms to make an application survive in the real world. Each application that succeeds is worth celebrating, and the teams behind them are due wholehearted congratulations. It is in this spirit that we bring you this special issue covering select applications from the IAAI conference held in February 2023 in Washington, DC. The articles address a broad range of challenging issues and contain lessons for fellow AI researchers and application developers. IAAI acceptance criteria are different from most academic conferences in that the end-user application must come first and foremost. A paper written for the annual AAAI or IJCAI conferences is unlikely to be accepted for IAAI because these papers focus on the innovation in the algorithm. IAAI focuses on how to get algorithms to the end user. A paper that describes a small change in a learning model to achieve 1% improvement in accuracy over related work is not appropriate for IAAI. Meanwhile, IAAI would be very interested in a similar paper saying that the current model is not deployable (e.g., due to size or training data), but a small change in the model that loses 1% accuracy allows it to be deployable. The articles in this issue cover humanitarian needs, manufacturing, and forecasting. A common theme is that all deployed applications work directly with end users to design a system that meets end-user needs. Many of the papers have co-authors from the end user community, which strengthens the paper significantly. The papers focus on end-user concerns, both in terms of solving the true end-user problem and in terms of generating explainable results. The first article by Rahul Nair from IBM with Bo Madsen and Alexander Kjærum from the Danish Refugee Council presents a system that forecasts the dynamics of refugee displacements. The system, Foresight, supports long-term forecasts aimed at humanitarian response planning. The explainable system provides evidence and context supporting the forecast and allows analysts to explore “what if” scenarios. Challenges to fielding this system include human-centered design, acceptance in the user community, and technical maturity, notably the lack of high-quality data. Foresight now covers 25 countries and 89% of all displaced populations globally. Shresth Verma and colleagues from Google, Harvard, Purdue, and the Indian Institute of Technology worked with ARMMAN, a nongovernmental organization to support maternal health care. Health care workers reach out to mothers to boost engagement with the health care services; these workers have limited availability compared to the number of beneficiaries. SAHELI helps identify the best recipients for service calls, prevented a drop in engagements by 30.5%, and is on track to serve one million beneficiaries by the end of 2023. This scale and impact have been achieved through multiple innovations in the model and its development, in preparation of real-world data, in deployment practices, and through careful consideration of responsible AI practices. ZhaoYang Zhu and colleagues from Alibaba deployed a system to forecast electricity load and can handle extreme weather conditions such as high temperatures or hurricanes. Accurate forecasting leads to more reliable and safe planning for the power grid. eForecaster contains a suite of explainable algorithms for diversified energy forecasting, leading to a 40% improvement in error, reduced manual work, and increased user acceptance through explainable guidance. The article describes four applications that have been deployed in seven provinces in China. Mihye Kim and her colleagues from Hyundai Capital and the Korean Advanced Institute of Technology (KAIST) in South Korea developed a system to predict the residual value of a vehicle over time. This information is used to determine credit lines and leasing rates to reduce revenue loss, reduce cases of loan default, and prevent fraud. The system also helps buyers avoid disreputable car dealers: these price estimates are shared on a used car website by the South Korean government. The paper describes real-world operational requirements such as compliance with regulations, and generalization to unseen input, for example, new and rare car models. Kyung Pyo Kang and colleagues from Kyung Hee University and Hyundai Motor in South Korea look at novel manufacturing design: products must be innovative, from the perspective of end-user preferences and from the perspective of competition and copyright infringement. A design infringement that is detected late in the manufacturing process might cost over $3 million US dollars. Their system, in use at Hyundai Motor, performs similarity verification of wheel designs and shortened the verification time by 90% to a maximum of 10 min. Designers no longer need to manually search for similar wheel images and can instead focus on other important aspects of the design process and bring new products to market faster. Chao Zheng, Xu Cao, and their colleagues at Tencent and New York University (NYU) looked at the challenge of high-definition (HD) maps for autonomous vehicle navigation. Their Tencent HD Map AI (THMA) system helps analysts process centimeter-resolution laser image datasets and label images. The active learning approach serves over 1000 labeling workers and generates more than 30,000 km of HD map data per day. With over 90% of HD map data labeled automatically by THMA, the system accelerates traditional HD map labeling processes by more than tenfold, significantly reducing manual annotation burdens and paving the way for more efficient HD map production. Rabia Ali and colleagues from Endress+Hauser in Germany and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology developed an approach to detect the weld seam between two metals. Current computer vision approaches are unable to meet the stringent tolerances required for industrial use, leading to significant human intervention to verify and correct every detected edge. Combined with a prefiltering approach that eliminates anomalous workpieces, their system can be deployed directly on laser welding machines, thus saving significant production time and cost. In a similar vein, Hayden Gunraj and his colleagues at the University of Waterloo, DarwinAI, and Moog use computer vision for quality inspection of solder joints. Solder joint defects affect a variety of printed circuit board components. The current manual inspection process is time-consuming and error-prone. SolderNet is an explainable computer vision algorithm that leads to high-throughput, high-performance, and zero-fatigue inspection. SolderNet has been used for over 26 million inspections with an overall escape rate below 0.01%. This selection of articles contains only a few of the interesting articles presented at IAAI 2023. We encourage our readers to look at the proceedings of IAAI 2023 and to submit papers of their own deployed systems to future IAAI conferences. The authors declare that there is no conflict. Karen Z.

To identify and correct solder joint defects, the solder joints on a circuit board are typically inspected manually by trained human inspectors, which is a very time‐consuming and error‐prone process. To improve both inspection efficiency and accuracy, in this work, we describe an explainable deep learning‐based visual quality inspection system tailored for visual inspection of solder joints in electronics manufacturing environments. At the core of this system is an explainable solder joint defect identification system called SolderNet that we design and implement with trust and transparency in mind. While several challenges remain before the full system can be developed and deployed, this study presents important progress towards trustworthy visual inspection of solder joints in electronics manufacturing.",

Because government agencies ask for it, software shops claim to provide it, popular magazines and newspapers publish articles about it, dreamers base their fantasies on it, and pragmatists criticize and denounce it. Such a state of affairs has persisted since Newell, Simon and Shaw wrote their first chess program and proclaimed that in a few years, a computer would be the world champion. Not knowing exactly what we are talking about or expecting is typical of a new field; for example, witness the chaos that centered around program verification of security related aspects of systems a few years ago. The details are too grim to recount in mixed company. However, artificial has been around for 30 years, so one might wonder why our wheels are still spinning. Below, an attempt is made to answer this question and show why, in a serious sense, artificial can never demonstrate an outright success within its own discipline. In addition, we will see why the old bromide that soon as we understand how to solve a problem, it's no longer artificial intelligence is necessarily true.",

In particular, a number of ship designers and AI researchers recently became interested in applying AI to the hydrodynamic design of ship hulls. A typical problem here is to design the shape of a ship's hull in response to desired hydrodynamic properties such as drag and stability, taking into consideration a variety of design constraints, such as total hull volume.",

Consider that the simple act of changing an object's grasp -- the change might be necessitated by the nature of some assembly goal -- involves the interaction of the geometries of the grasping device and the object if the change is to occur without a collision between the device and the object. Of course, one could ask, Could geometric considerations be divorced from the highly developed symbolic-level planning? That is, could we first synthesize a symbolic plan and then plug in the geometry for the execution of the actions? Experience has shown the answer to, unfortunately, be a big no.",

Many manufacturing processes have been modeled to date, but eventually every significant process in motor vehicle construction will be included. Significant cost reductions are among the many benefits CAPE brings to Ford. CAPE is a highly significant system for Ford of Europe in terms of the business needs it satisfies and the corporate acceptance of AI applications: First, CAPE represents a major investment, with significant person-years of effort spent on predeployment development alone. Second, CAPE is the first large-scale production expert system to be deployed within Ford of Europe. Third, cost estimating is a critical business function. With a total annual materials budget of several billion dollars, cost control is at the heart of Ford's business. Fourth, reducing the lead time for new model programs provides a key competitive advantage. CAPE reduces estimating response time by 50 percent. Fifth, this system is enormously ambitious. The final system will capture the combined knowledge of estimating experts in all areas of automotive manufacture.",

While it is easy to make broad, generalized, or off‐the‐cuff predictions about the future, it is more difficult to develop predictions that are carefully thought out, concrete, and measurable. This forum was created to help researchers craft predictions whose accuracy can be clearly and unambiguously judged when the bets come due. The bets will be documented both online and regularly in this column. We encourage bets that are rigorously and scientifically argued. We discourage bets that are too general to be evaluated or too specific to an individual or institution. The goal is not to continue to feed the media frenzy and outsized pundit predictions about AI, but rather to curate and promote bets whose outcomes will provide useful feedback to the scientific community.

For instance, one experiment on Facebook involved more than 60 million subjects. Such large‐scale experiments introduce new challenges as even small effects when multiplied by a large population can have a significant impact. Recent revelations about the use of social media to manipulate voting behavior compound such concerns. It is believed that the psychometric data used by Cambridge Analytica to target US voters was collected by Dr Aleksandr Kogan from Cambridge University using a personality quiz on Facebook. There is a real risk that researchers wanting to collect data and run experiments on social media platforms in the future will face a public backlash that hinders such studies from being conducted. We suggest that stronger safeguards are put in place to help prevent this, and ensure the public retain confidence in scientists using social media for behavioral and other studies.",

    "abstract": "The AAAI Executive Council unanimously adopted two new important documents at its recent meeting in Honolulu, Hawaii.The AAAI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct is designed to inspire and guide the ethical conduct of all AI professionals, including current and aspiring practitioners, instructors, students, influencers, and anyone who uses AI technology in an impactful way, and is particularly intended to act as a standard of ethical and professional conduct for all AAAI members.Additionally, the Code serves as a basis for remediation when violations occur.The Code includes principles formulated as statements of responsibility, based on the understanding that the public good is always the primary consideration.Each principle is supplemented by guidelines, which provide explanations to assist AI professionals in understanding and applying the principle.This code is adapted from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct and expresses the conscience of the AI profession.The Code of Conduct for Conferences and Events sets forth expectations for behavior at all AAAI events and provides a mechanism for attendees to report any behavior that falls outside these expectations.All persons, organizations and entities that attend AAAI conferences and events are subject to the standards of conduct set forth in this document.AAAI expects all community members to formally endorse this code of conduct, and to actively prevent and discourage any undesired behaviors.",

Workshop participants concluded that care cannot be commodified or reduced into outcome‐oriented tasks and can therefore not be encoded into technology; additionally participants determined that regulation of predictive artificial intelligence technologies is required to maintain their benefit and trustworthiness. The aim of these workshops is to encapsulate both the ups and downs of these technologies. The study organizers and participants feel their role is to bring the integration of artificial intelligence technology into societal values to the forefront of discussions for its future.",

    "abstract": "The 13th Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS) was held May 26-28, 2020. Originally scheduled to take place in Vienna, Austria, the symposium pivoted toward a fully online technical program in early March. As an in-person event SoCS offers participants a diverse array of scholarly activities including technical talks (long and short), poster sessions, plenary sessions, a community meeting and, new for 2020, a Master Class tutorial program. \r\nThis paper describes challenges, approaches and opportunities associated with adapting these many different activities to the online setting. We consider issues such as scheduling, dissemination, attendee interaction and community engagement before, during and after the event. We report on the approaches taken by SoCS in each case, we give a post-hoc analysis of their their effectiveness and we discuss how these decisions continue to impact the SoCS community in the days after SoCS 2020.",

The bets will be documented online and regularly in this publication in The AI Bookie. We encourage bets that are rigorously and scientifically argued. We discourage bets that are too general to be evaluated or too specific to an institution or individual.

Most of my predictions about what will happen in the industry don't come true even though they ought to. So I'm not going to tell you what the future holds; what I will do is to point out some of the technological trends that are at work. The outline of the talk is as follows: I'll start off by looking at the previous IAAI conferences and reflect on what we've learned from them. Then I'll look at what's changing in the hardware base that sets the context for all the computer applications we do. I think that will lead to interesting new viewpoints. Next I'll sketch what applications might arise from this new viewpoint. Finally, I'll discuss how the development of practical applications ought to interact with the scientific enterprise of trying to understand intelligence, in particular, human intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Stickers are popularly used while messaging to visually express nuanced thoughts. We describe a real-time sticker recommendation (SR) system. We decompose SR into two steps: predict the message that is likely to be sent, and substitute that message with an appropriate sticker. To address the challenges caused by transliteration of message from users’ native language to the Roman script, we learn message embeddings by employing character-level CNN in an unsupervised manner. We use them to cluster semantically similar messages. Next, we predict the message cluster instead of the message. Except for validation, our system does not require human labeled data, leading to a fully auto-matic tuning pipeline. We propose a hybrid message prediction model, which can easily run on low-end phones. We discuss message cluster to sticker mapping, addressing the multilingual needs of our users, automated tuning of the system and also propose a novel application of community detection algorithm. As of November 2020, our system contains 100k+ stickers, has been deployed for 15+ months, and is being used by millions of users.",

    "abstract": "To craft effective public policy, modern governments must gather and analyze data on both the performance of their public functions and the responses by the public. Federal administrative agencies such as the Patent Office and Centers for Disease Control routinely do this, as does the United States Congress. More importantly, they make such data freely accessible. Within the United States government, however, the judicial branch is a conspicuous outlier. In theory, federal court records could be used to evaluate the efficiency and fairness of the justice system. In practice, court records are effectively out of reach because they sit behind a government paywall. This financial barrier, along with an equally important myriad of technical obstacles, have forestalled the development of AI-driven analysis that could enable a systematic understanding and evaluation of the work of the courts. The Systematic Content Analysis of Litigation EventS Open Knowledge Network (SCALES OKN) seeks to address this situation by transforming the transparency and accessibility of court records. The SCALES OKN will potentiate the development of new AI solutions that will benefit the judiciary, legal scholars, and the public. In this article, we outline some of key financial, technical, and policy challenges to developing novel AI solutions.",

However, this apparent creativity is also creating a real challenge in the objective evaluation of such systems as authors are becoming reliant on crowd worker opinions as the primary measurement of success and, so far, few papers are reporting all that is necessary for others to compare against in their own crowd experiments. This challenge is not unique to ConvAI, but demonstrates as AI systems mature in more “human” tasks that involve creativity and variation, evaluation strategies need to mature with them.",

    "abstract": "When modernization and other changes demand workforce reskilling, employers often turn to local colleges for training programs. Doing so can be a frustrating experience. HR and talent professionals have difficulty identifying and communicating requirements, especially for new jobs and roles, while college continuing education (CE) and professional development offices have difficulty understanding and responding to company needs. This article describes an NSF Convergence Accelerator project called SkillSync™ in which multiple forms of AI are used to address this specific problem and provide national efforts (e.g., the US Chamber of Commerce Talent Pipeline Management initiative) with skills data and skills alignment services. Skillsync uses variations on the Siamese Multi-depth Transformer-based Hierarchical Encoder (SMITH) and other natural language understanding methods to map job descriptions and course information to skills taxonomies, uses machine-learned models to align skills needs with learning outcomes and training, and incorporates an intelligent coach based on Georgia Tech's Jill Watson “virtual teaching assistant” to answer questions about Skillsync's vocabulary, functionality, and process. This article describes these AI methods, how these methods are used in Skillsync, and the challenges involved.",

    "abstract": "This special issue presents 10 articles that feature the NSF Convergence Accelerator, a program launched in 2019 by the US National Science Foundation, focusing on transitioning research to practice for social impact. Included in this special issue are related articles — ranging from an introduction to the NSF Convergence Accelerator program to descriptions of projects in phase 1 and phase 2 of the Convergence Accelerator. We are pleased to introduce this special issue featuring the NSF Convergence Accelerator, an exciting new program launched in 2019 by the US National Science Foundation, focusing on transitioning research to practice for societal impact. The special issue begins with an article that provides an overview of the NSF Convergence Accelerator program, coauthored by the program management team at NSF. This article also introduces the first two “tracks” in the program, viz., Track A — Open Knowledge Networks (OKN) and Track B — AI & the Future of Work, and the “track integration” activity underway in each. The second article on Knowledge Graphs relates the Track A work on open knowledge networks to this broader topic area and incorporates perspectives from experts/practitioners from academia and industry. Next is a set of seven articles describing projects currently in phase 2 of the Convergence Accelerator — five in Track A and two in Track B. We recommend reading the NSF overview article first, prior to reading these individual project articles. The last article on Enabling AI Innovation via Data and Model Sharing provides an overview of all 18 projects in phase 1 of the Convergence Accelerator Track D and is coauthored by the 18 project principal investigators along with NSF program directors. Six of these projects have been selected for phase 2, as noted in the article. The Convergence Accelerator currently has three additional tracks (C, E, and F) that are not covered in this special issue. Track C in the 2020 cohort focuses on Quantum Technology. Tracks E and F in the 2021 cohort focus on Networked Blue Economy and Trust and Authenticity in Communications Systems, respectively. NSF also recently announced tracks G, H, I, and J in the 2022 cohort focusing respectively on Securely Operating Through 5G Infrastructure, Enhancing Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities, Sustainable Materials for Global Challenges, and Food & Nutrition Security. We hope that the articles in this issue convey the full excitement of the NSF Convergence Accelerator program. We wish to thank the article authors for their valuable contributions, the reviewers for their diligent work in providing thorough reviews of articles, and the editors of the AI Magazine for featuring this special issue.

    "abstract": "At AAAI 2021, we introduced a “New Faculty Highlights” program. The aim was to showcase top young researchers who had taken up their first faculty or research scientist position at a research-intensive university or lab in the preceding year. Each selected participant presented a 30-min talk at the conference, summarizing their work to the broad AAAI audience. We see many ways in which this program benefits the AAAI community. First, it deepens the conference experience for attendees. Participants are encouraged to draw on their highly polished job talks. Because job talks are designed for accessibility to broad audiences, they are ideal for helping researchers from diverse AI subfields to understand important emerging trends and simultaneously to become familiar with AI researchers leading the new generation. The longer talk format also enables speakers to describe a body of work rather than a single paper and to situate different elements within a coherent narrative. Second, the program benefits the selected faculty members. It is hard to get known in a community as big as AAAI. These talks offer participants a high-profile opportunity to make their work more broadly known. We expect the program to act as an important source of recognition for such young researchers. Finally, the program benefits students. AAAI's plenary talks tend to focus on senior researchers; New Faculty Highlights expose students to examples of exceptional work by researchers who were recently students themselves. We hope that this experience is both inspiring and helpful to students about to embark upon their own job searches. In the first iteration of the program at AAAI 2021, 119 young researchers applied; a distinguished committee of seven AAAI fellows selected 18 of these to participate in the program. The selected speakers were a demographically diverse group (11 male and seven female; seven different countries represented). They were just as diverse in terms of their research perspectives, which spanned multi-agent systems, robotics, theoretical machine learning, information retrieval, planning, green AI, social context of language, justice for machine learning, online privacy, and more. We are delighted that AI Magazine has invited these young stars to contribute articles. In this edition, four of the 18 are included. Lili Mou explores neural models for the generation of text using unsupervised techniques; Jundong Li studies causal effects in network data; Pascal Bercher develops theory, algorithms, and applications for two prominent planning techniques; and Hang Ma advances decision-making in multi-agent systems. We hope that the New Faculty Highlights program becomes a permanent feature of AAAI conferences, and does its bit in celebrating early career successes and encouraging more students to pursue a career in research. The authors declare that there is no conflict.",

Deployed application papers describe systems that have been in use for at least several months by individuals or organizations other than their developers, have measurable benefits, and incorporate AI technologies. Emerging applications are technologies and systems that are close to deployment and clearly show an innovative implementation of AI technologies. These papers are of value not only to other application developers looking for guidance in applying various techniques to their own applications but also to researchers who need to understand the unique technical challenges provided by real-world problems.",

This approach enables one to distinguish between the universal and stipulative constraints. This is in contrast to an approach where we start with the most powerful formal-computational system and then model the phenomena by making all constraints stipulative in a sense. The use of constrained systems for modeling leads to some novel ways of describing locality of structures and brings out the relationship between the complexity of description of primitives and local computations over them. These ideas serve to unify theoretical, computational, and statistical aspects of natural language processing in AI. It is expected that this approach will also be productive in other domains of AI.",

    "abstract": "It is possible to argue, relatively convincingly, that any research topic only begins to become mature when it appears on a syllabus somewhere. Once the topic has become well enough understood that it can be explained easily to paying customers, and stable enough that anyone teaching it is not likely to have to update his/her teaching materials every few months as new developments are reported, it can be considered to have arrived. Another reasonable indicator of the maturity of a subject, a milestone along the road to academic respectability, is the publication of a really good book on the subject -- not another research monograph but a book that consolidates what is already known, surveys and relates existing ideas, and maybe even unifies some of them. Grigoris Antoniou's Nonmonotonic Reasoning is just such a milestone -- well written, informative, and a good source of information on an important and complex subject. Since the idea was first mooted",

However, he found his attention increasingly dis-tracted by the possibilities provided by probability trees for understanding probability and causality -- so much so, in fact, that instead of finishing the first book, he wrote a different one on this second topic. It is this second book that is the subject of this review, and it is easy to see why the power and breadth of the ideas seduced Shafer from his original purpose. (Do not despair, however, those three draft chapters have now also appeared, although without the others that were originally intended to accompany them, in Probabilistic Expert Systems, Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, 1996).",

    "abstract": "The 13th Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS) was held May 26 to 28, 2020. Originally scheduled to take place in Vienna, Austria, the symposium pivoted toward a fully online technical program in early March. As an in‐person event, SoCS offers participants a diverse array of scholarly activities including technical talks (long and short), poster sessions, plenary sessions, a community meeting and, new for 2020, a Master Class tutorial program. This article describes challenges, approaches, and opportunities associated with adapting these many different activities to the online setting. We consider issues such as scheduling, dissemination, attendee interaction, and community engagement before, during, and after the event. In each case, we report on the approaches taken by SoCS, then give a post hoc analysis of their effectiveness and discuss how these decisions continue to impact the SoCS community in the days after SoCS 2020. This work will be of interest to organizers of similar conferences who may be considering the switch to an online format.",

Numerous news reports suggest that artificial intelligence capacities have influenced high‐profile voting events; publications decrying the threat posed to democratic procedures are proliferating. This article takes a skeptical view of such claims, with an argument in six sections. First, the received principles of procedural democracy in relation to voting events are outlined. Second, the kind of services in question are considered. Third, to what extent these services actually involve artificial intelligence is pondered. Fourth, how such technological capacities may bear upon the tenets of procedural democracy are raised. Fifth, it is argued that it is unlikely that those tenets are indeed significantly undermined in practice. And sixth, this article concludes by considering the implications of it being proven that such technological capacities do play a decisive role in voting events.",

On the one hand, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to increase our efficiency and ability to cope with the changes that are coming. On the other hand, AI itself also causes disruptions that may be managed best by contributions from other fields. We aim to start an interdisciplinary discourse with this special issue and bring together a set of articles from AI researchers, sociologists, economists, and psychologists who discuss five basic questions: How can AI help? How will AI affect economy and work? How does AI affect democracy? How does AI affect our togetherness? And how does AI affect the human self?",

    "abstract": "Abstract With the rise of intelligent virtual assistants (IVAs), there is a necessary rise in human effort to identify conversations containing misunderstood user inputs. These conversations uncover error in natural language understanding and help prioritize improvements to the IVA. As human analysis is time consuming and expensive, prioritizing the conversations where misunderstanding has likely occurred reduces costs and speeds IVA improvement. In addition, less conversations reviewed by humans mean less user data are exposed, increasing privacy. We describe Trace AI, a scalable system for automated conversation review based on the detection of conversational features that can identify potential mis‐communications. Trace AI provides IVA designers with suggested actions to correct understanding errors, prioritizes areas of language model repair, and can automate the review of conversations. We discuss the system design and report its performance at identifying errors in IVA understanding compared to that of human reviewers. Trace AI has been commercially deployed for over 4 years and is responsible for significant savings in human annotation costs as well as accelerating the refinement cycle of deployed enterprise IVAs.",

On the one hand, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to increase our efficiency and ability to cope with the changes that are coming. On the other hand, AI itself also causes disruptions that may be managed best by contributions from other fields. We aim to start an interdisciplinary discourse with this special issue and bring together a set of articles from AI researchers, sociologists, economists, and psychologists who discuss five basic questions: How can AI help? How will AI affect economy and work? How does AI affect democracy? How does AI affect our togetherness? And how does AI affect the human self?",

    "abstract": "Two closely related aspects of artificial intelligence that have received comparatively little attention in the recent literature are research methodology, and the analysis of computational techniques that span multiple application areas. We believe both issues to be increasingly significant as Artificial Intelligence matures into a science and spins off major application efforts. It is imperative to analyze the repertoire of AI methods with respect to past experience, utility in new domains, extensibility, and functional equivalence with other techniques, if AI is to become more effective in building upon prior results rather than continually reinventing the proverbial wheel. Similarly, awareness of research methodology issues can help plan future research buy learning from past successes and failures. We view the study of research methodology to be similar to the analysis of operational AI techniques, but at a meta-level ; that is, research methodology analyzes the techniques and methods used by the researchers themselves, rather than their programs, to resolve issues of selecting interesting and tractable problems to investigate, and of deciding how to proceed with their investigations. A public articulation of methodological issues that typically remain implicit in the literature may provide some helpful orientation for new researchers and broaden the perspective of many AI practitioners.",

Second, it must effectively communicate to the reader, in the same manner in which a course instructor must be capable of imparting knowledge to students in a classroom. Third, it must stimulate the reader into thinking more deeply about the subject and into viewing it from fresh perspectives.

    "abstract": "In a letter to the editor (AI Magazine, Winter 1989), Benjamin Kuipers criticizes various points made in an earlier paper of ours (Akman and ten Hagen 1989). First, a side (nonetheless important) remark: Although Kuipers asserts that he distributes QSIM to interested researchers, our experience has been otherwise. Akman has tried twice to obtain QSIM, without success. Although Kuipers promised to deliver a copy -- QSIM was under revision at the time of Akman's request (this being as early as winter 1988) -- the program was never sent. So much for the availability of QSIM. Kuipers' letter is full of sweeping generalizations that are so much against the nature of scientific enterprise. We should also add that we are disappointed to see Kuipers employing universal truths and unarguable facts such as . if you build the model, the predictions derived from that model are likely to be wrong or . guarantees of mathematical validity [are] necessary for any science as his main cheval de bataille. In the following we'll point out, one by one, the weaknesses of QSIM. Our task will be easy since we shall merely reproduce, almost verbatim, Kuipers' own sentences (Kuipers 1986) and, additionally, Janowski's (1987) views. (The latter reference gives an excellent review of QSIM's disadvantages.) Then, we'll let the reader judge.",

Our subject may be unique in the virulence and frequency with which it is attacked, both in the popular media and among the cultured intelligentsia. Recent articles have argued that the very idea of AI reflects a cancer in the heart of our culture and have proven (yet again) that it is impossible.

My plans converged after consultation with many people in the AI community, including the IJCAI-83 conference committee, and they have that committee's approval.

Robert Epstein, Director Emeritus, Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies, and an adjunct professor of psychology, Boston University, University of Massachusetts (Amherst), and University of California (San Diego) summarizes some of the difficult issues during the planning of this first real-time competition, and describes the event. He then speculates about the future of the competition and about its significance to the AI community.

We humanists, when asked to speak on questions of science and technology, are notorious for offering an embarrassed and ignorant respect toward those matters, a respect, however, which can all too quickly degenerate into insolent condescension. Face to face with the reality of computer technology, say, or with artificial intelligence, we humanists are the kind of soreheads who compulsively point out that human beings aren't machines, that computers will never possess the uniquely human powers of intuition and common sense, and that we smelly, hairy and other wise organic people are simply more interesting, more clever and more mysterious than electricpowered, binary-formatted, digital computers with their tidy little green phosphorescent screens. So now you know what I'm going to say, or at least part of it. For, to be even more candid with you this morning, I want to go on to say that while I do believe many of the things that we humanists are reputed to believe, I also happen to believe that humanists are wrong, and very foolish, to fear computers. But they are also wrong, to underestimate the power of those computers and their important utility in the world that is now ours and the word that we will soon be turning over to our descendents.",

    "abstract": "My Ph.D. thesis (Ward 1992, 1991)1 addressed the task of generating natural language utterances. It was motivated by two difficulties in scaling up existing generators. Current generators only accept input that are relatively poor in information, such as feature structures or lists of propositions; they are unable to deal with input rich in information, as one might expect from, for example, an expert system with a complete model of its domain or a natural language understander with good inference ability. Current generators also have a very restricted knowledge of language -- indeed, they succeed largely because they have few syntactic or lexical options available (McDonald 1987) -- and they are unable to cope with more knowledge because they deal with interactions among the various possible choices only as special cases. To address these and other issues, I built a system called FIG (flexible incremental generator). FIG is based on a single associative network that encodes lexical knowledge, syntactic knowledge, and world knowledge. Computation is done by spreading activation across the network, supplemented with a small amount of symbolic processing. Thus, FIG is a spreading activation or structured connectionist system (Feldman et al. 1988).",

A recurring idea at the workshop was the need to examine uncertainty calculi in the context of choosing representation, inference, and control methodologies. The effectiveness of these choices in AI systems tends to be best considered in terms of specific problem areas. These areas include automated planning, temporal reasoning, computer vision, medical diagnosis, fault detection, text analysis, distributed systems, and behavior of nonlinear systems. Influence diagrams are emerging as a unifying representation, enabling tool development. Interest and results in uncertainty in AI are growing beyond the capacity of a workshop format.",

Nine faculty and more than fifty research associates and graduate students are involved in AI research. Projects are funded by a large number of government agencies, as well as by several major corporations. The computing environment will improve dramatically over the next several years, due in large part to Coordinated Experimental Research Department by the National Science Foundation in 1982. In addition to the research program in AI, the Department offers a large number of courses at both the graduate and undergraduate levels on all facets of AI. The principal AI laboratories also sponsor numerous colloquia by visiting scientists and permanent laboratory personnel. The principal research areas are computer vision, search and decision making, parallel problems solving, and database research.",

    "abstract": "Schlumberger is a large, multinational corporation concerned primarily with the measurement, collection, and interpretation of data. For the past fifty years, most of the activities have been related to hydrocarbon exploration. The efficient location and production of hydrocarbons from an underground formation requires a great deal of knowledge about the formation, ranging in scale from the size and shape of the rock's pore spaces to the size and shape of the entire reservoir. Schlumberger provides its clients with two types of information : measurements, called logs, of the petrophysical properties of the rock around the borehole, such as its electrical, acoustical, and radioactive characteristics; and in terpretations of these logs in terms of geophysical properties such as porosity and mineral composition. Since log interpretation is expert skill, the emergence of expert systems technology prompted Schlumberger's initial interest in Artificial Intelligence. Our first full- scale attempt at a commercial-quality expert system was the Dipmeter Advisor. Following these initial efforts, Schlumberger has expanded its Artificial Intelligence activities, and is now engaged in both basic and applied research in a wide variety of areas.",
