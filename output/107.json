    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The aim of this study was to provide data on the prevalence and epidemiology of isolated deep chondral lesions of the knee, diagnosed in arthroscopy. The study was also aimed to analyse subjective treatment results of localized deep isolated cartilage lesions and to determine how the different factors might affect the final outcome. MATERIAL AND METHODS From 1997 to 2002, 5233 knee arthroscopies were performed. The first part of the study is an epidemiological and statistical analysis of the isolated articular cartilage lesions in which we used the questionnaire based on the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Questionnaire. The second part is the analysis of subjective treatment evaluation. For this purpose the IKDC criteria were used. Following aspects were taken into account: lesion location and size, time after surgery, patients' age, performed surgical cartilage procedure. The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 7 years. The statistical analysis was performed with the use of the Pearson correlation coefficient and t-test. Significance was set at p<0.05. RESULTS In the analyzed material cartilage lesion was diagnosed in 2931 patients (57.3%). Isolated localized chondral Outerbridge grade 3 and 4 lesions were documented in 5.2% of all patients with diagnosed cartilage lesion. The patellar articular surface (37.5%) and the medial femoral condyle (32.2%) were the most frequent localizations of these lesions. There was no correlation between the results and the period of time after arthroscopy. The best results were obtained in cases of loose body removal, debridement, mosaicplasty and also in cases where the lesion was left untreated. DISCUSSION The management of full-thickness cartilage injury remains one of the most difficult problems in the orthopedic surgery, particularly isolated and symptomatic. In 7 years of follow-up we found good and satisfactory results when debridement and loose body removal was performed and when the lesions was left untreated. Significantly the worst results in subjective evaluation we observed in marrow-stimulating procedures. This study confirms that the appropriate qualification for treatment plays the most important role in successive management of cartilage injuries. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of isolated deep chondral lesions of the knee remains a questionable issue. Little invasive arthroscopic methods as well as using no surgical treatment in grade 3 and 4 isolated cartilage lesions may be effective and improve symptoms and knee function at mid-term follow-up.Our data support also the contention that the natural history of cartilage lesions still remains unpredictable and not well understood.",

    "abstract": "Displaced, intra-articular fractures of the calcaneus represent a surgical challenge and the ideal choice of treatment remains a subject of continued debate. Open reduction and stable internal fixation without joint transfixation has been established as the standard treatment for most of these fractures with good to excellent results in more than two thirds of patients in larger clinical series. The extended lateral approach respects the neurovascular supply to the heel and allows a good exposition of the fractured lateral wall, the subtalar and calcaneocuboid joints, but wound healing problems cannot be completely avoided despite meticulous soft tissue handling. Percuatneous and less invasive procedures have successfully lowered the rates of wound complications but exact anatomic reduction remains an important issue. Care must be taken not to overlook atypical fractures like sustentacular fractures and fracture-dislocations of the calcaneus that are treated with a small medial or curved epimalleolar lateral approach, respectively. The use of bone grafting or bone substitutes for defect filling appears not necessary in most cases. Prognostic factors that can be influenced by the surgeon are anatomical reduction of the overall shape of the calcaneus and congruity of the subtalar joint which should both be controlled intraoperatively. Treatment results are adversely affected by severity of injury, open fractures, bilateral fractures, a high body mass index and smoking. Early, stable soft tissue coverage with pedicled or free flaps appears to lower infection rates and improve the functional results after open fractures. Calcaneal malunions and nonunions are disabling conditions resulting from either non-operative treatment or inadequate reduction and fixation of displaced fractures. Deformity correction is tailored to the type of deformity and individual patient needs. Treatment options include lateral wall decompression, in situ- or corrective subtalar arthrodesis and calcaneal osteotomies accompanied by soft tissue-balancing.",

    "abstract": "Periprosthetic fractures are increasingly frequent.The fracture may be located over the shaft of the prosthesis, at its tip or below (21).The treatment of explosion frac-tures is difficult because the shaft blocks the application of implants, like screws, which need to penetrate the medullary cavity.The cerclage, as a simple periosteal loop, made of wire or more recently cable, does not only avoid the medullary cavity.Its centripetal mode of action is well suited for reducing and maintaining radially displaced fractures.Furthermore, the cerclage lends itself well for minimally invasive internal fixation.New insight challenges the disrepute of which the cerclage technology suffered for decades.The outcome of cerclage fixation benefits from an improved understanding of its technology, mechano-biology and periosteal blood supply.Preconceived and generally accepted opinions like \"strangulation of blood supply\" need to be re-examined.Recent mechanical evaluations ( 22) demonstrate that the wire application may be improved but cable is superior in handling, maintenance of tension and strength.Beside the classical concepts of absolute and relative stability a defined stability con-dition needs consideration.It is typical for cerclage.Called \"loose-lock stability\" it specifies the situation where a loosened implant allows first unimpeded displacement changing abruptly into a locked fixation preventing further dislocation.",

    "abstract": "Twisting is clinically the most frequently applied method for tightening and maintaining cerclage fixation. The twisting procedure is controversially discussed. Several factors during twisting affect the mechanical behaviour of the cerclage. This in vitro study investigated the influence of different parameters of the twisting procedure on the fixation strength of the cerclage in an experimental setup with centripetal force application.Cortical half shells of the femoral shaft were mounted on a testing fixture. 1.0 mm, 1.25 mm and 1.5 mm stainless ste- el wire cerclages as well as a 1.0mm cable cerclage were applied to the bone. Pretension of the cerclage during the installation was measured during the locking procedure. Subsequently, cyclic testing was performed up to failure.Higher pretension could be achieved with increasing wire diameter. However, with larger wire diameter the drop of pre- tension due to the bending and cutting the twist also increased. The cable cerclage showed the highest pretension after locking. Cerclages twisted under traction revealed significantly higher initial cerclage tension. Plastically deformed twists offered higher cerclage pretension compared to twists which were deformed in the elastic region of the material. Cutting the wire within the twist caused the highest loss of cerclage tension (44% initial tension) whereas only 11 % was lost when cutting the wire ends separately. The bending direction of the twist significantly influenced the cerclage pretension. 45% pretension was lost in forward bending of the twist, 53% in perpendicular bending and 90% in backward bending.Several parameters affect the quality of a cerclage fixation. Adequate installation of cerclage wires could markedly improve the clinical outcome of cerclage.",

    "abstract": "Fractures of the proximal humerus commonly affect elderly patients. The vast majority of proximal humeral fractures result from low-energy trauma in presence of osteoporosis. Incidence of proximal humeral fractures dramatically increased over the last decades. Recent epidemiological studies expect a rather stagnant incidence. Diversity of fracture types attenuates reliability of available classification systems. Even though, predictive morphologic criteria have been detected enabling a prognostic assessment. A short or absent metaphyseal head extension and disruption of the medial periosteal hinge reliably predict ischemia of the humeral head fragment. Still, humeral head necrosis may be prevented in early reduction and fixation. The range of treatment options consists of non-operative therapy, minimal-invasive osteosynthesis, open reduction and plate fixation, intramedullary nailing and primary arthroplasty. Most proximal humeral fractures in the elderly are stable injuries and can be successfully treated by non-operative means. Operative treatment of displaced, unstable fractures should resort to the least invasive procedure providing adequate reduction and fixation stability. To date, open reduction and locking plate osteosynthesis represents the standard operative procedure in displaced three- and four-part fractures. However, a number of risk factors may promote fixation failure or impair functional outcome, most important low local bone mineral density, residual varus displacement of the humeral head, insufficient restoration of medial calcar support, humeral head ischemia and insufficient fracture reduction. Innovation of fixation techniques (e. g. angular stable locking systems and bone augmentation) will further expand indications for operative fracture treatment. Outcome of hemiarthroplasty is closely related to anatomical tuberosity healing and restoration of rotator cuff function. Reverse shoulder arthroplasty may provide satisfactory shoulder function in geriatric patients, rotator cuff dysfunction or failure of first-line treatment. Choice of treatment should be individualized and base on careful evaluation of patient-specific, fracture-specific and surgeon-specific aspects.",

    "abstract": "The number of hip fractures will increase enormously in the decades to come as will the cost of treatment of these patients do.In the USA the annual cost has estimated to be nearly $10 billion.Hip fractures, therefore, represent an enormous socio-economic and medical problem and challenge (orthopaedic) surgeons an anaesthetists to find the cheapest and most effective way to treat them.At the same time the search for preventive measures should be continued.Biphosphonates and hip protectors seem to be able to decrease the risk of suffering a hip fracture with 50%. CLASSIFICATIONThe first classification of femoral neck fractures, proposed by Abraham Colles, in displaced and non-displaced (impacted) fractures appears to be still the most useful one.The Pauwels classification cannot be applied to the preoperative x-ray, because the fractured leg is always in external rotation.The Garden classification is not reproducible and does not lead us to the right treatment. TREATMENTStability and healing chances of impacted fractures depend especially on age and general condition.In patients under 70 years of age without co-morbidity, the secondary instability rate after non-operative treatment is very low: 5%.In elderly people with multiple co-morbidity secondary instability can go up to 80%.These patients are better served with primary operative treatment.Although the majority of surgeons feel good with a strategy of prophylactical internal fixation in all patients, this author pleads for non-operative (early mobilization) treatment of all patients, who are healthy or have only one serious comorbidity.There is consensus about the treatment of displaced fractures in patients under 65 years of age: closed reduction and internal fixation.The best treatment for patients over 80 years of age is prosthetic replacement.In the (large) group of patients between 65 and 80 years of age calendar age is not a reliable guide to the right treatment.There is a growing conviction that the choice between internal fixation and prosthetic replacement in these patients should be made on the basis of the biological age (ASA-score, habitat, the activity level, the need for walking aids and cognitive function).Bone density does not seem to play an important role.If internal fixation is the preferred treatment, the choice of implant is controversial.It is the author's experience that fractures with a steep fracture line (Pauwels 3) should be anatomically reduced and stabililized with a sliding hip screw.The less steep fractures (Pauwels 1 and 2) can be slightly overreduced in valgus and anteversion, which provides a bony support against shearing forces, and fixed with parallel screws according to the 3-point-fixation principle.The timing of surgery continues to be a controversial subject.From a recent study in our own institution we concluded that no significant association could be found between delay to surgery and the clinical outcomes.However, considering the trends towards less complications and shorter length of hospital stay, early surgery (within 1 day from admission) is likely to be beneficial for hip fracture patients who are able to undergo operation.There is agreement about the use of the cemented arthroplasty.If a hemiarthroplasty is chosen, the bipolar type is to be preferred to the unipolar type.The difference in price between both prostheses is negligible because the overall cost of the treatment have gone up so immensely.Futhermore, a basic advantage of the bipolar system is the relatively small operation, needed for conversion to a total hip replacement, because the stem can stay in place.As to the question hemiarthroplasty or total hip replacement, the discussion has not yet been closed.We studied the natural history of the cemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty by evaluating 307 patients, operated between 1975 and 1989 in our institution.Only 3 patients, who not have been revised, were alive at the end of the observation period (2004).A striking difference was found in the occurrence of late mechanical complications (aseptic loosening and acetabular wear) between patients under 75 years of age (22%) and the older group of patients (6%).As to the patient's overall satisfaction 56% suffered no impairment from their sustained fracture, 36% were slightly impaired.We concluded that the use of the cemented bipolar prosthesis is justified in patients over 75 years of age.Patients between 65 and 75 years of age should either be treated with internal fixation or with a total hip replacement. NONUNION OF THE FEMORAL NECKNowadays in cases of nonunions of the femoral neck the surgeon is tempted to perform prosthetic replacement of the hip, the more so if there is also evidence of a disturbed vascularisation of the head.This will provide rapid pain relief and mobilization.However, long-term results of hip arthroplasties, especially in younger people and in presence of bone atrophy, are not always as expected and a less radical approach is worth considering.The intertrochanteric valgisation osteotomy, described by Pauwels is an excellent alternative for patients up to 65 years of age with a non-union of the femoral neck.A union rate of 80-90% is described by most authors.Leg length, rotational and angular deformities can be corrected at the same time.Between 65 and 80 years a total hip replacement is probably the best option for fit patients.For elderly patients a cemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty is an adequate treatment.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of fracture healing has undergone an evolution over many decades with continuous improvement of fracture treatment.Solid union is a precondition of restoring the function of a fractured bone.The goal of the early treatment of the fracture was focussed upon enabling solid union in acceptable alignment of the fracture.This was achieved with reduction followed by application of external splints.The function of the articulations was often troubled by long lasting and extensive external immobilization, which required physiotherapy that lasted longer than bone union.The surgical reduction and stabilization aimed at early recovery of movement of the articulations and maintenance of the function of the soft tissues and blood supply.The AO group initiated 1958 by Maurice E. Müller and his colleagues prioritized the recovery of limb function and propagated precise reduction and fixation using mainly compression.Absolute stability of fixation, achieved using implants, allowed to move the articulations very early without pain, while the fracture united solidly.After such treatment the implants could not be removed before 1 1/2 to 2 years without risking increased incidence of re-fracture.This was in sharp contrast to the fact that after conservative treatment the bone was solidly united after 2 to 3 months.The analysis of this situation revealed that internal remodelling after absolutely stable fixation did not recognize the presence of the fracture.Primary healing, therefore, is not a healing in the strict sense of the word but a side effect of internal removal of necrotic bone.To maintain early function of the limb and stimulate the healing process the so called biological internal fixation was developed.It combines minimal surgical trauma, acceptable rather than precise reduction and flexible fixation usually achieved with so called internal fixateurs.Flexibility of mind and of tools aims at safe and early healing with full recovery of function and minimal risk of biological complications.",

    "abstract": "Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is one of the up-to-date organic polymer thermoplastics with applications in orthopaedics and trauma medicine. This study presents a detailed analysis of its tests and applications in clinical medicine. A wide range of PEEK modifications and composites are commercially available, e.g., PEEK-Classix, PEEK-Optima, Endolign and Motis. They differ in their physical properties, which makes them suitable for different applications. Other forms, so-called PEEK bioactive composites, contain beta-tricalcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite. Research in this field is also concerned with the surface finish of this polymer thermoplastic and involves macroporous titanium and hydroxyapatite layers, or treatment with laser for an exactly defined surface structure. The clinical applications of PEEK and its composites include, in addition to components for spinal surgery, osteosynthesis plates, screws, intramedullary nails or external fixators, which are implants still at the stage of prototypes. In this review, attention is paid to the use of PEEK thermoplastics for joint replacement. Mid-term studies involving hundreds of patients have shown that, for instance, the VerSys Epoch Fullcoat Hip System (Zimmer) has a markedly lower stress-shielding effect. Carbon fibre-reinforced (CFR-PEEK) composites are used to make articulating components for total hip replacement. Their convenient properties allow for production of much thinner liners and an enlargement of the femoral head diameter, thus reducing the wear of joint implants. CFR-PEEK composites are particularly effective for hip resurfacing in which the Mitch PCR (Stryker) acetabular component has been used with good results. The MOTIS polymer acetabular cup (Invibio Ltd.) is another example. Further PEEK applications include the construction of finger-joint prostheses (Mathys AG), suture anchors (Stryker) and various kinds of augmentations (Medin). Based on the information obtained, the authors suggest further use for CFR-PEEK composites, such as the construction of articulating liners for total shoulder joint replacement, particularly in reverse shoulder arthroplasty.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSThe analysis of 135 surgically treated patients with both column fractures showed that more than half of these patients had associated injuries.The mean age was 40 years, and two thirds of these patients were male.A high energy trauma was the trauma mechanism in 87.4%.The mean ISS was 14.2 points.The mean articular fracture displacement was 14.8 mm.65.9% of the patients showed a central femoral head dislocation.An associated posterior wall fracture was present in 34.8% and an acetabular roof comminution in 34.1%.8.9% of patients had a fracture related nerve damage. RESULTSOsteosynthesis was performed 9.6 days after trauma.Several approaches were used for stabilization with a combina tion of plate and screw fixation in 71.9%.The mean operative time was 287 minutes with a blood loss of 1796 ml.Post operatively the hip joint was congruent in 94.7% with anatomical or near-anatomical joint reconstruction in 75.6%.Iatrogenic nerve injury occurred in 12 patients (8.9%).89 patients (66.4%) could be followed after a mean of 54.6 months.The average subjective Visual Analog Scale pain score was 27.6.Mild or no pain was seen in 60.7%.The mean Merle d'Aubigné score was 15 with 60.7% of patients having a functionally perfect or good result.61.8% had no post-traumatic osteoarthritic changes of their hip joint.A joint failure was diagnosed in 25.8% of the pa tients. DISCUSSIONAnalysing only patients with anatomically reconstructed hip joints patients had better results with 69,8% having no or mild pain and a good or excellent functional result.Post-traumatic arthrotic changes occued in only 17.5% of these patients.A joint failure was present in 25.4%.In this group, a joint failure was significantly more likely to be present with an additional lesion of the femoral head and severe primary articular fracture displacement. CONCLUSIONSIn contrast to other acetabular fracture types, both column fractures show worser results regarding joint reconstruction, and functional and radiological long-term results.The optimal results can be achieved with anatomic joint recontsruction.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS The study involved four groups of implanted composite proximal femoral synthetic bones of eight specimens per group; nailing with PFN, DHS, fixation with three cannulated screws, and EF. 70˚ osteotomy was performed to simulate a Pauwels Type 3 basicervical fracture. Minimum preload of 100 N was applied before loading to failure. The constructs were subjected to cyclic loading with 16˚ to midline from 100 N to 1,000 N for 10,000 cycles at 3Hz. Axial loading was applied at 10 mm/min until failure. Failure load, failure mode, and displacement were documented. RESULTS Mean failure load was 2182.5 ± 377.9 N in PFN group, 2008.75 ± 278.4 N in DHS group, 1941.25 ± 171.6 N in EF group, and 1551.6 ± 236.2 N in CS group. Average displacement was 15.6 ± 4.5 mm, 15.5 ± 6.7 mm, 11.7 ± 1.9 mm, and 15 ± 1.7 mm, respectively. No significant difference was noted among groups for fixation strength except CS group. All CS constructs failed during cyclic loading. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that PFN, DHS and EF achieved higher fixation strengths than CS in basicervical fracture. PFN has higher failure loads and possesses biomechanical benefits for fixation of unstable basicervical fractures compared with DHS and EF.

In all diverse medical departments CRP is often used, and also in orthopaedics CRP is proved to be very helpful in diagnosis and monitor of infections. CRP in most fields is superior to conventional and newer infection parameter and is a basic parameter for inflammation. Especially for detection of an early postoperative infection CRP can be very helpful as an objective parameter easy to obtain. In uneventful operative treatment a similar evolution in CRP concentrations was found: the peak level occurred on the second or third postoperative day and reflected the extent of surgical trauma. A second rise of CRP in the postoperative course indicates a complication. Highest levels are reached in bacterial infection after the forth postoperative day with a cut-off level about 10 mg/dl. CRP can also be used as a preoperative marker for risk stratification and newer times CRP is reported as an independent fracture-risk-factor. In general CRP is the basic inflammatory parameter in orthopaedic surgery and is more significant and common than WBC or ESR. But CRP is only a laboratory parameter and must always be correlated with clinical signs of infection.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Rotator cuff tears are one of the most frequent shoulder disorders which are often associated with pain and interfere with proper arm function. In order to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of using cultured human autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) applied to the suture site during arthroscopic repair of a rotator cuff tear, a prospective clinical study was designed and started recently at the authors' department. Its primary goal was to evaluate the safety of using cultured human MSCs, the secondary goal then was to study a therapeutic effect of their application. Preliminary results of the study on a limited number of patients are presented here. MATERIAL AND METHODS Ten patients who met the indication criteria for arthroscopic repair of a rotator cuff tear were included in the study. In addition, they also had to meet inclusion and lack exclusion criteria. According to the protocol, their bone marrow was harvested at 3 to 4 weeks before surgery. Subsequently, an arthroscopic repair of the rotator cuff tear was performed and an suspension of cultured MSCs was applied to the suture site at the end of the procedure. The isolation of MSCs from bone marrow and their cultivation was carried out by the company Bioinova, Ltd. The patients were followed up at 6 weeks and 3 and 6 months post-operatively. Their clinical assessment included physical examination of the shoulder, pain intensity evaluation according to the visual analogue scale (VAS), and subjective questionnaires for Constant and University of California (UCLA) scores. All patients underwent MRI examination at 6 post-operative months to evaluate the quality of rotator cuff reconstruction. The findings were compared with the pre-operative results. RESULTS A final evaluation was made in eight patients of 10. Two patients were excluded from the study because their exclusion criteria were fulfilled. The evaluated patients showed significantly better clinical outcomes as early as 6 weeks after surgery; also all pre-operative scores were improved at 3 and 6 months. The average values at 6 months post-operatively were: 0 points for the VAS score, 32 for the UCLA score and 84 for the Constant score. The MRI findings at 6 months after surgery showed fully healed and well-integrated tissue of the rotator cuff tendon attachment in all eight patients. No adverse effects of therapy were recorded during the follow-up period. DISCUSSION The use of autologous stem cells and growth factors in the treatment of tendons, muscles and cartilage is currently the topic of many experimental studies on animal models. Its utilisation in human clinical trials has been reported only marginally; the relevant studies have so far used only suspensions of non-cultured mononuclear cells. Our study, although on a smallsize patient group, provides evidence that human cultured autologous MSCs can safely be used for tissue repair in the indications mentioned above. CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary short-term results show that using human cultured autologous MSCs in the treatment of rotator cuff tears is safe. However, further research is needed, particularly with regard to the effectiveness of the method. Key words: rotator cuff tear, arthroscopic repair, mesenchymal stem cells, tendon, cell therapy.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSThis prospective study consisted of 826 patients who underwent primary TKA between September 2010 and March 2015 and had at least one complete post-operative examination.Our group included 296 men and 530 women.The average age at primary TKA was 68.9 (45-87).Primary osteoarthritis was the most frequent indication to surgery (82.6 %).The followup period ranged from 1 month to 3 years.On each follow-up examination, every patient received an original questionnaire with 24 questions concerning the course of their post-operative period (between the discharge from hospital and the planned follow-up).The patients assessed the degree of satisfaction with surgery outcomes on a scale ranging from \"fully satisfied\" to \"dissatisfied\" and expressed their overall satisfaction in percents. RESULTSAt the final follow-up, 6.5% of the patients were not satisfied with the outcome.The patients' overall satisfaction was 90.2 % (i.e., responses to the question of how you were satisfied with surgery).Significantly more satisfied patients were among those with primary osteoarthritis.Their satisfaction was related to the level of the UCLA activity rating, feelings of uncertainty when walking and to the functional ability component of the KSS system.On the other hand, more dissatisfied patients were found among those with several previous operations, a higher ASA score or a higher number of risk factors (Charlson comorbidity score etc.).The duration of pre-operative complaints had no relation to post-operative satisfaction.Similarly, there was no relation between VAS-evaluated pain intensity before TKA and patient satisfaction after arthroplasty.Obesity and satisfaction were not inter-related either. DISCUSSIONAssessment of satisfaction is one of the Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) used by patients to evaluate the effect of a therapeutic method.These instruments aid in assessing the degree to which the method has met the needs and expectations of patients.It is relevant to emphasise that subjective factors, such as expectation or satisfaction, do not depend on the therapeutic procedure only.Recent reports have shown that, in 10% to 30% of the patients, the TKA outcome has not met their expectations.More detailed studies draw attention to the fact that there are more dissatisfied patients after TKA than those after THA.When satisfaction with pain relief is considered, the number of dissatisfied patients is even lower (72%-86%). CONCLUSIONSAn analysis of the patients' responses shows that the rate of satisfaction is high shortly after surgery but declines gradually thereafter.The overall satisfaction is stable about 12 months after the surgery.The number of dissatisfied patients or those reporting pain after TKA in our study is in agreement with the results reported in relevant literature.The associations found here will be used in preparing a tool for clinical outcome prediction.",

We aim to review our long-term specialist orthopaedic institutional experience of Lisfranc injuries and the surgical management of this complex injury, specifically considering surgical outcomes as per radiological and clinical assessment. We present data from a prospectively maintained institutional database, reviewing patients who underwent operative fixation for Lisfranc injury between April 2014 and August 2020. Patients were referred to our institution from hospitals across the country. We included all operatively managed Lisfranc injuries, primary procedures, and patients over the age of 16. Revision procedures, open injuries, polytrauma patients, patients under the age of 16, and those with multiple foot injuries were excluded. We assessed post-operative results as per the Wilpulla radiographic and clinical criteria. We treated 27 patients across the study period, of mean age 37.5 (SD 18.3), 55% male and 45% female. 33.3% of our patients were obese as defined by body mass index >30. As per the Myerson classification, we had 2 category A, 24 category B, and 1 category C injuries. Time to operation was median 14 days (range 0-116), with 2 delayed presentations following failure of conservative treatment. Our median length of stay was 1 day (range 0-16). We had 3 complications: 2 wound infections and 1 re-operation for non-union. Post-operative assessment as per Wilpulla demonstrated 74% of good, 18.5% fair and 7% poor fixation results. In our institutional experience, partial congruity lateral displacement injuries were the majority of surgical referrals. Surgical treatment through open reduction and internal fixation delivers good clinical and radiographically anatomical results. Further to conventional mechanisms of injury, we propose obesity to be an important risk factor for indirect, low-energy injuries that may help identify this injury.

This retrospective study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of aspirin as thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing TKA or THA. In this retrospective review of a database of patients who underwent total hip and total knee replacements between 2021 and 2023, we divided patients into two groups: those with no anticoagulation therapy before surgery and those on chronic anticoagulant use prior to surgery. The primary endpoint was the number of patients with complications after aspirin use in the postoperative period. We collected patient demographic information, history of anticoagulant use, postoperative anticoagulant usage, comorbidities, type of surgery, reactions to anticoagulants, complications related to thromboembolism, length of hospital stay, and hospital readmissions. For patients who underwent elective THA or TKA, no significant difference in overall VTE or PE rates was detected when comparing aspirin with other anticoagulants. No mortality events were reported. However, there were differences in bleeding event rates between the aspirin group and other anticoagulant groups. Proper patient selection and early postoperative mobilization support the use of aspirin as a thromboprophylaxis therapy. The results of this study confirm that aspirin is a safe alternative to other anticoagulants in the postoperative management of THA and TKA.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by progressive damage and loss of articular cartilage with concomitant structural and functional changes in the joint. It is the most common cause of joint pain globally and the resulting productivity loss to the economy. The clinical symptoms of osteoarthritis are mostly determined by the difficulties of patients related to the development of articular degenerative changes, which secondarily lead to joint stiffness and functional limitation. The diagnosis of this disease is currently based on typical clinical symptoms and radiographic findings (e.g. joint space narrowing, osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis, etc.). These parameters, however, are difficult to detect in the early stages of the disease and are most often recognized in the advanced stages. For these reasons, the diagnosis of osteoarthritis is often delayed until irreversible destruction of joint tissue occurs and conservative treatment is less effective. Despite recent scientific progress in understanding the genetic and molecular principles of joint degeneration, currently there is no reliable causal therapy for OA. This review aims to summarize current knowledge of osteoarthritis and possible future directions for diagnosis and early intervention. One of such directions is the study of the so-called biomarkers. A biomarker is defined as an indicator of biological processes and can include radiographic, histological, physiological, or molecular characteristics. In particular, molecular biomarkers are widely studied in knee OA. Attention of the research community is focused on the study of biomarkers as a method of detection and prediction of the early stages of osteoarthritis before irreversible joint damage occurs. Biomarkers help develop more effective and, above all, personalized treatment, thus improve the overall clinical approach to the patient.",

    "abstract": "Open fractures still represent a major challenge for the treating surgeon and frequently demand a complex of soft tissue and bone procedures to achieve an undisturbed healing with adequate limb function. However, despite improvement in operative techniques and antibiotic therapy septic complications still occur in severe open fracture forms up to 50%. They are still deleterious for the patient as well as a major economic factor for the treating hospital. Radical (repetitive) debridement of the wound and coverage of soft tissue defects are of utmost importance in the prophylaxis of septic complications along with antibiotic therapy. If the local wound requires flap coverage, early performed procedures yield a clear decrease of infection rates even in most severe fracture forms. Osseous stabilization contributes to infection prophylaxis, especially when the implants can be inserted in a minimal invasive way and provide an adequate handling of soft tissues and the wound. Thus, most often intramedullary nails and external fixators are used today for osteosynthesis. Recently developed plates with angular stability offer a promising alternative even in open fractures, especially when there is an extension of the fracture into the meaphyseal area though indications have to be evaluated. Manifest septic complications demand an early and aggressive approach with radical eradication of the septic topic. While acute infections require most often only minor surgical procedures and offer the chance to leave implants in situ, chronic infections usually demand complex reconstructive measures of bones and soft tissues.",

    "abstract": "Prophylactic antibiotic treatment is mandatory in every operation involving an orthopedic implant.Carefully selected and correctly administered antibiotics can provide effective protection of the implant from bacterial colonization.The prevention of deep wound infection in joint replacement includes several procedures and measures which constitute three basic groups: 1) Promotion of patient's ability to resist infection (careful pre-operative preparation, elimination of potential infectious loci, good nutritional status, etc).2) Optimal conditions for the operative wound (surgical technique, prophylactic antibiotics).3) Reduction of the number of bacteria brought in the wound (control measures, supersterile operating theatres).Clear rules for the system of prophylactic antibiotic treatment should be adopted.A program in which responsibility for antibiotic administration was shifted from the nursing staff to the anesthesiologist in the operating theatre showed improved outcomes and reduced costs.Poor timing of prophylactic antibiotic administration is one of the basic mistakes.If the wound happened to be contaminated during surgery, the first three post-operative hours would be most decisive for the development of infection.An effective bactericidal concentration of antibiotic should be present in tissues and serum immediately after surgery has begun.Therefore the appropriate time for antibiotic application is before a skin incision is made, and not after the operation has started; the highest serum and bone tissue levels appear 20 to 30 min.after intravenous antibiotic injection.To allow antibiotics to reach target tissues, they should be introduced at least 10 min.before tourniquet application.For long surgical procedures or when blood loss is high, an additional dose of antibiotics is recommended during the operation.If a sample for bacterial cultivation is required, antibiotic administration is postponed until during surgery.However, this is used only in indicated cases when deep infection is suspected and no assessment of the causative agent is available.Otherwise this approach carries a high risk of infectious complications in aseptic revision arthroplasty.Long-term, unjustified administration of antibiotics leads to an increase in resistance to the antibiotic involved.Some studies show that a day's course is as effective as a sevenday one.A shorter antibiotic course decreases the costs, reduces side-effects and minimizes the development of resistance.An optimal duration of antibiotic treatment has not been defined yet, and is still a hot issue for discussion.Many authors recommend one pre-operative antibiotic dose and, according to the kind of antibiotic, agree to its 24-hour administration in order to lower the toxic effect of antibiotic and to prevent selection of resistant microorganisms.The choice of suitable antibiotics for prophylactic treatment should be based on the range of agents causing joint replacement infections and the pharmacological properties of the drug.This should have minimal toxicity, should be well tolerated by the patient and, from the epidemiological point of view, should have a low risk of inducing resistance because of frequent use.Naturally, it is not possible to include all antibiotics against all causative agents and therefore attention should be paid, in the first place, to Gram-positive bacteria, i. e., staphylococci and streptococci, which are the most common causes of infectious complications associated with joint replacement.Because of difficulties related to the right choice of antibiotic, it is recommended to keep a record of complications in each patient in order to provide feedback and to facilitate the establishment of reliable antibiotic-based prevention.The prevention of infection in orthopedics is a comprehensive issue.It cannot be expected that prophylactic antibiotic treatment will compensate for mistakes made in operative protocols, for inadequate operative techniques, for shortcomings in operating theatre equipment or insufficient preparation of patients.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe characteristics, diagnosis, classification and treatment options of rare fractures of the sacrum known as suicidal jumper's fractures are presented based on six illustrative cases. MATERIAL AND METHODSJumper's fractures of the sacrum are characterised by an H-or U-shaped fracture line in the upper sacrum, usually involving the S1-S2 region.Typically, the anterior segment of the pelvic ring is not injured.In most cases this injury is associated with polytrauma and it is imperative that the patients undergo thorough neurological examination including that for perineal sensitivity and anal tone. RESULTSBetween 1998 and 2007, 109 patients were treated for AO/OTA type C pelvic injuries at the Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology.A bilateral fracture of the sacrum with a typical fracture line, i.e., suicidal jumper's fracture, was recorded in six patients (5.5 %), which accounts for 1.2 % of the total number of the pelvic fractures treated.Five patients underwent surgery, one was treated conservatively.Neurological deficit was recorded in five of the six patients.Surgery resulted in bone union and overall improvement in five patients, the patient treated conservatively showed lasting neurological deficit with no progression; she developed pseudoarthrosis. DISCUSSIONTransverse fracture of the sacrum, in the literature referred to as suicidal jumper's fracture, is a rare injury.In 1985 Roy-Camille introduced a classification system for sacral fractures.In the classification proposed by Denis et al., transalar, transforaminal and central fractures are distinguished, with transverse fractures being included.For making exact diagnosis, the AO/OTA classification is necessary.There is a wide range of neurological features associated with displaced sacral fractures.It includes motor and sensory deficit in L5 and S1 dermatomes and myotomes, dysfunction of the sphincters, perineal insensitivity and possibly also sexual dysfunction.Based on the Denis classification, zone I fractures are responsible for 5.9 %, zone II fractures for 28.4 % and zone III fractures for 56.7 % of the neurological deficits associated with sacral injuries.In patients with zone III fractures, urinary bladder innervation and sexual dysfunction are recorded in 76 %, and neurological deficit in 41 %, of which two-thirds are motor neuron lesions.Motor deficits are most often due to L5 and S1 root lesions; sensory deficits result from S2-S5 and L5 root lesions.External rotation and vertical displacement produce a traction mechanism, comminution and impaction of the massa lateralis result in nerve compression.Sacral fractures can be treated conservatively or surgically.Conservative therapy, bed rest, traction and gradual physical therapy are indicated in children and adolescents with non-displaced or slightly displaced sacral fractures, either without or with minimal neurological symptoms.Surgical treatment involving nerve decompression, open reduction of the fracture and subsequent fixation of the fragments is indicated in all displaced fractures.When nerve structures are affected, the injury-surgery interval should not exceed six hour. CONCLUSIONSSacral fractures known as suicidal jumper's fractures are rare but very serious injuries difficult to diagnose.All injured patients should undergo a thorough neurological examination, including perineal sensitivity and anal tone.The treatment includes nerve decompression, fragment reduction and the restoration of sacral and pelvic stability necessary for neurological recovery, early rehabilitation and good clinical outcome.",

    "abstract": "Pediatric pelvic injury is of major significance despite these injuries in children are rare with a suspected yearly rate of 3% of all pelvic injuries.The special pediatric bone anatomy of the pelvis is responsible for different fracture patterns, and overall, a bony or joint injury of the pelvis is an indicator of a severe trauma.The vast majority of pediatric pelvic fractures is the result of a high-energy trauma, especially after strucking by a car or injured as motor vehicle passengers.Additional injuries are common, but additional head injury is only present in 1/3 of patients.An adequate structured primary diagnosis must therefore be mandatory.The a.p.X-ray of the pelvis is still the gold standard to evaluate these injuries.The majority of injuries is mechanically stable with 85-90% expected type A-and B-injuries.Primary management of these injuries is orientated to that of adults.The standard emergency fixation procedure is the external fixator.Definitive treatment depends on the displacement of fractures and the instability of the pelvic ring.In displaced and unstable fractures, today, anatomic reconstruction of the pelvic ring by osteosynthesis is favoured.Due to the potential negative long term consequences of mal-healing child-adapted stabilization techniques should be used.Moratlity is related to concomitant injuries, e.g.severe head injury.Risk factors of mortality are the overall injury severity, additional complex pelvic trauma and the type of pelvic fracture.Nevertheless, growth disturbances occur in rare cases.Therefore, frequent clinical and radiological controls are proposed until the completion of growth.Overall, good and excellent long-term results can be expected in most patients, especially after type A-injuries.But several long-term sequelae can occur in unstable pelvic injuries depending on the instability of the child's pelvis at the time of injury.Overall, there is a good correlation between the clinical and radiological result.Risk factors for a worse result can be additional significant peripelvic injuries (complex pelvic trauma).",

    "abstract": "PURPOUSE OF THE STUDY: Pelvic ring fractures in the geriatric population are of increasing frequency. Often insufficiency fractures or occult fractures are described. With a classical injury mechanism the majority of these injuries are the result of a low energy trauma, typically a fall from standing or during walking.Clinically, many patients report immediate anterior groin pain but detailed clinical examination often shows significant posterior pelvic pain. CT evaluation often reveals posterior pelvic ring injury, in the majority of cases a sacral compression fracture. Despite adequate diagnostics, many of these patients suffer from persistent pain, which can be observed up to 8 weeks after injury. To asses the role of external fixator in pain relief and early mobilisation in this group of patients the study was performed.From the database of all patients with pelvic ring and acetabular injuries 25 patients > 65 years with type B injuries stabilized by a supraacetabular external fixator were analyzed. Prospectively demographic data including sex, patient age, cause of injury, frequency and type of concomitant injuries and diseases, injury severity,fracture type and complications were recorded. For evaluation of the pain course, the visual analog scale was used. Preoperative and postoperative mobility and the type of post-treatment were evaluated.Stabilizing the pelvic ring with a simple external fixation procedure (supraacetabular one pin external fixator) allows immediate relief of pain, which allows early and successful mobilization of these patients. Normally, adequate mobilization is possible immediate after application of the fixator.This simple operative procedure, therefore, can be used for pain control and sufficient mobilization to avoid secondary medical complications.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of femoral neck fractures shows a relatively high number of poor outcomes, usually due to late complications, such as avascular necrosis of the femoral head or pseudoarthrosis. The latter may develop when the osteosynthesis of osteoporotic bone fails. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate a group of patients treated by osteo- synthesis for intra-capsular femoral neck fractures at our department, and to verify indication criteria and identify the therapeutic procedures that are best suited to our conditions.In the 1997-2001 period, a total of 81 patients with intra-capsular femoral neck fractures were operated on. Of these, 64 treated by dynamic hip screw (DHS) fixation were followed up for at least 5 years. There were 33 women and 31 men; the average age was 21.5 years (range, 21 to 74 years).The Garden classification was used to evaluate the displacement of femoral neck fractures. Preferably, osteosynthesis was carried out by closed reduction; only exceptionally was an extension device for the operating table used. A 135-degree sliding hip screw, with a short thread, directed to the head centre and a two-hole side plate were used most often.The average follow-up was 6.9 years. Evaluated were: the occurrence of late complications in relation to the length of time between injury and surgery, quality of fracture reduction, use of an anti-rotation screw and necessity of repeat surgery.Garden I or II fractures were diagnosed in 13 patients, 51 had Garden III or Garden IV fractures. Bone union without complications was achieved in 73.4 % of the patients within 12 months of surgery. Late complications were found in 26.6 %; of these, only one had Garden I fracture and the rest were Garden III and IV fractures. An anti-rotation screw was used in 39 patients (60.9 %) and its use had no effect on the development of late complications. Of the seven patients who developed pseudoarthrosis, the screw was used in four (57.1%); out of the nine patients with avascular necrosis, it was used in six (66.7 %). In the whole group, an unsatisfactory outcome of post-operative reduction was recorded in 29.7 %. In the patients with late complications this was found in 52.9 %, which was a statistically significant difference. Of the 17 patients with poor outcomes, 14 underwent total hip arthroplasty; in the patients with necrosis, arthroplasty was carried out at an average of 26 months post-operatively, in those with pseudoarthrosis it was at 7 months post-operatively.For the treatment of intra-capsular fractures of the femoral neck, surgery is the most frequent approach, but there are controversial views on various relevant issues. An important factor affecting the treatment outcome is the patient's bone quality.Our results show a direct relationship between the extent of fracture displacement and late complications, i.e., avascular necrosis and non-union. The quality of fracture reduction had a greater effect on fracture non-union than on the development of femoral head necrosis. The length of time between injury and surgery played a lesser role than it is believed. The use of an anti-rotation screw was not significantly related to the occurrence of late complications. The DHS method is economical and available, and provided sufficient results whose comparisons with the literature data show that this therapeutic approach is correct.",

    "abstract": "Tibial plateau fractures can range from a simple lateral split pattern to very complex bicondylar injuries that can be a sour- ce of great disability. these fractures can provide a challenge for both junior as well as for senior surgeons alike. careful evaluation of the mechanism of injury and fracture pattern plays a crucial part in the operative planning. Assessment of the soft tissues should be performed carefully and adequate imaging is mandatory to allow a more detailed evaluation of the fracture architecture and pre-operativeplanning. Timely accurate reduction and fixation is the goal. Over the last decade the surgical approach chosen has been largely determined by the fracture pattern. Internal plate osteosynthesis through antero-lateral and postero-medial incisions is the most commonly utilised technique for complex bi-condylar fractures. An early range of motion with special attention to full knee extension is essential for a successful functional outcome. Application of the principles mentioned is a pre-requisite to achieve the best result. New fixation techniques, such as locking plates, have not changed those principles but helped to apply them more reliably.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYTo report on the early results and possible complications of iliosacral screw fixation in the management of unstable pelvic ring injuries. MATERIAL AND METHODSOne hundred and two unstable pelvic ring injuries were treated using iliosacral screw fixation for posterior pelvic ring disruptions.Closed manipulative reductions of the posterior lesion were attempted for all patients.Open reductions were used in the minority of patients with unsatisfactory closed reductions as assessed fluoroscopically at the time of surgery.Anterior fixations were by means of open reduction in 62 patients and by external fixation in 14 patients, and by screws in 7 patients.Twenty patients had no anterior fixation.Plain anteroposterior, inlet and outlet radiographs of the pelvis were obtained postoperatively at six weeks, three months, six months and one year.A pelvic computed tomography scan was performed postoperatively in those patients where residual displacement or screw misplacement was suspected.Complications were recorded. RESULTSOne patient died 31 days after the trauma due to pneumonia and one died 9 months after the surgery after a fall from a height in a second suicidal attempt.There were two posterior pelvic infections and one anterior pelvic infection.Screw misplacement occurred in seven cases.In six cases a misplaced screw produced transient L5 neuroapraxia.There was no fixation failure requiring revision surgery.There was one case of injury to the superior gluteal artery. DISCUSIONUnstable pelvic ring disruptions are severe injuries, associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality.Pelvic fractures can be treated by variety of methods.Treatment with traction and pelvic slings does not offer accurate reduction and confines the patient to prolong bed rest with all potential complications.Several authors documented lower morbidity and mortality rates and shorter hospital stay in patients treated by early operative stabilization of pelvic injuries.The timing of the surgery is still controversial.Some authors in large trauma centres believe that ideally the initial treatment should be the final treatment.The advantage of urgent fixation is the use of this usually minimally invasive technique in the initial stabilisation of a hemodynamically unstable patient.The disadvantage is performance of the surgery under increased stress and time limit, which may lead to the acceptance of sub-optimal reduction.Very good team work of the orthopaedic surgeon, anaesthetist and other involved specialists (general surgeon, urologist) is necessary. CONCLUSIONSIliosacral screw fixation is a useful method of stabilizing unstable pelvic ring injuries.It is a difficult technique, with a steep learning curve.The surgeon must understand the complex and variable sacral anatomy.High quality fluoroscopic imaging is a must.Especially in vertically unstable injuries the sacroiliac screws need to be augmented by sound anterior fixation.Low rates of infection, wound healing problems and minimal blood loss are advantages of this method.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe authors present the long-term results of surgical treatment of deep chondral defects of the knee (medial or lateral femoral condyle).They used the transplantation of autologous cultured chondrocytes in the form of a solid chondral graft. MATERIAL AND METHODSIndications for autologous chondrocyte transplantation most frequently included acute trauma to the knee.Patients with chondral lesions categorized as grades IIIa and IIIb by the Noyes-Stabler classification were indicated for this treatment.A small sample of healthy cartilage was harvested arthroscopically from the non-weight-bearing area of the knee and was sent to the Tissue Bank for chondrocyte cultivation.After 4 to 5 weeks the cultured chondrocytes were formed into a solid chondral graft, implanted at the damaged site of the medial or lateral femoral condyle and fixed with fibrin glue (Tissucol). RESULTSFifty-two patients, 34 males and 18 females (average age, 29 years range, 17 to 45 years) were treated using this method in the period from 2001 to 2009.Follow-up was 6 to 84 months, with an average of 46 months.Thirteen patients were examined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 7 to 39 months (average, 19 months) after the implantation.Full incorporation the chondrograft was observed in 12 patients (92.3%).The clinical results were evaluated by the Lysholm scoring system (1, 2 and 5 years after the operation) and showed significant improvement.In 24 patients, the chondrograft quality was evaluated by immunohistochemical methods in samples taken by second-look arthroscopy from the borders of implantation sites.Hyaline chondral tissue was detected in 100% samples by microscopic examination, and collagen type II was present in 100% samples examined by imnunohistochemistry using haematoxylin-eosin staining. CONCLUSIONSA significant improvement in knee function was recorded when the pre-operative and final follow-up stages were compared.The autologous chondrocyte transplantation showed a potential for the treatment of large cartilage defects.The excellent results achieved allowed the patients to return to normal activity levels.This method is also convenient when ligament reconstruction is necessary during one operation.",

    "abstract": "PURPOUSE OF THE STUDY: Associated transverse and posterior wall fractures account for approximately 20% of all acetabular fractures. To asses the risk of these concommitant bone injuries on early joint failure despite a high rate of postoperative congruency.The analysis of 104 surgically treated patients with associated transverse and posterior wall fractures showed that more than half of these patients had associated injuries. The mean age was 35 years, and > 75% of these patients were male. A high energy trauma was the trauma mechanism in 94.2%. The mean ISS was 26.3 points. The majority of patients showed a juxta- or transtectal fracture line. The mean articular fracture displacement was 13.5 mm. 87.5% of the patients showed a femoral head dislocation. An acetabular roof comminution was present in 16.3%. 20.2% of patients received a fracture related preoperative nerve injury to the sciatic nerve.Osteosynthesis was performed 9.9 days after trauma. The Kocher-Langenbeck approach was used in > 90% for stabilization with a combination of plate and screw fixation in 71.1%. The mean operative time was 190 minutes with a blood loss of 855 ml. Postoperatively the hip joint was congruent in 90.3% with anatomical or near-anatomical joint reconstruction in > 90%. Iatrogenic nerve injury occurred in 12 patients (8.9%).67 patients (67.7%) could be followed after a mean of 42.7 months. The average subjective Visual Analog Scale pain score was 42.7. Mild or no pain was seen in 58.2%. The mean Merle d'Aubigné score was 15.4 with 56.7% of patients having a functionally perfect or good result. 52.2% had no post-traumatic osteoarthritic changes of their hip joint. A joint failure was diagnosed in 32.8% of the patients. Analyzing only patients with anatomically reconstructed hip joints, patients showed comparable results with 61.3% having no or mild pain and 59.2% a good or excellent functional result. Posttraumatic arthrotic changes occur in only 26.5% of these patients. A joint failure was present in 32.7%. In this group, a joint failure was significantly more likely to be present with an additional acetabular comminution zone.Associated transverse and posterior wall fractures have a significant risk of early joint failure despite a high rate of postoperative congruency.",

MATERIAL AnD METHODSThe study comprised 20 patients (male 17, female 3; median age 33.5 range 15-77) who had undergone lower extremity fracture surgery and were diagnosed with aseptic delayed union (8 patients) or non-union (12 patients).Blood taken from the patients was centrifuged to separate PRP, which was then activated by calcium chloride.The prepared PRP was injected into the fracture line under fluoroscopy guidance for totally three times once a week.The application of PRP was made at median 6 (range 6-8) months after fracture surgery.All patients were followed-up with clinical examinations and radiographs over a median period of 11 (range 8-12) months. RESULTSFracture union was achieved in six patients at median 15 (range 8-24) weeks.There was non-union of the fracture in eleven patients during the follow-up period and these patients underwent revision surgery.Sufficient union was not determined radiologically and clinically in three patients.Fracture union was achieved in six of eight patients in the delayed union group.There was no patient in the non-union group with fracture union. COnCLUSIOnSFracture healing is a process affected by many factors.Although PRP has been reported in literature to be a biological treatment which increases healing, adequate healing was not determined in the treatment of non-union with PRP injection.However, in selected patients determined with delayed union, PRP injection can be recommended in non-surgical treatment.",

    "abstract": "Due to the aging population, there is an increasing number of fragility fractures of the pelvis (FFP). They are the result of low energy trauma. The bone breaks but the ligaments remain intact. Immobilizing pain at the pubic region or at the sacrum is the main symptom. Conventional radiographs reveal pubic rami fractures, but lesions of the dorsal pelvis are hardly visible and easily overlooked. CT of the pelvis with multiplanar reconstructions show the real extension of the lesion. Most patients have a history of osteoporosis or other fragility fractures. The new classification distinguishes between four categories of different and increasing instability. FFP Type I are anterior lesions only, FFP Type II are non-displaced posterior lesions, FFP Type III are displaced unilateral posterior lesions and FFP Type IV are displaced bilateral posterior lesions. Subgroups discriminate between the localization of the dorsal instability. FFP Type I lesions are treated non-operatively. FFP Type II lesions are fixed in a percutaneous procedure when a trial of conservative treatment was not successful. FFP Type III lesions are treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). FFP Type IV lesions are treated with bilateral ORIF or with a bridging osteosynthesis. Iliosacral screw osteosynthesis is widely used, but has an elevated risk of screw loosening due to diminished bine mineral density. Transsacral bar osteosynthesis enable interfragmentary compression and does not have this danger of loosening. Bridging plate osteosynthesis is used as an additional fixation to iliosacral screw osteosynthesis. Lumbopelvic fixation is restricted to highly unstable lumbopelvic dissociations. More studies are needed to find the optimal treatment for each type of instability. Key words: pelvis, fragility fracture, diagnosis, classification, treatment.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate, in a retrospective study, injuries to the urogenital tract in patients with pelvic ring fractures. MATERIAL In the years 1998-2007, a total of 308 patients with pelvic ring fractures were treated. The study did not comprise patients with low-energy fractures, such as apophyseolysis in children, osteoporotic bone fractures or pathologic fractures. It also did not include patients with multiple injuries who died within 6 hours of admission to the hospital. The group consisted of 186 men and 122 women with an average age of 34 (range, 6 to 76) years.The fractures sustained were classified as type A in 5 %, type B in 57 % and type C in 38 % of the patients. The average follow-up was 71 (range, 13 to 121) months. A primary injury to the urogenital tract was recorded in 50 (16 %) patients. Injury to the urethra was found in 23 (7.5%) and urinary bladder trauma in 18 (6%) patients, vaginal injury was in four women (1%), and penis injury in three (1%) and lacerated testicles in two men (1%). Injury to the urogenital tract was associated with a pelvic ring fracture type A in 5 %, type B in 34 % and type C in 61 % of the patients. Out of the 23 patients with urethral trauma, only six (26 %) were free from functional and subjective complaints; eight (35 %) continued to receive therapy for urethral stenosis seven (30 %) reported urinary incontinence, and seven men (30 %) had erection problems. In six patients (26%) the lasting sequelae were combined. The 18 patients with injury to the bladder reported no subjective complaints at a one-year follow-up. Two patients with penis root injury had erectile dysfunction. Two patients with the loss of both testicles were in the care of a psychiatrist. The patients' satisfaction was evaluated on a 0-to10-point scale. The average value for the whole group was 4.1 points. In the patients with erectile dysfunction, the value was 0.8, and in those with isolated injury to the urinary bladder it was 9.4 points.The increasing number of injuries to the urogenital tract associated with permanent sequelae is caused by a growing number of pelvic ring fractures as well as, and this is more important, by decreasing mortality in patients with severe trauma to the pelvic ring The extent of urogenital injury is related to the degree of dislocation of the pelvic skeleton. Injury to the male urethra is the most frequent urogenital trauma because of the male anatomy. It occurs most often in unstable C type fractures when the pelvic ring is disrupted with bone displacement due to shear force at the site of urethra attachment. The consequences are related to the quality of treatment of urogenital tract injury as well as to how the skeletal injury is managed. The lasting effects of the primary injury to nerve structures are beyond repair by therapy.Injury to the urethra results in erectile dysfunction in 50 % of the injured patients it is often associated with urinary incontinence that has a strong effect on the patient's life quality. Isolated trauma to the urinary bladder has a good prognosis. The incidence of post-traumatic incontinence is not high, but reduces the patient's personal and social comfort. A prerequisite for a successful therapeutic outcome is a good cooperation of the orthopaedic surgeon and urologist. Key words: pelvic ring fractures, urogenital injury.",

    "abstract": "The malposition of pedicle screws in the lumbar spine is associated with a potential risk of iatrogenic injury of neurological structures but also with a decrease of biomechanical stability. The correct position of the pedicle screws of a dynamic stabilization device, as a long-term implant, seems to be of great importance. A high incidence of screw loosening could influence both the rate of revision surgeries and the clinical results.We compared screw loosening in our own patients with published data after navigated and non-navigated implantation of Dynesys.Posterior instrumentation with the Dynesys system was performed in 19 patients after improvement of facet joint infiltrations. Seven (37%) patients underwent conventional surgery (group I), five (26%) were operated on using a CT-based navigation (group II) and seven (37%) using a fluoroscopic-based navigation (group III). Pre-operatively, the \"Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire (OQ)\" and the \"Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36)\" were used to obtain pain and functional scores. Furthermore, radiographs, MRI and CT examinations were performed before surgery. Screw position was analyzed on post-operative CT scans. At a minimum follow-up of twelve months, clinical examination, plain and dynamic X-rays were performed, and pain and functional scores (OQ, SF-36) were obtained.Pedicle perforation of minimum 2 mm was detected in two group I patients, in one group II and in two group III patients. Regarding OQ and SF-36, an improvement was observed in all patients, except for one column of SF-36. One patient (group I) underwent revision surgery due to symptomatic screw loosening and another patient (group III) due to persistent pain without signs of screw loosening.In former publications the majority of patients improved after Dynesys implantation with or without the use of navigation methods.Malposition of screws was not always followed by screw loosening. Revision surgery due to screw loosening, but without clinical symptoms, was not necessary in the majority of cases.It still remains unclear if screw loosening after Dynesys implantation influences the clinical results or the rate of revision surgery and if malposition of screws will be followed by a higher rate of screw loosening.",

    "abstract": "To present the results of Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS) osteosynthesis for the treatment of proximal femoral fractures with a focus on specific complications of this method. MATERIAL From 1997 till 2007, the authors performed 367 DHS osteosyntheses to treat 341 patients with fractures of the proximal femur. The average patient age was 81.8 years (21-101). Twenty-six patients had surgery for bilateral fractures.Osteosynthesis was always carried out using a 135° DHS (Medin, Nové Město na Moravě, Czech Republic) to manage fractures of the femoral neck (13 ); trochanteric and basic cervical fractures (349 ) and subtrochanteric fractures (5). At the end of 2009 the group was evaluated in terms of specific complications, i.e., intra-operative, early and late post-operative complications, and reoperation incidence. Hip radiographs were made before the patient was discharged, at 6 weeks, then at 3, 6 and 12 months post-operatively.When there were no complications, X-ray examination was repeated every 12 months.A total of 39 specific complications of the DHS system (11 %) were recorded. The 17 intra-operative complications included: insufficient reduction (10), broken tip of a K-wire (3), faulty technical procedure (2) and fracture of the distal fragment during surgery (2). In addition, 22 post-operative complications (both early and late) were recorded: \"cut-out\" phenomenon (6), avascular necrosis of the femoral head (5), progression of coxarthrosis (4), screw breakage (2) , femoral fracture under the plate (2), pseudoarthrosis (2) and late infection (1). Complications in relation to the fracture site were as follows: femoral neck fractures, 3/13 (23 %) all requiring revision surgery; trochanteric fractures, 35/349 (10 %), of these 12 reoperated; subtrochanteric factures, 1/5 (20 %) no revision surgery required. Of the 367 fractures treated by DHS osteosynthesis, 15 (4 %) required revision surgery for specific complications. The mortality rate within one year of surgery was 49 %.Enough information on treatment options for proximal femoral fractures can be found in the literature. However, less attention is paid to their complications. The authors used DHS osteosynthesis to treat 367 fractures during 11 years, and recorded 11 % of complications. These can be prevented by the correct indication (the final decision of the implant to be used is sometimes made only after a fracture reduction under an X-ray image intensifier on the operating theatre), correctly performed procedure and thorough post-operative care. The high one-year mortality was due to the high average age in the group.The authors regard DHS as an effective method to treat stable pertrochanteric fractures and fractures of the femoral neck in younger patients. Complications most often occur as a result of technical mistakes made by surgeons.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSThe adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for chondrocyte differentiation are usually obtained from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs).In this study these cells were compared with mesenchymal stem cells derived from adipose tissue (AMSCs).The aim of the study was to verify the ability of human BMSCs and AMSCs to differentiate into chondrocytes in vitro in the presence or absence of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β1).Human BMSCs and AMSCs were collected from healthy donors during orthopaedic surgeries, in vitro cultured in three passages to obtain the required quantity of cells.A pellet culture system was used for chondrocyte differentiation. RESULTSAt 21 days of cultivation, cell aggregates grown in the chondrogenic medium were larger than those cultured in the control medium.Both the BMSCs and AMSCs pellet cultures showed spontaneous chondrogenesis.Histological staining with haematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome stains, as well as immunohistochemical staining to detect type II collagen revealed no apparent differences between the pellet cultures with TGF-β1 presence and those without it.The real-time RT-PCR detected expression of the type II collagen gene in all tested cultures.In the BMSCs pellet culture only, TGF-β1 presence resulted in a decrease in type I collagen mRNA levels and in an increase in type II collagen mRNA values. DISCUSSIONOur results showed an in vitro chondrogenic potential of mature human mesenchymal stem cells derived from both bone marrow and adipose tissue.In agreement with the relevant literature data, we suggest that both cell types have an equal prospect for use in cartilage tissue engineering.",

PATIEnTS AnD METHODSRetrospective analysis in a level I trauma center.Between the years 2007-2009, 22 patients were treated with double plating due to nonunion of long bone fractures.Long bones included three clavicles, six humeri, three femora, seven ulnae, two tibiae and one radius.The mean period between index procedures (if existed) and revision procedures was 53.35 weeks (range 6 months-3 years).The same surgical technique, independent on the anatomical location was utilized.Perioperative intravenous antibiotics were withheld until intraoperative cultures were obtained in all patients.An approach to the fracture site was performed with removal of all previous existing hardware, including aggressive debridement of the nonunion site while keeping stripping to the necessary minimum.After primary plate fixation of the fracture with adequate compression, a second plate, with at least two well spaced screws on each side, was placed at a ninety degree angle to the primary plate.Autologous bone graft or bone graft substitute was placed in most, but not all cases.All procedures and assessment of union were done by fellowship trained trauma surgeons.In the infected cases, culture specific intravenous antibiotics were administered for six weeks.Quality of life measures included DASH score of the upper extremity, lower extremity functional score (LEfS) for the lower extremity and Short from 12 (Sf-12) for all patients. RESULTSUnion was achieved in all patients, with an average time to union of 5.8 months (range 2-24 months).One patient healed after a repeat double plating, since the first procedure was unsuccessful.Tissue culture were positive in 11 out of 22 patients.One clavicular plate was removed, due to irritation.no hardware failure was noted in these cases.Mean LEfS was 59%, quick DASH score -18.5 20 and Sf-12 MCS and PCS were 50.37 15.22 and 49.96 8.5 receptively.

This study evaluated 70 multi trauma patients in Fatemi trauma center affiliated to Ardabil University of medical science.This study was prospective study populations were 70 trauma patients admitted in Fatemi trauma center. During the II month, and patients data was collected by clinical evaluating of patients and follow up them and arranged as a questionnaire then related findings were evaluated by SPSS software.The average age of patients was 37.6±23.5 years and minimum and maximum age was 1 and 85 years. The most common involved group was 10-19 years (13 men and 1 woman). 81.4% of patients (57 cases were male) and 18.6% were female (13 cases). The most common causes of trauma was car accident with 64.2% frequency (43 cases) and then motorcycle accident with 16.4% frequency (11 cases) and all injured patient due to motorcycle accident compose the age group less than 40 years old. Also car accident had the highest frequency in both gender. Other causes of trauma were fall down with 13.5% frequency (9 cases) and under debris 5.9% (4 cases). Also from 70 studied patients, 67 cases (95.7%) had blunt trauma and 3 cases (4.3%) had penetrating trauma. The most penetrating trauma occurs in ages less than 50 years and was in the range of 30-50 years.

The average length of ICU stay was 12.14±11.11 days. Overall mortality was 15.7 (11 cases). In this study, by the ISS increasing, the mortality rate also increased. But there is no relation between the mortality rate and RTS ratio.The ISS scoring system performed better than the RTS in predicting of mortality and probability of survival and the length of ICU stay and had high accuracy and can predict patients' outcome better by ISS measuring.",

The plates were repeatedly applied bridging a comminuted bone segment in a heavy patient. The biomechanical analysis elaborates why this happened and proposes an unconventional procedure to prevent this failure with a minimally invasive procedure. A plate bridging an open gap or a defect in a long bone diaphysis is exposed to full functional load. According to clinical observations such plate application often fails even without external load such as weight bearing. The plate risks to break through fatigue when exposed during a long time to cyclic loading. This type of failure has been observed even with broad plates as well in femoral as in tibiae. The first option to avoid such failure consists in protecting the plate by installing load sharing between plate and either bone or an additional implant. This reduces the load carried by the plate to a safe level. Load sharing with bone may be installed at surgery by establishing solid mechanical bridge between the two main fragments of the fractured bone. The optimal load sharing relies on a solid compressed contact between the main fragments. It can be established because the bone is able to take a large load which results in optimal protection of the plate. In the case of an extended comminuted bone segment it may be very difficult, traumatizing and inefficient to reconstruct the bone. In the present case it was impossible to establish load sharing through the bone. The second option protecting the plate is provided by callus bridging of the gap or defect. The formation of a solid callus bridge takes time but the fatigue failure of the plate also takes time. Therefore, the callus bridge may prevent a late fatigue failure. The surgeon may select one of several options: - Replacing the lack of bone support using a second plate which immediately alleviates plate loading. The drawback of application of a second conventional plate is the extent of surgical trauma at the critical site of healing. - Shingling and/or applying an autologous cancellous bone graft: This procedure provides initially no relevant load sharing but will do so after a couple of weeks. The mechanical coupling of the comparably soft graft and the main fracture fragments presents little problems. Applying a cortical bone graft: Such a graft does provide initial only small load sharing and does a less good job inducing callus than a cancellous graft. Furthermore, the coupling by callus between a somewhat rigid bone graft and the mobile main fracture fragments requires a solid maintained contact. If the cortical graft is fixed using implants with small contact area to the graft such as screws or cerclage loops, the local stress may be critical and the graft may break. When the cortical graft is fixed with cerclage wires the procedure must take into account the limited strength of the individual cerclage. Therefore multiple and well-spaced cerclages are required and may lead to success especially if an intramedullary component of the implant contributes to protection (6). The degree of unloading depends apparently on the stiffness of the material of the protecting splint. Though, more important is the effect of the dimensions of the splint. While titanium as a material is about 50% less stiff than steel, the thickness of the implant changes the stiffness with the third power. That is doubling the thickness results in eightfold increased stiffness. When considering the unloading by application of a second plate the leverage of the second plate plays an important role. The larger the distance between the axis of bending and the second implant the larger the protecting effect. The helical plate (2, 3, 7) as introduced by A.A.D. Fernandez offers biological and mechanical advantages. It can be applied without touching the fracture site maintaining the critical biology intact and provides mechanically efficient unloading. Its application is fairly simple: The helical plate is modified conventional long and small plate that is twisted between its ends about 90 degrees. The twist is applied using \"bending irons\" (4, 5, 8) whereby the force required is small and the exact degree of twist is not critical. Therefore the twist is applicable operating bending irons by hand. Assuming a situation where a plate bridging a defect or non-union has failed the broken plate is replaced by a similar implant: At the distal end of the bone fracture and opposite to the surgical approach a small incision allows to slide in the helical plate in such a way that proximally the plate ends on the same side of the limb as the replaced plate. Ideally the two plate ends meet and the application of the helical plate does not ask for an additional surgical exposure at this location. Otherwise a small minimally invasive exposure is required. The helical plate is then fixed to the main bone fragments using a couple of locked screws. The following case demonstrates the use and efficiency of the helical plate saving a situation where multiple attempts using conventional plates had failed. The successful final treatment of this case was performed by A. A. D. Fernandez.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this retrospective study was to present a comprehensive overview of the causes of bone-tendon-bone (BTB) autograft failure after primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. MATERIAL AnD METHODS: Between 2003 and 2013, we performed revision ACL replacement in 47 patients who had undergone primary BTB autograft ACL reconstruction in other hospitals. The group consisted of 16 women (aged 25 to 48 years) and 31 men (25 to 46 years). Surgery was performed on the right knee in 26 and on the left knee in 21 patients. In each of the 47 patients, two different assessments were made: 1. Analysis of causes of failure based on surgical protocols and/or intra-operative video records taken during most of the procedures. 2. Evaluation of bone tunnel location on lateral knee radiograms, using the method described by Harner for femoral tunnels and that reported by Stäubli and Rauschning for tibial tunnels.The most frequent cause of knee instability, occurring in 51.1% of the patients, was new trauma to the knee. nontraumatic instability in the remaining 48.9% was due to insuffiiency of the graft, and resulted from an incorrect surgical technique (42.5%) or biological causes (6.4%). The most common surgical mistake found was incorrect bone tunnel placement in the tibia or femur, with a malpositioned femoral tunnel being most frequent. This was diagnosed in 32 patients (68.1% of all patients) and, in 17, was the main or major cause of BTB graft failure.Based on relevant literature data and our experience, principles for prevention of graft failure after ACL reconstruction can be summarised as follows: 1. harvest of a suffiiently strong BTB autograft 2. accurate anatomical bone tunnel placement 3. appropriate tension of the BTB autograft 4. preventing graft impingement 5. secure graft fiation 6. early functional rehabilitation with an accent on delaying full weight-bearing on the knee (6 to 9 months post-operatively)New trauma to the knee is the most frequent cause of BTB autograft failure after ACL reconstruction. This can be avoided by participating in a professionally guided rehabilitation programme and not returning to sports activities earlier than 9 months after ACL reconstruction. The most common technical error in ACL reconstruction is non-anatomical tunnel placement in the tibia and femur. Femoral tunnel malposition is most frequent while incorrect tibial tunnel placement, which does not inflence graft failure so much, is less common.",

    "abstract": "The choice of best procedure in fracture treatment relies on a proper understanding of tissue reactions to the prevailing mechanical and biological conditions.Investing time and effort is rewarding as it opens up access to a fascinating world and improves fracture treatment based on logical decision making.An intact bony skeleton enables mechanical functions of the human body such as locomotion.This function of the bone is made possible by its stiffness and strength, which allows bone to carry load without undergoing major deformation while remaining intact even under heavy loads.The shortcoming of bone as a strong and stiff material is its brittleness.Its brittleness prevents bone from bridging a fracture under unstable conditions.In spontaneous healing or healing under flexible fixation, a cascade of repair tissues stabilizes the fracture and allows for solid bony union.Excessive load fractures the bone.Disrupted bone loses its stiffness.Loss of stiffness and, consequently, loss of skeletal support disables the function of the limb.fracture healing is a ubiquitous and spontaneous process which restores stiffness as a prerequisite for mechanical function.Restoration of mechanical integrity requires that bone bridges and/or remodels the fracture site.If there is high initial tissue deformation (strain) at the fracture site, bone as a brittle material cannot bridge the gap.In spontaneous healing or healing under flexible fixation a cascade of consecutive phases of tissue differentiation are required to overcome this shortcoming of bone.The cascade increases tissue stiffness at the expense of tolerance to deformation until a low value of interfragmental strain is reached that then allows bone to form a solid bridge.The cascade of differentiation is impressive as a \"reasonable\" process with a goal.Therefore, bone healing is often considered as a rational process where the repair tissues are expected \"to think and to act in order to achieve\".we propose the observation of bone reactions without assuming that these reactions are guided by goal-oriented intelligence because the latter is non-existent.Observing the unexpected without having a preconceived opinion is a precondition for new insight.This approach avoids being misled into projecting one's own thinking into tissues that react without goal orientation.fracture healing is a repair process which requires induction and must be enabled.To get a feel for the problem we will first address the mechanical properties of bone as the prerequisites for its mechanical functions.Then we will discuss which conditions induce and which enable the repair process.The following paper addresses a fascinating interplay between physical and biological processes that enable fractured bone to bridge solidly and remodel to regain its \"pre-fracture\" function and structure.no one of the different treatment modalities or healing patterns is best on its own.for a given situation the goal is to recover the function of the bone, limb and patient early and permanently by choosing the optimal procedure and implant.Understanding bone reactions permits a rational choice and replaces subjective predilection and monomania.The stability of the fixation and the blood supply are priority considerations, which must often be weighed against each other.",

    "abstract": "The ilioinguinal approach is one of the standard approaches in the treatment of displaced acetabular fractures used during the last decades (9). The meta-analysis of Giannoudis et al. showed that 21.9% of acetabular fractures were historically treated using this approach (3). One of the disadvantages of this study was, that studies focussing especially on posterior wall stabilization and studies dealing with more complex fracture types treated by extended approaches were integrated. Thus, these fracture types were overrepresented. Re-analysis excluding these data lead to an increase of the rate of anterior approaches to 25.9%. More recent data (years 2005-2007) from the German multicenter study showed that presently in almost 45% of the cases the single ilioinguinal approach was used and only 38% of patients were stabilized via the KocherLangenbeck approach (11). Historically, the Smith-Peterson approach (15, 17) and the iliofemoral approach were used to treat acetabular fractures. In the 60ies, based on the work by Letournel and Judet, the ilioinguinal approach was developed for acetabular fracture fixation (9). It is an extrapelvic approach resulting in an indirect reconstruction concept of the acetabulum without direct visualization of the articular acetabulum. The ilioinguinal approach was the standard anterior approach during the last 30-40 years. An important advantage is the reduced soft tissue detachment of periarticular muscles with only a small risk of developing heterotopic bone formation. The aim of the second part of \"Standard approaches to the acetabulum\" is to report on the special topics indication, positioning, exposure, incision, dissection, the anatomical basis of osteosynthesis and present results using ilioinguinal approach.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSTo simulate the pathological status of arthritis, rat chondrocytes were used to establish the osteoarthritis (OA) model by IL-1β (10 μg/ml) as a modulating in vitro, and exosomes were isolated by differential ultra-high speed centrifugation.The cell counting kit-8, wound healing and flow cytometry assays were utilized to assess proliferation, migration and apoptosis of chondrocytes, respectively.Lipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation of chondrocytes were detected by oil red O staining and toluidine blue staining individually.The expressions of miR-140-3p and chondrocyte-specific gene mRNA were investigated using qRT-PCR.Western blot was applied to assess chondrocyte associated proteins and BMSC-Exo surface protein markers, and immunohistochemistry was adopted to detect the staining of collagen I and II. RESULTSUnder scanning electronic microscope, the shape of exosomes was almost round.Exosome treatment prominently impaired the inhibition of chondrocytes' proliferative and migrative ability by IL-1β.It was found hypoxia had a more marked impact on proliferation, expression of collagen II and apoptosis in OA chondrocytes than normoxia, as well as a stronger effect on weakening adipose differentiation and enhancing chondrogenic differentiation in inflammatory chondrocytes.Furthermore, incubation with BMSC-Exo overexpressing miR-140-3p can remarkably increase the survival rate and migration in inflammatory chondrocytes.In addition, overexpression of miR-140-3p was found to enhance the chondrogenic differentiation of inflammatory chondrocytes.Furthermore, we found that the healing effect of exosomes on inflammatory chondrocytes under hypoxic conditions was produced by a rise in miR-140-3p expression within them and that hypoxia-mediated upregulation of miR-140-3p expression occurred through HIF-1α. CONCLUSIONSUnder hypoxia, BMSC-Exo enhanced the chondrogenic phenotype, increased the viability of inflammatory chondrocytes.The overexpression of miR-140-3p in BMSC-Exo is beneficial to protect joints and delaying the pathogenesis in OA.",

    "abstract": "The anterior approach to the thoracic and lumbar spine is used with increasing frequency for various indications. With the advent of prosthetic intervertebral disc replacement, its use has become even more frequent and has often been associated with serious complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate vascular complications in patients who underwent anterior spinal surgery of the thoracic and lumbar spine.We performed a total of 531 operations of the thoracolumbar spine from the anterior approach. In 12 cases, after exposure of the body of the first or second thoracic vertebrae, we employed the Smith-Robinson technique to expose the cervical spine. We used sternotomy in six, posterolateral thoracotomy in 209, the pararectal retroperitoneal approach in 239, anterolateral lumbotomy in 58 and the transperitoneal approach in seven patients. The aim of surgery was somatectomy in 190 patients and discectomy in 341 patients. Sternotomy and transperitoneal approaches were carried out by a thoracic or vascular surgeon and all the other procedures were done by the first author. The indications for spinal surgery included an accident in 171, tumor in 56, spondylodiscitis in 43 and a degenerative disease in 261 patients.All patients indicated for anterior spinal surgery were examined by conventional radiography in two projections, and this was completed by CT sagittal and frontal reconstructions of the affected region. Most patients also underwent MR imaging. The Smith-Robinson approach was used for exposure of T1 or T2. Sternotomy was indicated for treatment of T2-T4 and also T1 in the patients with a short, thick neck. Access to T3-L1 was gained by posterolateral thoracotomy, in most cases performed as a minimally invasive transpleural procedure. For access to the lumbar spine we usually used the retropleural approach from a pararectal incision or lumbotomy. We preferred the pararectal retroperitoneal approach in L2-S1 degenerative disease, L5 fractures, and L5-S1 spondylodiscitis. We carried out lumbotomy in patients with trauma, tumors and L1-L4 spondylodiscitis. The transperitoneal approach from lower middle laparotomy was used only in tumors at L5 or L4. For treatment of trauma and degenerative disease of the lumbar spine we preferred less invasive procedures, and for tumors and spondylodiscitis we used more extensive exposure because of the difficult terrain. The patients were followed up for 2 to 96 months (average, 31.4 months) after anterior spinal surgery.In 12 patients treated by the Smith-Robinson procedure and in six patients undergoing sternotomy, neither early nor late signs of any injury to major blood vessels or internal organs were recorded. The 209 patients with posterolateral thoracotomy were also free from any signs of vascular injury, but trauma to the thoracic duct was recorded in one case. We found injury to major blood vessels in three patients in the group treated by the pararectal retroperitoneal procedure. In the total of 531 anterior spinal surgery procedures this accounts for 0.56 %; of the 304 lumbar operations and 239 pararectal retroperitoneal operations it is 0.99 % and 1.26 %, respectively. In one patient the vascular injury was associated with trauma to the ureter.In our group of 531 patients we found a higher risk of vascular injury when the L4-L5 segment was treated, when less invasive surgery was used or when spinal anatomy was altered due to tumor or spondylodiscitis. All the complications were recorded in the first 250 patients. It should be emphasized that, because in five patients, the planned anterior spondylodesis would have been associated with high risk due to altered anatomy of the bifurcation of the aorta, these patients were treated by dorsal instrumented spondylodesis. We also avoided the anterior approach for revision spinal surgery and used the posterior approach instead. Vascular complications were treated in cooperation with a vascular or cardiac surgeon. In the most serious case, if a sophisticated cardiosurgical technique had not been immediately available, the patient would probably have died.The technique of anterior approach is safe only in the hands of experienced spinal surgeons with long experience. In institutions where anterior spinal surgery is not a routine method it is advisable to involve a vascular or cardiac surgeon. However, the most important point is to know when not to operate.",

The aim of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of antiseptic agents in the prevention of postoperative complications associated with surgery on the proximal femur, hip and pelvis in children.This prospective randomized study included 162 patients with the following diagnoses: cerebral palsy, developmental hip dysplasia, Perthes' disease, epiphyseolysis of the femoral head, and tumors. A total of 182 surgical procedures were carried out on soft and bone tissues in the proximal femur, hip and pelvis regions. The patients were allocated to two groups according to the intra-operative conditions used. Group 1, including 89 patients, was treated with 3.5 % solution of betadine before final closing of the wound and group 2, comprising 73 patients, received no betadine irrigation during the intraoperative period. The other operative and post-operative conditions provided for the patients were identical; surgery was carried out in one operating theatre without laminar air flow.The average follow-up was 7.8 months (range, 2-14 months).

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the exact localization of the histopathological process (bone, bone-tendon junction or tendon), and to determine whether the underlying pathologic process is predominantly of inflammatory or degenerative nature, then to evaluate the outcome of the surgical treatment of patellar tendinopathy.A prospective cohort study was performed in order to analyze the outcome of surgical treatment of patellar tendinopathy, as well as to document histopathological changes in bone, bone-tendon junction, and in the patellar ligament in 34 professional athletes treated with patellar apicotomy. All the patients included in the study were classified as stage 3 according to Blazina and showed no improvement after at least 6 months of conservative treatment. The postoperative follow-up was from 1 to 8 years with a mean value of 4.7 years.The postoperative results were analyzed using a semiquantitative scoring system where the functional outcome was classified as very good if the athlete returned to his sporting activity without any negative side effects, good if the athlete resumed his sporting activities with modest painful sensations present only at the maximum level of physical exertion, and poor if any reduction of athletic activity was present. In twenty patients a histopathological examination of resected bone and tendon tissue was performed. The specimens were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and examined under a light microscope using polarization. Special stains used were Alcian blue, to detect any increase in ground substance, and Prussian blue which enhances conspicuity of hyaline degeneration and enables detection of hemosiderin. Immunohistochemistry was performed in order to analyze presence of blood vessels, leukocytes and histiocytes.Very good results were achieved in 20 of operated knees, good results were achieved in 12 of knees and poor results were achieved in 2 of operated knees. Pathological changes in the bone were found in 35% of analyzed specimens, abnormality at the bone-tendon junction were found in 75% of the specimens, and changes in the patellar tendon were found in all extracted specimens. The histopatholological nature of the lesions found within the tendon tissue in all of the analyzed specimens belongs to the group of degenerative changes.Currently a consenus has been established that the expression tendinitis is \"out\", and the term tendinopathy should be used instead. No inflammatory cells and no increase in prostaglandins can be detected in the tendons. Histopathological studies of the tissue fibrils affected by tendinosis characteristically demonstrate hypercellularity, hypervascularity, lack of inflammatory infiltrates, and disorganization and loosening of collagen fibers.The clinical results and histopathological examination in our series justified our operative method. In the chronic stage these lesions are irreversible and constitute permanent intratendinous lesions. It thus seems logical to excise these lesions from their origin at the apex of the patella and entry into the adjacent tendon. It is also recommended on the basis of our and other authors' research that the term patellar tendinopathy should be used instead of tendonitis/tendinitis.",

    "abstract": "A retrospective analysis of complications associated with surgical treatment of pelvic ring fractures.Between 2004 and 2011 a total of 257 patients with pelvic ring fractures, 176 men and 81 women with an average age of 36 years, were treated. The average follow-up was 53 months (range, 13 to 108 months). AO type C fractures, which were most frequent, were recorded in 67%, type B fractures in 30% and type A fractures in 3% of the patients. Displaced unstable fractures or markedly displaced type A fractures of the pelvic ring were indicated for surgery.Three types of complications were distinguished, i.e., intra-operative, early and late. Of a total of 40 intra-operative complications in 31 (16%) patients, the most frequent ones included malreduction in 14 patients (5%), nerve injury in 12 (5%), erroneous insertion of an implant in seven (3%) and vascular injury in six (2%) patients. Early post-operative complications requiring repeat surgery that were recorded in 15 patients (6%) were due to failure of osteosynthesis in seven patients, early wound infection in six, and haematoma which needed exploration in two patients. There were 25 late post-operative complications in 18 patients and they included fracture union with pelvic deformity in eight (3%) patients, chronic posterior pelvic pain in seven (3%), inguinal hernia through a scar in six (2%), pseudoarthrosis in three (1%) and late infection in one patient.The outcome of surgery depends on the fracture type, method of management and associated injuries; the patient's age and bone quality also play a role. Risk factors for the development of complications include markedly displaced and unstable pelvic ring fractures, open fractures, complex pelvic injury and associated injuries which do not allow for immediate definitive fracture stabilisation. Not every poor outcome is due to a complication per se or, the other way round, is exclusively related to the type of fracture. Many long-term sequelae arise from complex injuries. Because the anatomy of the pelvis is very complex, pelvic fractures are often associated with injury to the nerve structures and their management by reduction and fixation is difficult.The characterisation and evaluation of complications associated with the management of pelvic ring fractures is problematic because it is difficult to distinguish which of them have been caused by pelvic ring fracture and associated injuries and which are due to surgical treatment. Although most complications arise from injury, the increasing role of surgery in their treatment leads to a higher rate of iatrogenic complications most frequently resulting from an improper surgical technique, including fracture reduction and/or fixation.",

RESULTSRenal cell carcinoma and breast cancer were the most abundant types of primary tumour.The mean time from diagnosis of primary tumour to first metastasis was 14.5 months (range 0-173).The mean time from diagnosis of metastasis to surgery was 21.4 months (range 0-173).38/28 intramedullary nails/locking plates were used for 58/8 manifest/impending pathological fractures.Mean cumulative survival was 16.3 months and implant failure rate was 6.1% with a mean time from initial surgery to revision of 22.2-20.6months. CONCLUSIONSOur data indicate that treatment with intramedullary fixation or cement augmented plate osteosynthesis is successful for the vast majority of patients, but thorough clinical evaluation and precise decision making adapted to the patient's estimated life expectancy must be applied to avoid overtreatment or risk of implant failure.",

    "abstract": "At the present time proximal femoral fractures account for 30% of all fractures referred to hospitals for treatment. Our population is ageing, the proportion of patients with post-menopausal or senile osteoporosis is increasing and therefore the number of proximal femoral fractures requiring urgent treatment is growing too. In the age category of 50 years and older, the incidence of these fractures has increased exponentially. Our department serves as a trauma centre for half of Prague and part of the Central Bohemia Region with a population of 1 150 000. Prague in particular has a high number of elderly citizens. Our experience is based on extensive clinical data obtained from the Register of Proximal Femoral Fractures established in 1997. During 14 years, 4280 patients, 3112 women and 1168 men, were admitted to our department for treatment of proximal femoral fractures. All patients were followed up until healing or development of complications. In the group under study, 82% were patients older than 70 years; 72% of those requiring surgery were in their seventies and eighties. Men were significantly younger than women (p<0.001) and represented 30% of the group. The fractures were 2.3-times more frequent in women than in men. In the category under 60 years, men significantly outnumbered women (p<0.001). The patients with pertrochanteric fractures were, on the average, eight years older than the patients with intertrochanteric fractures, which is a significant difference (p<0.001). The mortality rate within a year of injury was about 30%. Trochanteric fractures accounted for 54.7% and femoral neck fractures for 45.3% of all fractures. The inter-annual increase was 5.9%, with more trochanteric than femoral neck fractures. There was a non-significant decrease in intertrochanteric (AO 31-A3) fractures. On the other hand, the number of pertrochanteric (AO 31-A1+2) fractures increased significantly (p<0.001). A total of 1 394 fractures were treated with a proximal femoral nail; a short nail was used in 1260 and a long nail in 134 of them. A dynamic hip screw (DHS) was employed to treat 947 fractures. Distinguishing between pertrochanteric (21-A1, 31-A2) and intertrochanteric (31-A3) fractures is considered an important approach because of their different behaviour at reduction. Pertrochanteric fractures occurred more frequently (81.5%); the patients' age was higher (80 years on the average) and women outnumbered men at a ratio of 3:1. Intertrochanteric fractures were found in significantly younger patients (average, 72 years), with a women-to-men ratio of 1.3:1. Stable pertrochanteric fractures (31-A1) were preferably indicated for DHS surgery. Unstable pertrochanteric (31-A2) and intertrochanteric (31- A3) fractures were treated with a nail. The patients underwent surgery on the day of injury or the next day. In the case of contraindications to an urgent intervention, surgery was performed after the patient's medical condition had stabilised. The number of complications was largely related to technical errors, such as insufficient reduction or an incorrectly inserted implant. Intertrochanteric fractures were associated with a higher occurrence of complications. No implant can compensate for errors due to surgery. Serious complications can be reduced by the correct assessment of fracture type, the use of an appropriate operative technique and early treatment of potential complications. The necessity of restoring continuity in the medial cortex of the femoral neck (Adams' arch) is the requirement that should be observed. Pseudoarthrosis or varus malalignment in a healed hip should be managed by valgus osteotomy. When the femoral head or the acetabulum is damaged, total hip arthroplasty is indicated. A prerequisite for successful surgical outcome is urgently and correctly performed osteosynthesis allowing for early rehabilitation and mobilisation of the patient.",

    "abstract": "A prospective cohort study evaluates the functional and radiological outcome of thoracolumbar spine fractures treated either with open or percutaneous dorsal instrumentation. In recent years, several studies advocate percutaneous stabilization of spinal fractures in patients without neurological deficits. However, it is still debated whether percutaneous stabilization is superior to open dorsal instrumentation in spinal trauma.This study was performed between 2010 and 2012 at a Level 1 trauma center. Patients treated either with an open or a percutaneous dorsal instrumentation for traumatic fractures of the thoracolumbar spine (T11 to L2) were included. Fracture morphology, screw positioning and clinical parameters were analyzed. Standardized questionnaires (VAS-spine-score; Oswestry-disability-score; SF-36) and follow up radiographs were performed.Overall 72 patients (29 percutaneous; 43 open) could be included. The surgical and the early postsurgical course were similar between both groups. Furthermore the operative approach had no influence on the functional and radiological outcome one year after surgery, but the questionnaires showed moderate impairments within both groups. Also both groups showed a significant loss of reduction after the first postoperative month (p < 0.01). Within the open group a significantly higher amount of fracture reduction (p < 0.01) and a significantly reduced intraoperative radiation exposure was seen (open 105.9 sec.; percutaneous 143.1 sec; p < 0.05); whereas the percutaneous approach was associated with significantly reduced intraoperative blood loss (open 2.2 g/dl; percutaneous 1.2 g/dl; p < 0.001).The functional and the radiological outcome of both groups was comparable one year after trauma. Minor advantages of the percutaneous system was less blood loss, whereas the open approach was associated with a significantly higher amount of initial reduction and significantly less intraoperative radiation exposure. Independent from the type of posterior fixation loss of reduction was already significant in the early postoperative course.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS In total, 452 patients undergoing THA or TKA were randomised to 3 groups: 1) the IV TXA group received 2 doses of TXA 1 g intravenously 3 hours apart; 2) the topical TXA group received TXA 2 g topically, and 3) the NO TXA - control group. Furthermore, each group was divided in two subgroups by performed surgery (THA versus TKA). The following endpoints were used for final analysis: postoperative blood loss, transfusion requirement, haemoglobin drop and postoperative complications (haematoma, surgical site infection, thromboembolism, early surgical revision). RESULTS Both topical and IV administration of TXA significantly reduced postoperative bleeding (mean ± standard deviation) after THA and TKA (topical 504.4±281.0 ml, IV 497.3±251.7 ml, NO 863.1±326.4 ml, p<0.001). Topical use was superior to IV in reducing postoperative drainage output in THA (topical 377±213.3 ml, IV 518.1±259.0 ml, p<0.01). On the opposite, IV use was superior to topical in drainage output in TKA (topical 646.1±281.3 ml, IV 457.8±235.8 ml, p<0.01). The differences in transfusion requirement and Hb drop between these administration methods were not statistically significant (p≥0.05), but any TXA administration was significantly better than no TXA in all endpoints of efficacy (p<0.001). The lowest complication rate was observed in the topical group (NO 24%, IV 19%, topical 7.5%). DISCUSSION Consensus on optimal TXA dosing regime in primary hip and knee arthroplasties is still missing. Use of TXA therapy in routine clinical practice is highly individualized in accordance with the current approach of personalized medicine. Topical application seems to be the safest route of TXA administration. However, precise application technique is essential. IV TXA is beneficial especially in patients with some bleeding coagulopathies undergoing TKA with a tourniquet. Repeat doses of TXA are not usually necessary after completed primary arthroplasties. CONCLUSIONS IV and topical TXA 2 g have similar effect on reduction of transfusion requirements and haemoglobin drop in THA and TKA. The IV route is superior to topical in TKA while topical TXA reduces complications in both THA and TKA. Key words: tranexamic acid, total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, topical administration, intravenous administration.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSA retrospective observational study in a population of 470,000 habitants was performed.Over the course of three years, all patients over 16 years of age who were diagnosed with fracture or fracture-dislocation at the level of a carpal bone, metacarpal and/or phalange were included.These fractures were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases 10 th edition (ICD-10).Incidence rates, along with gender and age distribution were also studied. RESULTS1,267 patients with a total of 1,341 hand fractures were included.They represented 29.7% of all upper limb fractures and 7.6% of all traumatological emergencies involving a bone fracture during that period.The most frequent ICD-10 group was S62.3, with the fifth metacarpal as the most often affected bone (39.7%).The most frequent location at the level of the phalanges (S62.5) was the proximal third of the proximal phalanx of the fifth radius.The global incidence rate was 99 fractures per 100,000 persons/year.No seasonal variation was observed.Only 10.2% of hand fractures received surgical treatment. DISCUSSIONSeveral epidemiological studies have been published on fractures in the hand, but none have used the ICD-10 classification.Although the distribution of our stratified sample by age and gender was similar to those previously published, the incidence rate in our study was much lower.We may possibly extrapolate our results to the rest of the Spanish population and even to the rest of the population of southern Europe, given the scarcity of epidemiological studies on this matter in these geographical areas. CONCLUSIONSThe ICD-10 classification is useful for the description and classification of hand fractures.The most often affected group is that including metacarpals of the long fingers (S62.3),being the distal level of the fifth metacarpal in young male patients the most frequent one.Most fractures are treated conservatively and in case of surgical treatment, the preferred surgical techniques include K-wire fixation, interfragmentary compression screws and plate osteosynthesis.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSBetween 1990 and 2005 a total of 14 arthrodeses of the CMC joint of the thumb were performed in 12 patients.The Carroll technique used in all cases involved a conical shaping of the first metacarpal base and a corresponding shaping of the trapezium articular surface, their subsequent set-up and fixation with Kirschner's wires.The patients were assessed for the presence of pain, changes in mobility and muscle strength before and after surgery.The comprehensive evaluation of the whole group was carried out by means of the Cooney score. RESULTSArthrodesis resulted in complete union of the CMC joint of the thumb in all cases.The patients were followed up for 5 years on average.The initial painful hand grip subsided in most of them.The initial restriction of motion remained, but was painless in almost all cases.However, broad grip strength improved on average by 35 %.The comprehensive Cooney score showed 64 % of excellent and very good results.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the clinical and functional outcomes of total hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients with acetabular fractures due to a low-energy injury. Acute primary THA included an antiprotrusion cage and autologous bone grafting of the acetabulum. This prospective study was carried out between 1998 and 2004.Ten patients, of whom six were men, (average age, 71 years; range, 60 to 83 years) with acetabular fractures were treated by THA. Two patients had type A2, two had type B1, three had type B2 and three had type B3 fractures, as assessed by the AO classification. X-ray showed osteoporosis due to decreased bone mass in all patients, and dislocations of the fragments in the weight-bearing area of the joint exceeded 1 cm. The average follow-up was 36 months.Indications for primary THA included, in addition to higher age, displacement in the fracture line exceeding 1 cm, a fracture line extending to the weight-bearing part of the acetabulum, presence of hip arthritis, cartilage injury, defects of the weight-bearing area of either the femoral head or acetabulum, and Pipkin type IV injury. The interval between accident and surgery ranged from 6 to 12 days (average, 9.5). Three surgical techniques were used, namely, cemented THA with a polyethylene cup cemented into an acetabulum-stabilizing cage; reconstruction with a cementless RSC acetabular component; internal fixation using screws and a cemented cup. Bone grafting of the acetabulum was used in all patients. Evaluated were basic operative parameters, complications, X-ray findings, ability to walk and Merle d'Aubigne scores.The average operative time was 100 min, the average blood loss was 1000 ml. Hip motion showed the following average values: flexion, 110 degrees ; extension, 10 degrees ; rotation, 30 degrees -0 degrees -30 degrees ; adduction, 25 degrees ; abduction, 35 degrees . All patients returned to their preoperative range of motion. X-ray examination showed good reduction, bone graft was completely incorporated in the acetabulum, and no displacement or signs of loosening or graft migration were recorded. Two patients had Brooker type I heterotropic ossification. The final evaluation of function at 36 months on the basis of the Merle d'Aubigne classification showed excellent and good results in four (57 %) and three (43 %) patients, respectively. The remaining three patients had a shorter follow-up, but were fully mobile with no complications observed.It has been reported that bony union of acetabular fracture after open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) was achieved in 74 % patients younger than 60 years, but in only 44 % of the patients older than 60 years. Secondary THA following ORIF is a demanding technique. Due to adhesions and a frequent malposition of the acetabulum, THA is associated with and increased risk of infection, tendency to develop para-articular ossifications, and a higher risk of early component loosening than in the standard procedure. One of the options is to perform acetabular stabilization and primary THA at one stage. The results of our study are fully in agreement with those reported for THA in hip arthritis or dislocated fracture of the femoral neck.Acute primary THA with the use of a antiprotrusion cage and bone grafting for acetabular fractures in elderly patients allows us to employ only one surgical technique for definitive repair. It provides primary stability and immediate pain relief, permits graded weight-bearing and early pain-free mobilization, and may also treat hip arthritis, if it exists. This technique has also good prospects for a selected group of younger patients in whom the treatment of acetabular fractures has a poor prognosis. Key words: acetabular fracture, elderly patient, primary total hip arthroplasty.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYTo evaluate surgical management of the fracture of the ring of axis (FRA), known as \"hangman's fracture\", and to discuss adequacy of this treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODSBetween 1994 and 2004, 41 patients with FRA were surgically treated in our hospital.We present a retrospective study of 30 cases treated by anterior cervical fixation and fusion and 11 cases treated by a posterior, CT-guided approach (published recently).Our diagnostic algorithm for evaluation of FRA included plain radiographs for basic diagnosis, detailed CT scan, MRI and finally passive lateral flexion-extension fluoroscopy (performed by physician) to assess stability.We also consider discography in selected cases, allowing further evaluation of discoligamentous injury.Fractures were classified according to Levine.Posterior compressive osteosynthesis according to Judet was performed in 11 patients with Levine type I fractures with fracture fragment distraction >3 mm.Anterior graft and plate fixation was chosen in 30 patients with type II (25 patients) and type I (5 patients) fractures where C2/3 disc injury was confirmed by MRI or discography.There was no case of facet dislocation in our series (type III).Pain, motion restriction and overall satisfaction with neck status were assessed on a scale 1-5 (1 = best) in patients treated with anterior approach.Self-evaluation questionnaires were administered during follow-up (average, 7.3 years; 24 months to 11 years). RESULTSAnatomically reduced fracture fusion was achieved in all cases (100%) at one year follow-up.Both autologous tricortical ( 22) and fibular allografts (8) were used for anterior approach.No perioperative complications occurred and no case was aborted.Average hospital stay in patients with standalone FRA was 6.8 days (3-15).Patients wore Philadelphia collar for 4-6 weeks.One patient died during follow up due to unrelated causes.None of the 29 patients treated with the anterior approach reported severe or very severe pain (grades 4 or 5).The average pain score was 1.28.Three patients with isolated FRAs reported slight subjective restriction of movement (grade 2).The \"satisfaction with overall neck status\" scale showed an average score of 1.62, never worse than grade 2. DISCUSSIONDespite increasing popularity of anterior surgical approach in the treatment of type II FRA, most authors still recommend conservative treatment.Surgical treatment is consensually recommended in type III fractures only.Type I is treated exclusively conservatively.There is currently no evidence-based data supporting any method of treatment of so called \"hangman's fracture\".The majority of treating surgeons do not consider the status of the intervertebral disc.Dynamic films, simulating the peak point of injury, are usually not performed.Hence, potentially unstable fractures are overlooked.This also explains the lack of long term follow-up data regarding the radiological status of C2/3 intervertebral disc as well as patients' subjective complaints. CONCLUSIONSSurgery provides plausible results.Compared to conservative treatment, it can offer significant benefits: 1) immediate, better and stable reposition; 2) high fusion rate; 3) shortening of the treatment period with better quality of life.Contrary to conservative treatment modalities, surgery possesses a potential for further development.",

    "abstract": "Deep sepsis still remains the second most common cause of prosthetic joint failure despite its overall incidence is decreasing. It can be defined as a bacterial growth and replication on the prosthetic joint surface resulting in periprosthetic tissue damage and prosthesis loosening. The implants are colonized by airborne-, skin-, tool-, and/ or surgeon-related bacteria during surgery even though majority of procedures are performed under strictly respected conditions nowadays. After the insertion of the prosthesis into the human body the race between bacteria and host cells begins on what will colonize the prosthetic surface first. If the bacteria are more successful then they develop on formation of biofilm which is the biological correlative for the prosthetic joint infection (PJI) resisting effectively against host immune response and antibiotics. That is why preventative measures are strongly worth to do it, and removal of the prosthesis is the single optimal treatment. Each step in the pathogenesis of prosthetic joint infection may represent relevant targets against which prevention strategies may be directed. Of them the most useful seems to be identification of individual factors predisposing for PJI development, antibiotic prophylaxis given before the surgery, and operating room/ surgical quality parameters.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYSegmental tibial fractures are commonly believed to be more difficult to manage, requiring surgical treatment.Our experience with forty-eight segmental tibial fractures suggests that these fractures, if closed and with shortening of an acceptable initial degree and a corrected deformity, may be successfully treated with functional braces. MATERIAL AND METHODSForty-eight closed segmental fractures of the tibia that had initial shortening ≥12 mm and angular deformity manually corrected to ≥7 degrees were stabilized in an above-the-knee cast for a median time of 33 days and a mode of 15 days.They were subsequently stabilized in a functional brace that allowed unencumbered motion of all joints.All other segmental fractures outside the established parameters were managed by other methods. RESULTSAll fractures healed at a median time of 15.3 weeks.The final shortening was 4.7 millimeters with a mode of 12 millimeters.The maximum shortening was 14 millimeters.Fractures healed with a medial-lateral (M.L) angular deformities ranging zero to 19 degrees, a median of 5.9 degrees and a mode of 3.4 degrees. CONCLUSIONThe relatively early introduction of weight bearing and the freedom of motion of all joints that the brace permits seem to result in motion at the fracture site, which in turn enhances osteogenesis.As we have previously documented, the initial shortening that closed tibial fractures experience does not increase with the physiological use of the extremity.The final shortening and angulation observed in most of the fractures should not be considered complications, simply inconsequential deviations from the normal.The same should apply to closed segmental fractures.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYTo design a prophylactic strategy for late hematogenous infection is not an easy task.It requires the assessment of risk factors for the patient as well as of a potential source of bacteremia.Cost effectiveness, efficacy of the antibiotic selected and complications associated with antibiotic treatment, such as allergic reactions and development of resistance to the antibiotic given, should also be considered.The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the occurrence of late hematogenous infection in our large group of patients, to analyze risk factors and to suggest an optimal system of antibiotic prophylaxis in order to prevent the development of this unwelcome complication. MATERIAL AND METHODSSince our objective was to include a large number of patients, a retrospective study was chosen as the method used.The patients treated for infectious complications of total joint replacement at the 1 st Department of Orthopaedics, Teaching Hospital in Motol, 1 st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, in the years 1991 through 2004, were evaluated with the use of a targeted questionnaire and complete medical records.The group comprised 229 patients, 149 women and 80 men.Of these, 123 were treated for infection of total hip replacement, 102 for total knee replacement, two had infection of prosthetic shoulder joints and two had infection of elbow joint alloplasty. RESULTSMedical history of 37 patients (16.3 %) included infection of or a risk-associated procedure on the urogenital system (endoscopic or open surgery, prostate gland biopsy, extracorporeal lithotripsy).Six patients (2.6 %) underwent surgery with possible bacteremia (intestine resection for tumor, 2x; surgery for paronychium, 2x; cholecystectomy, 1x; and appendectomy, 1x).Dental surgery or mouth disease was recorded in 11 patients (4.8 %). DISCUSSIONThe authors suggest that the orthopedic surgeons performing joint replacement should assume their deal of responsibility and should provide relevant, comprehensive information to both the patient and the attending physician.These surgeons should be ready to remain involved in their patients' further therapies and, after assessing all risks, should be able to recommend an optimal prophylactic treatment.The introduction of a new preventive approach requires a simple and uncomplicated scheme.Any complicated and expensive system of preventive antibiotic administration will only meet with lack of understanding and with trivialization.The requirement that antibiotic treatment should be selected according to the site and type of risk-associated disease is logical, but, in our opinion, rather formal and unrealistic.The authors prefer a simple system permitting a rapid and overall introduction of preventive measures. CONCLUSIONSThe groups of patients indicated for prevention of late hematogenous infection of prosthetic joints are clearly defined and, by no means, do they involve all patients with total joint replacement.",

    "abstract": "The elbow is a complex joint and is vital in positioning the hand in space.We believe that open reduction internal fixation offers the best chance for return to function following intra-articular fractures of the distal humerus.We advocate the following principles for the effective treatment of these injuries: identification and protection of the ulnar nerve followed by transposition, broad exposure of the fracture utilizing an olecranon osteotomy, anatomic restoration of the articular surface with preservation of all osteochondral fragments, rigid fixation of both columns using pre-contoured plates and screws, and the institution of early range of motion post-operatively. ANATOMYUnderstanding the anatomy of the distal humerus is critical to effective treatment of distal humerus fractures.Divergent medial and lateral columns of bone support the distal humeral articular surface in an inverted-Y configuration.The medial column diverges from the central humeral axis at an angle of 45 degrees, and the lateral column at an angle of 20 degrees (22,32).The trochlea lies in the center and links the two columns and articulates with the olecranon.Stability of the elbow is a product of bony articulations, soft tissue tension, and the musculotendinous forces acting across it.The central sulcus of the trochlea inter-digitates with the corresponding articular ridge on the olecranon providing significant bony stability to the elbow through this highly congruent articulation.The trochlea is covered by articular cartilage over an arc of almost 300 degrees and subsequently permits a broad range of motion at the ulno-humeral joint.Compromise of the trochlea in the form of shortening, bone loss, or residual incongruity can translate into significant loss of elbow motion and stability.The capitellum resides on the lateral column and provides 180 degrees of articulating area.In contrast to the trochlea, the posterior aspect of the lateral column is non-articular and allows for posterior placement of implants without risk of injury to cartilage or risk of impingement with flexion and extension.The distal articular surface lies in 4 to 8 degrees of valgus and is externally rotated 3 to 4 degrees relative to the central axis of the humerus.The capitellum and trochlea are translated anteriorly relative to the humeral diaphysis, creating an angle between the central humeral axis and the distal articular segment of 30 to",

    "abstract": "Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a feared complication of total joint arthroplasty. Several strategies have been developed to treat it. The purpose of our study was to compare therapeutic strategies for PJI treatment published in the literature.We retrieved around 5,000 documents concerning this topic, published between January 1960 and November 2006, from the databases MEDLINE and EMBASE. Using a two-phase selection, 382 relevant articles were chosen, and full texts were obtained for 302 of them (79%). However, only 77 of them fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in our study. A total of 645 hips and 1,145 knees could be analyzed. A comparison was made of the following procedures: two-stage surgery, one- stage surgery, implant removal and long-term antibiotic therapy in hip PJI; two-stage surgery, debridement, arthrodesis and long-term antibiotic therapy in knee PJI. The criteria used to evaluate successful PJI treatment included the rate of recur- rent infection (primary outcome) and the rate of additional surgery (secondary outcome). The capability index (c), relative risk (RR), odds ratio and \"number needed to treat\" (NNT) were calculated for both outcomes under study.1. The lowest rate of recurrent PJI was reported for two-stage reimplantation (hips, 7.4%; knees, 11%), then came one-stage reimplantation for hip PJI (9.2%) and arthrodesis for knee PJI (15.6%). 2. The lowest relative risk for the primary outcome of this study was found in two-stage reimplantation (RR=0.62 and 0.32 for hip and knee PJI, respectively, knee arthrodesis (RR=0.78) and one-stage hip reimplantation (RR=1.07). 3. The NNT was negative for two-stage reimplantation (NNT = -21.6 and -4.3 for hip and knee PJI, respectively). 4. Compared to long-term antibiotic therapy, knee debridement had a higher risk of recurrent infection (RR, 4.72 versus 1.20) as well as the risk of additional surgery (RR, 4.41 versus 1.31). However, when the capability index and NNT were used, knee debridement achieved better primary outcomes than antibiotic therapy (c=0.0317 versus 0.0000) and NNT (2.2 versus 26.3). 5. Relative risk for additional surgery was the lowest in two-stage reimplantation (RR=0.47 and 0.36 for hip and knee PJI, respectively), and the highest in long-term antibiotic therapy for hip PJI (RR=6.47).The resultant ranking of therapeutic approaches to PJI, as found in our study, is not surprising; except for seemingly bet- ter outcomes achieved by long-term antibiotic therapy compared to surgical debridement in knee PJI. This, among others, shows the need to use more comprehensible statistical instruments, such as the capability index, that could provide a more reliable evaluation of therapeutic interventions.A two-stage protocol for PJI treatment had the lowest risk for both PJI recurrence and need for additional surgery in comparison with all other strategies developed for PJI therapy. Therefore, it should be accepted as the method of choice. One-stage hip reimplantation is a less reliable approach in which it is inevitable to strictly respect the indication criteria. Other methods are either less reliable or associated with a high risk of repeat surgeries, or provide functionally unacceptable outcomes.",

RESULTSThe mean HHS improved from 44.79 preoperatively to 93.58 postoperatively.1.85% (5 MAYO stems) had to be replaced because of aseptic loosening.Furthermore the DEXA scans revealed the metaphyseal load transfer with increased bone density in the calcar region. CONCLUSIONAs especially younger patients will require one or more hip revision procedures during the course of their life due to their life due to their age and activity level.These patients should receive a primary implant with proximal load transfer.Only these implants can avoid stress shielding of the proximal femur.The minimally invasive implantation of these implants can also ensure an enhanced periprosthetic bone density an optimized postoperative rehabilitation phase. MATERIAL AND METHODSThe authors have gained substantial experience in more than 1,000 implantations of the MAYO ® Conservative Hip System (Zimmer Inc., Warsaw, USA).This shaft system was developed in 1985 at the Mayo-Clinic (Rochester, USA) for the treatment of younger patients.Morrey et al. [6] demonstrated that the intra and postoperative blood loss is reduced significantly with these implants and that the shaft shows excellent long-term results (fig.1).The MAYO ® Conservative Hip System is a cementless short stem hip prosthesis with a wedge design in A/P and M/L plane (fig.2) ensuring immediate primary fixation of the prosthesis in the bone.It is available in 8 sizes (fig.3) and made of Tivaniumr, a Titanium-Aluminum-Vanadium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V).In addition, it provides a partial fibre-mesh-structure (fig.4) and is partially coated with hydroxylapatite.We favour this implant for younger patients (< 70 years) with good bone quality and normal anatomical",

    "abstract": "Hallux rigidus is a frequent disease of the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. It is a painful condition markedly reducing joint motion. For grade-3 and grade-4 disease, as classified by Coughlin, first MTP joint replacement is another option of surgical treatment, in addition to resection arthroplasty or arthrodesis.In a group of 27 patients with symptomatic hallux rigidus, 28 MTP joint replacements using a TOEFIT-PLUS implant were carried out in the 2005-2009 period. There were 24 women and three men, with an average age of 56.3 years. The average follow-up was 24 months (range, 4 to 48). Indication for surgery included hallux rigidus in 20, conditions following Keller's arthroplasty in five, necrosis of the first metatarsus head in two cases and a condition after the Austin procedure in one patient. Pain, assessed by the Kitaoka score, and the range of joint motion; were evaluated before the surgery and at the final follow-up visit this also included the radiographic assessment of implant position and its integration.Of the 28 implants used, nine were hemiprosthetic and 19 total joint replacements. The average time between surgery and full weight-bearing was 6.6 weeks (range, 5 to 8) in both groups. The post-operative Kitaoka score was 87.1 (68-100) as compared with the preoperative value of 36.3 (24-52), and this difference was statistically significant.The range of motion at the first MTP improved from 14.7 degrees pre-operatively to 38.5 degrees post-operatively. There was no statistically significant difference in joint function, as assessed by the Kitaoka score and range of motion, between the two groups (hemiprosthetic vs. total joint replacements). The complications included prolonged skin healing with minor dehiscence in four cases. Revision surgery was required in three cases because of restricted joint motion associated with pain. In three cases of the total joint replacement group, there was radiographic evidence of asymptomatic osteolysis around both the phalangeal and the metatarsal component. In the hemiarthroplasty group, no osteolysis was recorded.Up to now several types of implants have been developed to alleviate pain and restore and maintain the first MTP motion in patients with hallux rigidus.The TOEFIT-PLUS implant belongs to the most recent ones. Our results are in agreement with those of other currently used replacements in terms of clinical and functional evaluation. The complications recorded in our study are also similar to those reported in the literature, which include aseptic loosening, dislocation and mechanical failure of the implant. There is no consistent approach to their treatment. Arthrodesis with tricortical graft seems to be an option, but it carries a considerable risk of failure. Since in our patients aseptic loosening was recorded only in the total joint replacement group, hemiarthroplasty has recently been preferred, because it has clinical and functional outcomes as good as total joint replacement.Our results with the use of TOEFIT-PLUS replacement show that this implant is effective in the treatment of hallux rigidus advanced stages and has good clinical outcomes, i.e., maintenance of motion at the MTP joint of the big toe, pain alleviation and early weight bearing. Since hemiarthroplasty is associated with fewer complications whose potential treatment is easier, this approach seems to have a better prospect than total joint replacement.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYTo evaluate the results of arthroscopic capsular release for the treatment of severe frozen shoulder syndrome.Between 2006 and 2008, 27 patients with severe frozen shoulder syndrome were treated by arthroscopic capsular release.The average age of the patients was 54 years (range, 34 to 75), 15 were men and 12 were women.The right shoulder was operated on more frequently (16 patients).The average pre-operative flexion was 73 degrees (range, 10° to 150°) and pre-operative abduction was 56 degrees (10° to 140°).The average Constant score was 35 points. MATERIAL METHODSWith the patient in a lateral recumbent position, arthroscopic release of the joint capsule is performed with the Mitek VAPR 3 radiofrequency system, using a hook or an LPS electrode.The rotator interval, coracohumeral ligament, superior and middle glenohumeral ligaments and anterior part of the inferior glenohumeral ligament are gradually released, as well as the anterior glenohumeral joint capsule along its full width at the anterior rim of the labrum.To avoid damage to the axillary nerve, the axillary part of the joint capsule is released along the edge of the glenoid cavity.When internal rotation in abduction still remains restricted, release is extended to the posterior glenohumeral joint capsule.The procedure also involves exploration of the subacromial space and, if necessary, subacromial bursectomy or acromioplasty.Subsequently, the range of motion after release is tested and, when necessary, the remaining fibres of the joint capsule are disintegrated by careful manipulation (redress).The surgery is followed by analgesic and rehabilitation therapy. RESULTSAll treated patients reported an improved range of motion.The average post-operative flexion and abduction extended to 160 degrees and 155 degrees, respectively, and 23 patients gained the motion range necessary for normal shoulder function.The average Constant score was 80.3 points and the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) score was 28.6 points.When using the school marking system, the average result evaluation was 1.75.All patients were satisfied with the outcome and were willing to undergo surgery on the other side if need be.No complications were recorded. DISCUSSIONTherapy for frozen shoulder can be conservative or surgical.Most of the cases can be managed by correct conservative treatment.In accordance with the current literature data, we are using arthroscopic capsular release in resistant cases.This technique allows us to release contracted structures without the risk of iatrogenic injury and offers possibilities for the treatment of co-existing lesions.In the majority of patients this procedure can remedy their complaints, although the affected shoulder joint rarely remains asymptomatic.The aim of this approach is to accelerate the treatment of this disability; the long-term results are similar to those of conservative therapy. CONCLUSIONSArthroscopic capsular release is the method of choice for the treatment of frozen shoulder syndrome in patients who have failed to respond to conservative therapy.It provides marked improvement in the range of motion and is associated with a minimum of post-operative complications.However, some patients may complain of persisting discomfort in the joint treated.",

    "abstract": "The effective initial treatment in the emergency room of polytraumatized children requires a sound knowledge of com- mon injury patterns, incidence, mortality, and consequences. The needed initial radiological imaging remains controversial and should be adapted to the expected injury pattern.In this retrospective study, the injury patterns of 56 polytraumatized paediatric patients (age ≤ 16 years) in the period from December 2001 to May 2009 were evaluated. All children were initially diagnosed with a whole body CT scan. The cause of accident, the localization including the detailed diagnose, the lethality and the severity of the injuries were analyzed. The AIS (Abbreviated Injury Scale) and ISS (Injury Severity Score) were used to classify the severity of injuries in different body regions. Moreover the number and the kind of operation as a consequence of the initial made diagnoses were investigated.The mean ISS was 30 ± 13 in 38 boys and 18 girls with a mean age of 10 years. The lethality was 13% and 4% in the first 24 hours. The most severe and most frequent injury was craniocerebral trauma in 89% with an AIS ≥ 3 in 80%. Surgical intervention of the head was done in 41%. Thorax injuries were found in 63% with 57% with an AIS ≥ 3 and in 11% a thoracic drainage was needed. Abdominal trauma was found in 34% (surgery 4%) with an AIS ≥ 3 in 32%. Fractures of the spine occurred in 14% (surgery 5%) with an AIS ≥ 3 in 4% and pelvic injuries were diagnosed in 16% (surgery 4%) with an AIS ≥ 3 in 14%. Injuries of the upper extremity were found in 23% (surgery 11%) with an AIS ? 3 in 5% and of the lower extremity in 32% (surge- ry 16%) with an AIS ≥ 3 in 13%.The authors recommend a whole body CT scan in children who are potentially polytraumatized because of the detected high percentage of head and thorax injuries in polytraumatized children and the needed head surgery. The quickest imaging with a high sensitivity is the whole body CT scan which provides the clinicians with relevant information to initiate life-saving therapy.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis of the thumb's basal joint is a frequent and, in some cases, very painful condition that usually affects middle-aged and elderly women. Several surgical procedures have been proposed for severe carpometacarpal (CMC) joint arthritis; of these, joint replacement has proved to be an effective approach to its treatment. The aim of this study is to present the outcomes of the total non-cemented trapeziometacarpal implant Maďa in the treatment of more advanced stages of this disease.Thirty-six total trapeziometacarpal joint replacements in 34 patients treated in 2008 for advanced CMC arthritis (Eaton and Littler stages III and IV) were evaluated. Indications for surgery after failure of conservative treatment included: pain, reduced grip and pinch strength and restricted range of thumb motion, all of them interfering with daily activities. The average follow-up time was 42 months, with a minimum of 37 months.At the final follow-up, thumb opposition to the base of the little finger was present in all patients. The average grip strength of the hand increased from 15.8 kg pre-operatively to 26.8 kg post-operatively. The average key pinch strength increased from 2.7 kg to 5.7 kg and the average tip pinch strength from 2.3 kg to 4.9 kg. All patients reported substantial pain relief. The average VAS values were 8.4 points before surgery and 0.4 points at 3 years after surgery. Pre- and post-operative DASH scores were 71.7 and 22.5, respectively. One patient had aseptic cup loosening that required revision surgery. No signs of implant loosening in any other patient were shown by radiographic studies at the final follow-up. One patient sustained a traumatic implant dislocation that was treated by open reduction.Total replacement of the CMC joint is a method with functional outcomes comparable with or better than other surgical procedures. Rapid post-surgery recovery is its clear advantage. The implant provides good stability and no prolonged immobilisation is needed.In our group, total arthroplasty of the thumb CMC joint provided pain relief, improved thumb motion and pinch strength. At present, CMC joint arthroplasty is recommended to elderly patients with symptoms of advanced arthritis (stage III or early stage IV) refractory to conservative treatment or to well-informed younger persons accepting reduced demands on the treated hand's activities.",

Up to date several genetic alterations and markers were described concerning the pathogenesis and the progression of the chondrosarcoma, which represents actually a heterogeneous group of different types including conventional intramedullary, clear cell, myxoid, mesenchymal, and dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma. The pathologic appearance varies, however, in general they grow with a lobulated pattern. Histologically the hyaline cartilage demonstrates high water content and typically enchondral ossification is apparent. Imaging reflect this while radiographic findings suggest the diagnosis when the typical \"ring-and-arc\" chondroid matrix mineralization, endosteal scalloping and soft-tissue extension were apparent. The CT is used for detecting the mineralization of the matrix, especially when it is subtle or when the lesion is located in complex areas. MRT is the method of choice to detect the high water content of these lesions with a high signal intensity with T2-weighting and its bone marrow extend. Surgical resection is the primary and preferred treatment modality for most individuals with localized disease. In selected cases of the Grad I conventional chondrosarcoma curettage should be discussed. Systemic chemotherapy may be considered in variant forms such as mesenchymal or dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas. In knowledge of the \"many faces\" of the primary chondrosarcoma individualized patient assessment and optimal clinical management is possible.",

This is certainly still the contemporary view but there is an obvious trend towards surgical stabilization. Surgical treatment of humeral shaft fractures has nonetheless been greatly facilitated by the development of new implants. In particular, a new generation of nails that general permit immediate mobilization have become available for improved management of longitudinal and multi-segmental fractures. Retrograde and antegrade nails have advantages and disadvantages and selection procedure is often based on the distal or proximal location of the fracture. Plates also offer an alternative for certain indications and have advantages at the proximal and distal shaft in particular. If there is primary lesion of the radial nerve, exploration is not very advisable, but in the absence of remission exploration can be conducted after several months with the same degree of success. Since the published literature offers no comparative studies with a high level of evidence, our statement can only be regarded as an up-to-date recommendation in the hope that future prospective randomized studies will address this issue.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the clinical and radiographic results in a group of patients with calcaneal fractures treated by means of minimally invasive, arthroscopically-assited osteosynthesis.A total of 175 calcaneal fractures in 154 patients were treated surgically at the Trauma Centre of Masaryk Hospital between January 2006 and August 2010. Twenty-six patients were enrolled in this prospective study. They had a total of 30 calcaneal fractures, of which 28 were managed by minimally invasive, arthroscopically-assisted osteosynthesis. The patient's records included demographic data, relevant medical history, fracture type by Sander's classification, associated injuries, time to surgery, length of surgery, post-operative quality of reduction, Böhler's angle before and after surgery, healing complications, hospitalisation time, follow-up period, bone union, functional outcome in Rowe score and hardware removal. The patients underwent minimally invasive osteosynthesis under arthroscopic and radiographic guidance. For this procedure, patients with Sanders type IIa and IIb fractures were predominantly indicated. The group also included patients older than 60 years, smokers, patients addicted to alcohol, a diabetic patient, a dialysed patient and a patient with chronic lower-limb lymphoedema.The patient group included 21 men with 25 fractures (83.5%) and five women with five fractures (16.5%). Nine men (42.9%) were heavy smokers; three men (14.3%) and one woman (20 %) were addicted to alcohol. All fractures were closed and, according to the Sanders system, were classified as follows: 16 fractures as type IIa (57.1%); eight fractures as IIb (28.6%); two fractures as IIIab (7.1%) and one IIIac and IIIbc (3.6% respectively). Six patients (23.1%) sustained bilateral fractures of the lower-limb. In the post-operative period, no disturbance of soft tissue healing and no superficial or deep wound infection were observed. The outcome of fracture reduction assessed by CT examination was excellent in 24 fractures (85.6%), satisfactory in one (3.6%) and poor in one fracture (3.6%). The mean Böhler's angle was +7.2 degrees pre-operatively and +35.4 degrees post-operatively. In all patients bone union was achieved within 3 months; hardware was removed in 19 fractures (67.9%). Functional outcomes according to the Rowe score were very good in 18 (69.2%), good in four (15.4%) and satisfactory in four (15.4%) patients. There were no poor results. The mean Rowe score for the whole patient group was 86 points.The demographic data are in agreement with the recent literature data. However, most studies have not included smokers and people addicted to alcohol, therefore, no comparison can be made. The comparison with studies on ORIF-treated fractures is also difficult, because our study included a higher number of less severe fracture types. The surgical technique is demanding and was, at the beginning, associated with intra-operative errors. The post-operative values of Böhler's angle are comparable to the results of ORIF techniques, but this does not mean that this technique could substitute the use of ORIF in complex fractures. The absence of any soft- or bone-tissue healing problems is a very good result, considering the number of risk factors in our patient group. The good functional outcomes according to the Rowe score can be attributed to a higher proportion of less complex fractures in the group.In our group of patients with predominantly less severe types of calcaneal fractures, the quality of post-operative fracture reduction, as a result of minimally invasive, arthroscopically-assisted osteosynthesis, appeared to be comparable with open techniques. The observed complete bone healing and absence of soft-tissue problems could present a surgical option to treatment nihilism in patients contraindicated for ORIF techniques.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYDecompression surgery with or without fusion is the gold standard treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis, but adjacent segment degeneration has been reported as a long-term complication after fusion.This led to the development of dynamic implants like the interspinous devices.They are supposed to limit extension and expand the spinal canal at the symptomatic level, but with reduced effect on the range of motion of the adjacent segments.The aim of the present study is the evaluation of the biomechanical effects on the range of motion (ROM) of adjacent lumbar segments after decompression and instrumentation with an interspinous device compared to a rigid posterior stabilization device. MATERIALS AND METHODSEight fresh frozen human cadaver lumbar spines (L2-L5) were tested in a spinal testing device with a moment of 7.5 Nm in flexion/extension, lateral bending and rotation with and without a preload.The preload was applied as a follower load of 400N along the curvature of the spine.The range of motion (ROM) of the adjacent segments L2/L3 and L4/L5 was measured with the intact segment L3/L4, after decompression, consisting of resection of the interspinous ligament, flavectomy and bilateral medial facetecomy, and insertion of the Coflex ® (Paradigm Spine, Wurmlingen) and after instrumentation with Click X ® (Synthes, Umkirch) as well. RESULTSThe interspinous and the rigid device caused a significant increase of ROM at both adjacent segments during all directions of motion and under follower load, without significant difference between these devices.The ROM of L2/L3 tends to increase more than the ROM of L4/L5 after instrumentation without statistical significance. DISCUSSIONThe \"dynamic\" Coflex device caused a significant increase of ROM at both adjacent lumbar segments comparable to the increase of ROM after instrumentation with the rigid Click X device.Other in vitro studies observed comparable biomechanical effects on the adjacent segments after fusion, but biomechanical spacer studies concentrated on the \"noncompressible\" X-Stop ® and could not demonstrate a significant adjacent segment effect of this device. CONCLUSIONSThe hypothesis, that an interspinous device would reduce the stress on adjacent segments compared to a rigid posterior stabilization device, could not be demonstrated with this biomechanical in vitro study.Therefore, the protection of adjacent segments after instrumentation with dynamic devices is still not completely achieved.",

    "abstract": "Defining reproducible criteria for lower extremity salvage following severe high-energy trauma continues to be one of the most challenging and controversially discussed fields in orthopaedic surgery.At present, however, the difficult performance, limited availability and number of valid reconstructive options for complex injury types, i. e. simultaneous osteoligamentous trauma with neurovascular lesions and severe soft tissue defects (\"composite/compound multilayer defects\") represent the decisive prognostic injury components triggering and determining the fate of the limb.Consequently, due to the complex injury pattern of the extremity and the overall situation of multiple injured patient the treatment and decision making has to be made in a priority-adapted algorithm.In this treatment algorithm interdisciplinary cooperation with vascular and plastic surgeons is of tremendous importance.Although the number of severely injured patients remains stable in the last decade, changes in the treatment algorithms result from increased survival rates of multiple injured patients and improved modern reconstructive options leading to continuously increasing rates of salvaged limbs.This paper aimed to systematically review the current literature for lower extremity injuries in order to unravel the different surgical treatment options and provide guidelines for decision making with corresponding treatment algorithms for limb salvage.furthermore, the experiences in the management of mangled extremities in our centre are presented and illustrated/underscored with different cases.",

    "abstract": "The wear of articular surfaces is considered one of the most important factors limiting the life of total hip arthroplasty (THA). It is assumed that the particles released from the surface of a softer material induce a complex inflammatory response, which will eventually result in osteolysis and aseptic loosening. Implant wear is related to a friction coefficient which depends on combination of the materials used, roughness of the articulating surfaces, internal clearance, and dimensions of the prosthesis.The selected parameters of the bearing couples tested were studied using an experimental device based on the principle of a pendulum. Bovine serum was used as a lubricant and the load corresponded to a human body mass of 75 kg. The friction coefficient was derived from a curve of slowdown of pendulum oscillations. Roughness was measured with a device working on the principle of interferometry. Clearance was assessed by measuring diameters of the acetabular and femoral heads with a 3D optical scanner. The specimens tested included unused metal-on-highly cross-linked polyethylene, ceramic-on-highly cross-linked polyethylene and ceramic-on-ceramic bearing couples with the diameters of 28 mm and 36 mm. For each measured parameter, an arithmetic mean was calculated from 10 measurements.1) The roughness of polyethylene surfaces was higher by about one order of magnitude than the roughness of metal and ceramic components. The Protasul metal head had the least rough surface (0.003 μm). 2) The ceramic-on-ceramic couples had the lowest clearance. Bearing couples with polyethylene acetabular liners had markedly higher clearances ranging from 150 μm to 545 μm. A clearance increased with large femoral heads (up to 4-fold in one of the couple tested). 3) The friction coefficient was related to the combination of materials; it was lowest in ceramic-on-ceramic surfaces (0.11 to 0.12) and then in ceramic-on-polyethylene implants (0.13 to 0.14). The friction coefficient is supposed to increase with a decreasing femoral head diameter. However, in the bearing couples with polyethylene liners manufactured by one company, paradoxically, the friction coefficient slightly increased with an increase in femoral head size from 28 mm to 36 mm. 4) The lowest friction moment (< 3.5 Nm) was found for ceramic-on-ceramic implants 28 mm in diameter; the highest values were recorded in metal-on-polyethylene bearing couples 36 mm in diameter (> 7 Nm).Although our study confirmed that the bearing couples produced by different manufacturers varied to some extent in the parameters studied, in our opinion, this variability was not significant because it was not within an order of magnitude in any of the tests.The study showed that both the friction coefficient and the friction moment are affected more by the combination of materials than by the diameter of a femoral head. The best results were achieved in ceramic-on-ceramic implants.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYEvaluation of the results in patients treated for post-traumatic defects by the method of callus distraction of the femur and tibia using a monolateral external fixator. MATERIAL AND METHODSThe group comprised 42 patients, 38 men and 4 woman, who underwent callus distraction using a monolateral external fixator in the Trauma Hospital Brno in the period from 2003 to 2010.The average age of the patients on the day gradual callus distraction was commenced was 32 (18-64) years.Post-traumatic bone defects were treated in 31 patients and deformities resulting from resection of post-traumatic infection loci in 11 patients.The tibia was involved in 34 and the femur in eight patients.The average follow-up in the out-patient department was 24.3 months (range, 7 to 118 months) after the fixator had been removed.The monolateral external fixator LRS Orthofix (Italy) was used in all patients. RESULTSThe average length of defects treated by callus distraction was 5.5 cm (3-16 cm).The average interval between osteotomy and distraction commencement was 6.1 days (4-8 days).The average duration of distraction was 74 days (33-162 days); the average time of fixator application was 168 days (138-416 days).The average healing index was 42 days per cm of bone (26-88 days per cm).The treatment of soft tissue loss during callus distraction was necessary in six patients (14.3%).Of these, two (4.8%) had local fasciocutaneous flap skin coverage, and four (9.5%) free issue transfer.A total of 38 complications were treated, i.e., 0.9 complication per each callus distraction of the femur or tibia.Of them, pin-tract infection was most frequent and was recorded in 21 patients (50%).It was usually managed by regimen arrangement and oral antibiotic therapy.The screw had to be removed due to septic loosening in five patients (11.9%).Breakage of a fixator pin occurred in three patients (7.1%).No fracture after fixator removal was recorded.Callus angulations were managed by correction of fixator during distraction in two patients (4,8%).In one patient (2.4%), premature healing of fibular osteotomy was treated by a new resection osteotomy.One patient (2.4%), following callus distraction, underwent Achilles tenotomy.The docking site after segmental bone transport did not heal in two patients (4.8%) who subsequently underwent revision surgery involving spongioplasty; bone union was achieved.Callus distraction in all patients was completed with the use of external fixators initially applied.All patients achieved full weight-bearing on the treated extremity. DISCUSSIONIn this study we evaluated the results of callus distraction carried out by means of a monolateral external fixator.This type of fixation seems very useful because the telescopic system allows for adjustment without necessity to change its assembly.Dynamic adjustment is important at the stage of callus maturation.A monolateral fixator is better tolerated by patients than is a circular fixator, though both systems give the same results.The process of callus distraction is associated with many different complications.Neither the height of femoral or tibial osteotomy, nor the method of its performance had any significant effect on callus formation.Spin-tract infection is the most common complication.Its frequency can be reduced by using 6-mm pins coated with hydroxyapatite.Delayed healing is rare in simple callus distraction but occurs in the cases of segmental bone transport or repeated osteotomy. CONCLUSIONSThe method of callus distraction is effective in the management of large bone defects.The treatment procedure depends on the extent of bone loss, size and type of soft tissue damage and presence or absence of infection.We prefer the use of monolateral external fixators for their ability of form adjustment and of 6-mm pins coated with hydroxyapatite.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSe Of The STUDyManaging bone tumours is complex, relying on limited evidence, expert opinions, and retrospective reviews.Multidisciplinary approaches and early diagnosis are crucial for better outcomes, especially in young patients with growing skeletons.The aim of this systemic review and meta-analysis is to give a comprehensive review of common malignant tumors affecting long bones in children and adolescents. MATeRIAl AND MeThODSA PubMed/Medline search for \"primary malignant long bone tumours in children\" initially retrieved 1120 papers, which were subsequently narrowed down to 110 articles based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.These articles were reviewed, focusing on clinical presentation, diagnostic workup, treatment options, surgical planning, and variations in presentation, including rare tumours.The two most commonly reported tumours were osteosarcoma and ewing sarcoma, leading to the division of studies into five groups.The inclusion criteria encompassed malignancies in patients aged 2-25 years, work-up, imaging, surgical treatment, rare tumour case reports, and surgical management principles, resulting in a heterogeneous group of articles.To enhance categorisation, it was clarified that studies with 10 or more cases were considered retrospective reviews. ReSUlTSReviewing of results thus demonstrate that the two likely tumours in children under consideration were osteosarcoma and ewing sarcoma.Their presentation findings and clinical features were discussed in detail in the review.It is worth noting here that in case of differential diagnosis this should be the first on the list. DISCUSSION AND CONClUSIONSAlthough focus of literature is more on the two most common tumours.however, rare tumours should be considered as they can mimic these common tumors.",

    "abstract": "Spinal injuries in children are rare and account for a low proportion of all childhood injuries. Due to anatomical and biomechanical properties of the growing spine, there are great differences between spinal injury in childhood and adulthood. Because of higher mobility and elasticity of the spine and a lower body mass in children, spinal injuries are not frequent and represent only 2 to 5 % of all spinal injuries. In this retrospective study, the effectiveness of conservative and surgical treatment of injured spines in children is evaluated in a 10-year period.All patients from birth to the completed 18th year of age treated in our departments between 1996 and 2005 were included in this study. The patients, evaluated in three age categories (0-9, 10-14, 15-18), were allocated to two groups according to the method of treatment used (conservative or surgical). The information on patients treated conservatively was drawn from medical records; the surgically treated patients were invited for a check-up.We used conservative treatment in patients with stable spinal injury who had no neurological deficit and in patients with neurological deficit but without apparent injury to the skeleton. Surgery was indicated in patients with unstable spinal injury and in those with neurological deficit and apparent injury to the skeletal structures. Injuries to the cervical spine were treated conservatively using a Philadelphia collar or a halo-vest in more serious cases. For treatment of injury to the thoracolumbar spine, the Magnuson method was preferred, together with rest in bed until subsidence of acute pain, followed by application of a vest and active rehabilitation to strengthen postural muscles. When surgery was used, the procedure was selected on a strictly individual basis in patients under 12; in older patients it was carried out according to the adult treatment protocol.During 1996 through 2005, we treated a total of 15 646 patients with injury to the skeleton, aged 0 to 18 years. The spine was affected in 571 cases, which is 3.6 %. We used conservative treatment in 528 (92.5 %) and surgery in 43 (7.5 %) children. The period between surgery and evaluation ranged from 6 to 120 months (average, 46.3 months) in the patients treated conservatively, and from 6 to 66 months (average, 27 months) in the surgically treated patients. The group of patients treated conservatively consisted of 292 boys (55. 3 %) and 236 girls (44.7 %); of these 219 (41.5 %) were in the 0-9 year category, 251 (47.5 %) were between 10 and 14 years and 58 (11 %) were 15 to 18 years old. The average age in this group was 10.2 years. The most frequent cause of injury was a fall (277; 52.2 %), then sports activity or games (86; 16.3 %), car accidents (34; 6.4 %) and diving accidents (30; 5.7 %). Pedestrians were injured on 25 occasions (4.7 %) and other causes of injury were recorded in 76 patients (14.4 %). In all age categories, injury to the thoracic spine was most frequent (340; 64.4 %). Three and more vertebrae were injured (multi-segment injury) in 124 patients (23.5 %). The thoracolumbar spine was affected in 22 patients (4.2 %), and lumbar vertebrae were injured in 28 patients (5.3 %). Injury to the cervical spine, both upper and lower, was least frequent, including four (0.8 %) and 10 (1.9 %) patients, respectively. None of the patients in this group showed neurological deficit. The surgically treated group included 29 (67.4 %) boys and 14 (32.6 %) girls; two (4.7 %) children were between 0 and 9 years, nine (20.9 %) between 10 and 14 years, and 32 (74.7 %) between 15 and 18 years, with an average of 15.1 years for the whole group. The frequent causes of injury were car accidents and falls in 21 (48.8 %) and 14 (32.6 %) children, respectively. Other causes were infrequent. The upper cervical spine was operated on in five (11.6 %), lower cervical spine in eight (18.6 %), thoracic spine in 13 (30.2 %), thoracolumbar spine in five (11.6 %) and lumbar vertebrae in 12 (27.9 %) patients. Thirty-six (83.7 %) patients had fractures, five had dislocated fractures (11.6 %) and two (4.7 %) had a dislocation. Of the 43 children in this group, neurological deficit was recorded in nine (20.9 %); this included a complete spinal cord lesion, an incomplete spinal cord lesion and a nerve root lesion in three, five and one patient, respectively.The results of this study confirm, in the majority of aspects, the conclusions of previously published papers. In some of the characteristics described above, however, our results are different, which can be explained by some specific features of care for injured children in the Czech Republic.Childhood spinal injuries account for only 2 to 5 % of all spinal injuries and for 3.6 % of all skeletal injuries in children. Particularly at the age of 11 to 12 years, they differ significantly from spinal injuries in adults and therefore require different therapeutic approaches. The cervical spine is affected most often in younger children, while the thoracolumbar spine in older children. Multi-segment injuries are typical in the childhood spine, particularly in smaller children. Typically, children show SCIWORA and a more rapid improvement of neurological deficit than adults. Conservative treatment is preferred; surgery before 12 years of age is strictly individual, while after 12 years therapy is similar to that used in adults.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSA total of 97 revision knee replacements due to aseptic loosening carried out in the years 1992 to 2003 were evaluated.The group included 46 men and 51 women at an average age of 66.8 years.The average preoperative Knee Society Score (KKS) was 31 points and the Functional Score (FS) was 22 points.There were 41 minor operations for AORI type I defects, 49 moderately serious procedures for AORI type II defects and seven major operations for AORI type III defects.In minor procedures standard components were implanted in 14 patients, standard components with cemented stems with extension were used in nine, and polyethylene plateau exchange was carried out in 18 patients.For moderately serious procedures, posterior stabilized components with extended cemented stems were used in 15 patients, revision implants with cementless stems in 26 patients and standard components with cemented stems in eight patients.In seven patients with major surgery, the hinged type of prosthesis was employed.Radiographic results were evaluated on the basis of Ewald's classification. RESULTSClinical findings showed improvement of the average KKS from 31 to 74 points at follow-up of 6.1 years.Functional outcomes improved, as shown by the average FS, from 22 to 67 points.Fifteen patients were not satisfied with the outcome of surgery, the causes being aseptic loosening in four, deep infection in eight and pain due to progression of radiolucent lines of the tibia in three patients. DISCUSSIONThe results of revision surgery with component replacement because of aseptic loosening are worse in comparison with those of primary total knee replacement.The average KSS score after revision surgery was 74 points at 6.1-year follow--up, whereas after primary surgery it was 92 points at 6.5 years.The average FS score after revision was 67 points, as compared with 86 points at 6.5 years after primary surgery.Complications involving infection occurred in 8.2 % of the revision cases, but only in 0.8 % of the primary operations.The authors used modular systems because these provide more options.Good outcomes were achieved with morselized bone grafting for filling cavitary defects.In patients with large defects in tibial or femoral metaphyses, posterior stabilized components and cementless intramedullary stems were used with good results. CONCLUSIONSThe authors recommend to avoid filling large bone defects with bone cement.They prefer bone grafting.In the case of good quality metaphyseal bone, they use standard components or posterior stabilized components with or without additional cemented or cementless short stem extensions.In the case of poor quality metaphyseal bone with defects, they use revision implants with cementless long stems.The authors have achieved good results with off-set stems.",

    "abstract": "Retrograde nailing represents an established fixation method for fractures of the distal femur and offers in femoral shaft fractures an alternative to the existing technique of antegrade nailing. The aim of this study was to investigate in a retrospective analysis the results of retrograde nailing in distal femoral fractures and selected cases of femoral shaft fractures. Emphasis was posed on long- term functional outcome, especially in daily activities.Retrograde femoral nailing was used from 1999 until 2006 in two Level 1 trauma centers for the treatment of distal femoral (AO/ASIF-type 33) and femoral shaft fractures (AO/ASIF - type 32) in 40 patients with 41 fractures. The mean age of patients was 63,7 years (min: 21 / max.: 103) and 70, 7% presented with ipsilateral local pathologies or associated entities. A pre-existing reduced activity level was found in 12 /40 patients (30%) and was equally caused by neurologic conditions and geriatric entities.Indication for retrograde nailing was left in AO/ASIF fracture-type 33 to the individual estimation of the surgeon, while it was restricted in AO /ASIF fracture- type 32 to problematic cases. For fracture fixation the Distal Femoral Nail (28/41 68,3%) of Synthes Int.(R) and a spupracondylar /; retrograde modified sc - UFN (13 /41 31,7%) produced by Synthes(R) Austria were used. Patients were followed till fracture healing and invited to a functional follow-up using the Lysholm / Gilquist score and the Tegner /Lysholm score.Osseous healing occured in shaft fractures in 18,1 weeks on an average compared to 16,5 weeks in supracondylar fractures. Postoperative complications requiring re-intervention were seen in 6/41 (14,6%) fractures. 28/40 patients (70%) were evaluated with a mean follow-up period of 20,4 months using the functional score of Lysholm /Gilquist and the activity score of Tegner/ Lysholm. Both scores were balanced among shaft fractures and distal femoral fractures (Lysholm - mean: 87,7 pts shaft. vs. 80,1 pts. distal Tegner-mean: 5,2 pts. shaft vs. 3,9 pts. distal), while motion showed better results in shaft fractures (arc of motion - mean: 120 degrees ) than in distal femoral fractures (arc of motion - mean: 105).Despite a high age of patients (average 63,7 years) and a reduced activity level with many local co-morbitities, retrograde nailing resulted in the majority (95,1%) in reliable osseous healing. Thus, achievement of a painless fracture-site and a stable knee-joint provides early mobilization even in problematic cases. Impairment of functional outcome, mirrored in an over-all Lysholm /Gilquist score of 83,3 pts. and an over-all Tegner /Lysholm score of 4,4 pts. , was mainly related to preexisting restrictions of the loco-motor system.Retrograde nailing represents a reliable fixation method for extra-articular (33 - A1-3) and simple intra-articular (33 - C1-2) fractures of the supracondylar area. In femoral shaft fractures retrograde inserted nails offer a valuable alternative, especially when the proximal femoral approach is obstructed.",

    "abstract": "The importance of prevention in late hematogenous infection is well understood but, because responsibility lies with general practitioners and other specialists, the orthopedic surgeon is usually not much interested. In both our and other countries, discussions are taking place on whether and to what extent antibiotic prevention should be carried out. Antibiotic prophylaxis of hematogenous infection is not indicated for all patients with joint arthroplasty, but only for a limited, defined group of patients at high risk. In these, however, the present state of knowledge suggests that prevention is necessary. A preventive treatment of late hematogenous infection is used for a procedure or a disease associated with risks in all the patients involved within two years of prosthetic joint implantation and, after this period, only in immunosuppressed patients. Surgery on the urogenital tract associated with the risk of bacteremia includes prostate gland surgery, operations for urinary bladder tumors, nephrolithotomy, extracorporeal lithotripsy and prostate biopsy. Certain conditions, such as urinary catheter presence, intermittent catheterization, urethral stent presence, urine retention and a history of urinary tract infection or prostate inflammation, pose an increased risk of bacterial colonization for the urogenital system. Dental procedures associated with a risk of bacteremia include tooth extraction, surgery on the parodontium, surgical extraction of an impacted tooth, dental implant treatment, procedures in a tooth's apical region, initial application of an orthodontic apparatus, intraligamentous blocks and also cleaning teeth and implants expected to bleed. Gynecological surgery with a risk of bacteremia are abdominal, vaginal and laparoscopic hysterectomies, surgery for cancer contaminated with vaginal bacteria, reconstruction surgery, operations on the pelvic floor for defects associated with urinary incontinence and use of xenotransplants. In obstetrics, a cesarean section carries some risks. In general surgery, the preventive administration of antibiotics is indicated, apart from situations always requiring antibiotic therapy, also for advanced forms of acute appendicitis, perirectal abscess, invasive endoscopy procedures on the colon, soft tissue phlegmona or abscess, surgical treatment of venous ulceration and pressure sores, and limb amputation. When inserting any piercing in patients with joint replacement at risk, it is recommended to do it with antibiotic administration; also, it is necessary to responsibly treat any inflammatory complication. The system of prevention for the late hematogenous infections of prosthetic joints is not developed as thoroughly as, for instance, it is in cardiology for patients with valve reconstruction. Because of the reasons given above, it is advisable to set up unambiguous guidelines for the prevention of late hematogenous infection in patients with joint replacement.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Surgery for the nonunion or malunion of pelvic fractures is not common even at specialised departments. This article presents the authors experience with this procedure, completed with case studies and a review of relevant literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS From 1998 to 2007, a total of 359 patients underwent surgery for pelvic trauma. In the same period, eight surgeries on nonunions or malunions of the pelvis were performed, three in men and five in women. The average age of the patients was 37.3 years (range from 15 to 68). The primary treatment included conservative therapy (two patients), external fixation (three patients) and osteosynthesis of the anterior pelvic segment in another three patients. Reconstructive surgeries were always executed for nonunion or malunion or for both conditions together. Patients suffered most often from pain, limping, from the need of using crutches or leg shortening; no diffuculties occurred while sitting. Surgery for nonunion or malunion was performed at the average period of 29.3 months (range from 6 to 84) after injury. Surgical techniques and risks are described in detail. RESULTS Two patients suffer from persistent pain after surgery. In one patient, it is due to partial sacroiliac ankylosis with pathological mobility of the remaining part of the sacroiliac joint together with nonunion of the fractured dorsal part of the ilium. In the other one, pain comes from muscular dysbalance, as well as from chronic lesions in the sacroiliac joint and from scoliosis, despite the fact that the pelvis was successfully reconstructed 7 years after the initial injury. Four patients have no or only transient pain. In four patients limping disappeared after surgery; in two it is still persisting. One of these is the patient with partial sacroiliac joint ankylosis, while symphysis pubic diasthesis persists in the other. Leg length difference, sitting problems or other complaints following surgery are not observed. Four patients developed union detected radiologically, widening of the symphysis persists in one patient and sacroiliac joint problem in another one. Excellent results with anatomic integrity in all three x-ray projections were achieved in only two patients. Satisfactory outcome with a residual deformity of less than 1 cm of the vertical or posterior displacement or up to 15-degree rotation in any plane was achieved in three patients. A poor outcome involving more than 1-cm dislocation was found in one case. DISCUSION The most common cause of poorly healed pelvic fractures is a misdiagnosis of the primary injury and a subsequent conservative way of treatment. Injuries to the posterior pelvic segment are repeatedly underestimated. A frequent error in pelvic ring fracture therapy is that only the anterior pelvic segment is treated surgically, often with only a simple external fixator inserted in the iliac crests. In addition, the treatment strategy is often decided on in hospitals whose surgeons have not enough in pelvic trauma surgery. The most frequent complaints associated with an inadequate treatment are pain, walking problems and limping. Sitting can be difficult in some patients. Urinary bladder can be compressed with the result of frequent and urgent miction, and vaginal compression could bring about dyspareunia. Additionally, pelvic deformations in women can aggravate delivery. Cosmetic changes due to a prominent sacrum, a prominent greater trochanter or distal spine scoliosis are also of concern. The method of an accurate measurement of anatomic alterations of the pelvis is presented. CONCLUSIONS Early surgery of the pelvic trauma enables an adequate restoration of pelvic anatomy and provides conditions for good and reliable stability of both the posterior and anterior pelvic segments. Late repairs of nonunions or malunions are demanding and associated with a high risk of serious complications, often with long-term sequelae. Key words: pelvic fracture, malunion, nonunion.",

    "abstract": "Degenerative disc disease (DDD) is a spinal condition resulting from degeneration of the intervertebral discs. It is associated with symptoms of sciatica, back pain and leg weakness and also with degenerative instability of the spine. To arrest the degenerative cascade of disc disease, and taking into consideration stress placed on the adjacent discs managed by decompression and stabilisation by instrumented fusion, the lumbar spine was treated by dynamic posterior stabilisation of the segments affected. Based on the classification described by Dubois et al., the Dynesys system was used. The aim of this study was to evaluate the mid-term results of this method in DDD patients.In the 2002-2007 period, 102 patients (65 men and 37 women; average age, 54 years) underwent surgery for problems due to DDD manifested by pain, neurological findings and radiographic evidence of degenerative changes in the spine. The classification of age-related changes, as described by Dubois et al. and Kirkaldy-Willis, showed that type 4 and type 6 of DDD (64% disc degeneration with spinal canal stenosis) were most common. After surgery using the Dynesys system, the patients were followed up for an average of 36 months. Patient examination included: pre- and post-operative medical history, clinical, radiographic (including magnetic resonance imaging/MRI) and neurological examination, and the pain and functional status assessment using the visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI), respectively. A total of 146 lumbar spine segments were surgically treated in 102 patients, the L4-L5 segment being treated most frequently, with a total of 61 interventions at this level. Radicular pain before surgery was reported by 40 patients. The average operative blood loss was 1013.8 ml and patients stayed in the hospital for an average of 13.8 days. There were 15 post-operative complications treated. After surgery, the patients participated in a. special rehabilitation programme and were allowed full weight-bearing after 3 months.At 36 months of follow-up, the improvement as against the pre-operative condition included a drop in the average VAS value from 7.3 to 4.7 and that in the average ODI from 54.5 to 39.9. The results were statistically analysed using ANOVA software and the t-test and Bartlet test (level of significance set at 0.05). The improvement in the patients' health status was statistically significant during all 3-year post-operative period. As shown by the MRI findings obtained from repeated examination in 26 patients, the use of the Dynesys system resulted in the post-operative disappearance of disc bulging and the restoration of the posterior longitudinal ligament and space in the lumbar spinal canal. The surgery had no positive effect on disc regeneration, but improved peridiscal marrow oedema of that lumbar segment in the way described by Modic et al.In patients with DDD, stabilisation of the lumbar spine by instrumented rigid fusion often results in increased biomechanical stress and damage to the segments adjacent to the area of fusion. The use of dynamic stabilisation devices, including the Dynesys system, reduces this potential risk. The Dynesys system is also effective in the treatment of DDD combined with spinal stenosis in elderly patients, as reported by other authors. A certain risk associated with Dynesys use may lie in disc height reduction in the anterior segment by up to 0.7 mm, thus producing a fulcrum pin effect. Despite this risk factor, dynamic stabilisation in DDD patients will considerably improve the quality of their lives.The results of 102 patients, with 146 segments treated by posterior dynamic neutralisation using the Dynesys system, show that this method improved subjective feelings, morphological findings and pain and functional status in the patients with DDD in the three-year post-operative period. This had a good effect on the quality of life in these patients.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate functional outcomes and knee joint stability after double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using three-tunnel quadriceps tendon-bone graft and four-tunnel hamstring graft (semi-tendinosus and gracilis muscles).Group 1 included 20 patients undergoing reconstruction with quadriceps tendon- bone graft group; 2 comprised of 20 patients treated by hamstring graft. There were 26 men and 14 women, with an average age of 27 (range, 16 to 44) years. The minimum follow-up period was one year.In group 1 patients, semi-anatomic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was performed by a three-tunnel technique (two tunnels in the femur and one in the tibia) using quadriceps femoris muscle graft. Group 2 patients were treated by anatomic four-tunnel reconstruction (two tunnels in the femur and two in the tibia) with the use of hamstring graft. Functional outcomes were evaluated on the basis of Lysholm and IKDC scores. Antero-posterior stability was measured with aKT-1000 arthrometer and rotational stability was assessed by the pivot-shift test. For statistical evaluation, the level of significance (p) was set at < 0.05.The final evaluation showed an average Lysholm score of 88.9 ± 12 (76-100) points for group 1, and 87.9 ± 11 (62-100) points for group 2; there was no statistically significant difference. The rounded average result of the functional IKDC score after surgery was the same in the two groups (80 ± 10). The joints treated by the three-tunnel technique had on average better antero-posterior stability, but this was not statistically significant. The pivot-shift phenomenon was not seen in either of the groups. Operative times in both groups were comparable. An intra-operative fracture of the patella occurred in two patients of group 1.No similar prospective study comparing the outcomes of the methods reported here has been found in the internatio- nal literature. The studies so far published have not included any such comparison or they compared other techniques, such as single- versus double-bundle reconstructions.Based on Lysholm and IKDC score evaluation and antero-posterior and rotational stability assessment, it can be concluded that both the three- and the four-tunnel technique of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction gave similar results, with no significant differences, at one-year follow-up. However, these are only short-term results and only a long-term follow-up can prove or disprove the validity of this conclusion.",

    "abstract": "Information on the distribution of UHMWPE wear particles around joint replacements is essential for the understanding of aseptic loosening of implants.Samples of soft tissue from around total hip arthroplasty (THA), which had a typical appearance of polyethylene granuloma, were collected from the places corresponding to the radiological zones of Gruen and DeLee. The samples were taken from 45 patients (group N1). Since the samples varied in macroscopic appearance and/or the technique of processing, a sub-group of 15 more uniform samples (group N2) were collected by the first author in order to ensure the maxi- mum reliability. The samples were examined for the extent of tissue damage and the amount of particles in each zone. The comprehensive orthopaedic evaluation of tissue damage was carried out as follows: the first author studied the joint replacement revision protocol and pre-operative radiograph in each patient. He evaluated the degree of damage in each zone and wrote down the results in the form of an ordered series according to increasing damage (relational statement). This ordered series was called orthopaedist's statement (OS). The amount of particles in each zone around THA was assessed by the IRc method developed in the laboratory of the second author. IRc method yielded numbers that were proportional to the volume of biologically active particles with size 0.1-10 microm in given zones. The set of numbers from IRc method for each individual case of THA was ordered in a series (relational statement). This ordered series was called a measurement statement (MS) and could be directly compared with orthopaedist's statement (OS). The OS's and MS's for each patient were statistically evaluated, independently for each group (N1=45, N2=15), and two hypotheses were tested: a) distribution of particles in various zones around THA is uniform, b) there is an agreement between OS and MS.The number of UHMWPE wear particles in different periprosthetic zones within each patient was significantly different in both groups (N1 and N2) at the significance level of P=0.001. The OS's and MS's were identical at the significance level P=0.05. Moreover, maximum amount of particles was found in zones III and 7 in 40 patients out of 45.Polyethylene wear debris is considered one of the major causes of THR failures. However, neither national nor international literature has provided a study that would show a statistically significant relationship between the numbers of wear particles in individual zones and the extent of tissue damage in these zones. This is most probably due to the fact that four independent methods had to be developed in order to compare OS's and MS's: 1) accurate technique of tissue sampling during THA revisions, 2) accurate method of isolating wear particles from the tissues collected, 3) efficient, reliable and reproducible quantification of UHMWPE particles and 4) correct method of statistical analysis for comparison of the orthopaedist's statements and the measurement statements for all patients involved.The distribution of wear particles in the periprosthetic tissues of THA is not uniform, i.e. the amount of wear particles of each patient varies from zone to zone. The extent of tissue damage in each zone, as assessed by the orthopaedic surgeon (OS), was in a good agreement with the volume of 0.1-10 microm particles obtained by IRc measurement (MS) of the zone. We have provided conclusive evidence that the highest number of particles is accumulated in zone III and zone 7. As the number of particles the zones varies and the greatest damage is repeatedly found in areas with the highest particle numbers, it can be concluded with certainly that wear particles are one of the main causes of aseptic joint implant failure.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this prospective study was to present injury characteristics and to evaluate therapeutic procedures and midterm functional and radiographic results of the surgical management of talus fractures.In the period from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2009, a total of 53 patients with 56 talar bone fractures or peritalar dislocations were treated surgically. The prospective study included 39 patients with 42 fractures of the talar neck and body; of these, 31 men had 34 fractures (79.5%) and eight women had eight fractures (20.5%). There were recorded demographic data, medical history, associated injuries, polytrauma criteria, time to surgery and its type, failure of osteosynthesis, complications associated with soft tissue healing, length of hospital stay, duration of follow-up, radiographic evidence of bone healing and the presence of avascular necrosis or arthritis. Fractures were classified according to the systems of Hawkins (modified by Canale), Sneppen and Marti. Outcomes were assessed on the basis of functional and radiographic scores (West Point Ankle Score). The injuries included 21 (50%) talar neck fractures, 12 (28.5%) isolated fractures of the talar body and nine (21.5%) combined fractures of the talar neck and body. There were four (9.5%) open fractures. Twenty-five (64.1%) patients had associated skeletal injuries; eight (20.5%) patients suffered polytrauma. Staged treatment was used in five patients (12.8%). The average time to final surgery was 4.2 days. The technique of minimally invasive osteosynthesis under fluoroscopic or arthroscopic control was used in 18 (42.9%) fractures, and open reduction and internal fixation was carried out in 24 (57.1%) fractures. The average follow-up was 30.9 months.Signs of avascular necrosis partly or completely affecting the talar body were found in six fractures (14.3%), three of which required secondary arthrodesis. Arthritis developed in 10 cases (23.8%) Functional and radiographic results assessed with the West Point Ankle Score, regardless of fracture type, were excellent in 17 (43.5%), good in 11 (28.2%), satisfactory in five (12.8%) and poor in six (15.5%) patients.High incidence of polytrauma and complex injuries of the hindfoot makes the timing of surgical management difficult and also affects its outcome. Timing used in our study is in agreement with general trends of staged talus fracture treatment. In accordance with the international practice, the majority of non-displaced talar neck fractures (Hawkins 1) were treated by means of osteosynthesis. We preferred minimally invasive fracture reduction under arthroscopic control in less complicated fracture types of the talar neck and body. The incidence of avascular necrosis, as reported in the literature, has had a decreasing tendency. Incidence of avascular necrosis without talar dome collapse does not necessarily lead to functional impairment. The results of functional and radiographic scoring were in agreement with the literature data and confirmed that functional outcome is related to the severity of fracture.Our results confirmed that the management of talar fractures by means of osteosynthesis is indicated even in nondisplaced Hawkins type 1 fractures, staged treatment is effective in dislocated and open fractures, delayed surgery is a safe procedure for less dislocated fractures and injuries requiring complex care should be referred to foot surgery centres.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe patients with pelvic ring injury involve two groups: 1) young and middle-age persons, mostly men, with serious injury to the pelvic ring due to high-energy trauma; and 2) older patients, mostly women, with osteoporotic fractures due to a simple fall.The aim of this study was to show significant differences in the selected epidemiological characteristics between these two groups. MATERIAL AND METHODSThe group comprised 225 patients older than 15 years with pelvic fractures who were treated between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2009.In this retrospective descriptive study, the patients' data on age, gender, mechanism of injury and a type of fracture according to the AO classification were retrieved and analysed.Categorical data at a level of significance of 5% were compared using the Chi-square test. RESULTSIn the group reviewed there were 113 women and 112 men, with an average age of 51 years (women, 53 years; men, 49 years) in the range of 15 to 95 years.More men than women were in the age range of 15 to 60 years (with the difference being significant only in the sixth decade of life; p=0.043).In the age category of over sixty, women outnumbered men, and this was significant in the eight and ninth decades (p=0.023 and p=0.04, respectively).Significantly more men were involved in motorbike accidents (p=0.047) or had falls from heights (p=0.004) and particularly those at a worksite (p<0.001).Fractures due to a simple fall were significantly more frequent in women than men (p<0.001)and, generally, were most often found in the old-age category, in which women were eight years senior to men.Type A fractures were found in 58, type B fractures in 140 and type C fractures in 27 patients.The most frequent fractures (A2.2, p=0.054;B2.1, p=0.038) occurred more often in women and at a much higher age than in men (the age difference was 15 years in type A2.2 fractures and \"only\" 7 years in type B2.1 fractures).The patients who sustained either of these fractures in a simple fall were about 35 years older than those in whom these fractures were caused by high-energy trauma. DISCUSSIONThe fact that pelvic injuries most often occur in men at young or middle age has been confirmed by several epidemiological studies with a conclusion that age-related risky male behaviours play a significant role.The findings of this study showed that pelvic fractures due to simple falls were mostly found in old-age patients, with women eight years older than men.This provides evidence for the existence of two distinct groups of patients with pelvic fractures.The existence of two epidemiologically different groups of patients with pelvic fractures, in the authors' opinion, is demonstrated by a correlation of AO fracture type, patient gender and age in each group.A mere comparison of the age of patients indicates that older patients had mostly type A and B fractures.Unilateral fractures of the pubic ramus after a simple fall, which are regarded as related to osteoporosis, were recorded in a significantly higher number of women of the oldest age.The authors suggest that epidemiological studies of pelvic injuries should use the age of 70+ as an exclusion criterion in the patients with type A2.2 and B2.1 fractures.This will remove the bias of epidemiological data on patients with severe pelvic injuries, resulting from involvement of patients with osteoporotic fractures. CONCLUSIONThe evaluation of epidemiological data in this study allows us to conclude that younger men are those most frequently sustaining pelvic injuries due to high-energy trauma and that old age (80+) is characteristic for patients of both sexes, with female sex predominance, who have fractures due to simple falls.These findings give support to the concept that, in a group of patients with pelvic injuries, a subgroup with fractures different in terms of epidemiology and aetiology (osteoporotic fracture) can be identified.",

    "abstract": "Clavicle fractures, especially of the mid third, are an injury commonly seen in clinical practice, therefore, there is constant earnest discussion of the optimal approach to therapy.Until recently clavicle fractures were solely the domain of non surgical management.Even displaced fractures have been successfully managed without surgery.However, complications have been reported after non surgical treatment, the most frequent being post-traumatic shortening of the clavicle with varying functional consequences for the shoulder joint and range of arm motion as well as pseudarthrosis, especially after more severely displaced fractures.Recent studies have now shown that outcomes after non surgical management of displaced fractures or shortening of the clavicle are worse than had been previously assumed.Surgical techniques for the stable fixation of clavicle fractures have been improved and a wider selection of implants for osteosynthesis of these fractures has become available.Although there is widespread consensus that undisplaced or minimally displaced clavicle fractures respond well to non surgical management, optimal treatment of displaced fractures or severe shortening is under scrutiny with regard to both the basic choice between non surgical or surgical management and implant selection.According to current research findings, surgical management of displaced clavicle fractures has advantages and appears to be superior to non surgical management.Intramedullary nailing has proven suitable for simple straight fractures, and plate fixation for multifragmentary fractures.",

Purpose of this study was to evaluate demineralized bone matrix (DBM) in PLF as alternative to the gold standard of ABG in acute traumatic vertebral body fractures of the thoracolumbar spine. MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively identified 101 patients with acute traumatic vertebral body fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine who were treated with instrumented PLF in our level one trauma center between 2005 and 2011. Patients with a primary paraplegia, osteodepriving disease or loss to follow-up had been excluded. Until August 2008, autologous bone graft harvested from the posterior iliac crest was used in PLF (control group n = 46). Starting September 2008, DBM was used as fusion expander in PLF (study group n = 16). Clinical and radiological evaluation was performed with a minimum followup of 18 months to assess the clinical and radiological outcome. RESULTS We found a fusion rate of 94% in patients undergoing PLF with the use of DBM and 100% with the use of ABG. There was one major complication of deep infection in the DBM group and two cases of superficial wound infection in the ABG group. We discovered a trend of reduced operating time with the use of DBM. CONCLUSIONS DBM leads to a similar fusion rate as the use of ABG in patients undergoing PLF for acute traumatic vertebral body fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine. DBM is associated with reduced operating time.case-control study Key words: demineralized bone matrix instrumented posterolateral fusion, acute traumatic vertebral body fracture, thoracolumbar spine, autologous bone graft.",

    "abstract": "Intramedullary nailing is a worldwide accepted technique for stabilization of fractures of long bones. Technique, instruments and implants primarily have been developed for the fixation of short (transverse and oblique) diaphyseal fractures. First generation nails were hollow and slotted, which gave them some elasticity. When the tip of the nail passed the fracture gap, picked up the opposite fracture fragment and was driven further down, the longitudinal axis of the bone was restored and the extremity realigned. Bone length was restored by closure of the fracture gap. The tight connection between the deformable hollow nail and the inner cortex at the isthmus realized a press-fit, which achieved a very stable bone-implant construct. The nail had the function of a weight-shearing implant. Interlocked nails represent the second-generation nails. They changed the spectrum of indications for nailing considerably. Not only short middle-third shaft fractures, but shaft fractures of all types (from transverse to comminuted) and all localizations can be stabilized with an interlocked nail. Due to interlocking, length and rotation are controlled. The nail bridges the area of instability, being a weight-bearing implant. Small diameter, solid nails formed the next generation of nail implants. They were conceived for the provisional treatment of fractures with an enhanced risk of postoperative infection such as open fractures or closed fractures with severe soft tissue damage. They were increasingly used for minimal invasive treatment of closed fractures without soft tissue damage as well, as reaming was not necessary and endosteal blood supply less damaged. Nevertheless, it became clear that they were connected with a higher incidence of implant failure and revision surgery. Another development was the creation of nails with multiple and angular stable interlocking options. Major advantage is that high stability is obtained in the fracture fragment, in which multiple interlocking is used. This property gives the possibility of nailing fractures close to a joint with a short fracture segment (24). Nevertheless, intramedullary nailing of metaphyseal fractures remains controversial. Major complications to be avoided are malalignment, delayed union, nonunion and implant failure due to suboptimal fracture reduction (23).",

MATERIAL AND METHODSA questionnaire was mailed to every Department of Traumatology registered in the DGU (German Trauma Society) databank. RESULTSWe received 60,32% of the initially sent questionnaires and after applying exclusion criteria 269 (53,91%) were applicable to statistical analysis.In the three-tiered German hospital system no statistical difference was seen in the general participation of children polytrauma care between hospitals of different tiers (p = 0.315).Even at the lowest hospital level 69,47% of hospitals stated to participate in polytrauma care for children, at the intermediate and highest level hospitals 91,89% and 95,24% stated to be involved in children polytrauma care, respectively.Children suspicious of multiple injuries or polytrauma received significantly fewer primary whole-body CTs in lowest level compared to intermediate level hospitals (36,07% vs. 56,57%; p = 0.015) and lowest level compared to highest level hospitals (36,07% vs. 68,42%; p = 0.001).Comparing the use of whole-body CT in intermediate to highest level hospitals a not significant increase in its use could be seen in highest level hospitals (56,57% vs. 68,42%; p = 0.174). CONCLUSIONAccording to our survey, taking care of polytraumatised children in Germany is not limited to specialised hospitals or a defined hospital level-of-care.Additionally, there is no established radiologic standard in work-up of the polytraumatised child.However, in higher hospital care -levels a higher percentage of hospitals employs whole-body CTs for primary radiologic diagnostics in polytraumatised children.",

RESULTSNinety-six percent excellent or good cosmetic results were achieved in both groups, and 94% / 90% excellent or good functional results were achieved in groups 1 and 2 (respectively).There was no significant difference between Baumann and humero-capitellar angles of intact and operated sides in both groups, but there was an average carrying angle difference of 2,96 degrees in the group 1 and 1,52 degrees in the group 2 and these differences were statistically significant.Five cases (10%) from each group had superficial pin tract infection.Hypertrophic incision scar occurred in 6 (12%) patients performed ORPP. CONCLUSIONBoth CRPP and ORPP are successful treatment methods in the management of non-complicated and non-comminuted displaced supracondylar fractures of the humerus in pediatric ages and their outcomes are similar.Incision scar and the long duration of operation are the disadvantages of open surgery.For fixing the fracture, placement of two K-wires from the medial and lateral aspects which cross each other is enough to achieve a good stability.In ORPP practices, lateral incision is a simple and reliable approach despite of the dissatisfying scar tissue formation.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Growth factors produced by platelets enhance tissue healing. The aim of this study was to confirm or disprove the hypothesis that, in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, the application of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) into the tibial and femoral tunnels and in the graft enhances graft maturation and graft-bone interface healing and thus improves knee function at 3 and 12 months post-operatively in comparison with the control group. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 40 patient had the surgery; 20 underwent single-bundle hamstring reconstruction with PRP application (PRP group) and 20 had the same surgery without PRP addition (control group). A 5 ml amount of PRP was obtained from the patient's peripheral blood. A graft inserted in the bone tunnels was fixed with interference screws and, after intra-articular fluid aspiration, 1 ml of PRP was injected into each tunnel and 3 ml were evenly applied to the intra-articular portion of the graft. The patients were examined by MRI at 3 and 12 months after surgery. The subsidence of swelling in the tunnelsurrounding tissues was taken as a sign of graft-bone interface healing, and increased signal intensity of the graft was considered as a result of its ligamentisation. The knee functional status was evaluated at 3 and 12 post-operative months, using the scoring systems (Cincinnati score, IKDC score). RESULTS Bone swelling was found at 3 post-operative months in 18 of 20 patients in both the PRP and the control group. Graft signal intensity was increased in most patients (19 of the PRP group; 18 control patients; p = 0.949). The Cincinnati score at 3 months had an average value of 72.7 (34-100; SO, 18.7) in the PRP group and 73.4 (42-99; SO, 16.3) in the control group (p = 0.793). The functional score after 12 months improved to 97.5 (75-100; SO, 12.8) in the PRP group and to 95.1 (66-100; SO, 13.1) in the control group; there was no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.885) at either 3 or 12 months. The IKDC score showed similar results. At 12 months bone swelling was recorded in seven out of 20 patients in the PRP group and in nine patients in the control group (p = 0.751). Graft signal intensity was increased in three and four patients of the PRP and control groups, respectively (p = 0.681). There was a statistical difference between the findings at 3 and 12 months within each group, but no difference between the groups. DISCUSSION In ACL reconstruction, the process of tendon graft-to-bone healing has several stages involving inflammation, cell proliferation and graft ligamentisation. At each stage, an important role is played by growth factors produced by thrombocytes, and therefore their potential use in the treatment of injuries to ligaments and tendons has recently come into focus. A number of experimental studies dealing with the effect of platelet-rich plasma on soft tissue healing has been published. Therefore, the method of using PRP to enhance graft healing in ACL reconstruction in humans is still being studied. CONSLUSIONS The use of PRP in ACL reconstruction does not accelerate graft remodelling and bone ingrowth into the tendon. The function scoring results showed a statistically significant improvement in knee function between 3 and 12 months of followup within each group studied but revealed no difference between the groups. The hypothesis postulated above was disproved. Key words: anterior cruciate ligament, platelet-rich plasma, anatomic single-bundle reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "A comparison of radiological and clinical results between dorsal pelvic segment stabilization with a transiliac internal fixator (TIFI) and that with two iliosacral screws (IS).In this prospective study, both the TIFI and the IS group had 32 patients. The majority of injuries were assessed as type C1.3 because only patients with a high-energy mechanism of injury were included. Radiological results were evaluated according to the Matta scoring system and clinical outcome using the Majeed score and the Pelvic Outcome Score. Categorical data were evaluated by the two-sided Fisher's exact test or Pearson's χ2 test and continuous data by Student's t-test. A test result with p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.In the TIFI group, the mean posterior displacement was 2.2 mm, in the IS group it was 1.9 mm (p=0.58542). The pelvic outcome scores in the TIFI group were: excellent, 28%; good, 12%; fair, 48.0%; and poor, 4 %; in the IS group they were: excellent, 11.1%; good, 22.2%; fair, 66.7%; and poor, 0.0% (p=0.51731). The Majeed scores were as follows: excellent, 56.0%; good, 16.0%; fair, 20.0%; poor 8.0 % for the TIFI group and excellent, 50.0%; good, 27.8%; fair, 11.1%; and poor, 11.1% for the IS group (p=0.70187). Within the total, average Majeed score was 80.64 points in TIFI, 80.67 in IS (p=0.99654). In a sub-analysis of unilateral transforaminal fractures (Pohlemann type II), the average score for TIFI was 82.8 points and only 53.5 points for IS; the differences were statistically significant (p=0.04517). No intraoperative complications were associated with TIFI and one injury to the superior gluteal artery (3.1%) and two iatrogenic neurological injuries with IS (6.3%; p=0.23810). In the TIFI group, the fixator was removed without complications. In the IS group, post-operative wound bleeding following screw removal occurred in three patients (20.0%; p=0.22414), complete extraction of screws and washers was successful only in seven patients (46.7%), washers were left in situ in six patients (40.0 %) and IS removal was not possible in two patients (13.3%). The difference in complications between the groups was highly significant (p=0.00220).The results of our study are in agreement with those of the relevant studies published recently as well as with the outcomes of transiliac plate fixation reported in the literature. TIFI implantation is preferred in transforaminal and central sacral fractures because, unlike iliosacral screws, it carries a low risk of excessive compression of the sacral foramina and iatrogenic neurological injury. There were no significant differences in clinical and radiological findings between TIFI and IS procedures. Only in unilateral transforaminal fracture the TIFI stabilization had better outcome, as shown by the Majeed score. The IS fixation was associated with a higher rate of complications not only in primary implantation, but also at implant removal.The TIFI technique is superior to the IS procedure in fixation of unilateral transforaminal fractures and provides a reasonable alternative to the existing types of minimally invasive fixation.",

The minimum follow-up was 12 months. Unstable was considered a fracture in which it was impossible to restore by reduction the medial support -- the Adams' arch, i. e. the region below the lesser trochanter in subtrochanteric fractures. Prevailing in the group of patients were unstable pertrochanteric fractures (AO 31 A2.1, A2.2) that occurred in 55 % of patients, per-subtrochanteric fractures (AO 31 A2.3) accounted only for 26 % and subtrochanteric fractures (AO 31 A3.3) for 19 %.The fracture healed in 95 % of patients within 6 months and in 98 % of patients within 9 months. There were 29 intraoperative complications recorded in 19 patients (12 %). This category included also intraoperative technical difficulties. Only 9 patients (4 %) were reoperated on. Early postoperative complications occurred in 16 patients (8 %) requiring reoperation in 7 cases. Six late postoperative complications occurred in 3 patients.Intramedullary implants for internal fixation of the proximal femur tolerate higher static and several times higher cyclical loading as compared to DHS types of implant. As a result the fracture heals even without the primary restoration of the medial support. The implant temporarily compensates the function of the medial column. When this function is not restored in a limited period of time, the internal fixation, although correctly performed, fails. The main cause of complications are technical mistakes or failure to observe the proper surgical technique.The most frequent mistake is reduction with the persisting varus position or distraction in the fracture line, incorrect placement of the screw in the femoral neck or the nail in the femoral shaft, wrong choice of the length of the screws, unnecessary hesitation in solving the defect in the course of the treatment. Forced insertion of the implant may cause additional damages to the skeleton. PFN is a quality implant for the treatment of unstable pertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures of the femur. The number and severity of complications may be reduced by the observance of proper principles of reduction and exact surgical technique.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of chondral defects by transplantation of autologous chondrocytes has recently shown further development. Various biomaterials are used as carriers facilitating attachment and even distribution of chondrocytes in the defect. Since 2003 Hyalograft C, hyaluronan-based scaffolds, has been used, in a clinical study, for implantation of autologous chondrocytes in the treatment of deep chondral lesions of the knee at our department.Eight patients (7 men and 1 woman; average age, 31 years) followed up for at least 9 months were evaluated. The lesions with an average size of 3.9 cm2 were localized on femoral condyles.The outcome of surgery was evaluated on the basis of the IKDC Subjective Knee Evaluation Form, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Lysholm knee score. The patients underwent MR examination preoperatively and at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. The newly-formed cartilage was assessed by International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) visual scores at second-look arthroscopy carried out at 9 to 12 months following transplantation. Consistency of the new cartilage developing in the defect and that of healthy cartilage around the defect was compared by means of a special indentation probe in three patients. A biopsy sample was collected from the grafted site for histological, histochemical and immunohistochemical examination.All patients reported improvement in knee function on average at 10 months after surgery. The average IKDC subjective score increased from 46 points preoperatively to 74 points postoperatively. The KOOS evaluation showed pain relief and improved function. In quality of life evaluation the average score of 35 points before surgery increased to 70 points after it. The average Lysholm knee score was 61 points before and 83 points after surgery. MR findings correlated well with arthroscopic findings. Second-look arthroscopy showed a normal appearance of the newly-formed cartilage in six, and an abnormal appearance in two patients. The average ICRS visual score was 9.4 points. No graft failure was recorded. The newly-produced tissue had the histological characteristics of a mixed hyaline and fibrous cartilage in seven patients, and of hyaline-like cartilage in one patient.The ICRS visual repair assessment of the newly-formed tissue showed that our results were better than the one-year outcomes reported by Bartlett et al. (11 patients after transplantation of a collagen bilayer seeded with chondrocytes), but worse than the results of an Italian multi-center study (55 patients with Hyalograft C-based grafts followed up on average for 14 months). At almost one year, implantation of on a Hyalograft C resulted in the production of mixed cartilage incorporated well in the subchondral bone. Only one patient had mature hyaline cartilage. One year is too short to allow for complete remodeling of the newly formed cartilage into a mature hyaline cartilage. This is in agreement with other studies suggesting that the new cartilage continues to mature and remodel for a time longer than one year.Based on our results we suggest that the use of Hyalograft C is a safe and effective option for treatment of deep chondral defects of the knee; it is particularly useful in patients in whom the primary defect treatment has failed. The application of Haylograft C is relatively quick and easy; this is convenient when surgery involves more than one procedure (ligament reconstruction, osteotomy). However, a definite evaluation of this method will be possible only after long-term results are available.

The average age was 42 years, with 67 % of the patients being younger than 40 years. The average follow-up was 42 montsh (range, 18 to 92). The acetabular fractures evaluated by the AO classification included type A1 in 17 patients, type A2 in seven, type B1 in nine, type B2 in six, type B3 in seven, type C1 in three and type C2 in two patients.In 11 patients with aseptic necrosis of the femoral head without acetabular deformity, cementless Zweymüller Bicon or Spotorno CLS acetabular components were used. Twenty-nine patients with acetabular defects of type I and II, according to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) classification, underwent acetabular reconstruction with the bone impaction grafting technique, using allogenic grafts and cementless Zweymüller Bicon acetabular components. Four patients with AAOS type III acetabular defects were treated with impacted morsellized bone allografts, using titanium mesh and cemented polyethylene acetabular cups. Three patients were treated with solid bone grafts fixed with osteosynthetic material. In two patients with type IV defects, osteosynthesis using a plate completed with allogenic bone graft, a mesh and a cemented cup were used.The patients were evaluated with the use of Harris hip scores. In 20 patients (43 %) the outcomes were excellent, and very good in 18 (37 %), satisfactory in six (12 %) and poor in four (8 %) patients.Hip joint arthroplasty following the surgical treatment of acetabular fracture is indicated in patients with post-traumatic hip arthritis. This frequently occurs due to complications associated with surgery for acetabular fractures, or the cause remains unknown. Some types of these fractures show a high proportion of poor results. The group can be divided into two different subgroups: the patients with a spherical, healed acetabulum and the patients with acetabular deformity or defect, of which the most serious condition is pseudoarthrosis of one or both columns. In the first subgroup, the surgical technique of acetabulum replacement is the same as in cases with arthritis due to degenerative disease. In the other subgroup, the procedure for cup implantation resembles revision arthroplasty for acetabular loosening. The options for treating defects or deformities and the implants used are identical in both situations. Therefore the results should be compared with those of revision arthroplasty and not primary implantation. Scars, fibrotic changes in muscles, para-articular ossification, bone defects, residual deformities of the acetabulum, devitalized bone fragments or hindering previous implants make the surgical procedure more difficult and interfere with good results.Total hip arthroplasty carried out after acetabular fracture is technically demanding. The prerequisite for a good result is to achieve primary stability of the acetabulum. Acetabular reconstruction is based, in the first place, on replacement of the missing bony tissue, and on providing conditions for correct alignment of the acetabulum and reliable primary and early secondary osteointegration.

    "abstract": "One of the most common causes of chronic heel pain is plantar fasciitis (ocalcaneal spur?). This condition most frequently occurs in patients over the age of 40. In most cases pain can be reduced or ceased by conservativ treatment, but in some patients therapy-resistant chronic pain can also develop. In these cases surgery may provide long term solution. The aim of this prospective observational study was to analyse the effectiveness of endoscopic surgery in patients with plantar fasciitis.Between 2001-2006 83 operations were performed on 74 patients (age: 47+/-11 years) by the same surgeon. All patients underwent conservative therapy before the operation, which did not solve their pain. In 41 cases the right and in 42 cases the left foot was affected. In 11 patients both sides had to be operated on.In each case endoscopic partial plantar fasciotomy was performed as described previously, modified by us. Patients were allowed to load full body weight on the operated foot on the first postoperative day. The patients' body mass index (BMI) was also recorded. Pain was assessed by using a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0-10. Patients had been followedup 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery.Pain was significantly lower at every assessment point as compared to preoperative values (p<0.01). The average period of time during which patients became pain free (i.e.: VAS=0) was 9.6 weeks. Most patients were overweight as indicated by the BMI=32.8+/-5.9 kg/m2. All but 3 operations proved to be successful as indicated by disappearence of pain. Two patients had reoperation of whom the BMI>30 kg/m2.Patients with heel spur may benefit from operation if the conservative treatment is unsuccesful. The aim is to relieve the inflammation and irritation of the plantar aponeurosis. One alternative is endoscopic partial plantar fasciotomy. During the operation at least the two-third of the aponeurosis is released without the exstirpation of its calcificated part. As indicated by our results complaints disappeared in most cases within one month after surgery. There were only 3 complications two of which had incresed BMI, suggesting, that obesity may have an important impact on the symptoms and success of surgery. However, further studies are required to come to firm conclusion regarding BMI and plantar fasciitis.In this prospective observational study it was found that endoscopic partial fasciotomy successfully releived pain in therapy- resistant cases of plantar fasciitis.

    "abstract": "A group of 79 patients with ipsilateral fractures of the hip and femoral shaft treated with the use of a long proximal femoral nail (PFN-long) was retrospectively evaluated.From January 1998 to February 2005, 79 patients were treated surgically. The group included 42 men and 37 women at an average age of 56.6 years. In 47 patients (37 men and 10 women; average age, 38 years; range, 18-72 years) the fractures were due to a high-energy trauma. In the remaining 32 patients (six men and 25 women; average age, 77.6 years), the cause of fracture was a low-energy trauma, most frequently an ordinary fall. The fractures were categorized according to the Dousa, Bartonícek and Krbec classification. Type IV fractures, i. e., subtrochanteric fractures involving the whole upper half of the femur, were most frequent.The Synthes PFN-long is based on the PFN and partly also UFN implants. The nail is matched to femoral shaft antecurvation, and femoral neck screws have a 10 degrees anteversion. The nail is cannulated, is 10 mm thick and is available in three lengths with a distal dynamic opening.The results are based on the evaluation of 65 patients followed up for at least 12 months. At 12 months bone union was achieved in all patients; in 38 patients (58 %) it occurred by 6 months and in 59 patients (91 %) by 9 months. The outcomes were excellent in 42 (64 %), good in 18 (28 %) and satisfactory in 5 patients (8 %). Thirteen intra-operative complications (27 %) in nine patients were recorded, with the necessity of repeat surgery in four cases. Two problems were involved: incomplete reduction (nine fractures) and incorrect implant insertion (four fractures). Early complications included hematoma in the wound in five cases and one infected wound.A late complication was delayed union in two cases.The management of ipsilateral fractures of the hip and femoral shaft is still associated with a high percentage of complications, mostly due to reduction being difficult. The PFN-long is an implant combining the advantages of the short PFN and UFN systems. Our results are in agreement with the literature data on similar fractures treated with second-generation reconstruction nails and have a lower percentage of complications, even though our group had different characteristics in terms of a higher average age and nearly equal numbers of men and women.The PFN-long is a high-quality implant that increases our options of treatment. Of all the reconstruction nails, it has most advantages. The availability of only three sizes (in three lengths with one thickness) is a certain disadvantage.",

    "abstract": "Scapholunate (SL) ligament disruption frequently occurs together with distal radius fractures. If it is not diagnosed and treated, instability develops and will eventually be manifested as arthritic lesions known as scapholunate advanced collapse (SLAC) of the wrist. The aim of this study was to record the occurrence of SL ligament disruption in the patients treated conservatively for displaced fractures of the distal radius and to find out which fracture types are most often associated with injury to the SL ligament.A total of 75 patients treated conservatively for distal radius fractures in 1997-98 were included in the study. The group comprised 41 women and 34 men, with fractures of the right upper limb in 44 and fractures of the left upper limb in 31 patients. They all were at active age, i. e., between 18 and 60 years, and came for a check-up 3 years after injury. They were examined for radiographic findings of SL instability and signs of SLAC development. Radiographs obtained after injury and images taken after reduction and then after bone union were retrospectively evaluated to look for signs of SL instability. The initial fractures were categorized on the AO classification and, for each fracture type, the percent of patients with co-existent SL instability was assessed.In the group of 75 patients examined at 3 years after injury, 16 (27 %) wrists showed radiographic signs of instability, with SLAC development in 13 patients and no arthritic lesions in three. All patients with SL instability reported pain, restricted range of motion in the wrist or reduced grip strength. The distribution of instability in relation to AO fracture type, expressed as percent, was as follows: SL instability associated with type A2 fracture was found in 38 %, with type A3 fracture in 17 %, and with type B in 25 % of the patients. SL instability was associated with type C1, type C2 and type C3 in 21 %, 27 % and 8 % of the patients, respectively. In radiographs taken after reduction, signs of damage to the SL ligament were apparent in 56 % of these patients. Radiographic findings at 6 weeks after injury showed signs of SL instability in as many as 81 % of the patients.Our results show that SL instability is found in association with type A2 and type A3 fractures, in which trauma force is \"used\" to break the distal radius and subsequently, due to carpal supination, to disrupt the SL ligament. In type B1 fractures, SL disruption results from an avulsion fracture of the radial styloid process due to ulnar deviation of the wrist. The retrospective evaluation of radiographs revealed that, immediately after reduction, signs of SL instability were obvious in 56 % of the cases. At that stage the condition could have been treated by K-wire transfixation and reattachment of the SL ligament. At 6 weeks, radiographic evidence of SL ligament disruption was found in 81 % of the patients. Even at that stage repair would have been possible by either reattachment or reconstruction of the ligament. It is apparent from these results that the evaluation of radiographic findings after reduction and during follow-up should also focus on other changes in the wrist in addition to signs of bone union.Fractures of the distal radius are no longer frequent only in elderly women, as has recently been common, but they are found more and more often in active young persons. Because their bones are healthier, soft tissues are affected more frequently. Injury to the SL joint results in the development of arthritic lesions which may rapidly progress in active patients. SLAC development can be prevented by early diagnosis of soft tissue lesions on X-ray images, because these are usually apparent after reduction or at follow-up. If doubts arise, arthroscopy or another examination should be done, even though these may not be sufficiently reliable.",

They used the transplantation of autologous cultured chondrocytes in the form of a solid chondral graft.Patients with chondral lesions categorized as grades II to IV by the Anderson classification or as grades II to IV by the Berndt and Harty classification were indicated for this treatment. After preoperative MRI examination, a small sample of healthy cartilage was harvested arthroscopically from the non-weight-bearing area of the talus and was sent to the Tissue Bank in Brno for chondrocyte cultivation. After 28 to 42 days the cultured chondrocytes were formed into a solid chondral graft, implanted at the damaged site of the talar dome and fixed with fibrin glue (Tissucol).Between July 2003 and October 2005 five patients, three males and two females, were treated using this method. Their age ranged from 22 to 46 years. Follow-up was 6 to 24 months, with an average of 12.6 months, and the patients were examined by MRI at 2 weeks, 2 and 6 months and at 1 year. The clinical results were evaluated on the basis of the Mazur and Weber scoring systems.A significant improvement in clinical function of the ankle joint was achieved in three patients and the condition remained unchanged in one patient. In one patient, the surgical outcome was too recent for evaluation, but the MRI results indicated tendency to good incorporation of the graft.",

    "abstract": "According to the available sources, no case of total spondylectomy of C2 with preservation of roots, preservation of vertebral arteries and a short fixation without occipitocervical fusion has been so far described in the literature.We decided to perform a radical surgery in a man, now 27 y.o., with solitary metastasis of thyroid adenocarcinoma.In the first step, we applied the posterior surgical approach.The patient was placed prone on a standard operating table with a support of head fixed by adhesive plaster, with the upper cervical spine slightly bent forward.We made a mid-line incision, extending from the external occipital protuberance to the C7 spinous process, controlled bleeding and exposed the C0-C4 section.Subsequently, the entire posterior epistropheus was resected, including most of the pedicles and the entire articular processes for C2-C3 articulation.Both the C2 roots were preserved, however, we had to control quite a profuse bleeding from the venous plexus around the left root.During dissection, the dural sac was damaged in the region of the attachment of the left root, which was treated by suture and covered with Tissucol fibrin sealant.Screws 4.0 mm thick, were inserted into the lateral masses of the atlas after Harms and 4.0mm screws into the C3 and C4 articular processes.On both sides, the screws were connected with 3.2 mm rods, and a transverse stabilizer was then applied to fix the two sides together.Cancellous bone grafts were harvested from the iliac crest and a massive posterolateral and posterior fusion of C1-C4 was performed.The second operation was performed after 21 days.Transoral transmandible approach without tongue splitting was applied.The patient was placed supine on a standard operating table with a support of neck, the head was fixed by adhesive plaster and slightly bent back, and tracheostomy was inserted.An arched incision through the middle of the red lip was made, extending 2 cm straight caudally and arching across the chin and neck, in the midline.On the caudal end we made a transverse inverted T incision.Subsequently, we exposed and osteotomised the mandible using the midline Z-type incision.In order to identify the space between the anterior arch of C1 and the C4 vertebral body, the Synframe retractor was inserted with one blade opening the mouth by pressure on the upper teeth and two blades pressing the tongue caudally.Then an inverted U incision through the mucosa of pharynx was made to identify paravertebral muscles.Caspar retractor was used to separate the muscles and expose C1-C3 laterally, including transversal processes with vertebral arteries.No pathological changes were manifested on the skeleton.First we removed the middle portion of the C2 vertebral body where we did not find any tumour, only sclerotic remodelling.Subsequently, we reamed the lower middle portion of the anterior arch of C1, extracted the dens and cut off the alar ligaments and the apical ligament of dens.The entire dens was then removed.Then we continued on the right side, in the intact part and extracted part of C2 in the region of the atlantoaxial joint, including the rest of the pedicle, and the anterior portion of the transversal process up to the vertebral artery.The posterior part of the transversal process was carefully rotated around the artery and also removed.All parts were extremely hard, sclerotic.The same procedure was followed on the left side where we found a 7x10 mm gelatinous greyish tumour in the lateral part of C2 below the atlantoaxial joint.Other parts were again sclerotic.Liquorrhea appeared again from dissection around the C2 root on the left side, the source of which we could not clearly identify.We filled the site of the probable hole with Tissucol fibrin sealant.Between the notch in the lower part of the anterior arch of C1 and the upper end plate of the C3 vertebral body we seated a shaped SynMesh cage with sharp edges providing a very good fixation.No additional fixation was needed.Again we harvested cancellous bone grafts from the iliac crest and placed them on the sides of the cage and at the front between the anterior arch of the atlas and the C3 vertebral body.Subsequently, the muscles were approximated and the mucous tissue of the pharynx repaired.The mandible was fixed by two Miniplate System plates and supported by a dental plate.Total spondylectomy of C2 with preservation of vertebral arteries and roots stabilized only by a short fixation is an extreme surgical procedure suitable only for exceptional cases of young patients with a good bone quality.With regard to potential complications it is of vital importance to consider carefully such operation and consult the proposed therapy with the patient.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this prospective randomized study was to compare, by means of biochemical markers, the operative invasiveness of the standard total hip replacement with that of the minimally invasive anterolateral (MIS-AL) approach.Twenty-six randomly assigned patients with standard and 22 patients with MIS-AL total hip replacement were included in the study. Patients with elevated pre-operative levels of the markers evaluated or patients taking medication that might affect marker levels were not included.Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were chosen as markers of muscle damage and post-operative inflammatory changes, respectively. Blood samples were drawn before surgery (less than 24 hours) and after surgery at 24, 48 and 96 hours, which respected biological half-lives of the markers and permitted us to study their dynamics. The results were evaluated and statistically analyzed at the department of biochemistry, using the two sample t-test.Statistically significant differences between the two groups of patients were found for both markers. The average CRP values differed significantly (p < 0.05) at 48 and 96 hours post-operatively, being higher for the standard than MIS-AL total hip replacement by 28% and 44%, respectively. The average CPK values showed the most marked difference at 48 hours after surgery, when the level was higher by 62.5% in the standard than MIS-AL total hip replacement (p < 0.05).Our objective evaluation of the invasiveness of surgery in total hip replacement was based on the most frequently recommended markers for assessment of muscle tissue damage and post-operative inflammatory changes. The study was focused on the invasiveness of surgery only and neither subjective nor objective outcomes of implantation were evaluated. The use of the muscle sparing approach MIS-AL results in minimal damage to muscle tissue and, consequently, a lower degree of post-operative inflammation than is recorded in traditional hip replacement surgery.In the patients undergoing MIS-AL total hip replacement, post-operative levels of CPK and CRP were significantly lower than in the patients with standard total hip replacement. The MIS-AL technique evidently provides a more sparing approach to soft tissues.",

    "abstract": "Aseptic loosening and osteolysis are the most frequent causes of total hip or total knee arthroplasty failure. Osteolysis is induced predominantly by polyethylene particles that are produced by adhesive wear of the prosthesis. The particles trigger a complex host's reaction varying in intensity even in response to the same number of particles. These differences indicate that individual predisposition may have an important role in the pathogenesis of osteolysis. The major key mediators of wear-induced osteolysis include the cytokines RANKL, TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8. The inter-individual differences in the extent of bone destruction may therefore be related to variation in the amount and/or activity of these cytokines based on their gene polymorphism. Our pilot study suggests an association of some variants of the cytokine genes (e.g., IL1A-889) with a predisposition to development of severe osteolysis. If this assumption is confirmed by future investigations, this approach can facilitate the pre-operative identification of patients at risk of the development of severe periprosthetic osteolysis and premature failure of the implant.",

    "abstract": "The most frequent deformity of the big toe and forefoot associated with a collapse of the transverse arch of the foot is a valgus deformity. For correction of a hallux valgus, several procedures are described in the literature. A valgus deformity often develops due to a varus deviation of the first metatarsal bone when the intermetatarsal angle between the first and second metatarsals is greater than 10 degrees. When the intermetatarsal angle is larger then 10 degrees or the first ray is hypermobile, a Lapidus procedure is one of the options. The objective of this study was to evaluate the outcomes in patients with hallux valgus deformity treated by the Lapidus procedure.The group comprised 61 patients, 49 women and 12 men, with an average age of 58.3 years at the time of surgery, who were treated at our department in the period from 2002 to 2006. Fifteen patients had bilateral surgery. The results of 76 operations were evaluated. Indications for surgery were hallux valgus in 22 patients, rheumatoid arthritis in 36 and psoriatic arthritis in three patients.Access was gained on the mediodorsal side of the foot through an incision medial to the extensor hallucis longus tendon, over the first tarsometatarsal joint up to the first metatarsophalangeal joint. An arthrodesis was fixed with two Kirschner wires in eight feet and with two screws in 15 feet. Recently, the use of shape memory alloy staples (DePuy Mitek) was adopted and applied in 53 feet with good outcome. In the patients with rheumatoid arthritis the Lapidus procedure together with resection of the heads of the second and fifth metatarsals was used from the plantar approach.The evaluation was focused on the patients' satisfaction and their subjective complaints. No pain was reported on 56 (73%) forefeet, slight pain was experienced on the dorsal side in ten feet (13%) and pain in the transverse arch also in ten feet (13%). Complications included slow healing of the wound in seven feet of the patients with rheumatoid arthritis (9.2%), and infection requiring revision surgery in one patient (1.3%). Five patients (6.5%) reported persisting swelling of the foot dorsum for a period longer than 3 months. Recurrence of hallux valgus was recorded in nine feet. The average American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score, which was 48.1 points pre-operatively, improved to 89.2 points post-operatively. In one patient, bony union was very slow and was achieved at 5 months after surgery.An exact evaluation of the results of a Lapidus procedure is not always possible, particularly in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in whom foot disorders are more complex. A much discussed issue is first metatarsal hypermobility. In our group of 61 patients, this was found in 28. Of these, 18 had rheumatoid arthritis and ten had hallux valgus. The rate of pseudoarthrosis following a Lapidus procedure is reported to range from 3.3% to 9%. In our group only one patient was affected (1.3%).A correctly performed: Lapidus procedure enables us, by correcting a varus deviation of the first metatarsal, to repair valgus deformity of the big toe resulting in painless walking.",

    "abstract": "In a retrospective study, to evaluate the results of surgical treatment of hallux rigidus on the basis of clinical rating, radiographic findings and visual analogue scale (VAS).The group included 68 patients, 38 women and 30 men, treated at the orthopaedic ward of the Hospital Ceské Budejovice in the period from April 2004 to June 2007. The average age of the patients was 58.6 years (range, 34 to 79). Right and left feet were affected in 42 and 26 patients, respectively. Follow-up ranged from 3 to 30 months.Surgery was undertaken only after all means of conservative treatment had been used. Indications for each type of operation were based on the severity of disorder of the first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ), patient's age, toe's motion restriction and physical stress on the patient's big toe. In patients with moderate degenerative MTPJ disease, in 25 feet, a Moberg dorsal wedge osteotomy of the first proximal phalanx was carried out when plantar flexion was preserved; in 12 feet, a Youngswick sagittal V osteotomy was indicated when both flexion and extension were limited and the first metatarsus was long enough; in 14 cases cheilectomy alone was used. In patients with severe arthritis, the TOEFIT-PLUS modular joint replacement of th first MTPJ was used in seven, the Brandes-Keller resection arthroplasty was carried out in six and arthrodesis of the first MTPJ was performed in four. All patients were examined at 2 and 6 weeks after surgery. Those undergoing osteotomy, arthrodesis or joint replacement were X-rayed after surgery and then at 6 weeks of follow-up.The outcome of treatment was evaluated at 3 to 30 months after surgery by clinical and X-ray examination and using the VAS. The average range of MTPJ motion improved from 5 degrees to 22 degrees in dorsiflexion and from 17.5 degrees to 27 degrees in plantar flexion. Osteotomy or arthrodesis in all patients healed in correct alignment, without loosening or migration of prosthetic components. Based on the VAS (100-point scale), pain assessment was 34 preoperatively and 78 post-operatively; joint motion increased from 51 before to 82 after surgery; and ability for daily activities from 50 to 84. The overall VAS score was 42 before surgery and improved to 83 after surgery. Five patients were dissatisfied; two of them underwent repeat surgery (arthrodesis) with marked improvement and one achieved improvement by shoe modification. The rest of the group reported good or very good outcomes.Resection arthroplasty, widely used before, is now performed only in patients exerting minimal physical activity and with severe arthritic disease, because it results in loss of the big toe's supporting function. Osteotomies by Moberg or Youngswick procedures involve the use of screws (Barouk). Stable osteosynthesis allows for early post-operative rehabilitation and weight bearing in appropriate modified shoes. Dorsal wedge osteotomy is the method most frequently used in our department to the full satisfaction of our patients.TOEFIT joint replacement is indicated in elderly patients with severe degenerative disease who wish to maintain toe motion and have adequate weight bearing of the treated foot. Emphasis is placed on good post-operative rehabilitation of the joint and on co-operation with the patient.The hallux rigidus diagnosis covers several grades of degenerative disease of the first MTPJ and therefore its surgical treatment must necessarily involve more than one operative procedure. Even when an appropriate technique is used, the problems may not resolve completely. When the technique to be used is considered, good communication with the patient is necessary, because they should know the principle of treatment and an anticipated outcome of it. Our results show that the surgical treatment of hallux rigidus has good outcome if it is correctly indicated and technically well performed and completed with good post-operative care.",

    "abstract": "The Stoppa approach used in acetabular and pelvic ring fractures provides an excellent visualisation of the anterior column, quadrilateral plate and part of the posterior column for its exact reduction. Our first experience of this surgical approach and preliminary results are reported.Between April 2008 and September 2009, the Stoppa approach was used 15 times in 14 patients. This series includes 13 males and one female with an average age of 47.7 years. The mean follow-up was 6.8 months (range from 3 to 15) in 11 patients. In three patients, the post-operative period was too short for evaluation. The surgical procedure is described in detail and associated risks are rated. The Harris hip score was used for clinical evaluation. Radiographic results were assessed according to the criteria described by Matta and Pohlemann.Ten patients suffered from an isolated acetabular fracture, two displayed an acetabular fracture combined with the pelvic ring injury. An isolated pelvic ring fracture was identified in one patient. One patient sustained an acetabular and pelvic ring fracture at one side associated with a simple pelvic ring injury contra-laterally. In five cases, surgery was carried out using three approaches; two approaches were used in another five patients. In remaining five cases, an isolated Stoppa approach was used. An exact anatomical or satisfactory reconstruction of the acetabulum was achieved in 10 patients; in three patients a poor result with 5-mm displacement was found. The pelvic ring fractures were anatomically reduced in two patients. The average Harris hip score in nine patients was 85 points (range from 70 to 95). No serious intra-operative vascular or nerve damage was detected, deep wound infection was revealed in one case.The Stoppa approach makes the surgery of the anterior column and quadrilateral plate easier. It can be combined with other surgical techniques, usually with an approach using an \"iliac window\" over the iliac crest or with a Kocher-Langenbeck's approach. Indications for this type of surgery include acetabular fractures, combined acetabular and pelvic ring fractures and pelvic ring fractures without an injury to the acetabulum as well. Compared to the conventional ilioinguinal approach, the Stoppa approach is less extensive and does not endanger integrity of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. It facilitates the treatment of fractures in the posterior part of the quadrilateral plate because the visual control of reduction allows us to restore anatomical conditions. Some technical problems may occur if the screws inserted from the posterior approach into the fracture line of the inner acetabular surface, in order to stabilise the posterior column, interfere with an exact reduction. The use of a narrow plate for stabilisation of comminuted fractures of the quadrilateral plate may create problems as well.The Stoppa approach changes the conditions for treatment of acetabular and pelvic ring fractures fundamentally. It affords an excellent visualisation of the anterior column and quadrilateral plate and allows for an exact reduction and stable fixation of their fractures. In combination with other approaches it permits anatomic reconstruction of the most serious fractures of the acetabulum and pelvic ring.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate our experience with the use of a retrograde nail locked in the sagittal plane for tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis indicated in severe post-traumatic arthritis of the ankle.Twenty patients, 16 men and four women at an average age of 58.7 years (range, 23 to 72) were evaluated. All patients had severe post-traumatic changes in the talocrural and talocalcaneal joints. Five patients also had an equinus deformity. In two patients arthrodesis followed the treatment of purulent arthritis of the talocrural joint. A local fasciocutaneous flap was used for soft tissue reconstruction in three patients. All patients were operated on using the standard surgical technique. METHODS With the patient in a supine position, reamed by hand with the use of a driving rod, a straight retrograde AAN Orthofix nail was inserted through the heel bone and talus into the distal tibia and locked in these bones in the sagittal plane.No complications such as injury to the neurovascular plexus or pseudoarthrosis were recorded. Four patients showed a reaction to the proximal locking screw on the proximal tibial surface, which was treated by earlier screw removal under topical anaesthesia. Due to infectious complications, the nail had to be removed prematurely in one patient. The average Foot Function Index was 12 points (range, 10 to 15) and the average ankle-hindfoot score was 67.6 points (range, 59 to 84). Thirteen patients (65 %) were not limited in their daily activities or recreational sports, six (30 %) experienced pain in sports but not daily activities and one patient (5 %) reported pain even when walking. All fusions healed in the correct position within 18 weeks.Tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis is not a frequent surgical procedure in either trauma surgery or orthopaedics. For this complicated procedure, rather than intramedullary nails, internal fixation with screws or plates or external fixation are preferred. The high rate of bony healing can be explained by maintenance of exact nail locking in the sagittal plane. The antero- posterior approach provides a more secure locking in the bone and assists in neutralizing sagittal forces at the site of arthrodesis. The use of reamed interlocking nails can therefore be accepted not only for treatment of long-bone fractures, but also for treating pseudoarthrosis and in complicated or failed arthrodesis.Patients' satisfaction is the primary goal we strive to achieve in severe post-traumatic conditions of the talus and foot. Repeat surgery, spongioplasty, external fixation revision for pin-tract infection, persistent pain, activity restriction and poor clinical results reduce patients' satisfaction. In our group, the rate of healed arthrodesis was high and the number of complications was low, therefore our patients' satisfaction was high.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was a retrospective evaluation of the surgical treatment of 171 fractures of the proximal femur and the femoral shaft.Between the years 1994 and 2008, 171 ipsilateral fractures were operatively treated in 169 patients with an average age of 56 years (range, 21-97 years). The group comprised 108 men and 61 women. The fracture was fixed by the long Gamma nail (Howmedica) in 18 cases, by the long PFN (Synthes) in 147 cases and by the long PFH (Medin) in three cases. In two patients with a bilateral fracture, a reconstruction nail was used on one side and a combination of DHS and condylar plate on the other. External fixation was used in a patient with severe burns. In one case the fracture was fixed by a LCP Proximal Femoral Plate. Types of fractures were evaluated on the basis of the authors' own classification of 1998. Type I (concomitant femoral neck and femoral shaft fractures) accounted for 13 %, Type II (pertrochanteric fracture and femoral shaft fracture) for 23 %, Type III (complex fracture of the proximal femur extending from the femoral neck base to the femoral shaft) for 21 %, Type IV (high subtrochanteric fracture extending from the tuberculum innominatum to the femoral shaft) for 40 % and Type V (Type I or II with a fracture of the distal femur) for 3 % of fractures. In 68 % of cases the injury was caused by high-energy trauma. In Types I and V it involved all the patients, in Type II 95 % of them. These fractures occurred primarily within a polytrauma or as an associated injury (91 %). Types III and IV included mainly monotrauma cases (78 %). The minimum follow-up period was 12 months (1-15 years).Of 129 fractures, 127 (98 %) healed within 12 months after the injury. In one patient, non-union healed after re-nailing 15 months after the injury. In another case, infected non-union healed 18 months after the injury. In the whole group, 14 intraoperative and 9 early postoperative complications (14 %) were encountered. In the group of 129 patients followed up minimally for 1 year, 16 late complications (12 %) were recorded. In 125 cases treated with a reconstruction nail there were 13 complications (10 %) and in four patients treated by another method, complications occurred in three cases. The highest number of complications was recorded in Type V fractures (3 of 5). Excellent results were achieved in 63 %, good in 29 %, fair in 6 % and poor results in 2 % of the patients.There is no generally accepted classification of ipsilateral fractures of the femur. Therefore, we used our own classification that proved useful in evaluation of the group of patients.We only slightly modified it in terms of the findings. Type III and type IV fractures have a number of characteristic features in common and so we decided to cover them by one type of complex fractures extending from the femoral neck base as far as the femoral shaft. There is no consensus concerning the treatment. In addition, the percentage of complications is quite high. The group was treated almost exclusively with the reconstruction nail. In 2 % we used another method of internal fixation. Our results do not differ from those reported by other authors.In case of fractures of the femoral shaft, in high-energy trauma particularly, it is necessary to check the patient for a potential proximal femur fracture. The diagnosis should be made on the basis of a radiograph of the pelvis in internal rotation and axial projection and CT scans for evaluation of the proximal femur, including 2D CT reconstructions. Prior to nailing of the femoral shaft, sciascopic examination must be made of the hip in both projections. Fixation by a reconstruction nail is a suitable method for treatment of ipsilateral fractures.We consider the risk of complications adequate to the mechanism of injury and its severity.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to determine the incidence of pressure sores and their effect on survival in patients older than 70 years who underwent surgery for hip fracture, and to identify the factors which were associated with an increased risk of pressure sores.The group comprised 269 patients (219 women and 50 men) older than 70 years who underwent surgery for proximal femoral fractures in the Trauma center between January 2003 and June 2005. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 18 months. In a prospective study we assessed relevant medical history, demographic and clinical data, pre-, intra-, and post-operative factors and the presence, location and depth of pressure sores. Statistical significance at a 5 % level of probability was determined by testing null hypotheses for qualitative and quantitative variables, using multivariate analysis adjusted for selected baseline characteristics.The average age of the patient group was 81 years (range, 70-99). Pressure ulcers developed in 92 patients (34.2 %); their presence in the post-operative period significantly reduced patient survival (p=0.037). In terms of location, pressure ulcers in the calcaneal region had a more significant effect on patient mortality (p=0.011) than those in the sacral region (p=0.130). Age was not significantly associated with pressure ulcer development (p=0.547), in contrast to male gender (p=0.007). A lower mobility score before injury was a significant risk factor (p=0.007). Co-morbidities adjusted for age and gender had a significant effect (p=0.003). The factors that did not significantly increase the risk of pressure ulcers were as follows: the patient's living environment before injury (p=0.113), AO type of fracture (p=0.653), type of anaesthesia (p=0.702), surgical procedure used (p=0.946), morbidity before injury (p=0.267) and time to surgery (p=0.180). The presence of acute complications was of boundary significance (p=0.083). DISCUSSION The study included only the patients with proximal femoral fractures who underwent surgery. It was the authors' view that, by excluding conservatively treated patients, a more homogenous group was achieved. There is only sparse information in the literature concerning the effect of pressure ulcers on reduced patient survival, and the significance of pressure ulcer location has not been evaluated at all. Similarly, the effect of pre-morbidity on pressure ulcer development has not been reported in any of the studies available. In contrast to other studies, the authors did not find age to be a risk factor for increased ulcer development. They believe that the quality and quantity of the input data (prospective data collection, large sample size, long follow-up) guarantee the validity of the results obtained in this study. The incidence of pressure sores is in agreement with the results of relevant studies involving large numbers of patients and prolonged follow-up.In patients older than 70 years undergoing surgery for hip fracture, the development of pressure ulcers had a significant effect on reduced survival, with the highest significance for ulcers in the calcaneal region. Factors significantly increasing the risk of ulcer development were male gender, morbidity before injury and pre-existing chronic complications. The presence of acute complications was of boundary significance. The study did not show any significant effect of age, pre-morbidities, time to surgery, patient's living environment before injury, fracture type, type of anaesthesia or surgical procedure used on the incidence of pressure ulcers.",

    "abstract": "The posterior tibial muscle is the key dynamic support of the medial longitudinal arch of the foot. When it fails--typically in women older than 40 years of age--progressively, the arch slowly collapses, the heel drifts into valgus, the midfoot flattens, and the forefoot gradually abducts and supinates, resulting in painful acquired pes planovalgus abductus et supinatus. Posterior tibial tendon insufficiency (PTTI) is often misdiagnosed as a chronic ankle sprain, osteoarthritis, or collapsed arch as a result of aging or obesity, and it leaves the patient debilitated. Prompt diagnosis prevents frustration for the patient and allows treatment to be started at an earlier, more easily managed stage. The diagnosis of PTTI is largely a clinical one. An increased awareness of the existence of PTTI should serve to help patients with earlier referral and treatment and by limiting the amount of disability.",

    "abstract": "Evaluation of infectious complications in patients with proximal femoral fractures treated by osteosynthesis using dynamic hip screws (DHS).The group included 501 patients with 532 DHS procedures performed in the years 1996-2010. In 31 patients osteosynthesis was carried out bilaterally.Osteosynthesis was indicated for femoral neck fracture in 18 hips and for pertrochanteric fracture in 514 hips. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy was administered within 48 hours of surgery. The occurrence of infectious complications (surface and deep wound infection), presence of infectious agents, risk factors, and the course of treatment and its outcome were investigated.Of 532 fractures treated by DHS osteosynthesis, seven were infected (1.3%) as follows: one fracture of the femoral neck with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and, of six pertrochanteric fractures, four with Staphylococcus aureus, one with Escherichia coli and one with Staphylococcus epidermidis. Surface wound infection was diagnosed in one case (0.2%) and deep infection in six cases (1.1%). Five revision DHS procedures were carried out in five patients. One or more risk factors were found in each patient with infected DHS. The treatment of infection included wound dressing and abscess drainage without reoperation in two cases, implant removal in three, and implant removal with femoral head resection and spacer insertion in two cases. Second-stage total hip arthroplasty (THA) was performed in one case. Of the seven infected fractures, five (71%) healed successfully. DISCUSSION DHS osteosynthesis is a reliable method for treating proximal femoral fractures. The 1.3% infection rate in our group is comparable with other relevant studies. This complication is serious and requires prolonged treatment but is not as devastating as an infected THA. For the treatment of infected DHS osteosynthesis, standard methods from screw removal to second-stage THA were employed.Infectious complications following osteosynthesis with dynamic hip screws are rare events in the treatment of proximal femoral fractures. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated infectious agent. Each infectious complacation was associated with one or more risk factors. Antibiotic prophylaxis is important particularly in patients at risk.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDyCervical spondylotic myelopathy is the most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction in patients over 60 years old.Symptoms often develop gradually and insidiously and are characterized by neck stiffness, arm pain, numbness and clumsiness of hands, as well as weakness of the hands and legs frequently leading to a change in mobility.Surgery is performed primarily to prevent the progression of symptoms but also with the aim of improving existing symptoms.Aim of our study was to assess the outcomes and potential complications of surgical decompression of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). MATERIAL AND METHODSProspective data was collected from 71 patients who were treated surgically for CSM over a four-year period (June 2006 to June 2010).Only patients with confirmed spondylotic cervical myelopathy were included in the study; those with an inflammatory, infectious or neoplastic etiology were excluded.The Nurick scale was used as a primary outcome measure, and the improvement in upper limb function as a secondary outcome measure.Statistical significance was assessed using the paired t-test. RESULTS34/71 (47.9%) patients had an anterior decompression, 36/71 (50.7%) patients underwent posterior surgery and one patient (1.4%) received a combined approach:The Nurick score: The mean score improved by 0.9 from 2.4 preoperatively to 1.5 postoperatively for the whole series.Three patients were able to return to work.The preoperative Nurick score showed a positive correlation with the postoperative Nurick score at one year (Pearson Coefficient = 0.85).Upper limb symptoms: Postoperatively, 24 patients were free of any upper limb involvement compared with 6 patients preoperatively.The main improvement was in patients who prior to surgery had subjective symptoms with no objective signs of weakness or muscle wasting.35/48 (72.9%) of this group showed improvement compared to 7/17 (41.2%) of patients who demonstrated objective weakness and/or wasting preoperatively.Complications: The overall rate of complications was 18.2%.There were two mortalities as a result of pneumonia (2.8%), one patient had to be transferred to the intensive care unit for cardiac failure (1.4%), fixation failure occurred in two patients (2.8%), worsening of myelopathy occurred in two patients (2.8%), C5 temporary radiculopathy presented in two patients (2.8%), superficial wound infection developed in one patient (1.4%) and three patients (4.2%) complained of severe axial pain in the postoperative period. DISCUSSIONOur results demonstrate that the greater the preoperative disability the greater the final disability is expected to be.Cord signal change, as an indicator of the pathological severity of the disease, correlates with a worse functional outcome.The degree of improvement postoperatively (i.e. the functional change) does not show a significant correlation with the initial preoperative status.It appears however, that there is a better chance of improvement in patients with no objectively detectable weakness or muscle wasting.The rate of complications encountered in this series is comparable with those in the literature, which renders them valid for quoting when considering surgical treatment for CSM.

Some authors predicted elderly individuals to be the most rapidly growing subgroup of patients currently sustaining acetabular fractures. Gold standard of treatment of acetabular fractures remains the open reduction and internal fixation. Relevant factors impeding surgical treatment include the significantly decreased bone stock and the incapability of the patients to partially weight bear following surgery. Therefore, special considerations should be performed when dealing with this patient group as surgical treatment is associated with several risks and often accompanied by poor outcomes.

    "abstract": "The aim of our study is to solve the problem of insufficient fixation of comminuted fractures of the quadrilateral plane and the iliopectineal line. These fixation problems occur while using the standard narrow 3.5 mm fixation plate applied from a modified Stoppa approach. A new plate developed by the authors--the Omega plate--fulfils the requirements.In the period 2010-2012, we performed 156 stabilisations of pelvic ring fractures and acetabular fractures. We used the modified Stoppa approach applying the standard fixation plate in 24 patients and the Omega plate in 15 patients. The patient group with the Omega plate included 10 male and five female patients with the average age of 61 years (range, 30-72). Only 11 patients were followed up, with an average period of 13.3 months, because one patient was lost to followup and three patients were shortly after surgery. The surgical technique of Omega plate application is described in detail. The clinical evaluation of post-operative results was based on the Harris Hip Score; the graphical results were rated using the Matta and Pohlemann criteria.The Stoppa approach alone was used in four patients, combination of two approaches (Stoppa and Kocher-Langenbeck approach) was used in six cases and three approaches were employed in five patients. No adverse intra- or post-operative events were recorded. Excellent or satisfactory graphical results were obtained in 12 patients and an unsatisfactory graphical outcome was recorded in three cases. In the follow-up period ranging from 8 to 22 months, 11 patients healed. Late complications included avascular femoral head necrosis in two and severe post-traumatic coxarthrosis in three patients. Due to these complications, all five patients underwent total hip arthroplasty without previous Omega plate removal at an average interval of 15 months from the primary pelvic surgery. They were not included in the follow-up evaluation. The remaining six patients had an average Harris Hip Score of 88 points (range, 81-98).The novel plate, shaped as a reverse omega letter, enables fixation of the quadrilateral area of the acetabulum through pressure of the arc of the plate against this area. Hitches, with holes for screw insertion, attached to the Omega plate in its middle part allow for fixation of fragments above the linea arcuata simply by pressure. Hitches in the ventral part provide for plate fixation to the ventral acetabular column and the superior pubic ramus. Hitches in the posterior segment of the plate facilitate insertion of a long screw in the posterior acetabular column from an additional iliac approach for stabilisation of simple acetabular fractures. The Omega plates are manufactured in several modifications.The Omega plate enables us to fix fractures of the superior pubic ramus, fractures of the anterior acetabular column, fractures of the quadrilateral acetabular plate, fractures in the iliopectineal line and simple fractures of the posterior column. A CT-defined projection of the pelvic inlet based on pre-operative CT scans allows us to choose the appropriate plate size and to shape the plate pre-operatively. After a technically well performed Stoppa approach and good fragment reduction, the application of an Omega plate is easy if our recommendations are followed. Fixation of all fragments of the anterior column and the quadrilateral plate is very stable and the Omega plate is highly resistant to secondary loss of reduction. A potential total hip arthroplasty does not require Omega plate removal.",

Of 1555 patients treated for this fracture, 125 (7%) underwent osteosynthesis. The evaluated group included 115 patients who came for examination at one-year follow-up. There were 59 (52%) women and 56 (48%) men. Dynamic hip screw (DHS) osteosynthesis with an anti-rotation screw was performed in 103 patients and lag-screw osteosynthesis involving three parallel cannulated cancellous screws was employed in 12 patients. The patients were allocated to groups according to the injury-to-surgery interval and to sub-groups on the basis of the Garden classification of femoral fracture stage.In the group of 58 patients treated within 6 h of injury, AVN developed in 10 (17%). When the type of fracture was considered, 4% of the non-displaced fractures and 30% of the displaced fractures developed AVN. The patients with Garden stage I and II (non-displaced) fractures treated within 6 h of injury had a significantly lower risk of AVN development than those with Garden stage III or IV (displaced) fractures. The group treated between 6 and 24 post-injury hours comprised 21 patients, of whom four (19%) had AVN. In non-displaced and displaced fracture sub-groups, 25% of the patients in the former and 16% in the latter had AVN. The stage of displacement had no effect on AVN development. The two groups together (patients treated by 24 h) had a significantly lower AVN incidence than the patients treated after 24 h (p = 0.0025). In this group of 36 patients, 16 had AVN (44%) and the fracture stage made no significant difference (p = 0.6985; nondisplacement sub-group, 41%; displacement sub-group, 55%).The study showed a significantly lower AVN occurrence in the patients surgically treated within 24 h of injury. In the patients treated within 6 h of injury, AVN incidence was significantly lower in the patients with non-displaced fractures, as compared with those who had displaced fractures. This was not true for the two patient groups treated later (6-24 and later than 24 h) in which the differences between AVN development after non-displaced fractures and that after displaced fractures were similar.",

    "abstract": "Radical resection of a vertebra is reserved only for specific tumors that invade the surrounding tissues and recur when not removed completely. The vertebra may be removed using a piecemeal technique or en bloc, using only two (in thoracolumbar spine) or more osteotomies (in cervical spine). We present our technique of en bloc resection of subaxial cervical vertebra for Ewing's sarcoma of C3, with preservation of all nerve roots and both vertebral arteries. To our knowledge, this surgical technique has not been reported in the English literature. The aim of this study is to describe the new technique of radical resection of subaxial cervical vertebra.A transoral biopsy of tumor tissue anterior to C2-C3 was performed in 8-year old boy, revealing a diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma. The patient was started on neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After 6 chemotherapy cycles with the VIDE regimen, the soft-tissue component completely regressed, with the only a residual deposit in C3 vertebral body. Based on further multidisciplinary meeting, an en bloc spondylectomy of C3 was recommended, preferably with preservation of nerve roots and vertebral arteries. In August 2014, prior to the planned surgery, we performed another thorough examination of the patient using plain films, CT and MRI. Neither angiography nor embolization was performed. DESCRIPTION OF SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: The first stage of the operation consisted of resection of the posterior structures. We exposed the posterior elements of C2 to C4 by the mid-line incision. The C3 arch was without pathological changes. After partial resection of the C2 inferior and C4 superior articular processes we performed bilateral osteotomy in the region of the pedicle adjacent to the arch with a chisel and removed the whole of the C3 posterior arch. Subsequently we perforated the transverse foramina close to the pedicle, using fine Kerrison rongeurs. The lateral parts around vertebral arteries were left in situ. In the next step we used instrumentation with polyaxial screws to stabilize the C2-C4 section. After 19 days we performed the second stage surgery from an anterior approach with the removal of the anterior and lateral parts of the vertebra. We made a transverse incision anterior to the sternocleidomastoid between the internal carotid artery and the trachea on the right side at the level of C3 to expose the spine. We resected C2-C3 and C3-C4 intervertebral discs and then performed osteotomy with fine Kerrison rongeurs on both sides, again, close to the vertebral body. Subsequently, the vertebral body was released and extracted en bloc. In the next step, both vertebral arteries were mobilized and shifted medially and the lateral portions of the transverse processes were released and removed en bloc. The empty space was filled with solid allograft and the C2-C4 levels were bridged by the cervical plate in 2+1+2 configuration.There were no complications during both surgeries. The follow-up CT examination 4 months after the operation revealed a clear bone fusion of C2-C4, both anteriorly between vertebral bodies and posteriorly between the arches. Clinically the patient has reached 8 month follow up and had no complaints, both he and his parents were satisfied. Physiotherapy is proceeding according to plan. The patient remains under supervision at our centre.Total en bloc resection of a subaxial cervical vertebra with preservation of neural and vascular structures has been described in the English literature only once. In 2007 was published a total en bloc resection of C5 for chordoma, preserving the above mentioned structures. Authors removed the lamina en bloc after bilateral osteotomy. Transverse foramina were perforated by the Gigli saw and removed in piecemeal fashion, including the posterior tubercle. In the next step, they removed the vertebral body and the anterior tubercle from the anterior approach. However, their treatment differs from the technique described here and does not correspond fully to the principle of en bloc resection. Our surgical technique is based on a similar principle of performing several osteotomies without the use of high speed burr, while preserving all neural and vascular structures. The difference can be particularly seen in the approach to remove lateral parts of the transverse foramen, which are surrounding the vertebral arteries. We consider it as ideal to split the cervical vertebra by smooth cuts into four parts and remove them en bloc.Total en bloc spondylectomy of a subaxial cervical vertebra with preservation of vertebral arteries and nerve roots is a radical surgery that should be used to treat only the most serious conditions. The risk of neurological deficit is outweighed by the benefits of oncological radicality. This new surgical technique has not yet been described and it is clear, that a larger cohort of patients is necessary to assess and potentially modify this technique so that it can be used more frequently in the future.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to describe a novel Omega plate and the procedure for obtaining an accurate pelvic inlet view, the mode of pre-operative plate contouring, the surgical procedure used and the evaluation of results in the first 15 patients treated using this method.In the period 2009-2011, a total of 232 patients underwent osteosynthesis for pelvic fractures. Out of them, 52 were treated by the modified Stoppa approach and 12 with the original Omega plate. Between July 2010 and January 2014, a novel 3.5-mm Omega plate was used in 12 men and 3 women. The average duration of follow-up was 8.5 months in 11 patients; four were shortly after surgery. The multi-functional Omega plate is described in detail. An exact pelvic inlet projection, named the \"computer tomography-defined (CTD) view\", was based on pre-operative CT examination. It facilitates pre-operative contouring of the plate according to a mirror image of the uninjured half of the pelvis. The surgical procedure enables us to apply the contoured plate to the correct position; the plate completes reduction, restores normal pelvic anatomy and makes operative time shorter. The radiographic evaluation of post-operative results was done using the Matta classification and functional outcome was assessed by the Harris Hip Score.Surgery using the isolated Stoppa approach was carried out in 11 patients and a procedure combining the Stoppa approach with another method was used in four patients. All operations were successfully completed, during two of them the external iliac vein was injured and treated by vascular suturing. No other vascular or nerve injury occurred. One deep wound infection successfully healed was recorded. The post-operative radiographic results were excellent or satisfactory in 12 and poor in three patients. At follow-ups of 6 to 12 months, no failure of fracture reduction or osteosynthesis was recorded in 11 patients. Neither avascular necrosis of the femoral head nor heterotopic ossification was found. One patient showed signs of post-injury arthritis at 6 months after surgery. The functional result assessed by the Harris Hip Score was excellent in seven patients, good in two (one of them with gonarthrosis), satisfactory in one patient with contralateral total hip replacement and ipsilateral gonarthrosis, and poor in one patient with hemiparesis after a stroke.Shape and size variability in CTD pelvic inlet views do not allow us to create a unified anatomically correct implant. Contouring during the operative procedure may not be accurate enough and significantly prolongs the time of surgery. Therefore, a custom-made plate for each patient seems to be an optimal method. It has been demonstrated on a group of 50 patients that CTD images of the right and left halves of the pelvis are identical in 68% and very similar (variation in length up to 5 mm and in curvature up to 3 mm) in 18%. At present plate contouring according to a mirror image of the acetabulum, which will be obtained by 3D printing, is prepared.Pre-operative contouring of an Omega plate based on a post-injury CT scan of the uninjured half of the pelvis is over 80% accurate or almost accurate. The multi-functional 3.5-mm pelvic plate Omega allows us to stabilise complicated fractures of the superior ramus of the pubic bone, anterior acetabular column or quadrilateral plate as well as fractures above the linea arcuata or uncomplicated fractures of the posterior column. The stabilisation of all fragments of the anterior column and quadrilateral plate is very firm and the Omega plate is resistant to fragment redisplacement. Also, it is its advantage that it can remain in situ if total hip arthroplasty is required later.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION While plate fixation remains the gold standard for surgical treatment for displaced mid-shaft clavicle fractures (DMCF), intramedullary fixation has emerged as a promising alternative. However, due to its more demanding technique and depending on the fracture's nature, an open reduction can be necessary. Aim of this study was to compare the outcome of open reduction versus closed reduction of DMCF using ESIN. PATIENTS AND METHODS Titanium Elastic Nail (TEN) were used to treat 40 patients undergoing minimally invasive ESIN between December 2006 and July 2009. A total of 19 patients were treated with a closed reduction and 21 patients required open reduction. RESULTS Open reduction increases operative time and fluoroscopy time significantly versus closed reduction (open 80.8 ± 35.9 min; closed 30.5 ± 8.5 min). No significant differences were found regarding strength measurement (75.7 ± 22.0 N in the closed group and 74.2 ± 26.0 N in the open group), DASH score (5.1 ± 6.5 closed group vs. 5.8 ± 7.3 open group) and Constant score (87.4 ± 9 points closed group vs. 85.3 ± 7.2 points open group). No major complications were observed. CONCLUSION There was no significant difference comparing patients who were treated with an open versus a closed technique. If appropriately indicated we believe that using ESIN is an adequate and successful operative technique for DMCF. There were no significant differences in shoulder function after either procedure.",

PATIENTS AND METHODBetween January 2010 and february 2013, we retrospectively evaluated 42 children with proximal humerus fractures.Requirements for inclusion were an open epiphyseal plate and a non-pathological fracture of the proximal humerus.fractures were classified according to Salter-Harris, Neer and Horwitz.following orthopaedic examination, all of the children were consulted to child psychiatry department of our hospital.Orthopaedic examination included a detailed physical examination; the assessment of the overall shoulder functions using the Constant score.Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Text Revisions (DSM-Iv-TR) were used for psychiatric examination. RESULTS9 of the 42 children with proximal humerus fractures consulted to child psychiatry were put ADHD diagnoses (21 %).Of the remaining 33 children without ADHD diagnosis, 5 children were operated; percentage of surgery was 15%.We found statistically significant difference between the rates of ADHD diagnosed children with proximal humerus fractures and ADHD diagnoses in normal population (p<0.01).There was also statistically significant difference between operation rates of children with or without ADHD diagnosis (55 % vs. 15 %) (p<0,01). CONCLUSIONSADHD can be accepted as a risk factor for sustaining high energy trauma and rate of ADHD children who were operated was significantly more than normal children.This might be due to more displaced, open fractures or polytrauma -higher energy trauma-they sustained.Deciding on the treatment method, surgery may be treatment of choice in certain children with severely displaced, irreducable, fractures or polytrauma with accompanying ADHD due to the potential difficulties during follow up period.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive disorders are common in geriatric surgical patients We conducted a study to evaluate depression and cognitive behavior in geriatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery. This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at a university hospital in Turkey, involving 262 elderly patients who underwent orthopedic surgeries. Data were collected using The Patient Information Form, Standardized Mini-Mental Test, and Geriatric Depression Scale. The mean score of the Standardized Mini-Mental Test scale of the patients after surgery was 17.97±4.99, mean score of the Geriatric Depression Scale was 6.20±2.78. The study revealed that 85.1% (n=223) of the participants had cognitive impairment and 69.1% (n=181) depressive symptoms. Additionally, cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms increased as age, pain scores, and length of hospital stay increased. Our research also showed that individuals with a history of falls, visual/hearing impairment, malnutrition, use of assistive devices, dependence on others for daily activities, non-educated or single, individuals are more likely to experience geriatric depression and have a higher of cognitive impairment. Additionally, patients who have had hip arthroplasty, have low hemoglobin levels, or have high ASA scores are more prone to cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment was more common in patients with higher depression scores. Considering these findings, it is crucial to identify the cognitive disorders and depressive symptoms during their initial hospitalization to prevent or treat them in geriatric patients. Regular monitoring of geriatric patients in orthopedic clinics for symptoms of cognitive status and depression is recommended, and caregivers should be made aware of this issue. geriatric patients, orthopedic procedures, cognitive status, depression.",

    "abstract": "The preclinical study aimed to compare the healing of segmental bone defects treated with biodegradable hyaluronic acid and tricalcium phosphate-based hydrogel with the established autologous spongioplasty. Another aim was to evaluate the hydrogel as a scaffold for osteoinductive growth factor of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and stem cells. The study was conducted in an in vivo animal model. A standardized rabbit model of a 15 mm long segmental bone defect of left radius was used. A total of 40 animals were divided into 5 groups of 8 individuals. In the KO- (negative control) group, the created defect was left to heal spontaneously. In the KO+ (positive control) group, the defect was filled with morselized bone autograft prepared from the resected segment. In the study group A, the defect was filled with hydrogel based on hyaluronic acid derivative and tricalcium phosphate. In the study group B, the defect was filled with hydrogel based on hyaluronic acid derivative, tricalcium phosphate and bone marrow aspirate. In the study group C, the defect was filled with hydrogel based on hyaluronic acid derivative, tricalcium phosphate, bone marrow aspirate and BMP-2. Healing was assessed using radiographs at 1, 6, and 12 weeks postoperatively and histology specimens were collected at 16 weeks postoperatively. Altogether 35 rabbits survived (KO- 7, KO+ 7, A 7, B 6, C 8) until the end of the study. As concerns the radiographic assessment, the best results were achieved by the groups KO+ and C, where new bone formation across the entire width of the bone defect was clearly seen at 6 and 12 weeks and the osteotomy line was completely healed too. At 12 weeks, complete bone remodelling was observed in all animals in the group KO+, whereas in the group C, bone remodelling was fully completed in 5 animals and partially completed in 3 animals. In terms of histological assessment, however, the best results were achieved by the group C, where the bone defect was completely remodelled into lamellar bone in 7 specimens, while in 1 specimen it healed with bony callus formation. In the group KO+, the defect was healed in 4 specimens by cartilaginous callus with loci of remodelling into bony callus, in 2 specimens the bony callus was predominant with cartilaginous callus areas, and only one defect was completely remodelled into lamellar bone. Compared to autografts that manifest osteogenic, osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties, the biodegradable hyaluronic acid and tricalcium phosphate-based hydrogel has osteoconductive properties only. Thus, it was also tested in our study as a scaffold for bone marrow cells and BMP-2 osteoinductive growth factor. Thanks to its semi-liquid properties, the biodegradable hyaluronic acid and tricalcium phosphate-based hydrogel is a promising material for use in 3D printing. The preclinical study in an in vivo animal model confirmed the beneficial effect of the biodegradable hyaluronic acid and tricalcium phosphate-based hydrogel on the healing of critical-size segmental bone defects. Better healing of these defects was also confirmed for filling composed of hydrogel and BMP-2 osteoinductive growth factor. The benefit of bone marrow aspirate mixed with hydrogel was not confirmed. bone defect, non-union, rabbit, hyaluronic acid, calcium phosphate, stem cells, BMP-2, scaffold, bone healing, spongioplasty.",

    "abstract": "The annual number of spinal fusion procedures has been increasing and is well documented worldwide. The O-arm is slowly becoming the standard for transpedicular screw insertion. The accuracy and safety of this method have been confirmed by many studies. Therefore, the learning curve of this method and its use by younger surgeons is the focus of our investigation. Longer operative time and radiation exposure to the patient are its only disadvantages. Our aim was to evaluate the learning curve of neurosurgical residents receiving specialist training and to demonstrate the safety and accuracy compared to the conventional C-arm-guided screw insertion used in the surgical management of spondylolisthesis. Two groups of patients were evaluated - a retrospective cohort composed of patients with degenerative lumbar spinal instability indicated for C-arm-guided posterior transpedicular screw fixation and a prospective group of patients with the same diagnosis and surgical indication for O-arm-navigated screw insertion. In the retrospective group, the surgeons were largely experienced certified spine surgeons and neurosurgeons, whereas in the prospective group there were mainly neurosurgical residents receiving specialist training under the supervision of a certified physician. Both groups underwent a postoperative CT scan to evaluate the pedicle screw malposition using the Grade system and the anatomical plane of malposition. The operative times for both groups were recorded and for the O-arm navigated group a learning curve from the introduction of the method was generated. The values obtained were statistically analysed. A relatively favourable learning curve of the O-arm-navigation was obtained, with operative times approximating the Carm-guided group at two years after the introduction of the method. Safety of the O-arm navigation applied by less experienced surgeons was confirmed through statistically significantly higher accuracy achieved in the O-arm group at the expense of longer operative times. Also, a significantly lower number of significant Grade 2 and 3 malposition was reported in the O-arm group. The higher accuracy of transpedicular screw insertion in the navigation method has been confirmed multiple times. In our study, even in the group of less experienced surgeons. The favourable learning curve of neurological residents receiving specialist training is less documented. Time efficiency of the method and its safety when applied by younger surgeons could help make O-arm navigation the new gold standard in spine surgery. The longer operative time, the purchase price of the device, and a relatively higher radiation exposure to the patient continue to be its disadvantages. Based on the data obtained, a conclusion can be drawn that the O-arm navigation in spine surgery represents a safer and more accurate method for transpedicular fixation compared to the conventional C-arm technique, even when used by less experienced surgeons. In future, we should focus on increasing its time-efficiency. We are convinced that the navigationassisted spinal instrumentation will soon become a necessity for spine surgery centres.

The mean age was 43 (9-64) years, and the mean follow-up was 72 (19-124) months. The extensor strengths were measured according to the Medical Research Council (MRC) scoring system. Nail tip-table surface distance (NTD) was measured to evaluate extension loss, and pulp-palm distance (PPD) to evaluate thumb flexion-adduction limitation. Grip and key pinch strengths were measured and corrected regarding the dominance and compared with those of the non-operated side. Quick Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QDASH) and satisfaction scores of the patients were evaluated. Donor site morbidity was detected in 6 patients (35%). The extension strength of the index finger was found to be significantly lower than the non-operative side (p<0.05). Thumb mean NTD and PPD values were 6.8 (0-50) and 2.9 (0-20) mm, respectively. The index finger mean NTD was 0.6 (0-10) mm. The grip strength was 86% (43%-100%) and the pinch strength was 82% (31-100%) of the expected strengths. Compared to the preoperative period, there was a significant decrease in the QDASH score (p <0.05). Postoperative QDASH scores of patients with donor site morbidity were significantly higher than those without (p <0.05). Although patients are generally satisfied with the EIP-EPL transfer results, the permanent morbidity rate in the index finger is high.

    "abstract": "Temporary hemiepiphyseodesis using figure-eight plates is currently one of the main surgical techniques to correct axial deformities of lower limbs in paediatric patients. Comprehensive analysis, correct indication and monitoring of treatment are the basic prerequisites for successful therapy. The aim of the study was to analyse parameters that could become an alternative to standard parameters used nowadays, namely the inserted screw angle (SA), and a new parameter - condylar ratio (CR). The study included 47 patients treated at the Department of Paediatric Surgery, Orthopaedics and Traumatology at the University Hospital in Brno between 2014 and 2021 and diagnosed with idiopathic bilateral axis deviation of lower limbs, namely genu valgum. After having met the inclusion criteria, the patients underwent a clinical check-up, and long leg radiographs were also obtained. Anthropometric parameters (age, sex, BMI, intermalleolar distance (IMD)), duration of treatment as well as radiographic parameters - mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA), mechanical medial proximal tibial angle (mMPTA), SA and CR, and their derived parameters expressing the change per unit time and defined as a rate of correction (r-mLDFA, r-mMPTA, r-SA, r-CR) were recorded. The obtained values were subsequently statistically analysed, namely by comparing the pretreatment and posttreatment values and through correlation analysis. The mean age of the population was 11.4 years, BMI 26.9 and IMD 14.1. The mean duration of treatment in the study population was 13.9 months. A significant difference was established between the pretreatment and posttreatment values of all measured radiographic parameters (p<.05). A significant correlation was identified between r-mLDFA and r-SA (p=.002), while no significant correlation was found between r-mLDFA and r-CA or between r-CA and r-SA (p=.650; p=.884). Comprehensive evaluation of the treatment of axial deformities of lower limbs and its optimization are crucial for successful therapy. In addition to the standard mechanical or even anatomical parameters assessing the axis deviation of lower limbs, the authors seek to evaluate also other parameters that may provide a new insight into the deformity or offer additional benefits such as reduced radiation exposure. Such a parameter is for instance the angle of inserted screws in the eight-figure plate system, although there is a difference in opinion among the authors. In our study, we concluded that it is the change in the screw angle that significantly correlates with the mechanical axis of the femur, and thus, under certain circumstances, can become a monitoring parameter. Contrarily, the condylar ratio is a newly introduced quantity which in our study did not show any significant correlation with the mechanical axis of the femur, although a significant change before and after therapy was observed. A significant correlation was established between the rate of change in screw angle and r-mLDFA, which may, under certain circumstances, serve as a parameter for treatment evaluation, with the advantage of reduced radiation exposure since the assessment requires one scan of the knee joints under loading only. On the other hand, though, no significant correlation was established between the CR as the newly defined parameter and r-mLDFA, which is why it can only be considered as a complementary parameter rather than a decisive one. temporary hemiepiphysiodesis, growth plate, genua valga, screw angle, correlation.",

    "abstract": "Open (incisional) biopsies have long been accepted as the gold standard in diagnosing bone and soft tissue tumors. However, the main disadvantage of this method is that it can lead to increased contamination, hematoma, infection, and pathological fracture. Compared to open biopsies, percutaneous core needle biopsies are less invasive, do not require hospitalization, have low costs and low complication rates, and there is no need for wound healing in cases that require radiotherapy. This study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of percutaneous core needle biopsy. The study included the results of 250 percutaneous core needle biopsies of 244 patients who presented at the tertiary university hospital between September 2012 - September 2022 and were diagnosed with a bone or soft tissue tumor using the percutaneous core needle biopsy method and then underwent surgical excision in the Orthopaedics and Traumatology Clinic. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic accuracy rates were calculated for the percutaneous core needle biopsy method according to the compatibility of the results. A fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous Jamshidi needle biopsy performed by an orthopedist for lesions originating from the bone has a diagnostic accuracy of 96%. CT-guided percutaneous Jamshidi needle biopsy performed by a radiologist for lesions originating from the bone has a diagnostic accuracy of 88.9%. Percutaneous Tru-cut needle biopsy performed by an orthopedist without imaging guidance for lesions originating from soft tissue has a diagnostic accuracy of 92%. USGguided percutaneous Tru-cut needle biopsy performed by a radiologist for lesions originating from soft tissue has a diagnostic accuracy of 96,7% (p<0.001). The diagnostic accuracy of open biopsies ranges from 91% to 99% in the literature. Additionally, the diagnostic accuracy of core needle biopsies in recent studies ranges from 76% to 99%. Compared to the literature, our study has shown that biopsies performed by orthopedic specialists have a high diagnostic power (96% for bone-derived lesions; 92% for soft tissue-derived lesions). Percutaneous core needle biopsy is highly effective and reliable in diagnosing bone and soft tissue tumors. Managing patients by a team using a multidisciplinary approach will increase diagnostic success. core needle biopsy, percutaneous, diagnostic accuracy, radiology guided biopsy, bone and soft tissue tumors.",

    "abstract": "Intraarticular fractures of the distal femur rank among the most severe musculoskeletal injuries. Various treatment options, such as plate osteosynthesis or retrograde nailing, can be employed. This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes and complications of intraarticular distal femoral fractures treated with retrograde femoral nail, with particular emphasis on C3 fractures. Between January 2016 and January 2023, 18 AO/33.C3 fractures were treated with a retrograde femoral nail. Of these, two were classified as 33.C1, eight as 33.C2 and eight as 33.C3. Twelve of the fractures were open. After the initial treatment and stabilizing the patient's overall condition, we proceeded with the definitive osteosynthesis. The first phase involved open reduction and fixation using individual screws to reconstruct the articular surface. The second phase consisted in retrograde nailing with correction of the length, axis and rotation of the femur. The evaluation criteria included: complication rate, number of revisions, knee range of motion, mechanical axis and length of the lower extremity, progression of gonarthrosis, pain level, need of walking support, Lysholm and Tegner Activity Score for functional outcome. Overall, we evaluated the complications and the outcomes of 12 patients (13 fractures). Of these, 8 patients experienced some kind of postoperative complications, primarily insufficient healing or nonunion, which were managed through revision surgery. Plate reosteosynthesis was used in 2 patients who were then excluded from the final clinical evaluation. No cases of deep infection or deep vein thrombosis were reported and no patient required total knee replacement. Seven AO/33.C3 fractures were individually evaluated. The average knee range of motion was nearly 0-93°, maximum flexion was 120°. On average, the lower extremity was 1.6 cm shorter and 7.3° varus to the mechanical axis. Only little progression of gonarthrosis was observed along with low levels of pain. The Lysholm Score ranged between 52 and 84 points (averaging 73.1). The mean Tegner Activity Score was 3.4. All results showed adequate improvement in 33.C2 and 33.C1 groups. The retrograde femoral nail demonstrates several advantages over the locking compression plate, particularly in biomechanical aspects. Various clinical studies have reported superior outcomes in terms of healing, complication rate, blood loss and functional outcome. Our study findings align with some of those international studies, particularly in the rate of infectious complications (0%), mean Lysholm Score (79.3 p.) and Tegner Activity Score (4.1). On the other hand, we observed a higher rate of revision surgery (53.8 %), mainly due to evaluating 33.C fractures only. The main advantage of this method lies in complete visualization, leading to better reconstruction of the articular surface coupled with excellent biomechanical properties of the intramedullary nail. Intraarticular distal femoral fractures pose significant challenges to treatment and frequently lead to permanent damage. The primary treatment goals involve achieving anatomical reposition of the articular surface, stable osteosynthesis, correction of the femoral length and axis and early rehabilitation. Our study demonstrates good clinical outcomes with a relatively low rate of complications. Patients are capable of walking without pain, achieving a good range of motion, returning to their occupations and becoming self-sufficient. Moreover, there were no infectious complications and no significant progression of gonarthrosis. retrograde femoral nail, intraarticular distal femoral fracture, functional outcome, complication rate.",

    "abstract": "Pelvic avulsion fractures in children are rare and usually associated with sports. The study aimed to evaluate the epidemiology, complications, and displacement cutoff value for surgical treatment. In a retrospective study (2007-2022), we used a group of 201 boys and 20 girls (p < 0.0001). The mean age of boys was 14.9 ± 1.7, and 14.0 ± 1.9 years for girls (p = 0.0129). Injuries included 86 anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS), 83 anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS), 28 ischial tuberosity (ITU), 13 iliac crest, nine reflected head of the rectus femoris avulsions, and two ipsilateral ASIS + AIIS avulsions. The displacement cutoff value was determined using logistic regression. Complications were assessed using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier plots. The mean incidence of avulsions was 21 per 1,000,000 children per year. The highest prevalence of osteosynthesis was in ITU (10 out of 28, 35.71%); iliac crest and reflexed head avulsions were treated conservatively. Running was related to the highest risk of ASIS, football for AIIS, and gymnastics for ITU. Most avulsions occurred in September, the fewest in July. Displacement cutoff values were calculated as 10.5 mm for ASIS, 9.5 mm for AIIS, and 14.5 mm for ITU. The most common healing complication was distraction 31 (14.0%), refracture in 2 ITU and non-union in 1 ITU; ITU complications were treated with osteosynthesis. According to the Cox regression, the following items significantly affected outcomes: fracture type (p < 0.0001), early verticalization (p = 0.0062), and initial displacement (p < 0.0001). Our study had several limitations, such as it was retrospective, there was a loss of patients from follow-up, and a lack of functional evaluations, for example, using Majeed's score modified for pediatric patients. The positives of the study included a relatively large group of patients from multiple hospitals, the use of logistic regression to determine displacement values to help differentiate between OS and conservative treatment, the inclusion of fracture incidence data, and the inclusion of patients with both surgical and conservative treatment. In the case of ASIS and AIIS avulsions, osteosynthesis can be considered for displacements ≥ 1 cm and ≥ 1.5 cm for ITU avulsions. Early verticalization was associated with a lower risk of healing complications in distraction injuries.",

    "abstract": "Inadequate treatment of displaced fractures of the navicular bone may result in malalignment, formation of non-union, accelerated development of osteoarthritis or avascular necrosis and thus a fundamental limitation of mobility and gait disturbance. The aim of our study was to evaluate the results in our group of patients undergoing surgery for navicular fractures. Our retrospective monocentric study included all surgically treated navicular fractures in patients over 18 years of age performed in our department between 2009 and 2018. A total of 18 patients met these criteria and were invited for clinical and radiographic follow-up. One patient refused to attend and two were lost to follow-up. The remaining 15 patients underwent clinical assessment, including the use of AOFAS midfoot and VAS scores, and the grade of osteoarthritis was determined using radiographs. Our final group of patients consisted of six women and nine men. The mean age of the patients at the time of surgery was 43 (21-67) years, with mean follow-up duration of 68 (18-130) months. The most common mechanism of trauma was high-energy injury occurring in nine of cases. According to the Schmid classification, six fractures were Type I and II each whereas three cases were Type III fractures. Concomitant injuries involving the foot and ankle were present in six cases. All fractures healed.Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) was performed in 14 cases. The radiographs showed the presence of osteoarthritis grade 0 or I in nine patients and osteoarthritis grades II and III in six patients. The AOFAS Midfoot scale was excellent and good in eleven cases, satisfactory in two and poor also in two cases. The average AOFAS Midfoot scale was 87.7 points. A procedure-related complication was a case of skin necrosis in a patient eventually undergoing cuneonaviculotalar arthrodesis in another hospital. Consistent with literature data, our group showed a higher incidence of concomitant injuries in the foot region. Use of two approaches was not associated with an increased risk of developing avascular necrosis. We do not recommend the use of Kirschner wires for definitive osteosynthesis although we do use them as part of staged treatment or as an additional type of fixation. Like other authors, we observed higher grades of post-traumatic osteoarthritis in the subgroup of patients with more severe injuries. Open reduction and stable osteosynthesis of navicular fracture-displacements are associated with good outcomes in most patients. The most serious consequences of these fractures are post-traumatic arthritis and pain. It is critical to search for concomitant injuries. Given the rarity of these fractures, they should be preferably treated in specialised medical centres.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to systematically review the available literature focusing on upper cervical spine injuries in children, namely the age and sex of patients, epidemiology of injuries, classifications used, diagnosis and treatment methods, neurologic deficit, concomitant injuries, and potential complications. The systematic review was elaborated in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol. The studies assessing pediatric upper cervical spine injuries were searched for in the MEDLINE database in September 2023. The studies included were published between 1991 and 2022. A total of 1354 studies were found through the database search. Subsequently, 53 articles were excluded as duplicates and 1217 due to irrelevant title or abstract. The full text of 84 studies was reviewed. Sixty-nine manuscripts failed to meet the predefined criteria. In the end, the systematic review was based on 15 studies. In the cohort of paediatric patients with upper cervical spine injuries, the girls accounted for 51.1% and boys for 48.9%. X-ray (64.9%) and CT (56.2%) were the most commonly used imaging for diagnosis, with MRI (51.5%) being the least used diagnostic method. Surgical procedure was opted for in treating more than a quarter of cases (27.6%). Most of the surviving patients were neurologically intact (69.2%), a fairly large number of patients (14.4%) died. The most common concomitant injury was craniocerebral trauma (39%) and the most common treatment complication was the instrumentation failure (11.3%). Upper cervical spine injuries are rare in children and represent a relatively heterogeneous group. The literature on this topic is mostly inconsistent. Currently, there is just a few studies dealing with pediatric upper cervical spine injuries as a whole; more often the papers focus on a single type of injury. Inconsistencies also occur in defining the age limit for the pediatric spine and in defining the upper cervical spine. For these reasons, comparing the results of individual studies can be difficult. The mean age of pediatric patients with upper cervical spine injuries was 6.7 years, with a slight predominance of girls. The most common cause of injury was traffic accidents. X-ray and CT were the most commonly used diagnostic methods and surgical therapy was opted for in treating more than a quarter of cases. More than two-thirds of the surviving patients were neurologically intact. Instrumentation failure was the most common treatment complication and craniocerebral trauma was the most common concomitant injury.",

    "abstract": "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the most commonly injured structures in distortion injuries of the knee joint. Currently, there is no consensus among the professional community regarding the basic principles and timing of ACL injury management. An analysis of several retrospective studies from the 2008-2023 period provides information on ACL preservation procedures and a comparison of these results with those of ACL reconstruction surgery using a graft. The most comprehensive information was provided by a large meta-analysis conducted by Van der List et al. in 2019, which compared 1101 patients from 13 studies who had undergone an ACL preservation surgery. Wilson et al. carried out a retrospective study of patients who underwent ACL repair with InternalBrace (Arthrex© implant system) ligament augmentation. In their meta-analysis, Van der List et al. reported the failure rate of 7-11% and the functional outcome score > 85% of maximum scores in the scoring systems used (Lysholm, KOOS, IKDC score) for the preservation procedures. Wilson et al. in their retrospective study reported the failure rate of 10.4% and the functional outcome > 87% of maximum scores in the scoring systems used. These values are consistent with similar outcomes reported in patients undergoing ACL reconstruction surgery using a graft. According to the available literature, the primary ACL refixation with InternalBrace augmentation for proximal ruptures appears to be a safe technique with satisfactory outcomes when properly timed and indicated. In acute proximal ruptures, this technique should be considered as an alternative to ACL reconstruction using a graft, with potential benefits of preserving the original tissue and proprioception of the ligament. A prospective randomized study which would compare these two surgical techniques is still lacking in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Isolated subtalar dislocations constitute 1% of all dislocations and are extremely rare. They frequently occur as a result of high-energy trauma. Dislocations are classified based on the direction of the dislocation, with 80% being medial. Closed reduction under anesthesia without delay is the optimal treatment method. In our case, we present an extremely rare instance of an isolated lateral subtalar dislocation resulting from a low-energy injury. Although isolated subtalar dislocations are frequently reduced with closed reduction, open reduction was necessary in our case. The structure obstructing reduction in lateral dislocations is often reported to be the tibialis posterior tendon. During open reduction, we identified and documented the tibialis posterior tendon as the obstructing structure. We have also discussed the post-reduction follow-up protocol.",

    "abstract": "This retrospective comparative study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and complication rates associated with two minimally invasive surgical techniques: extended arthroscopic debridement and 18-gauge percutaneous tenotomy. The study included 31 patients with resistant lateral epicondylitis who underwent either arthroscopic debridement (n=14) or percutaneous tenotomy (n=17) between January 2019 and June 2023. Outcomes were assessed using the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) and the Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) at preoperative, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month intervals. Additionally, a detailed cost analysis was performed to compare the economic implications of both surgical techniques. The results demonstrated significant improvements in both groups at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. However, by the 12-month follow-up, the arthroscopic group maintained stable clinical outcomes, while the percutaneous group showed a decline in MEPS and PRTEE scores, suggesting a potential regression in long-term efficacy. Despite this, the percutaneous tenotomy group benefited from a shorter procedure time, fewer complications, and a quicker return to work, making it a highly cost-effective alternative. In conclusion, while extended arthroscopic debridement offers sustained clinical benefits, particularly in long-term follow-up, 18-gauge percutaneous tenotomy emerges as a viable primary intervention due to its simplicity, low complication rate, and significant cost savings. Future studies with larger cohorts and longer follow-up periods are warranted to further elucidate the long-term effectiveness and patient satisfaction associated with these techniques.",

    "abstract": "Hip fractures in the elderly are commonly complicated by deep venous thrombosis (DVT), particularly in the preoperative phase. This retrospective study aimed to determine the preoperative incidence of DVT and identify its risk factors in older patients with hip fractures. This single-center retrospective study enrolled 278 patients (aged ≥ 60 years) with unilateral hip fracture, who underwent color Doppler ultrasonography of the lower extremity veins on the day of surgery at the Second People's Hospital Affiliated to Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine between 1st January 2015 and 31st December 2020. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, and surgical history were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors for preoperative DVT. The incidence of DVT was 15.5%, including peripheral venous thrombosis at 18.6% and central venous thrombosis at 5.4%. Univariate analysis showed no significant differences in gender, age, and type of fracture. However, delayed admission, longer time from admission to surgery, and atrial fibrillation were significant risk factors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified delayed admission (OR = 2.597, 95% CI 1.275-5.290, P = .009), prolonged time from admission to surgery (OR = 1.166, 95% CI 1.034-1.314, P = .012), and atrial fibrillation (OR = 2.848, 95% CI 1.115-7.275, P = .029) as significant independent risk factors for DVT. Early admission and prompt surgery of elderly patients with hip fractures are critical to prevent the occurrence of DVT. Atrial fibrillation remains a significant risk factor that requires close attention. Prospective studies are warranted to validate these findings and optimize prophylactic strategies.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate patients' knowledge and opinions about robotic total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). In order to assess patients' knowledge and opinions about robotic THA and TKA surgery, a descriptive questionnaire consisting of a total of 17 questions assessing patients' demographic information (age, gender, education level, occupation, income level, marital status) and their knowledge and opinions about robotic surgery was designed and applied to 200 participants by face-to-face interviews. The mean age of participants was 62.6 ± 7.1 years (range: 43-82), with 53% female. Among participants, 39% were university graduates, 9% were healthcare professionals, and 61.5% had an income between 10,000-20,000 Turkish lira. 60% (n = 120) had information about robotic surgeries, primarily sourced from newspapers, TV (35%), and social media (33%). 68.3% believed robotic surgery positively impacts surgical outcomes, and 77.5% preferred robotic surgery for knee and hip procedures. Those informed via social media had a mean age of 57.6 ± 6.5 years, while those informed through patient recommendations had a mean age of 64.0 ± 6.9 years (p = 0.001). Higher education levels correlated with increased knowledge of robotic surgery (p = 0.001), as did private-sector employment and higher income (p = 0.001, p = 0.001). This study is an important step to understand the awareness and attitudes of robotic surgery among patients. There is a difference between the level of knowledge of the participants about robotic surgery and real scientific facts. Lack of knowledge and misconceptions about robotic surgery may affect patients' decision-making processes. Orthopaedic surgeons has responsibility to evaluate the new technological products in the light of strong scientific evidence when recommending to their patients. Also, media sources and social media platforms should maintain accurate information on emerging technologies.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe outcome of surgical treatment in hallux valgus is sometimes unsatisfactory for both the patient and the surgeon.The valgus position of the big toe in the metatarsophalangeal joint is associated with a deviation to varus of the first metatarsal, resulting in the space between the first and second metatarsals called the intermetatarsal (IMT) angle.In most patients the angle is between 10 and 20 degrees.These patients were indicated for scarf osteotomy as this method has been reported to achieve good outcomes.The results are compared with the relevant literature data on foot osteotomy. MATERIALOur group involved 62 scarf osteotomies carried out on 49 patients who were followed up for an average of 18 months (range, 6-36 months).Three patients underwent surgery on both feet in one stage, five had bilateral surgery in two stages.The average pre-operative IMT angle was 16 degrees (range, 9-21 degrees) and the average hallux valgus angle was 37 degrees. METHODSThe patients were indicated for surgery on the basis of subjective complains and weight-bearing radiographs.Scarf osteotomy was performed by the Barouk technique.From a signle incision in the first intermetatarsal space, the lateral articular capsule was released, adductor tendon was dissected and sesamoid bones were reduced.The first metatarsal was exposed from an incision along its medial axis, the bunion was excised and Z-osteotomy of the metatarsal was performed.The distal fragment was shifted laterally, fixed with two 3.5 mm Poldi screws, and the capsule was closed under tension with transosseal suture.If necessary, an additional procedure on the big toe phalanges or osteotomy of the other metatarsals are carried out.From the second post-operative day the patients were allowed to walk on the heel, after removal of sutures they walked wearing a special sandal and, from the third week onwards, full weight-bearing was allowed.The average hospital stay lasted 4 days.The evaluation of post-operative results was based on radiograms, subjective feelings of the patients and clinical assessment of the range of big toe motion. RESULTSOut of 62 operations carried out on 49 patients (average age, 41.5 years), 23 were performed on the right and 23 on the left foot; bilateral surgery was carried out in three patients in one stage and in five patients in two stages.Simultaneously, the Weil osteotomy was performed on six feet, Akin osteotomy of the big toe phalanges on five feet, Braggard surgery of the second toe on three feet, and scarf osteotomy of the fifth metatarsal on three feet.All feet were indicated for scarf osteotomy because of pain and, in 56 feet, also esthetic reasons were involved.The patients' subjective post-operative assessments were as follows: satisfaction with the outcome in 58 feet, pain associated with tight shoes in two feet, pain while walking in six feet, and dissatisfaction with the big toe shape in one patient.The average IMT angle of 16 degrees and hallux valgus angle of 37 degrees on the pre-operative radiograms showed improvements to 9 degrees and 18 degrees, respectively, on the post-operative X-ray.The sesamoid bones were reduced in all cases.After surgery the average range of motion was restricted as follows: plantar flexion by 7 degrees (to 23 degrees) and dorsal flexion by 6 degrees (to 54 degrees).The complications included one fracture of the head requiring osteosynthesis, one failure of fixation with repeat valgus osteotomy, three cases of insufficient correction of a valgus position that had to be treated by additional osteotomy of the first toe phalanges. DISCUSSIONOut of other types of osteotomy (Funk, Dega, spike osteotomy), outcomes similar to scarf osteotomy have been achieved only by the Austin procedure.However, in this, shifting of the distal fragment is limited and the results show that the Austin method should be preferred in deformities with an IMT angle of about 10 degrees.Scarf osteotomy in addition allows for early weight-bearing, does not produce shortening of the first metatarsal but permits its elongation and elevation by oblique osteotomy, if necessary.It can also be used for the fifth metatarsal.The drawbacks include a more complicated surgical technique and higher risk of complications; shifting of the distal fragment is also limited and, for this reason, scarf osteotomy is not effective in deformities with an IMT angle higher than 20 degrees. CONCLUSIONSScarf osteotomy is an effective procedure for a moderate valgus deformity of the big toe with an IMT angle between 10 and 20 degrees.It permits early weight-bearing of the treated extremity.It requires exact pre-operative planning and strict adherence to the operative technique.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYIn this double-blind prospective study, pain after reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) was evaluated using the visual analogue scale (VAS).Comparisons were made between patients administered an intra-articular analgesic mixture of adrenaline, morphine and bupivacaine (Marcaine) and those without it, between patients surgically treated by the BTB technique and those undergoing hamstring tendon ACL reconstruction, and between men and women undergoing the same procedure. MATERIALEighty-five randomly selected patients were allocated by five groups according to the surgery performed: 1. ACL reconstruction by the BTB technique, without administration of the analgesic mixture (20 patients); 2. hamstring tendon ACL reconstruction, without the analgesic mixture (20 patients); 3. ACL BTB technique with intra-operative, intra-articular analgesia (20 patients); 4. hamstring tendon ACL reconstruction, with intra-operative, intra-articular analgesia (20 patients), 5. ACL reconstruction using a cadaver graft, without intra-operative analgesia (5 patients). METHODSACL reconstruction was carried out, in tourniquet-induced ischemia, by one of the standard techniques mentioned above.An analgesic mixture of adrenaline (1 ml/1 mg), morphine (1 ml/10 mg) and Marcaine (0.5 %/20 ml) was administered into the joint under arthroscopic control before the procedure was terminated.In all cases, the drain was released at 30 min.after the end of surgery.The limb was immobilized in a brace and the joint was cooled with ice.When requested, intramuscular analgesics (Dolmina and Dipidolor) were given.VAS pain scores were recorded at 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h after surgery.The range was from 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum pain) scores.In addition, the amount of intramuscular analgesics and the time of their administration after surgery were noted. RESULTSVAS pain scores were lowest in the patients with ACL reconstruction by cadaver BTB grafting, the highest scores were reported by the patients with autologous BTB graft reconstruction.Women perceived the operation as more painful than men.When the intra-operative analgesic mixture was used, the amount of post-operative opiate analgesics was reduced by 29 % and 46 % in group 3 and group 4 patients, respectively, and in group 3 its administration was postponed (first administration after an interval 1.7-times longer than in group 4).The number of patients not requiring any opiate drugs increased markedly in both these groups.Intra-operative analgesia resulted in only a slight decrease in VAS pain scores, more in group 3 than group 4. DISCUSSIONSeveral analgesics are used for intra-articular administration in order to alleviate post-operative pain.The most frequently used drugs include bupivacaine, morphine or epinephrine, but their mixtures are more effective than any of the drug administered alone.The most apparent evidence of the effect was the reduced amount of opiate drugs required after surgery, which was significant in all patients treated with intra-articular analgesia (groups 3 and 4) and particularly in men.However, VAS pain scores in the two groups decreased only slightly.Since maximum pain is experienced at the graft donor site, the effect of the evaluated mixture is regarded as complementary and multi-modal analgesic therapy is recommended. CONCLUSIONSThe use of intra-articular analgesia has a significant effect on the reduction of opiate amounts administered to patients during the 24-hour post-operative period after ACL reconstruction, regardless of the surgical technique used.These patients also reported slightly lower perception of pain, as assessed by the VAS pain score.The effect was higher in men than in women.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the results of treatment in patients with infected fractures or chronic osteomyelitis in the tibial and ankle regions by radical debridement of skeletal and soft tissues and coverage of the defect, using free flap transfer or muscle flap transposition.Between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2004, 26 patients were treated by this method; 13 had infected tibial or ankle fractures and 13 showed osteomyelitis of the tibia. All patients, in the case of failure, would have been indicated for below-knee amputation. The group comprised six women and 20 men at an average age of 46 years (range, 10 to 67 years).In this retrospective study, the following data were recorded: type of injury (multiple trauma, combined trauma, single trauma), fracture type according to the AO classification, grade of injury in open fractures by the Gustillo and Anderson classification, number of previous operations in patients with infected fractures, microbiological findings in all patients before defect coverage with a flap, interval between the injury and flap coverage, number of post-operative complications, number of subsequent operations, period of relief for the treated limb, actual weight-bearing of the limb, patient's satisfaction with the therapy.Since one patient died of heart attack during follow-up, 25 patients (5 women and 20 men) were included in the final evaluation. The average follow-up was 27 months (range, 15 to 49 months). The healing of infection and union of bone were recorded in 21 patients (84 %). Healing with pseudoarthrosis development occurred in three patients (12 %). One patient (4 %) had to undergo leg amputation due to persistent secretion. The duration of treatment before coverage of the defect was on average 10 weeks (range, 4 weeks to 6 months) in the patients with infected fractures, and 9 years (range, 2 to 20 years) in the patients with osteomyelitis. Post-operative complications were recorded in seven patients (27 %). Impaired vascularization of the flap in the early post-operative period was found in two patients (8 %). In two patients (8 %) residual infected tissue under the flap resulted in purulent secretion. In three patients (12 %), at the time of evaluation, the lower extremity could not bear weight due to non-union of fractured bone.The use of free or transposition muscle is regarded as the optimal method for the treatment of extensive defects of soft tissues in limb traumatology. The advantages include: good quality coverage of the defect; ability of vascularized flap tissue to transport antibiotic to the defect area; long-term improved perfusion in the fracture region is important for fracture healing.The treatment of infected tibial and malleolar fractures by debridement and subsequent coverage of soft tissue defects, using muscle flap transfer, permits elimination of infection in most of the patients, but often requires subsequent surgery in order to provide biological stimulation for healing of defective fractures. Treatment of osteomyelitis of the tibia by this method is demanding, but has a good prospect of healing in a period shorter than is necessary for treatment without muscle flap transfer.",

    "abstract": "The authors describe the therapeutic utilization of separated/isolated autologous growth factors in semiconservative treatment of type III injury to the ankle ligamentous complex.Between October 2004 and March 2005 a group of 11 patients, two women and nine men, aged 18 to 41 (average, 25.09) years with acute injury to the lateral ligamentous complex of the ankle were treated by plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) infiltration. On functional radiographic examination, the post-traumatic lateral opening of the tibiotalar intraarticular space was 17.45 degrees (range, 12.0-30.0; s = 5.68).The injured patients were clinically examined and standard forced inversion radiographs were made using topical anesthesia. Autologous PRGF activated with calcium chloride was used to infiltrate the injured tissues. The treatment was followed by immobilization of the joint and its subsequent rehabilitation. Clinical examination of injured tissues was carried out at 4 and 6 weeks of follow-up, using stability assessment tests and functional radiography of the ankle. Physical therapy included standard procedures, but faster regeneration of the soft tissues allowed for more exercises.The average time of healing was 5.18 weeks. Five patients showed no signs of instability at 4 weeks after therapy and could return to their previous sports activities. One patient had lateral ankle instability at 5 weeks and therefore the therapy continued with prolonged immobilization and then rehabilitation at a slower pace. The average lateral opening of the tibiotalar intra-articular space at 4 or 6 follow-up weeks was 4.73 degrees (range, 3.0 - 7.0; s = 1.19). At 6 weeks after therapy, 90.9% of the patients resumed their full sports activities.Ankle distortion with swelling, hematoma and pain, but with no radiographic findings of ligament lesions, is usually treated conservatively by ankle immobilization and early rehabilitation. When an injury to the fibular ankle ligaments occurs (i.e., opening of the tibiotalar intra-articular space laterally by more than 10 degrees), surgery and reconstruction of the injured tissues is indicated. An alternative treatment of acute injury to the ligamentous ankle complex includes application of growth factors into the injured tissues. The presence of growth factors facilitates the healing and remodeling of soft tissues and regenaration may begin before leukocytes infiltrate the affected site. At a relatively low level of interleukins, the inflammatory phase of healing is suppressed, pain is reduced and the process of reparation and regenaration is accelerated.The use of bioinductive properties of growth factors is one of the options for treating injuries to the ligamentous complex of the ankle. It can be used alternatively to conventional surgery or as an adjunct accelerating and improving the healing of traumatic lesions and postoperative conditions.",

    "abstract": "To analyse risk factors for the development of prosthetic infection after total joint arthroplasty in our group of patients, and to contribute to the understanding of conditions leading to infection and, consequently, to its eliminations.We assessed a group of 196 patients who were treated for deep infection of total hip or knee arthroplasty at our department between 1990 and 2006. The group was compared with a group of 400 randomly selected patients who, in the same period, underwent total hip or knee arthroplasty and were free from infectious complications.Several factors considered to be associated with a potential risk for the development of prosthetic infection were selected and the frequency of their occurrence in the two groups (infected and non-infected) was assessed. When the rate o its occurrence in the infected group was higher than five-times that in the non-infected group, the factor was regarded as significant. When its occurrence was less frequent, the factor was considered less important for the development of prosthesis infection.The following factors were shown to be significant (the figure in brackets denotes the difference in frequency between the infected and the non-infected group): * Body mass index lower than 20 (6.5) or higher than 60 (5.1) * Diabetes mellitus on insulin therapy (5.3) * Chronic renal insufficiency in the patient's medical history (5.6) * Urinary tract infection in the patient's history (7.8) * Immunological deficiency in the patient's history (6.1) * Alcohol abuse (8.2) and serious psychiatric disease (5.1) in the patient's history * Surgery involving post-traumatic or traumatic tissues (6.3) * Presence of erysipelas (28.6) and varicose ulcer (8.8) on the leg operated on * Presence of osteomyelitis and articular infection in the region of implantation In each patient, accumulation of factors was assessed and it appeared that when any three (or more) factors investigated were found in a patient, the probability of prosthesis infection increased 16-times; when two (or more) significant factors were present, the probability of infection development was 14-times higher.We compared these results with the relevant literature data, and the majority of them were in agreement with the other authors. In contrast to the published information, we found a higher occurrence of psychiatric disorders in the infected group. Of all the factors investigated, the presence of erysipelas appeared to be most significant, with a frequency 28.6-fold higher in the infected than the non-infected group. References to this risk factor were rare in the literature.We recommend a thorough evaluation of risk factors in the patients planned to undergo total arthroplasty, assessment of factor significance and accumulation, and careful consideration of all pros and cons in patients at high risk of infection development.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe aim of the study was to make a basic analysis of the patients treated for pelvic fractures in the year 2007 at 14 institutions in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. MATERIAL AND METHODSThe group investigated consisted of 474 patients treated in 2007.In a one-year prospective descriptive study, patients' data were recorded according to a unified protocol.They included age, gender, mechanism of injury, fracture type, associated injuries, method of treatment, post-operative complications, length of hospital stay, injury/surgery-to-standing time and number of deaths during primary hospitalization.The χ 2 test of independence in a contingency table was used to compare categorical data.The level of significance for the test was set at 5%. RESULTSThe group comprised 192 women and 282 men with an average age of 45.9 years (range, 15 to 95).In men, the frequency of pelvic fractures was significantly higher (p<0.001),because men significantly outnumbered women in the largest middle-age categories (30 to 59 years).Pelvic fractures were significantly higher only in women over 80 years of age.The most frequent cause of injury was a road traffic accident (237 patients, 50%).Significantly more men than women were injured in motorbike accidents (p=0.015),due to a fall from height (p=0.001) or by a falling object (p=0.040).Women more frequently suffered injury as a result of a suicidal attempt by jumping (p=0.051) or a simple fall (p<0.001).Type A2.2 fractures (115 patients, 24%; average age, 51.8 years) and type B2.1 (77 patients, 16%; average age, 43.5 years) were most frequent.In 248 patients (52%), a pelvic fracture was part of multiple trauma.These patients had an average ISS of 30 points.Conservative treatment was used in 287 patients (61%).In 71 patients, skeletal traction (30 patients, 6%), C-clamp (19 patients, 4%) or external fixation (22 patients, 5%) was temporarily applied during the primary treatment.Surgery was carried out in 187 patients (39%).The average operative time was 114 minutes (range, 45 to 315)Post-operative complications were recorded in 58 patients (30% of the surgically treated).The most frequent local complication was wound infection (11 patients, 6%).The average hospital stay was 27 days (range, 2 to 266); 181 patients (38%) required care at an anaesthesia and acute care department for an average of 14 days (range, 1 to 127).The injury/surgery-to-standing time was 30 days on average (range, 2 to 118 days).Twenty-six patients; nine women and 17 men (5%), died during primary hospitalization.Their average age was 62.5 years (74.1 years in women and 56.4 years in men).Práce vznikla za podpory rozvojového programu Ministerstva školství ČR 237388 \"Vytvoření otevřeného multimediálního edukačního centra pro integraci výuky v rámci problem-based learning curricula pánve a pánevních orgánů\" a grantu Interní grantové agentury Ministerstva zdravotnictví ND 9971-3 \"Poruchy mikčních, sexuálních a defekačních funkcí u žen v aktivním věku po zlomenině pánve\".",

    "abstract": "In this retrospective study we analyse the methods of Monteggia lesion (ML) treatment in children used in our department. Based on the results we propose several general principals for the therapy of this complex injury to the forearm in agrowing skeleton.The group included patients with the diagnosis of acute ML treated at our department in the 2003-2007 period. No patients in whom therapy was started later than two weeks after injury were included.We assessed injuries according to the Bado classification system modified by Olney for young age, and also by the system based on ML stability assessment previously published by us.We evaluated the type of ulnar fracture and lesions affecting the radio-humero-ulnar joint, and the therapeutic method used. The treatment outcome was evaluated by the criteria proposed by Letts et al. for the elbow joint in children (minimal follow-up of one year). RESULTS In the five-year period, we treated 36 children with acute ML. The most frequent were patients with Bado type I equivalent lesion (61 %) and those with unstable ML (53 %).We treated 39 % of the patients conservatively and 61% by osteo-synthesis. The ;osteosynthesis of one bone was performed in 30 % (radius, 11 % ulna, 19 %) and of both bones in 31 % of the cases. The outcome assessed by the Letts score was excellent in 80 %, good in 17 % of the patients and poor in only one patient (3 %).There is general consensus in the literature that childhood ML, if early and correctly diagnosed and correctly treated, has a good prognosis in most of the cases, in contrast to adult ML. However, the views on therapy vary from closed reduction under general anaesthesia to routine surgical exploration of the radio-humero-ulnar joint with open reduction of dislocation of the radial head and temporary radio-humeral arthrodesis. However, a unified therapeutic approach to an immature skeleton has not been proposed yet.In the treatment of a growing skeleton, the reduction and stabilisation of an ulnar fracture is of primary concern. Only then is the management of injury to the radio-humero-ulnar joint reasonable. Any ML should always be considered on the whole. In most cases, a stable lesion is indicated for conservative treatment and an unstable one for surgical stabilisation. Apotentially unstable lesion should first be managed conservatively and, if this fails, by surgical stabilisation.",

The failure mechanisms leading to revision remain an issue of constant debate. The purpose of this study was to analyze the mid-term survival of primary total knee arthroplasties as well as to evaluate complications and failure mechanisms in patients with posttraumatic knee osteoarthritis. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective study included 79 patients with an average age of 59 years at the time of primary total knee arthroplasty. A functional and radiographic assessment was obtained during outpatient clinical follow-up at 3 and 12 months postoperatively and yearly intervals after that. Survival rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analyses. The mean postoperative follow-up was 69 months. RESULTS At 69 month the revision-free survival rate was 88.6%. In nine cases (11.4%) a revision procedure was performed. The leading cause of revision was a periprosthetic infection (n = 6, 66.6%). An age of fewer than 55 years at the time of total knee arthroplasty had a significant influence on implant survival (p = 0.018) with superior survival in favor of the older patient population. At most recent follow-up, a mean Knee Society Score of 82 points and an average Function Score of 77 points were observed. CONCLUSIONS Periprosthetic joint infection is the primary failure mechanism leading to a revision in patients with total knee arthroplasty for posttraumatic osteoarthritis. Apart from the increased infection rate, total knee arthroplasties in patients with posttraumatic osteoarthritis revealed results that were comparable to patients with primary osteoarthritis.

    "abstract": "To evaluate the effect of acromial morphology, as assessed on radiographs, on rotator cuff tears.A total of 200 patients surgically treated for shoulder disorders were enrolled. All were older than 40 years and had good quality shoulder radiographs. Two groups were composed: First, a clinical model group of 136 patients to be investigated for three parameters of rotator cuff injury that was divided into two subgroups. One included 68 patients, with an average age of 53.5 years, in whom surgery revealed no injury to the rotator cuff; the other subgroup of 68 patients, with an average age of 58 years, had a ruptured supraspinatus tendon. Subsequently, a control group of 64 patients (32 with rotator cuff injury and 32 without it) was used to verify the results of the model group.Three parameters describing the acromion, i.e., acromion index (AI), lateral acromion angle and acromial slope, were measured on standard radiographs. Tangential antero-posterior and scapular \"Y\" (supraspinatus outlet) views were taken, the images were digitalised and evaluated using a TomoCon 3.0 Viewer programme, and the results of the two groups were statistically analysed and compared.The difference between the patients with rotator cuff injury and those without it was best shown, in both groups, by significant differences in the acromion index. This was true for both the men and women. The AI values for the patients with rotator cuff injury were 0.66 and 0.65 in the model and control groups, respectively. The same AI value of 0.76 was found for uninjured rotator cuffs in both groups. The two other parameters investigated did not appear to be of any significant validity for assessment of rotator cuff tears.The aetiology of injury to the rotator cuff has not been fully understood yet but, undoubtedly, the causes will be many. The shape of the acromion is regarded as one of the important factors. We agree with Nyffeler et al. that a lateral extension of the acromion is most often associated with rotator cuff tears and that the acromion index proposed by these authors is a good parameter to assess this morphological change.A lateral extension of the acromion plays an important role in the aetiology of degenerative tears of the supraspinatus tendon. The acromion index appears to be the best instrument for assessing this morphological change.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective review of all periprosthetic fractures following knee arthroplasty which have been surgically treated at our institution between January 2005 and January 2012 was conducted. Beside epidemiologic data, type of surgery and postoperative complications were recorded. The functional outcome was assessed using range of motion, Knee Society Score and VAS to evaluate pain. Quality of life was evaluated using SF-36 and WOMAC. Furthermore patients mobility and comorbidities were analysed. RESULTS 25 (mean age 76 ± 8 years; m:w 5:20) patients were included. The overall complication rate was 24%. Mean KSS knee score was 73 ± 19 and a function score was 41 ± 36. Range of motion revealed 95° ± 24° (active) and 98° ± 16° (passive). The total SF-36 scored a mean of 41 ± 6 and 29 ± 19 in average considering the WOMAC index (pain: 19 ± 20; stiffness: 23 ± 27; daily: 47 ± 29). 20% were able to mobilise without help as opposed to 80% that were in need for assistance. Our analysis revealed no influence of the final outcome as a function of fracture type or type of treatment. Multiple regression analysis could not reveal significant influence of the comorbidities. CONCLUSION Periprosthetic fractures following knee arthroplasty are accompanied by a significant decrease of the knee function and quality of life as well as high complication rates. Since patient's quality of life apparently depends on the functional outcome, future efforts should aim to improve these parameters.

RESULTSno statistically significant difference was found in pre-operative values between the two groups.Post-operatively, there were no significant differences in the occurrence of complete graft failure (p=0.0755;DB group, n=0; SB group, n=3), rangeof-motion deficit (p=0.2277-0.9788)or return to pre-operative sports activity (p=0.2322).In the DB group, side-to-side anterior tibial shifts at a pressure of 124 n (medians=1.3 mm and 2.1 mm for DB and SB groups, respectively; p=0.0007) and at a pressure of 250 n (DB group =2.1 mm; SB group = 3.1 mm; p<0.0001) were significantly different from the corresponding values in the SB group.Positive results for the pivot shift test (PST) were significantly less frequent in the DB than the SB group (Chi-square test =0.0112).The SB group patients had a 2.9-times (odds ratio, 2.8704) higher risk of positive postoperative PST results than the DB group patients.In both groups, a comparison of pre-and post-operative criteria showed significant improvement in both the subjective and the objective results. DISCUSSIOnThe results of this study, in accordance with other authors' conclusions, suggest that the double-bundle technique provides better control over rotational and anterior knee laxity and therefore restores knee biomechanics better.However, other literature data do not confirm any significantly better outcomes of this method.Since only short-term results have been obtained so far, the study will continue because only the long-term results can provide conclusive evidence of an advantage of one technique over the other. COnCLUSIOnSOur study showed significantly better restoration of knee rotational and anterior laxity in the patients undergoing anatomical reconstruction of the ACL by the double-bundle technique.The other evaluated criteria did not differ in relation to the technique used.",

Regarding the primary TKA there are no valid data concerning the ideal point of time for removal. The objective of this prospective randomized study was to investigate which drainage procedure should be given preference with regard to wound healing, blood loss, development of intraarticular hematomas and early postoperative function.We documented the ROM, the knee circumference at the upper patellar pole preoperatively and on days 2, 4 and 6 postoperatively. The blood volume and loss was calculated. As surrogate parameter for wound healing we counted the amount of days until no residual secretion was observed via the wound/drainage site.The results of our investigation do not show any significant difference with regard to the mentioned parameters.In our investigation, we were unable to find any significant advantage of intraarticular drainage for 48 hours over 24 hours after primary total knee arthroplasty. After uncomplicated total knee arthroplasty we recommend removing drainage after 24 hours.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to analyse causes of impaired bone healing in femoral fractures and to present options of their management.This is a retrospective study of the data on complications prospectively collected between 2008 and 2013. The patients admitted for primary treatment at the Trauma Centre of the Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove from January 2008 to December 2013 included 1186 patients with injury severity scores (ISS) > 15 and 1340 patients with new injury severity scores (NISS) >15, all older than 16 years. With the exception of two patients, the primary treatment involved the application of an external fixator as part of damage control surgery. Definitive surgery, regardless of the site of fracture, was performed using unreamed femoral nails (UFN) in 51, distal femoral nails (DFN) in 33, plates in 26, long proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA-long) in 14 and nails combined with dynamic hip screw (DHS) plates in five fractures. The analysis revealed both mechanical and biological causes of poor bone healing.Of the 124 patients whose multiple injuries included a fracture of the femur, 11 died within 24 hours in spite of intensive resuscitation. In the remaining 113 patients there were 16 bilateral fractures, 20 fractures of the proximal femur (extraarticular), 72 diaphyseal femur fractures and 26 distal femur fractures. Nine patients sustained segmental femoral shaft fractures. Ten diaphyseal and 14 distal femur injuries were open fractures (13.5% and 54%, respectively). Pseudarthrosis developed in a total of 12 fractures (9.3%); six (7.2%) were diaphyseal fractures, of which three were initially open fractures, and six (21.4%) were distal femur fractures with two initially open injuries. All proximal femur fractures healed completely.The frequency of non-union femoral diaphyseal fractures in our patients treated by unreamed intra-medullary nailing is in agreement with the literature data. The frequency of non-union distal femur fractures in our group was slightly higher than is published in the literature. This can be accounted for by the characteristics of our group consisting of patients with multiple severe injuries in whom fractures are due to high-energy trauma; the overall severity of injuries negatively affects the biological potential of a human organism for bone healing.A successful outcome of femoral fracture repair is based on an understanding of the biomechanical principle, i.e., correct fracture reduction and stable osteosynthesis fitting the morphology of the fracture. Comminuted femoral fractures heal well with the use of a narrow long nail whose working length allows for even distribution of movement at a fracture line amongst the fragments and thus fracture motion load does not exceed 20%. On the other hand, short oblique and transverse fractures are examples of problematic fractures which require maximum possible stability provided by a thick nail with a short working length; this is achieved by reaming the medullary cavity or adding lag screws. In our group of patients these fractures were also the most problematic ones. Generally, nailing remains the golden standard in the management of femoral fractures.",

MATERIAL AnD METHODSA total of 30 Metha stems and 30 standard Biocontact stems implanted in the period from 2007 to 2012 were evaluated.The Metha patient group comprised 22 women and six men, with the mean age of 58.9±SD 8.7 years (43-75), mean height of 164.2±6.3 cm (156-178), mean body mass of 68.2±12 (48-91) and mean BMI of 25±3.9 (19-32).The Biocontact group included 19 women and 11 men, with the mean age of 63.6±10.8 years (45-77), mean height of 166.6±6.6 cm (152-175), mean body mass of 77.6±13.1 (46-104) and mean BMI of 27. 6±4.3 (20-37).The evaluation was based on plain X-ray findings and clinical status assessed using the Harris hip score and 10-point visual analogue scale (vAS) for pain before surgery and at final follow-up. RESULTSIn the Metha group the mean pre-and post-operative Harris hip scores were 41.7±9.9 (28-57) and 94.4±5.1 (82-100), respectively.In the Biocontact group the values were 41.5±11.9(32-64) and 89.3±11.2(57-100), respectively.The mean vAS for low back and thigh pain improved from the pre-operative value of 7.41±2.1 (4-9) to 0.56±1.0(0-3) in the Metha group and from 7.29±2.2(4-9) to 1.64±1.8(0-5) in the Biocontact group.The post-operative results in both rating systems were significantly better (p<0.05) in the Metha than the Biocontact group patients.All stems showed radiographic evidence of good osteointegration.Stem subsidence and calcar atrophy were recorded in one patient of the Metha group.In the Biocontact group stem subsidence was found in two patients and signs of stress shielding in 14 patients. DISCUSSIOnShort hip stems have been introduced in THA implantation with the aim to restore physiological biomechanics as much as possible and to ensure good long-term functioning of the joint replacement as well as to save the proximal femoral bone tissue for potential THA re-implantation.Our results of short hip stem implantation presented in this study are compared with the results of relevant recently published literature. COnCLUSIOnSShort hip stems show adequate osteointegration without need for diaphyseal fixation and allow for more natural weightbearing distribution in the proximal femur.The short-and mid-term clinical results are better than with the use of conventional cementless stems.They can be recommended as an optimal choice for use in younger patients with good bone quality who are expected to require THA re-implantation.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYTotal joint replacement is one of the options in surgical treatment of advanced ankle arthritis.It allows the ankle to remain mobile but, unfortunately, it does not provide the same longevity as total knee or hip replacements.Therefore, decisions concerning the kind of treatment are very individual and depend on the clinical status and opinion of each patient. MATERIAL AND METHODSA total of 132 total ankle replacements were carried out in the period from 2004 to 2015.The prostheses used included the Ankle Evolutive System (AES) in 52 patients, Mobility Total Ankle System (DePuy) in 24 patients and, recently, Rebalance Total Ankle Replacement implant in 53 patients.Three patients allergic to metal received the Taric prosthesis.Revision arthroplasty using the Hintegra prosthesis was carried out in four patients.The outcome of arthroplasty was evaluated on the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scoring scale.Indications for total ankle arthroplasty included post-traumatic arthritis in 83 patients, rheumatoid arthritis in 37 and primary arthritis in 12 patients.There were 78 women and 54 men, with an average age of 55.6 years at the time of surgery. RESULTSThe average follow-up was 6.1 years (1-11 years).The average AOFAS score of the whole group increased from 33.2 before surgery to 82.5 after it.The primary indication had an important role.Arthroplasty outcomes were poorer in patients with post-traumatic arthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis or primary arthritis.In patients with post-traumatic arthritis, the average AOFAS score rose to 78.6 due to restricted motion of the ankle, and some patients continued to have pain when walking.The average AOFAS score in a total of 49 patients who had rheumatoid arthritis or primary arthritis reached a value of 86.4.Post-operative complications were recorded in ten patients (7.6%) in whom part of the wound was healing by second intention.Ossification was also a frequent complication and had to be removed in six patients (4.5%).No early infection was recorded and late infection was treated in three patients.The prosthesis had to be removed and ankle arthrodesis performed in seven patients (5.3%).All had necrosis of the talus with ankle instability.In five, the retrograde nail Medin was used and extensive defects remaining after talar necrosis were filled with massive bone grafts obtained from a bone bank.One patient required tibio-calcaneal arthrodesis with external fixator; surgery in one case involved the use of a Zimmer Trabecular Metal Ankle Fusion Spacer with retrograde nail fixation.The development of cystic radiolucencies adjacent to tibial or talar components presents another post-operative complication.It was recorded mostly in the patients after AES implantation, in whom eight of 52 (15.3%) had these findings. DISCUSSIONTotal ankle arthroplasty is a complicated surgical procedure potentially associated with various technical problems.The occurrence of complications is indirectly related to the experience of the orthopaedist performing surgery; literature data show that the number of complication decreases with an increased frequency of ankle replacements done. CONCLUSIONSTotal ankle arthroplasty, as every orthopaedic surgery, has its advantages and disadvantages.The positive aspects are pain relief and improved mobility of the ankle allowing for physiological gait.However, it shows a lower survivorship rate that the other large joint replacements.A successful outcome depends on the correct indication.The ankle should be stable, the talus without signs of necrosis and valgus or varus deviations of the ankle should not exceed 10 to 15 degrees.",

In the present study we analyzed associations between vitamin D therapy and pain, mobility, fatigue, and daily functioning in children with musculoskeletal/orthopedic conditions suffering from chronic and recurrent pain, but also diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency.Children with different musculoskeletal/orthopedic conditions and vitamin D deficiency were prescribed to receive vitamin D over 6 months. Thirty-five children (18 males; age 10.48 ± 3.87 years) completed a 6-month follow-up. Self- and parent/proxy rating scales were used to evaluate pain, movement, fatigue, and daily functioning.At a six-month follow-up assessment involving child- and parent-reported scores, worst pain intensity significantly decreased (p ≤ 0.03) after vitamin D therapy, as well as functioning problems related to pain (p ≤ 0.01). The children reported better movement and balance with less fatigue. The parents reported better functioning in everyday activities of their children.This pilot study showed that vitamin D therapy possibly reduces pain intensity and improves mobility and daily functioning in children with musculoskeletal/orthopedic disorders, chronic recurrent pain, and vitamin D deficiency. Further follow-up and randomized studies are required in order to assess the validity of clinical recommendations.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to present our first experience with and the results of treating angular deformities and length discrepancies of the lower limbs in children and adolescents using the Eight-plate system, and to compare our results with the literature data.A total of 22 patients underwent surgery for the correction of angular deformities or length discrepancies of the lower limbs in 2014. Using Eight-plates, temporary medial hemiepiphysiodesis was carried out in 13 patients with the diagnosis of genu valgum (group 1). In nine patients (group 2) the Eight-plate was used to correct milder forms of leg length discrepancy by epiphysiodesis involving the distal femur only or also the proximal tibia. The Eight-plate system consists of a plate with two or more holes and two screws. Under X-ray image intensifier guidance, the plate was inserted above the physis of the long bone through a minimally invasive approach. Pre-operative long-standing radiographs of the lower extremities were measured. Post-operatively, radiographic assessments and clinical examinations were done at 3-month intervals to monitor the effects of therapy.In group 1, the average pre-operative intermalleolar distance (IMD) measured on standing radiographs was 15.2 cm. The average lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA) of 82° before surgery increased to 90° and the average pre-operative medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA) of 95° decreased to 88° at the time of plate removal. In all group 1 patients the therapy was completed successfully at an average of 9.2 months. The mean values of changes recorded at 3-month intervals of followup were 2.1° (± 0.9°) for LDFA and 1.5° (± 0.6°) for MPTA. The therapy in group 2 (average leg length inequality, 2.1 cm) was finished and evaluated in seven patients; in two patients it remained to be completed. The average Eight-plate guided growth treatment was 12.7 months, and the average reduction in leg-length discrepancy recorded at 3-month intervals was 4.9 mm. There were no complications.All our results so far obtained are in agreement with those of the authors pursuing this topic for a longer time. Compared to the currently used Blount's staples, the Eight-plate is a growth-plate sparring method which avoids damaging the growing physis and is thus suitable for use in children under 10 years of age. It is also associated with a fewer number of complications.Our first results, although based on a short follow-up, clearly show that the Eight-plate guided growth method has several advantages; it is a great contribution to surgery and brings new options particularly for the correction of angular deformities in patients under 10 years.",

Clinical and radiological assessmentFor the definition of non-union in diaphyseal bone a careful clinical and radiological assessment is mandatory.Patients with non-union will describe pain, reduced loading capacity, neurological symptoms if callus of hypertrophic non-unions will compress nerves or even the plexus brachialis.Clinical evaluation should involve documentation of the remaining range of motion.Documentation should respect clinical presentation of the arm or forearm with potential angular deformity of the affected limb, shortening of the limb and state of the soft tissues.Assessment of the vascular potential, presence of movement on stressing the non-union site and range EtiologySeveral etiological factors are contributing to the genesis of non-union.External factors are the severity of the initial injury, comminution of fracture, soft tissue damage and conditions (open vs. closed fracture type), as well as bone loss in open fractures.Internal factors are genetic predisposition, diabetic disease, peripheral vascular disorders, cortisone therapy, mental disorders, smoking and previous skeletal injuries (8,10,19,24,27).Risk factors for the development of an infected",

MATERIAL AND METHODSA total of 36 patients that underwent first MTP joint arthroscopy between January 2014 and December 2019 were reviewed.The mean age at the time of surgery was 38.3 years (range, 14-65), with no gender predominance (19 males).All arthroscopies were performed by a single surgeon using a 2.7 mm arthroscope with a 30° viewing angle as well as other standard instruments with a diameter equal to or smaller than 3.5 mm.Postoperative results were assessed by a satisfaction questionnaire obtained during the telephone interview.For patients with sesamoid bone pathology ability to return to sports activities was also evaluated. RESULTSThe far most common indication, in even twenty-nine patients, was hallux rigidus, five patients were treated for nonunion of sesamoid bone fracture, one patient had an osteochondral defect of the first metatarsal head and one was treated due to the development of arthrofibrosis following the open corrective procedure of hallux valgus.The mean follow-up was 31.2 months.Thirty-four patients responded to the satisfaction questionnaire.Thirty patients (88.2%) were either satisfied or very satisfied with the procedure and thirty-one (91.2%) of them stated that they would undergo the same procedure again.The satisfaction rate for patients with early stages of hallux rigidus (grade 1 and 2) was 90.4%.Only one patient in this group (2.8%) required open revision surgery due to recurrence of pain and joint stiffness.All patients with nonunion of sesamoid bone fracture were very satisfied with the procedure, and three out of four patients (75%) who were also competitive athletes resumed their sports activity at the same or improved level after the arthroscopy.Regarding arthroscopy-related complications we observed four cases (11.1%) of iatrogenic injury to dorsal sensory nerves of the great toe, resulting in only one permanent sensory impairment. DISCUSSIONConsidering the high satisfaction rate and low rate of complications in our study, as well as those published in the literature, we can suggest that arthroscopy of the first MTP joint is a safe and effective procedure. CONCLUSIONSArthroscopy of the first MTP joint certainly has a place in the treatment of some pathological conditions of the first MTP joint, and in our opinion, it should be first-line surgical therapy for the initial stages of hallux rigidus and sesamoid bone pathology.",

MATERIAL AnD METHODSWe analysed 140 fractures of the acetabulum treated in our institution by different methods between 2009 and 2013.In addition to the use of Letournel´s classification, we allocated each fracture to one of six groups: 1. Sixty displaced fractures treated surgically, 2. Twenty three fractures with a displacement of more than 6 mm, 3. Eighteen slightly displaced fractures (2-3 mm in the acetabular roof or 4-5mm in other parts of the acetabulum), 4. Twenty non-displaced fractures, 5. Six pelvic fractures involving the acetabulum and 6.Thirteen fractures of old people, mostly displaced but not examined by CT.Groups 2 to 6 were treated conservatively.In all patients, demographic and epidemiologic factors were analysed in relation to the patient's group assignment.In 107 patients, hip function was assessed using the Matta clinical grading system at a minimum follow-up of 12 months (average 3.16 years).Radiological status, time of admission, start of weight-bearing after the accident, working ability, mortality and complications were also evaluated. RESULTSnon-displaced fractures were often associated with serious injury or polytrauma in 20 patients; not all of them had excellent functional outcome.(mean score, 17.25).Excluding two patients who developed avascular necrosis, fourteen slightly displaced fractures had a final score of 16.92.Sixteen patients with displaced fractures were managed conservatively due to their poor medical condition and other circumstances.Their functional outcome (mean score, 15.25) was significantly worse than that of the patients with non-displaced fractures (p = 0.02) and worse than the outcome in patients with slightly displaced fractures, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.32).no occurrence of accelerated post-traumatic arthritis was observed in these groups.The mean clinical score of 14.80 and 60% of excellent and good results were achieved in surgically treated patients.Eight of them were treated by primary hip arthroplasty and osteosynthesis.A total of 11 patients required total hip arthroplasty because of post-traumatic osteoarthritis, but only one from the group of slightly displaced fractures, all others from the group of surgically treated patients. DISCUSSIOnDisplaced fractures of the acetabulum are best treated by open reduction and internal fixation.The type of fracture and the quality of reduction influence the functional outcome.There are a few studies reporting long-term outcomes in conservatively treated acetabular fractures.Although conservative treatment continues to be the mainstay of treatment in most centres in the developing countries, it is obvious that not all of acetabular fractures can or must be treated surgically or identically.We found that, in many cases, surgery was too dangerous for the patient and his/her medical condition or that the result of surgery was doubtful, mostly because of a late presentation.In some cases, primary hip arthroplasty is a solution.Secondary total hip replacement is technically more demanding and has a higher rate of failure. COnCLUSIOnSConservative treatment is the method of choice for the treatment of non-displaced acetabular fractures.Excellent or very good results can also be expected in slightly displaced fractures if acetabular roof involvement is minor.In displaced fractures, if the result of surgery is doubtful under various circumstances or if high-risk medical conditions are present in the patient, conservative treatment can be the method of choice with satisfying results.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY This radiographic study was focused on measuring the dimensions of pelvic bones at sites of minimally invasive screw insertion with the aim to assess the risk of damage to vascular and nervous structures. MATERIAL AND METHODS The group consisted of 77 patients (39 women and 38 men) aged between 19 and 85 years (average, 65; women, 65; men, 64) who underwent CT examination of the pelvis because of reasons other than injury. On the left side, a total of 14 dimensions of the superior pubic ramus, supraacetabular region, retroacetabular region, quadrilateral surface of the acetabulum and lateral foraminal sides of the S1 and S2 vertebral bodies were measured. The results were evaluated using descriptive statistics. RESULTS The inner antero-posterior dimension of the isthmic area of the superior pubic ramus was 8 mm or less in four women (10.3%) and 9 or 10 mm in further 14 women (35.9%). The inner cranio-caudal dimension of the superior pubic ramus was 8 mm or less in 14 women (35.9%) and 9 or 10 mm in further 16 women (41.0%). These dimensions obtained in men were as follows: 8 mm and less in three men (7.9%) (7 mm in one, 8 mm in two), and 9 or 10 mm in nine men. Sizes of the other pelvic bones were large enough to allow for safe insertion of single screws. DISCUSSION Single screws most frequently used in minimally invasive treatment of pelvic fractures are cannulated screws 7.3 mm or 6.5 mm in diameter; less frequently used are 4.5-mm cancellous screws (e.g. in treatment of avulsion injuries) or long 3.5-mm cortical \"creeping\" screws to be inserted in the superior pubic ramus. The use of \"creeping\" screws reported by several authors indicates problems associated with placement of standard screws (diameter, 7.3 mm and 6.5 mm) through the isthmus into the superior ramus. In slim high pelvises of some patients with gracile skeletons or in low pelvises of small women, the screws can protrude over the cortical margin. However, the risk of injury to nervous or vascular structures is low when the intraosseous screw is exactly inserted and it is so even in case its thread cuts into cortical bone. Neither the femoral artery nor the femoral nerve is situated too close to the superior pubic ramus. The \"corona mortis\" may potentially be jeopardised because of its contact with both the superior and posterior cortical bones of the superior ramus, but it usually follows a course more lateral to the isthmus of the ramus. CONCLUSIONS The results of the study showed that the size of the superior pubic ramus in its isthmic area may cause difficulties during insertion of cannulated screws with standard diameters (7.3 mm and 6.5 mm) in the majority of women and in some men. The risk of damage to vascular and nervous structures during screw insertion is associated only with the superior and posterior walls of the superior pubic ramus and with the area of the S2 foramen in case the correct procedure of intraosseous screw insertion is not strictly followed.retrograde pubic screw, iliosacral screw, supraacetabular screw, retrograde posterior column screw.",

    "abstract": "Hand enchondromas are benign cartilage bone tumors. Curettage represents the actual gold standard for hand enchondromas. Little has been written about the effectiveness of curettage on hand functionality. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the effectiveness of curettage and bone grafting on the hand. For each case, we compared the pre-operative and post-operative QuickDASH of the treated limb. The final functional outcome was also evaluated by calculating the affected finger's Total Active Movement (TAM). Complications and local recurrences were recorded. Forty-five cases were included in our study. Fifteen of them had a pathological fracture. The mean pre-operative QuickDASH score was 48.4. No intraoperative complications occurred. After a mean follow-up of 38.1 months, the mean QuickDASH score had decreased to 4.4, and the TAM was optimal or sub-optimal. QuickDASH and TAM were significantly better for those with pathologic fractures before surgery. Only 3 cases (7%) had postoperative complications, and 1 (2%) had a local recurrence. Our results prove the effectiveness of curettage and early rehabilitation in increasing and restoring the performances of the treated hands. Our patients experienced a significant improvement in their functionality after surgery, generally passing from a poor to an excellent status. In our cohort, those who had a pathologic fracture before surgery had slightly but significantly worse functional outcomes compared to those who did not suffer pre-operative lesions. Curettage and early postoperative rehabilitation can lead to good clinical and functional outcomes for hand enchondromas. Patients with pathologic fractures, although slightly exposed to a higher risk of sub-optimal outcomes, can also aim for good post-operative functionality. hand, chondroma, QuickDASH, fracture, rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "The study aims to evaluate the mid-term functional and subjective outcomes of treatment of the mallet finger with a bone fragment using the Ishiguro extension block pinning. The hypothesis was that this technique provides reliable and high-quality outcomes with a low complication rate. The study included 54 patients aged 7-17 years who underwent surgery at our department between 2017 and 2022. The inclusion criteria were the diagnosis of the mallet finger with a Doyle type IVa and IVb bone fragment, subluxation of the distal interphalangeal joint, fracture fragment size greater than 30% of the articular surface on lateral view radiographs, and fragment dislocation greater than 2 mm. The surgeries were performed in line with the original description of the Ishiguro technique, with reduction and closed osteosynthesis of the fragment using Kirschner wires. The surgery was followed by fixation with a plaster cast for 4 weeks on average, and rehabilitation was recommended after pin removal. The outcomes were assessed using the QuickDASH questionnaire and the Crawford criteria. The mean QuickDASH score was 3.8, the median score was 0.0. A total of 59% of patients reported no difficulty or limitations, and 37% described minimal extension deficit with no subjective difficulty. Only 4% of patients experienced more severe difficulty such as significant extension deficit or pin track infection. No secondary subluxation of the distal interphalangeal joint was observed. The results of our study are in agreement with global literature, which also shows a predominantly excellent and good effect of the treatment of mallet finger by extension block pinning. Complications were associated with delayed treatment and patient noncompliance. The studies comparing different techniques show that the extension block pinning provides outcomes comparable to those achieved by other methods, or even better. The Ishiguro extension block pinning is a reliable, technically and financially undemanding technique that provides excellent outcomes in treating the mallet finger with a bone fragment. The use of this technique is also supported by the fact that it can be performed as an outpatient surgery under local anaesthesia and by its low complication rate. Nonetheless, further research is necessary to specify more accurately the indication criteria for surgical management of Doyle IVa and IVb lesions.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to analyze the outcomes of knee arthroscopy (KA) for degenerative meniscal tears in relation to early total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in the elderly population. The study focused on identifying the factors that influence the need for TKA within seven years after previous arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM). A total of 526 patients older than 64 years who underwent APM between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015, were included in the study. The patients were divided into three groups according to age. Specific patient data were extracted from the hospital information system. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data were collected according to a predefined protocol. A total of 118 patients (22.4%) underwent TKA within seven years after KA, with a mean time to TKA of 35.5 months. Notably, up to 30% of patients required TKA within one year of their initial KA. The mean age at the time of TKA was 72.2 years. Women had a higher risk than men (24.4% vs. 19.2% men; p = 0.195). When all factors were analyzed, postoperative pain (OR = 4.17; 95% CI: 2.03-8.553), varus knee alignment (OR = 2.45; 95% CI: 1.20-5.01), and BMI (OR = 1.11; 95% CI: 0.02-1.20) were significant predictors of TKA. When considering only preoperative factors, varus alignment on radiographs (OR = 2.39; 95% CI: 1.21-4.71), a higher radiographic grade of knee osteoarthritis (OR = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.12-3.07), and BMI (OR = 1.09; 95% CI: 1.01-1.17) were the strongest predictors of early TKA. Among intraoperative/postoperative findings, the presence of medial chondropathy confirmed during KA (OR = 2.07; 95%CI: 1.52-2.83) and postoperative pain (OR = 5.02; 95% CI: 2.75-9.17) were the only significant predictors. This study highlights the risk of TKA in elderly patients undergoing APM. Previous studies have cautioned against performing this procedure in older patients, yet the optimal treatment for symptomatic knees with degenerative meniscal tears remains uncertain. Several factors may influence the progression of knee osteoarthritis in these patients, with knee biomechanics and pre-existing osteoarthritis being the most critical. Both can potentially be addressed with appropriate knee osteotomy, a procedure that has recently been shown to be effective in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Interestingly, age itself did not increase the risk of TKA in our study. In conclusion, our retrospective analysis showed that more than one-fifth of patients undergoing KA for degenerative meniscal tears may require TKA within seven years. In addition, preoperative varus knee alignment, advanced knee osteoarthritis, and higher BMI were identified as the strongest risk factors, suggesting that KA should be indicated with caution in such patients.",

A control group and an observation group were set for equal allocation of 106 patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) treated with TKA during November 2021 and November 2023 through a random number table. GA was used for the control group, and GA plus SNB-TNB was performed for the observation group. Clinical indexes, analgesic effect, joint motion range, hemodynamic indexes and safety were compared between the two groups. The observation group had decreased fentanyl dosage, patient-controlled intravenous analgesia pump pressing times, morphine dosage, extubation time, and recovery time compared with those of the control group (P<0.05). The static and dynamic Visual Analog Scale scores at different time points were lower in the observation group than in the control group (P<0.05). The observation group had higher maximum flexion degree than that of the control group at different time points (P<0.05). The incidence rate of adverse reactions in the observation group was lower than that of the control group (P<0.05). SNB-TNB can comprehensively intervene with the tissues surrounding the knee joint, and nerve block techniques are capable of intercepting harmful inputs in a targeted manner, elevating pain threshold, inhibiting signaling transmission from nerve endings, and thus terminating the pain perception ability of the cortex. Nerve block mainly depends on local anesthesia, and is helpful for lowering the additional dose of opioids and maintaining the hemodynamic stability. Compared with simple GA, GA plus SNB-TNB applied in TKA is more conducive to accelerating the recovery of patients, reducing the anesthetic dosage, enhancing the analgesic effect, with more stable hemodynamics and higher safety.",

    "abstract": "The beginnings of osteosynthesis (OS) in the Czech lands, dating back to the second half of the 19th century, are associated with the German surgeons W. Heine and C. Gussenbauer working in Prague. Development of the Czech musculoskeletal surgery began with the appointment of K. Maydl to the head of the Czech University Department of Surgery in Prague in 1891. In 1908, his pupil K. Kukula published the first \"OS manifesto\" in the Czech literature, including his own original method of fixation of diaphyseal fractures with a magnezium peg. Further development of OS of fractures came as late as in the 1920s. The first to publish his own results in a cohort of 37 patients was K. Šantrůček, followed by V. Novák. At the beginning of the 1930s, A. Jirásek presented an extensive review of the issues concerning OS of fractures based on his experience obtained from 476 operations. In 1939, J. Zahradníček published an extensive study focused on non-unions, including his own classification that was later modified by Weber and Čech. In 1941, E. Polák published the first Czech monograph dealing with nailing of femoral neck fractures. Immediately after World War II, development of intramedullary osteosynthesis took place, surprisingly first in peripheral departments. In the 1950s, osteosynthesis further progressed. Worth mentioning is the nail designed by A. Pavlík, who is known worldwide as the author of the harness used in management of DDH. Instrumental in introduction of AO principles into the clinical practice were O. Čech and F. Stryhal, who became familiar with the technique of stable OS during the 1960s. In 1972, they published an original Czech textbook of osteosynthesis, merely 9 years after the first AO textbook. In 1973, O. Čech together with B.G. Weber won worldwide recognition for their monograph Pseudarthrosen. During the 1970s, domestic production of implants was established in cooperation with S. Beznoska from Poldi Kladno. At the turn of the 1980s, operative treatment of fractures in our country reached the European level. Key words: osteosynthesis, history, operative treatment of fractures, Czech Republic.",

    "abstract": "The study evaluates the functional outcomes of the treatment of pediatric trigger digits in two centers and compares them with data from the available literature. The secondary objective is to verify the possibilities of collecting data on patients' health status through questionnaire surveys using remote communication via a web interface. Patients operated on at the Hand and Plastic Surgery Institute in Vysoké nad Jizerou (ÚCHRaPCH) and the Motol University Hospital, Department of Orthopaedics (FNM) between 2018 and 2021 were evaluated. An analysis of demographic data, affected digits, and an assessment of functional outcomes using the Quick-DASH questionnaire were performed. The data were collected through Google Forms and then statistically analyzed. The subgroups were compared using the chi-square test and two-tailed unpaired t-test and logistic regression with Firth's correction was used to compare the obtained Quick-DASH scores. A total of 124 trigger digits in 102 patients were evaluated, including 113 thumbs and 11 fingers; bilateral findings were observed in 20.6% of patients. The mean age at the time of surgery was 3.7 years. The questionnaire was completed by 57.8% of patients treated at ÚCHRaPCH and 57.9% at FNM. The median Quick-DASH score was 0.0, indicating no disability or hand function limitation. The average Quick-DASH score was 1.7. No significant differences were found between the centers in demographic parameters or achieved scores. The prevalence of a non-zero Quick-DASH score was 24%. Our results, in line with global literature, confirm that surgical release of the A1 pulley is an effective method for treating pediatric trigger thumb or fingers with minimal complications. The online questionnaire survey proved beneficial for data collection. The limitation is the low response rate and the unavailability of suitable validated questionnaires for the given age group. The relatively high risk of a non-zero Quick-DASH score may be influenced by the inappropriate choice of questionnaire given the age of the subjects. An advantage of the data collection method used is the ability to require full completion of the questionnaire before submission, thereby eliminating the need to discard incomplete questionnaires. Surgical treatment of pediatric trigger digits provides excellent outcomes, and the use of online questionnaires is suitable for health data collection. Further research is needed to validate questionnaires for pediatric age categories and subsequently to expand the concept of web-based data collection.",

    "abstract": "The knee is the most common peripheral site of osteoarthritis (KOA; knee osteoarthritis). The mainstay of non-operative treatment is education, exercise, weight reduction, and pharmacological therapy. Intra-articular hyaluronic acid (HA) injection is a non-operative treatment option. The aim of our study was to assess the most recent data on the efficacy of intra-articular administration of HA in KOA therapy and to compare it with intra-articular injections of platelet-rich plasma (PRP), corticosteroids (CS) and placebo (saline solution). The PubMed and Cochrane Library databases were searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) conducted between 2012 and 2023 comparing the efficacy of HA with PRP, CS, or placebo. The efficacy was mostly assessed using the WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) and VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) for pain. The Rob2 (Risk of Bias 2) tool developed by the Cochrane Collaboration was used to assess the risk of bias. The data pooled from 29 studies (2032 patients treated with HA, 965 with PRP, 376 with CS and 697 with placebo) were analysed. The efficacy was assessed mostly at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the administration of the investigated substance. All types of interventions (HA, PRP, CS) were found to have a beneficial effect on the knee affected by KOA, namely through symptom relief. The greatest effect was achieved with PRP, which lasted longer than that of HA or CS. HA offered a moderate relief of symptoms, which was still apparent at 6 months after administration. The administration of CS resulted in a rapid onset of pain relief which was, however, of short duration and started to diminish as early as after the first month of follow-up. In placebo-controlled studies, the follow-up did not exceed 6 months. Intra-articular administration of HA continues to be the most common intra-articular therapy for patients with KOA. We should therefore take an interest in its outcomes. This intervention is recommended by the OARSI as 1B level treatment. The ACR, on the contrary, has turned from both the HA and PRP. The NICE in its opinion on non-surgical management of KOA also advises against HA. In our study, on the other hand, we concluded that all three active pharmaceutical ingredients (HA, PRP and CS) improved the KOA symptoms, with PRP showing the most significant, longest lasting and most consistent overall beneficial effects. This conclusion does not imply that HA offers no or only negligible effect. The particular size of effect of intra-articular administration of HA depends on a number of circumstances. Further research should therefore be conducted which would look into the HA benefit in relation to the specific patient, KOA phenotype, stage of inflammation, or healing processes.",

Only two patients had postoperative positive Trendelenburg tests. There were no cases of nonunion or sciatic nerve palsy. An interoperative femoral fracture was observed in one case. This study demonstrates that excellent clinical outcomes can be achieved with no revisions, no nonunion, and minimal residual limping in patients who undergo shortening with STFO using a Wagner cone for the femur and a primary cup for the acetabulum.",

    "abstract": "Fixation of osteochondral fragments is a relatively common procedure in pediatric orthopaedic surgery. This study analyzes clinical and MRI results of biodegradable MAGNEZIX® magnesium alloy implants used to fix osteochondral knee lesions in pediatric patients. 18 pediatric patients with unstable or displaced OCD lesions or osteochondral fractures were treated with MAGNEZIX® screws or pins. Clinical examinations were conducted at regular intervals, and the final clinical and MRI assessments were performed 24 months after surgery. The overall functional scores at 24 months were found to be good, with a VAS score of 1.22 points ± 1.83, Lysholm score of 87.61 points ± 11.31, and IKDC score of 76.94 points ± 10.85 for both groups. On MRI, 14 patients (77.78%) showed complete union, four patients (22.22%) showed incomplete union, and none of the patients experienced healing failure. Complete implant absorption was examined in eight patients (44.44%) on MRI. Most patients exhibited varying degrees of chondropathy, and one patient required reoperation due to screw breakage and migration. The use of MAGNEZIX® implants in the treatment of pediatric osteochondral fractures and OCD lesions has shown good clinical outcomes and favorable healing of osteochondral lesions. However, varying degrees of chondropathy have been observed in most cases.",

    "abstract": "The study aims to point out the risks and matters associated with the inclusion of a new anterior approach in total hip replacement methods and to determine when and whether the values of investigated parameters would come close to those of the established surgical technique. Another aim was to compare the blood loss in AMIS and DLA approaches. The study covers 62 total hip arthroplasties in a breakdown by surgical approach. It investigated the progress of the entire surgical team - surgeon's learning curve, time curve of preparation for surgery, placement of the acetabular component, blood loss, and postoperative haemoglobin drop. The control group consisted of patients in whom the established surgical technique, i.e. the direct lateral approach, was used. The component placement was assessed on standard centered AP view radiographs of the operated joint by using the ellipse method to calculate the Liaw's anteversion and inclination. A total of 62 surgeries were included in the study. The AMIS group (31 surgical procedures) was composed of 19 women and 12 men, with the mean age of 70 years. The preparation of the operating field took 11.5 minutes on average and the duration of surgery from incision to suture was 66 minutes. The blood loss reached 295 ml, with the mean Hb drop of 16 g/l. The mean anteversion and inclination were 22° and 43°, respectively. The DLA group (31 surgical procedures) was composed of 14 women and 17 men, with the mean age of 67.5 years. The preparation of the operating field took 8 minutes on average and the duration of surgery from incision to suture was 53 minutes. The blood loss reached 300 ml, with the mean Hb drop of 21 g/l. The mean anteversion and inclination were 17° and 43°, respectively. The duration of the 1st to 10th AMIS surgeries was 80 minutes; the duration of the 11th to 20th surgeries was 58 minutes; and in the case of the 21st to 31st surgeries it was 55 minutes. The results showed that there is no need to worry about an excessively long learning curve of the surgeon and the entire team when introducing a new surgical procedure as long as they have a positive attitude thereto. The data obtained in other countries reveal that the AMIS approach is on the rise ever more often. The authors therefore hope that this study will contribute to its widespread adoption.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) can be particularly challenging in cases of low-grade chronic infection. The suspicion of infection is typically confirmed through cultures of synovial fluid and periprosthetic tissue. However, these methods may not always detect low-grade infections, which can lead to persistent infection and early failure of the prosthesis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of sonication in enhancing the detection of PJI using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. A prospective cohort of 26 patients, suspected of having mitigated PJI, underwent surgery at the First Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, St. Anne's University Hospital in Brno between 2019 and 2024. The cohort included 16 women and 10 men, aged 56 to 82 years, with infections involving hip (11 cases) or knee prostheses (15 cases). Standard PCR and sonication followed by PCR were used to confirm PJI. In 20 out of 26 cases, both standard PCR and sonication-assisted PCR detected the infection(p= 0.014). However, in 6 cases, standard PCR failed to identify the pathogen, whereas sonication followed by PCR confirmed the infection. Among these, 4 cases had significantly positive results, and 2 showed weak positivity. The most common pathogens detected were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (12 cases), followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and others. The findings of this study indicate that the integration of sonication with PCR markedly enhances the detection of PJI, especially in instances where standard PCR techniques may be insufficient, such as in low-grade chronic infections.",

    "abstract": "Subtalar dislocations are rare orthopedic emergencies characterized by simultaneous dislocation of the talocalcaneal and talonavicular joints without an associated talar neck fracture. While these injuries are commonly managed with closed reduction and immobilization, they are often associated with chronic instability and other long-term complications due to underdiagnosed soft tissue injuries.This study aims to evaluate the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the management of isolated medial subtalar dislocations and propose a routine MRI protocol to predict and address chronic instability. A prospective case series was conducted, including 13 patients with isolated medial subtalar dislocations. All patients underwent MRI to assess soft tissue injuries, particularly the calcaneofibular ligament (CFL) and anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL). Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain and the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores. MRI identified complete or partial tears of the CFL and ATFL in the majority of patients. Patients with complete ligament tears reported worse outcomes, with lower AOFAS scores and higher VAS pain scores, compared to those with partial or no ligament involvement. Conservative management was effective in mild cases, while surgical reconstruction was required for patients with significant instability. Routine MRI in the management of isolated subtalar dislocations enhances the detection of soft tissue injuries, facilitating timely interventions and reducing the risk of chronic instability. Integration of MRI into the diagnostic and follow-up protocol for improved patient outcomes.",

The study population consisted of 15 women and 22 men, with the mean age of 66.4 years. The youngest patient was 20 years old, and the oldest patient was 94 years of age. Patients with prosthetic joint infection were excluded from the study. The study included all patients with the diagnosis of shoulder arthritis who underwent surgery at our department in the period 2018-2023. The patients were enrolled based on the clinical finding, laboratory results and bacteria culture tests. Arthroscopy and shoulder joint lavage were performed in the shortest possible time, with revision of both the glenohumeral and subacromial spaces and insertion of drains into both these spaces, or a 24-hour arthroscopic irrigation lavage. During the hospital stay, inflammatory markers were monitored, antibiotics were administered intravenously and after discharge orally for the period of at least 6 weeks. The surgical outcomes were evaluated by clinical follow-up of the patients, who were asked to complete the forms of the UCLASS and CONSTANT scoring systems that are used to determine the patients' satisfaction with their treatment and postoperative status. Between 2018 and 2023, a total of 13,441 surgeries were performed. The total number of shoulder joint surgeries was 1,357, of which, 1,131 were arthroscopic procedures and 226 were total shoulder arthroplasties. Arthritis of the glenohumeral joint was diagnosed in 37 patients, in whom a total of 54 surgical procedures were performed. The main symptoms were local pain, limited range of motion, swelling, and mild fever. The symptoms persisted for 4 days on average. Revision surgery was performed in 9 patients. The most common pathogen was Staphylococcus aureus. In all cases, appropriate therapy resulted in full recovery. Even through septic arthritis of the shoulder joint is less frequent than septic arthritis of the knee, in our study population it ranked second in terms of frequency, or third when also infectious complications of total joint replacements are considered. Very rarely it affects a native joint of young and otherwise healthy patients. Early diagnosis, timely surgical treatment, and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial in the management of septic arthritis.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is a complex disorder resulting from injury to developing brain. It involves multimodal and multidisciplinary approach that involves various disciplines of medical science. The entire focus of this approach is to provide patients with this disorder the best quality of life. Although CP can affect both upper and lower limbs, the functional expectation of upper limb is much higher and complex. This implies particularly to hand and wrist based on complex functional movements expected of them. This puts orthopaedic surgeons in a unique position in managing these patients. It is worth mentioning here that it is not about offering them a surgical intervention the emphasis should lie on the entire process of selection, evaluation, and intervention. All these steps need to be considered very thoroughly so that the best outcome is achieved based on patients' expectation at present and keeping the future consideration in mind as well. This paper focuses only on children with hand and wrist deformity. Although children have a great healing potential, but they have high functional demand and longer-life expectancy in general so getting things right for the first time should be of paramount importance. This paper tries to address this issue by reviewing the literature to help orthopaedic surgeons in developing an algorithm in their mind when offering intervention. The consideration of inclusion and exclusion criteria along with review of literature has been considered with this background in mind. This paper primarily addresses the surgical aspect of disease and steps that are critical in this regard. Follow up planning, long-term outcome, rehabilitation planning, use of conservative treatment has not been considered in this review.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to evaluate the timeliness and effectiveness of treatment of all patients who underwent surgery for septic arthritis of the wrist at our department between 2003 and 2023. The retrospective study included 38 patients (26 men and 12 women). The mean age of the patients was 68 years. All patients underwent surgery for culture-positive arthritis of the native wrist. Patients with periprosthetic and extraarticular infections were excluded from the study. Once the diagnosis was established based on the clinical examination and laboratory analysis of blood and synovial fluid, antibiotic treatment was administered and revision surgery was performed. Arthroscopic procedure was used in the unaffected wrist, whereas open surgery was opted for in case of any degenerative changes of the wrist joint and extra-articular spread of infection. A total of 50 surgeries were performed, of which 6 arthroscopies, 32 open arthrotomies, 2 open surgeries with proximal row carpectomy, 6 open surgeries with simultaneous resection arthrodesis, 2 revision surgeries with arthrodesis via internal fixation for prolonged healing, 2 revision surgeries for another postoperative complication. In our study cohort of patients with septic arthritis, the arthritis of the wrist represented 7%. The most common pathogen was Staphylococcus aureus (60.5%). In 35 patients (92%) at least one risk factor for septic arthritis was present. In all patients, signs of local inflammation were present. 17 patients showed signs of system-wide inflammation and in 32 patients laboratory markers of inflammation were reported. In 6 cases both sides were affected. In our cohort the lethality reached 8%. These were patients with severe immunodeficiency and multiple loci of infection. Full recovery was achieved in 35 patients (92%), i.e. in all surviving patients, in whom the wrist joint was stable upon treatment completion and the self-care was not limited. The prevailing part of the patients (92.10%) with septic arthritis of the wrist showed risk factors for the development of septic arthritis, i. e. poor overall health condition of the patient, immunosuppression, organ failure, diabetes, age over 65 years, rheumatoid arthritis, surgery or trauma, drug or alcohol abuse. In case of bacteremia or sepsis, the risk factors include also chronic degenerative or inflammatory changes in the wrist region, with synovitis constituting a predisposition for hematogenous spread of septic arthritis of the wrist. Our cohort clearly confirms that the system-wide signs and laboratory markers of inflammation are nonspecific markers which cannot conclusively confirm the diagnosis of septic arthritis of the wrist, but the development of their values over time demonstrates the effect of treatment used. The presence of degenerative changes of the wrist joint influences the choice of surgical procedure. Septic arthritis of the wrist ranks among the less common types of arthritis. Early diagnosis should promptly be followed by adequate surgical treatment. Correct early management increases the likelihood of full recovery, even in high-risk patients.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to compare the postoperative outcomes of patients with total hip arthroplasty performed through Watson-Jones anterolateral approach and Röttinger minimally invasive anterolateral approach (MIS-AL). The hypothesis was that the MIS-AL approach enables faster recovery and better clinical outcomes in terms of abductor muscle strength and Harris Hip Score (HHS). The prospective comparative study included 136 patients who underwent surgery between 2018 and 2021. In 88 patients the Watson-Jones procedure was performed and in 48 patients Röttinger minimally invasive procedure was opted for. The Harris Hip Score (HHS) was used to evaluate the outcomes at three time points (before surgery, at 3 and 6 months after surgery) and the abductor muscle strength was measured using the dynamometer at four time points (before surgery, at 17 days, 3 and 6 months after surgery). The statistical analyses were conducted using the independent samples t-test at the level of significance p < 0.05. In the MIS-AL group, the HHS after 3 months was 86.32 ± 4.8 points, which was a higher score than that achieved in the Watson-Jones group (78.76 ± 5.6; p = 0.0015). After 6 months the difference remained in favour of MIS-AL (94.68 ± 4.7 vs. 90.28 ± 5.4; p = 0.0078). The maximum abductor muscle strength after 6 months improved from 125.52 ± 14.8 N to 170.91 ± 16.2 N in the Watson-Jones group and from 142.78 ± 15.3 N to168.11 ± 15.8 N in the MIS-AL group, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups (p > 0.05). The results show that the differences in abductor muscle strength between the MIS-AL approach and the Watson-Jones anterolateral approach were statistically insignificant. However, better results of the Harris Hip Score in patients in whom the MIS-AL approach was used are supported by the trend of faster functional recovery and higher satisfaction rate of patients undergoing less invasive surgical procedures. The Röttinger minimally invasive anterolateral approach provides faster improvement of the HHS during the first six months after surgery. The differences in abductor muscle strength between the groups were statistically insignificant.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYAseptic loosening of implants is the main complication affecting the longevity of joint prostheses.The highest proportion of loosening occurs due to osteolysis produced by the presence of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) wear particles smaller than 1 m.These can be identified by microscopic, spectroscopic or light-scattering methods.Here we describe our method for counting wear particles, based on the principle of light scattering. MATERIAL AND METHODSBetween 2002 and 2004, we collected samples of polyethylene granuloma in 19 patients who underwent revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) for aseptic loosening.The samples were obtained from strictly defined areas corresponding to the radiographic presentation of periprosthetic zones describes by Gruen and DeLee in THA.The frozen samples were lyophilized and subjected to delipidation and hydrolyzation procedures in 65 % HNO 3 .The top part of solution containing wear particles was blended with isopropanol, and the mixture was filtered through a 10-m polycarbon membrane.Subsequently, the filtrate was filtered through a 0.1-m membrane.Membranes with trapped particles, 0.1 to 1.0 m in size, were sent for particle characterization and quantification.The number of wear particles was measured by the method based on light scattering with calibration (LSC), using a Beckman Coulter LS230 analyzer that can express particle size distribution in a given volume in percent.The method was based on the fact that each particle reflects rays that can be measured.The medium measured contained an unknown number of UHMWPE particles and a known number of calibration glass beads varying in size.The number of UHMWPE particles was calculated from the known number of calibration beads. RESULTSBecause the collected samples were also used to develop the method, comprehensive data was obtained in six patients only.Particle distribution recorded in the periprosthetic zones in THA varied greatly; up to a five-fold difference in particle concentration was observed between the zones.In five of the six patients, the highest particle concentration was found in zone III. DISCUSSIONSeeking a method that would be exact, quick and cheap and would eliminate particle aggregation remains the subject of study for researchers cooperating with clinical practice.At present methods based on weighing isolated particles are used most frequently.We developed the LSC method that, for quantification, utilizes the ability of particles to disperse light, and allows us to calculate the real numbers of UHMWPE wear particles in a medium containing a known number of calibration particles.Although this is an indirect method, it gives more accurate results than the direct weighing of particles.The advantages of the LSC method involve less demand on sample purity, greater speed and low limits of detection.The method is useful for statistical evaluation of a larger number of samples.The variation in particle distribution in THA found in this study is in agreement with the relevant literature data; it is also in agreement with our assumptions and clinical findings. CONCLUSIONSThe authors developed an original method for assessment of UHMWPE wear particles in tissue samples, which is quicker than the methods so far used.In the periprosthetic tissues studied, particles about 1 m in size were detected; their numbers (about 10 10 particles per gram dry tissue) are in agreement with the literature data.The distribution of particles in periprosthetic zones in THA was uneven.The highest number of particles was found in the neighboring zone III and zone 7, as described by Gruen and DeLee.",

    "abstract": "The CF 30 stem in combination with a cementless acetabulum was used at the First Department of Orthopedic Surgery in Brno in the years 1994 to 1995. From the second year following implantation, aseptic stem loosening was recorded. In order to find explanation of this early loosening, the authors, in cooperation with the Institute of Solid Mechanics, Mechatronics and Biomechanics, carried out the stress-strain analysis in a model system.Eighty patients (31 men and 49 women) received a cemented CF30 femoral component in 1994. Of them, 16 patients underwent revision arthroplasty, three died of causes unrelated to the surgery, and four were lost to follow-up.The final clinical and radiographic check-up was carried out in 2001. The results of a comprehensive examination were available in 57 patients with a CF30 stem. The patients were evaluated on the basis of the Harris hip score and anteroposterior radiographs of the hip. X-ray films obtained immediately after surgery and those taken at regular intervals during follow-up were compared. The following characteristics were noted: translucent lines in individual zones along the stem at the cement-bone interface; osteolysis, i. e., non-linear translucent areas, at least 5 mm long, at the cement-bone interface; and subsidence of the femoral component, i. e., migration of the stem distal to the tip of the greater trochanter.The CF 30 stem survival curve showed that aseptic stem loosening occurred from post-implantation year 2, and increased during the following years. At 6 years and 6 months, a total of 16 patients underwent revision surgery, involving reimplantation in 14 and implant removal in 2 patients.Potential causes of aseptic loosening: Polyethylene wear.However, no acetabular loosening was found in this group, although acetabular components are reported to become loose more often than femoral components. By comparison of the stem survival curves for Poldi and CF 30 stems it appeared that, at 6 years and 6 months, the Poldi stem survival curve showed better results. Matt surface finish of the stem. However, the link between the CF 30 stem and cement was so strong that, in all 16 revised hips, the stem was removed together with nearly a complete cement mantle. The authors therefore dismiss this as a cause. Also, in the remaining cases of CF 30 aseptic loosening, which had not been revised, radiographic evidence suggested loosening between bone and cement. The authors did not find any movement of the CF stem in its cement mantle. The stem always fitted in with the cement mantle. Erroneous surgical technique or cementing was unlikely. The procedures were performed by experienced orthopedic surgeons who used the second-generation cementing technique. In patients with a Poldi stem, the first-generation cementing method was used and the proportion of aseptic loosening at 6 years of follow-up was only 4 %. In contrast, loosening in patients with the CF 30 stem was 20 % at 6 years and 6 months postoperatively. Shape of the CF 30 stem with the intention to find a relationship between stem shape and its early aseptic loosening, the authors started cooperation with the Institute of Solid Mechanics, Mechatronics and Biomechanics at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Brno University of Technology. Using the method of finite elements, they carried out the stressstrain analysis in a model system. Stress at the cement-bone interface in the CF 30 stem was higher than in the Poldi stem, and this difference was statistically significant. The authors believe that the more frequent loosening found in patients with the CF 30 stem can be accounted for by its shape.The survival curve for the CF 30 femoral stem did not show good results, and therefore this stem is not recommended for implantation. The authors suggest that a more frequent early aseptic loosening of CF 30 stems may have been caused by its unsuitable shape.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYHydroxypatite coating (HAC) was introduced into total hip arthroplasty (THA) practice to improve the fixation interface between bone and prosthesis.To test this assumption however, long-term follow-up investigations are needed.In this study, we present data for two consecutive series of THA stems with HAC and a minimum ten-year follow-up. MATERIALOverall, 249 patients (271 hips) were included in the study, of these 122 (135 hips) had Walter hip arthroplasty (WHA group) with a two-layered TiO2/HAC at the proximal part of the stem and 127 (136 hips) had ABG I prostheses (ABG I group) with a single-layered HAC at the proximal part of the stem.Mean length of follow-up was 11.4 years (0.8-13) and 9.8 years (4-12) in WHA and ABG I groups, respectively.Mean age at the time of surgery was 62 years (23-79) and 47 years (21-65) in WHA and ABG I groups, respectively. METHODSProbabilities of implant survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Radiographic data were included to construct the worst-case scenario.Differences in survival curves were evaluated by Gehan's Wilcoxon test.Harris hip score was used to compare preoperative status with that of final follow-up. RESULTSThe overall survival of WHA was significantly better than the ABG I (0.85 versus 0.66; p < 0.05).The main reason for a high revision rate in ABG I was periprosthetic osteolysis followed by aseptic loosening.With regard to stems, the survivorship curve for the Walter stem was significantly better than for the ABG I stem even when radiographic results were included (p = 0.0002).In the WHA group, two stems (1.5%) were revised due to sepsis, in contrast to thirty-one stems (23.5%) revised in the ABG I group due to osteolysis and aseptic loosening (p < 0.05).Significant improvement was achieved in both groups under study in terms of Harris hip score. DISCUSSIONData presented here appear surprising at first glance because the differences between the stems under study are only minor.The failure in ABG I was most probably caused by poor polyethylene quality and poor locking mechanism of polyethylene liner in the metallic shell.In addition, HAC used in ABG I prosthesis was not able to prevent the development of polyethylene disease stimulated by high wear rate. CONCLUSIONThis study revealed excellent survivorship for WHA stems after a minimum ten-year survival and significantly poorer survivorship for the ABG I stems.This may be explained at least particularly by combined two-layered HAC used in WHA stems which provide simultaneously endurable bone interlocking and effective barrier against expansion of polyethylene disease.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYTo evaluate the mid-term results of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) using a Medin Modular joint prosthesis in a standard design preserving the posterior cruciate ligament. MATERIALThe study comprised 206 consecutive total knee arthroplasties, 10 bilateral, 60 in men and 136 in women.Twelve patients died of causes unrelated to the surgery and 14 knee replacements were lost to follow-up.A total of 180 were evaluated at an average follow-up of 6.5 years (range, 5 to 8.7 years).The patients ranged in age from 43 to 84 years (average, 69.5 years).The basic indication for surgery was osteoarthritis in 179 and rheumatoid arthritis in 37 cases. METHODSPain, range of motion, stability and function were scored on a 100-point scale of the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) Scoring System.Subjective satisfaction was essessed by the patient's willingness to undergo the surgery again.At yearly intervals, radiographs in two projections were examined for radiolucent lines around the implant.The Kaplan-Meier survival curve was evaluated for the whole group and compared with that for non-infected cases only.The mechanical properties of the implant were most reliably shown by the survival curve for the subgroup of knee replacements free of infection. RESULTSAt the final follow-up out of 180 knees, 169 were fully functioning and 11 required revision arthroplasty for the following reasons: polyethylene wear, one knee; instability, two; infection, six; patellar fracture, one; and problems associated with the femoro-patellar joint, one knee.The Kaplan-Meier curve for the whole group showed survival of 92 % of the implants at the end of the 9-years follow-up time.In the infection-free subgroup, in which aseptic loosenings were only included, there was a 95 % survival.The average range of flexion was over 106 degrees, and only 11 knees had flexion below 90 degree lack of.Extension from 5 to 10 degrees was found in four knees.Thirteen knees showed instability that did not interfere with function.In 191 knees, after surgery alignment was optimal, between 0 and 5-degree valgus; in 11 knees varus up to 5 degrees and valgus up to 10 degrees were found.No pain was recorded in 123 knees, occasional pain with no effect on function in 36 cases, and moderate pain after weight-bearing in 10 knees.By the HSS score, 136 knees had excellent and very good (over 90 points) outcomes and 21 had unsatisfactory or poor outcomes (below 85 points); the remaining 23 had satisfactory outcomes (between 89 and 85 points).The subjective evaluation was positive for 156 knees.Of 169 TKA evaluated radiographs, 141 were without signs of radiolucency, 17 showed a slight marginal radiolucent line and 11 had a more pronounced radiolucent line up to 1 mm in width, but without progression. DISCUSSIONA total of 93 % of total replacements were evaluated and 7 % were lost to follow-up.Therefore, the number of remaining patients is big enough to make the group valid for assessment.The rate of complications, including 2.9 % of infected knees, is in agreement with the reported values.The occurence of polyethylene wear was negligible.A comparison of the cumulative survival curve for the whole group with that for the infection-free subgroup showed that the effect of infection on the TKA outcome was statistically significant (p=0.0431), and that late infection remains the most serious complication.Aseptic loosening plays a less important role in implant survival evaluated at mid-term intervals. CONCLUSIONSThe rate of complications for Medin Modular implants evaluated at an average follow-up of 6.5 years is not different from the values reported for similar prostheses.The most serious complication is late infection.Persistent pain is usually located to the femoro-patellar articulation, but it seldom markedly affects joint function.The cumulative survival curve for the whole group was 92 % at a 9 years.The HSS evaluation of the whole group showed that 75 % of the knees achieved mor than 90 points.",

    "abstract": "The frequency of periprosthetic fractures related to total knee arthroplasty is increasing, with a prevalence of 1.3% on the average and with women being affected more often (4 out of 5 patients). Fractures of the distal femur are common, while tibial fractures are rare. Crucial for treatment is to distinguish fractures of the metaphysis above the femoral component, which remains firmly fixed, from those involving the knee joint replacement and component loosening. Supracondylar periprosthetic fractures are almost always managed surgically, using methods of osteosynthesis with an angle condylar or DCS plate, or a short retrograde- inserted supracondylar intramedullary nail. The recent use of implants such as LCPs with angle-stable screws has offered good prospects. This retrospective study presents our first experience with an LCP for treatment of supracondylar periprosthetic fractures of the knee joint.Between 2005 and 2008, a total of 13 supracondylar periprosthetic knee fractures were treated by the LCP technique. The patient group included 10 women and three men the average age was 67.4 (range, 56-81) years. The fractures were classified using the system proposed by Su et al. and the AO classification system. According to the Su classification, 12 types I and II fractures and one type III fracture were indicated for osteosynthesis. Based on the AO classification, there were four type 33 A1 fractures, five 33 A2 fractures, three 33 A3 fractures and one 33 C2 initially incorrectly classified as type 33 A3 fracture. The average time between total knee arthroplasty and injury was 6.8 years. In all patients fractures occurred after primary implantation of a cemented condylar total knee replacement without a femoral stem.The fractures were treated by a less invasive technique of LCP implantation within an average of 2.5 days of injury. The patients were followed up until radiographic fracture union, and complications were recorded.The 13 patients were treated by LCP osteosynthesis through a less invasive approach. One patient had primary spongioplasty, two had spongioplasty after an interval of 7 weeks. One patient died of a disease unrelated to trauma and surgery at 3 months after osteosynthesis. In one patient, osteosynthesis failed with fragment dislocation shortly after the operation. The case analysis showed that the initial indication was marginal and the comminuted zone was too low above the implant, with the fracture line extending to the component. Subsequently, conversion to revision total knee arthroplasty involving a stem was carried out. In nine patients, bone union was achieved in an average of 18 weeks, with radiographic evidence of fracture union. No complications such as wound infection, delayed wound healing or thromboembolic disease were recorded. No bone union failure and pseudoarthrosis development occurred.There are only few reports on the treatment of supracondylar periprosthetic knee fractures and evaluation of its results in the literature, and the groups evaluated are small. In a meta-analysis of cases from the 1981 to 2006 period, Herrera et al. have found only 29 assessable studies with a total of 415 cases, i.e., an average of 14 cases per study. The usual method of treatment was DCS plate osteosynthesis. Complications associated with conventional osteosynthesis techniques, as reported by various authors, may reach up to 30% (pseudoarthrosis development, 9% osteosynthesis failure, 4% necessity of revision surgery, 13% fracture malunion, 47%).Good results have been achieved with a retrograde-inserted intramedullary nail. The use of an LCP has been reported in the literature only occasionally. The classification system described by Rorabeck et al. is most widely used, but the system proposed by Su et al. seems more convenient to us, because fractures are placed in three groups, according to the localisation of a fracture line and its distance from the femoral component, as follows: type 1 fracture, fracture line is proximal to the femoral component type 2 fracture, fracture line starts at the level of a proximal edge of the femoral component and runs proximally type 3 fracture, fracture line extends below the upper end of the femoral component. Type 1 fracture is indicated for a retro- grade-inserted intramedullary nail, type 2 fracture for LCP osteosynthesis, and type 3 fracture for revision total knee arthroplasty. The use of LCPs in the treatment of supracondylar fractures of total knee arthroplasty, with a success rate of 86%, is described by Ricci et al. Other authors also report better outcomes with the use of LISS or LCP methods than with conventional osteosynthesis techniques.Osteosynthesis with an angle-stable table LCP is an efficient method suitable also for the treatment of periprosthetic fractures of the distal femur above total knee arthroplasty. It offers all advantages of angle-stable implants. It is more effective for osteoporotic bone than a DCS implant or a condylar plate, because it provides better fixation stability for the distal fragment. However, further studies are needed to compare its efficiency with that of an IM nail.",

    "abstract": "To present a prospective evaluation of one-year results in 162 patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty from a minimally invasive antero-lateral approach (THA MIS-AL).A total of 249 THA MIS-AL procedures were performed between January 2005 and October 2007. At one year after surgery 162 patients were examined and their conditions evaluated by the Harris score, percent satisfaction assessment, 1-to-5 scale school marking, findings on lateral X-ray images and occurrence of post-operative complications.With the patient lying in a lateral recumbent position, access is gained through a short incision (5 to 8 cm) along a line connecting the greater trochanter and the anterior superior iliac spine, between the gluteus medius and tensor fasciae latae muscles. After the articular capsule is removed and neck osteotomy done by a two-step procedures, the head is extracted. Both the acetabulum and the femur are processed with special instruments and a cemented or a cementless implant is inserted. Standard prophylaxis with antibiotics and anticoagulants is administered. The patient is mobilized from the second post-operative day, with individually allowed, partial weight-bearing of the operated extremity.In the 162 evaluated patients, the average Harris score increased from pre-operative 46.8 to post-operative 90.4 points. Excellent and good outcomes were found in 84% of the patients. The average school marking was 1.12 and patient satisfaction expressed in percent was 97%. Of 32 patients who had undergone both standard and minimally invasive hip replacement surgery, 25 considered the MIS AL technique to be better, five found no difference and two regarded is as worse. In two patients (0.8%), exposure had to be extended by the standard antero-lateral approach because of femur damage without displacement. Two patients (0.8%) suffered temporary post-operative peroneal nerve paresis. One patient (0.4%) had functional complications and five (2%) had to undergo surgery for haematoma. Sockets in a position other than the optimal 35 degrees to 55 degrees were recorded in two patients. The stem showed a 5 degrees varus deviation in one patient and that of 4 degrees in eight patients; a 4 degrees valgus deformity was found in three patients. Para-articular ossifications (stage 1 or 2) not affecting joint function were recorded in 20 patients (12%).Our results show good subjective evaluation of this technique. Its advantages include less pain and earlier patient mobilization. In our first patients a higher number of slight stem malposition (up to 3 degrees) was recorded. Early complications were rare. The occurrence of paraarticular ossifications was an unexpected finding; these, however, did not influence either joint function or subjective evaluation of the outcome.If all indication criteria are met and the operative technique is well mastered, the MIS-AL procedure helps provide successful outcomes with less muscle damage and more rapid rehabilitation for people receiving hip replacement; it has few complications and, in indicated cases, it appears to be an approach preferable to the standard THA technique.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSConventional MR images and MR arthrograms of the shoulder were obtained in 35 patients treated between January 2004 and January 2006.Each MR image was evaluated by five radiologists experienced in assessing findings on the musculoskeletal system.Subsequently, the patients underwent shoulder arthroscopy performed by shoulder arthroscopy surgeons.Each detailed arthroscopic report was compared with the pre-operative MR findings, and the sensitivity and specificity of MR examination were calculated.The arthroscopic findings served as standards of reference for comparison. RESULTSSLAP lesions were found intra-operatively in seven out of the 35 patients (20 %).MR sensitivity was 43 % (3 to 7 patients) and specificity was 96 % (27 to 28).The accuracy of MR for SLAP lesion diagnosis was 86 % (30 of 35 patients).Tears in the anterior labrum were diagnosed by arthroscopy in 16 of 35 patients (46 %); MR sensitivity was 44 % (7 of 16 patients) and specificity was 89 % (17 of 19).The accuracy of MR for diagnosing labral tears was 68 % (24 of 35 patients). DISCUSSIONWhen designing our study, we tried to avoid limitations of similar investigations.We employed a nuclear magnetic resonance system with high resolution and standardized both the arthroscopic technique and the evaluation of MR images.Our results of diagnosing rotator cuff disorders and SLAP lesions are in agreement with those of other relevant studies.The limitation of our study was a small size of the group. CONCLUSIONSAlthough MR imaging is a sensitive method suitable for diagnosing some shoulder disorders, the MR imaging of SLAP lesions and labral tears does not give results accurate enough to be used for pre-operative planning.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe aim of our retrospective study is to show that in cases of very serious degenerative alteration of the shoulder as well as massive Cuff arthropathy, there is a valid reason for the indication of an inverse prosthesis of the total shoulder joint.We therefore describe operation technique as well as evaluation of our own results, including complications. MATERIALFrom October 2000 to October 2005, 24 patients had 25 Delta prostheses implanted.All these 25 implantations were carried out by the author personally, using the Delta prosthesis, in Hybrid technique. METHODIn all 25 implantations we used a lateral access by splitting the Deltoideus.We implanted the Glenoid component cement free, and we cemented the prosthesis of the Humerus in all our cases.After an average post-operational examination time of 3 years and 9 month, we examined clinically and radiologically, 23 patients (92%) with 24 implants.Pain, mobility and activity in every-day life were considered in the clinical post-operative check up. RESULTSEvaluation of pain showed that 14 patients (60,9 %) were free from pain and 9 patients (39,1 %) showed a great improvement in their medical state.In all cases we could clearly see that as far as mobility and activity in every-day life were concerned, a significant improvement hat occurred.The post-operative rate of complications showed the figure of 2 luxations (8 %).The luxation of the first patient could be repositioned in a non-operative way.The second patient was reoperated twice and we exchanged the shaft of the Humerus.In no instance did we discover any obstacle to the healing of wounds or any infections. DISCUSSIONWhen the indication is carefully handled the inverse prosthesis of the shoulder is an excellent way of treatment of serious degenerative alteration of the shoulder joint and major Cuff arthropathy.The operation, which is technically demanding, should only be carried out by an operator experienced in shoulder operations.The rate of luxations can certainly be lowered with the accumulation of experience and strict adherence to the precise way in technique called for by this operation. CONCLUSIONWith elderly patients the inverse shoulder prosthesis is a good alternative way of treatment of serious degenerative alteration of the shoulder and massive Cuff arthropathy.",

    "abstract": "Injury to the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is relatively rare and, if combined with avulsion fracture of the PCL insertion site, it accounts for only a small number of knee injuries. This is why PCL avulsion fracture is an easily missed diagnosis resulting in knee instability and arthritis development. The aim of this study was to show the necessity of surgical treatment of these injuries.Between January 2004 and September 2005, four patients with PCL injury underwent surgery. Three had avulsion fracture at the PCL insertion site, and in one the avulsion fracture involved also the intercondylar eminence. The average follow- up was 15 months, with a range of 5 to 20 months.The diagnosis was based on clinical examination, plain X-ray and MRI results. After arthroscopic treatment of the anterior compartment, the posterior compartment was treated from the posteromedial and the posterolateral approach. Using a K-wire for guidance, a tunnel was drilled and the fragment was fixed with an absorbable cannulated screw. Postoperatively, the limb was immobilized in a rigid brace at a 20 degrees flexion for 4 weeks followed by passive exercise rehabilitation. Within 10 weeks of surgery full weight-bearing was possible in all patients. Outcome evaluation was based on clinical, radiographic and MRI examination shortly after surgery and at 3-month follow-up.None of the four treated knee joints had any post-operative instability. The PCL was in a correct position and showed appropriate tension on MRI scans.Today arthroscopically-assisted operations are preferred to conservative treatment or open osteosynthesis. An exact diagnosis is best made on the basis MRI examination. To fix the bony fragment, various techniques can be used, such as hooked nail, screw, K-wire or traction suture through the proximal tibia. The method used usually depends on the size of a bony fragment.The advantages of arthroscopic surgery include faster healing and rehabilitation and less pain and trauma associated with the operative procedure. A readily performed arthroscopic procedure prevents knee joint instability and arthritis development. The outcomes achieved in our patients give support to the indication for surgical treatment in this kind of knee injury.",

    "abstract": "A detailed description of the Judet posterior approach to the scapula. MATERIAL AND METHODSThe authors used this approach in 24 patients operated on for fractures of the scapular body and neck and for combined fractures of the scapula.In 23 patients the surgical site healed without complications, in 1 case revision was required due to a haematoma. DESCRIPTION OF THE APPROACHThe approach has three phases.The first of them consists in a boomerang skin incision along the scapular spine and the medial scapular border producing a skin flap, and identification of the posterior border of the deltoid.In the next phase, the posterior deltoid is dissected off the scapular spine and reflected laterally.In the final phase, the infraspinatus is mobilized and reflected proximally.During the whole procedure the neurovascular bundle passing from the spinoglenoid notch to the infraspinatus must be handled with maximum caution.In certain types of fractures of the scapula, this approach may be limited using a medial and a lateral window to expose the respective borders of the scapular body, without full mobilization of the infraspinatus.On the other hand, where the fracture of the scapula is associated with a fracture of the lateral clavicle or dislocation of the AC joint, the approach may be extended using a saber cut incision starting from the proximolateral angle of the Judet incision and passing over the AC joint.This modification was used in a fracture of the scapular body associated with dislocation of the AC joint. DISCUSSIONThe advantage of the Judet approach is an excellent exposure of the infraspinousus fossa.The main disadvantage of this approach is considered its extensiveness and atrophy of the infraspinatus that is most probably caused by its mobilization.However, there may be more causes of this atrophy.The first of them is injury to the suprascapular nerve in fractures of the surgical neck of the scapula by its entrapment in the fracture line.In these fractures the whole course of the nerve in the spinoglenoid notch should be revised.Another cause may be overstretching of the nerve during the operation, when the mobilized muscle is retracted too far proximally, medially or laterally.Therefore a continuous visual control of the nerve is of vital importance.The third cause is inadequate reinsertion of the muscle.A certain role may be played also by insufficient postoperative rehabilitation.Clinical experience gained in the treatment of our patients and a personal experience of one of the authors (injury to the suprascapular nerve during arthroscopy of the shoulder and complete atrophy of the muscle) prove that even after dennervation of the infraspinatus the function of the shoulder is almost normal.Performance of a limited approach using a lateral and a medial window requires sufficient experience in both the Judet approach and internal fixation of the scapula fractures.This modification is indicated in transverse two-part fractures of the scapular body and exceptionally in three-part T-or Y-fractures of the scapular body with a minimal displacement in the vertical fracture line.Its use depends also on the type of the fracture of the lateral border of scapula.Where an interfragment is broken off the lateral border, the fracture line passes close below the glenoid or involves it, the use of a limited approach is questionable.Of great importance in this respect is also the trauma-operation interval.After one week the reduction of the fragments from the limited approach is difficult and there is a potential risk of injury to the suprascapular nerve.An alternative lateral direct approach to the lateral border of the scapula, described for the first time by Dupont and Evrard in 1932, provides only limited exposure and cannot be, where necessary, extended to the entire infraspinous fossa.Therefore it is not suitable for treatment of the scapular body and neck.The posterosuperior approach is indicated in isolated fractures of the posterior glenoid.It uses the horizontal part of the Judet incision and passes along the posterior edge of the acromion and the lateral portion of the scapular spine.After dissection of the spinal and partially the acromial portion of the deltoid off the bone, the muscle can be retracted distally providing access to a more deeply located tendon of the infraspinatus.The tendon may be either retracted or cut and carefully elevated medially thus providing access to the posterior surface of the glenoid and the scapular neck.Where necessary, this approach may be converted to the Judet approach. CONCLUSIONThe discussed disadvantages of the Judet approach are relative and its benefits clearly prevail.Therefore it is recommended as the basic posterior approach for operative treatment of fractures of the scapula.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate our experience with the therapy of infected total shoulder arthroplasty and to compare the treatment methods used. Although infected total shoulder arthroplasty is not a frequent finding at the present time, the necessity of treating this complication may become more urgent with the continually increasing number of arthroplasty procedures performed.From 1992 till the beginning of 2005, eleven patients were treated for infected total shoulder arthroplasty. Of them, seven underwent the primary surgery in an outside hospital and four were initially treated at our department. The average age of the patients at the time of infection diagnosis was 61 years. The right shoulder was infected in nine and the left in two patients. An acute infection occurred in one patient (9 %), sub-acute in three (27 %) and late in seven patients (64 %). The average period between the primary operation and infection manifestation was 19.3 months.The group of 181 patients operated on for shoulder replacement between 1992 and 2005 was evaluated, and a deep infection of total shoulder arthroplasty was found in 11 patients (2.2 %). An antibiotic therapy alone was sufficient to eradicate the infection in only 20 % of the infected patients, but these showed good Constant scores (average, 42 points). Revision surgery, debridement and suction therapy had a low success rate (33 %) and good Constant scores (average, 45 points) in the cured patients. A two-stage reimplantation was 100 % successful but had a poor outcome, with an average Constant score of 26 points. However, a two-stage reimplantation involving a spacer had both a 100 % success rate and a good outcome with an average Constant score of 49 points. On statistical evaluation using the unpaired t-test, there was a significant difference in the Constant scores (T 4.35 p=0.005) between the patients undergoing exchange arthroplasty with (n=40) and without (n=4) the spacer.The cement spacer inserted for the period between the operations was well tolerated by the patients.There is a consensus that an antibiotic therapy is indicated only in exceptional situations. Similarly, debridement and suction drainage are successful only if the infection is diagnosed early. Poor function scores after resection arthroplasty are not surprising, because a sharp residual proximal humerus is likely to irritate soft tissues and, in addition, it is not possible to reconstruct a rotator cuff to match it. An unexpected finding, however, is the fact that, in contrast to hip joint arthroplasty, resection shoulder arthroplasty shows poor outcomes also in terms of infection eradication. Comparing the results of one-stage with two-stage reimplantation is a complex issue. Attention should be paid to a relationship between the methods routinely used to treat an infected total shoulder arthroplasty and those preferred by the given hospital for treatment of other joints. If the therapy is well established in that hospital and gives good long-term results, it is optimal to use it also for the treatment of infected total shoulder arthroplasty.Early diagnosis and immediate therapy can prevent more serious damage to soft tissues. The method of treating infected total shoulder arthroplasty is not different from other big joint therapies. The use of a spacer will allow us to remodel soft tissues satisfactorily even after extensive debridement. The functional results of treatment involving a spacer are significantly better. Key words: infection, shoulder, shoulder arthroplasty, one-stage revision, two-stage revision, spacer.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the quality of life in patients treated for degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis at 3 years of follow-up.Between October 2005 and 2008, answers to Oswestry, quality-of-life (SF-36) and VAS questionnaires were obtained from 117 patients indicated for lumbar spine surgery due to spinal stenosis. There were 52 men and 65 women, with an average age of 62 years. For future evaluation, the patients were placed into three groups according to the surgical treatment used: simple decompression with posterolateral fusion using autograft (69 patients); decompression and instrumented posterior fusion completed with autograft (21 patients); decompression and posterior dynamic stabilisation using the Dynesys system (27 patients). The patients were asked to respond to the three questionnaires again at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months of follow-up and to rate their willingness to undergo the surgery again on a 1-to-5 scale (from definitely yes to definitely no).In all three groups, the Oswestry disability index (ODI) significantly improved from the average pre-operative value of 53 to 39 post-operatively. This remained constant at 12 months (ODI 38), 24 months (ODI 38) and 36 months (ODI 37) after surgery. The SF-36 questionnaire also showed significant improvements in both categories covering components of physical and mental health. The VAS-based assessment of satisfaction with life and back and leg pain, however, did not provide such convincing results. The marking of satisfaction with surgery outcome was 1-2 in 71 % of the patients, and \"only\" 9.5 % of them would have never undergone the surgery again (marked 5). The L4-L5 segment was the most frequently treated region, and monosegmental decompression with fusion was the technique used most often.Our results are in agreement with the data reported in the national and international literature, including the number of patients studied and the results obtained from the Oswestry and SF-36 questionnaires. The assessment of life satisfaction using the VAS score has not been found in the literature. Our VAS back pain and leg pain scores slightly differed from the literature data, since no significant improvement in them was recorded. In assessing the patient's quality of life after lumbar spinal surgery, it is necessary to take into consideration also co-morbidities and external factors. CONCLUSIONS The results presented here show that lumbar spine surgery results in a significant improvement of life quality and has an irreplaceable role in the treatment of patients with degenerative spinal disease. However, three-year results do not provide enough evidence of the real stabilisation of patients' health state and thus the follow-up study is to be continued.",

    "abstract": "This retrospective study reports on the clinical results of a group of 23 patients with subtrochanteric femoral fractures using the Long Trochanteric Fixation Nail (LTFN).Between January 2005 and January 2008, 23 patients (20 women, 3 men; average age: 64.8 years old) with subtrochanteric femoral fractures were treated surgically. According to the AO/ASIF Classification, the most frequent fracture type was an 32-A1. They were also classified regarding the Seinsheimer Classification, in which the commonest type was the IIB. Of the 23 fractures, 14 of them had been the result of an unexpected fall, 2 were the result of a high-energy trauma and 7 consisted of pathologic fractures.All the patients were treated using the LTFN device and they all received clinical and radiological follow-ups at least until their fractures were consolidated. The average surgery time, average decrease in haemoglobin in the first 24 hours post- surgery, average need for red blood cell transfusion, postoperative mortality at a 6th month follow-up, time to autonomous deambulation, most frequent destination at the time of discharge, average time for consolidation of the fracture and average follow-up time were reported. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were also recorded.The average surgery time from cut to stitch was 97.45 minutes with the decrease in haemoglobin averaging 26.45 g/L and, on average, the need for red blood cell transfusion was 1.12 concentrates. In the first postoperative week, 57.1% of the total number patients were capable of deambulation. The time to hospital discharge was 12.9 days. After an average follow-up of 13.9 months, total weightbearing was achieved in the 64.7% of the patients. The average consolidation time was 21.6 weeks and none of the patients developed pseudoarthrosis. Technical failures were seen in 4.3% of the cases: 1 patient suffered a migration of the distal locking screw. There were no cases of deep infection, cut-out, bending/breaking of the implant, malrotation or fracture of the femoral shaft at the tip of the implant.From a mechanical point of view the use of a long intramedullary nail in combination with a blade or a screw seems to be the most appropriate treatment for subtrochanteric fractures of the femur. Despite the improvement of implants and surgical techniques, failures due to complications are still considerable. The low distal shaft diameter of the LTFN, in combination with an extremely precise positioning of the blade in the middle of the femoral head, can prevent mechanical complications. Open reduction and cerclage cabling may be required so as to obtain a correct alignment of the fracture.We conclude that the LTFN is a safe and reliable intramedullary device for the treatment of subtrochanteric fractures of the femur. Deambulation within the first postoperative surgery is possible when positioned properly. Its implantation requires more surgical time than the standard nails.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSBetween January 2005 and June 2007, 208 patients (120 women and 88 men) were included in the prospective study carried out at our department.These patients were undergoing elective surgery for lumbar spinal disease, namely, central and lateral stenosis, degenerative disc disease and degenerative and isthmic spondylolisthesis.All patients were treated by transpedicular fixation and fusion involving transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) in 165 patients, anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) in five and posterolateral fusion (PLF) in 38 patients.Satisfaction of the patients with surgery outcomes was assessed on a three-point scale, using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and the Short Form health survey questionnaire (SF-36v2) for life quality evaluation.The follow-up period ranged from 6 months to 2 years.The results were statistically analysed using the chi-square test and t-test. RESULTSA total of 30 complications were recorded in 28 patients (13.5 %).Revision surgery was necessary in 18 patients (8.7 %).Pedicle screw misplacement was found in eight patients and permanent neurological deficit with paresis of the unilateral lower limb in three patients.Carbon cage break-down during surgery occurred in one patient, misinsertion of the cage was in one patient.The dural sac was damaged in five patients, superficial and deep wound infection was found in four and two patients, respectively.Broken screws were detected in seven patients.Donor-site pain persisted in two patients.The patients free from complications were more satisfied (partial or full satisfaction in 86 %) than the patients with complications, who reported satisfaction in 78 %.However, the difference was not statistically significant.The complications had no significant effect on either any of the SF-36v2 health domains or the total physical and mental score or pain intensity.The ALIF procedure was associated with no complications, PLF with three (13 %) and TLIF with 23 (14 %) complications, but the differences were not statistically significant. DISCUSSIONComplications and revision surgery were relatively frequent in our group, but not excessive compared with the published data which report their occurrence from 3% to 30 %.This large range is related to an ambiguous definition and specification of complications.A significantly fewer complications have been reported in the studies supported by companies, or in those in which the author/s participate in instrumentation development.Some studies suggest that novel and more complex techniques bring about a higher risk of complications and repeat surgery, others report better results and fewer reoperations following a 360-degree fusion than after PLF.The difference in complications between TLIP and PLF in our group was not significant. CONCLUSIONSComplications are a serious issue of spinal surgery.The majority of complications in our group were associated instrumentation -most frequently with incorrect screw misinsertion.On the whole, the complications did not significantly influence the quality of life and pain intensity after surgery.Most of them were treated successfully with no permanent consequences.The permanent neurological deficit in three patients, because of the small number, had no effect on the whole group results.A reduction in the number of complications would not produce any expected improvement of functional outcome.",

    "abstract": "In this study the arthroscopic reconstruction of a rupture of the subscapularis tendon is described and the results of the technique are evaluated, with the aim to show the advantages and effectiveness of this surgical procedure.Between 2006 and 2008, arthroscopic repair of the subscapularis tendon was carried out in 23 patients, 16 men and seven women, with an average age of 55 (range, 37-74) years. The dominant arm was treated more often (15x). All 23 patients treated by this diagnostic arthroscopic technique were included in the evaluation.With the patient in a lateral recumbent position, the arthroscope was introduced from a dorsal port, and the procedure was carried out through working ventral and anterosuperolateral ports. Following its identification, the subscapularis tendon was mobilised and an insertion site was prepared. Subsequently, a Fastin anchor (Mitek) was inserted. The tendon was stitched through using the mattress suture technique and firmly reinserted to the lesser tuberosity. If necessary, a coracoplasty was performed and the biceps long head tendon was managed.When more tendons of the rotator cuff were torn, the subscapularis tendon was treated first. A complete tear was treated with two anchors and a partial rupture with one Fastin anchor. Post-operative immobilisation lasted 6 weeks and was followed by a six-month rehabilitation therapy. The tears were assessed according to the system proposed by Lafosse et al. The outcomes were evaluated using the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and Constant scoring systems at a minimum of 1 year after surgery.The 23 patients undergoing arthroscopic repair of the subscapularis tendon were evaluated. The average follow-up was 24 months. The average pre-operative values for the Constant and UCLA scores were 44.4% (25-72%) and 13.8 points (8-24), respectively. Post-operatively, they improved to 84.75% (50-100%) for the Constant score and 28.6 points (17-35) for the UCLA score. The only post-operative complication involving persistent purulent secretion from the posterior port was successfully managed. All patients reported improvement as against the pre-operative condition, all were satisfied with the outcome and expressed their willingness to undergo the same surgery on the other shoulder, if need be.Rupture of the subscapularis tendon is an infrequent injury to the rotator cuff and an isolated tear is rare. An exact clinical diagnosis of a subscapularis tendon tear is difficult. However, subscapularis tendon tears can be reliably diagnosed as well as treated by arthroscopy, including partial ruptures that are often misdiagnosed. Our results compare well with those reported in the international literature and are rated as very good.Arthroscopy is the most suitable method to diagnose as well as manage ruptures of the subscapularis tendon classified as Lafosse grades I to IV. Arthroscopic tear repair results in a significant improvement in function of the shoulder joint and pain relief. Based on these results, the arthroscopic treatment of all Lafosse grade I-IV ruptures in our institution is recommended.",

    "abstract": "Fractures of the femoral neck have been serious health and social issues of the recent decades. Although up-to-date implants and perioperative care are now available, the treatment is still associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications. The aim of this study was to specify early postoperative complications and to ascertain which factors, if any, can predict them.Between October 2005 and February 2007, a total of 155 patients were treated for femoral neck fractures in our department. The group of elderly patients (n = 82) who underwent elective total hip arthroplasty for osteoarthritis served as controls. The selected pre-, peri- and post-operative characteristics were prospectively collected. Each patient was followed- up for at least one month after surgery. The data were first compared by univariate analysis and then, for statistically significant factors, their predictors were identified by the logistic regression.The average age of the patients with femoral neck fracture was 77 years and that of the control patients was 75 years. The ratio of men to women was similar in both groups; the groups differed in body height, weight, preoperative morbidity, ASA score, lymphocyte counts, severity of brain atherosclerosis, independence in walking, and self-sufficient living. The number of complications in the hip-fracture group was 87 while, in the control group, it was only 15 (p = 0.0002). The hip- fracture group showed significantly higher occurrence of postoperative delirium (34 versus 4; p = 0.001) and prosthesis dis- location (12 versus 0; p = 0.009). The subsequent multifactorial analysis showed that the risk of postoperative delirium was associated with preoperative lack of self-sufficiency (odds ratio, OR = 4.814; 95 % CI, 1.551-14.942) and the length of operative time (OR = 0.970; 95% CI, 0.951-0.989). Prosthesis dislocation was predicted by an increased height of the patient (OR = 1.087 per each cm; 95% CI 1.001-1.159). An interval between injury and surgery longer than 48 hours was not associated with higher mortality.Postoperative delirium is a complication found in up to 60% of the patients with surgery for femoral neck fracture. The frequency of this complication depends on the instruments used to identify cognitive dysfunction - with a more sensitive instrument cognitive dysfunction is probably detected in more patients.The higher occurrence of dislocation in the hip-fracture group is also in agreement with the literature data. On the other hand, its association with patient height should not be overestimated, because a coincidence of several other factors may have been involved in the mechanism of dislocation. Displacement can be prevented by the use of offset acetabular components and 36-mm femoral heads for primary implantation in such patients.A significantly higher frequency of prosthesis dislocation and postoperative delirium was found in the patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty for traumatic indication than in the patients after elective surgery. A subsequent multifactorial analysis revealed a potential association of prosthesis dislocation with the patient's height and that of postoperative delirium with the duration of operative time and the degree of preoperative self-sufficiency.",

    "abstract": "Periprosthetic fracture is one of the most serious complication of total knee arthroplasty. In our retrospective clinical study we designed our classification with rules for treatment of those fractures.During the last thirty years we treated 53 distal femoral periprosthetic fractures in our orthopaedic department. In our clinical study we reviewed our group of distal femoral periprosthetic fractures with on the basis of X-ray findings, the treatment method used and treatment outcomes.According to our findings we divided distal femoral periprosthetic fractures into six groups: Type I Nondisplaced fractures, 5.7%; treatment failure rate, 33%. Type II a Fractures with lateral comminution (the most often type of fractures), 37.7%; treatment failure rate, 20%. Type II b Fractures with medial comminution, 7.5%; treatment failure rate, 60%. Type II c Fractures above TKA (the second most often type), 34%; treatment failure rate, 18%. Type II d Comminuted fractures, 5.7%; treatment failure rate, 18%. Type IIIFractures with loosening of TKA, 9.4%; treatment failure rate, 20%. For the treatment of fractures we used various methods according to the type of fracture: Plate osteosynthesis in 32 cases, with failure in seven. Three failures in IIa group due to incorrect osteosynthesis with condylar plate, treated by reosteosteosynthesis with same implant. One in IIb group treated primarily with cement plomb, after second failure treated with revision total knee arthroplasty. Two failures in IIc group, treated by reosteosynthesis with spongioplasty using the same implant. One failure in III group solved with revision TKA. Intramedullary nail in nine cases , with failure in two. One failure in IIb group treated by reosteosynthesis with condylar plate and cement plombage. One in IIc group due to infection, solved with extraction of material and second stage revision TKA. Conservative treatment in three cases,with failure in two. One in I group treated with condylar plate. One in IId group solved with revision TKA. Miniosteosynthesis in three cases, with failure in two.One failure in IIa group treated with condylar plate, one in IIb group treated with intramedullary nail and additional hydroxyapatite plombage. Revision total knee arthroplasty in five cases with no failure. Extraction of TKA, external fixation, and arthrodesis in 1 case with no failure.The rules for treatment of distal femoral periprosthetic fractures are not definite yet. For fractures above TKA is recommended nail osteosynthesis; for fractures at the level of femoral component is preferable to use osteosynthetic material, condylar plate or LCP. Bone grafts, bone cement, and artificial bone are used to augment osteosynthesis in comminuted fractures. Fractures at the site of loosening are indicated for revision TKA.According to our results: Type I: Conservative treatment possible. Osteosynthesis with condylar plate is recommended. Type IIa: Indication for condylar plate osteosynthesis. Type IIb: The most problematic group. Osteosynthesis with condylar plate with augmentation or condylar plate placed from medial side. Type IIc: Plate osteosynthesis possible, intramedullary nail is recommended. Type IId: Osteosynthesis with augmentation is possible in some cases; revision TKA is recommended. Type III: Indication for revision TKA.",

    "abstract": "An assessment of the results over a time period is an integral part of any treatment evaluation. A standard method used for this purpose is Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The aim of this study was to show how, for total hip arthroplasty (THA), estimates of prosthesis survival probability can be affected by a factor known as competing events.A set of input data concerning competing events (death and loss to follow-up), in addition to the investigated event (revision THA), was analysed by both the Kaplan-Meier method and the method of cumulative incidence with the use of worst-case analysis.Our results showed that, for the same input data, the Kaplan-Meier method gave lower estimates of prosthesis survival probability than the method of cumulative incidence. This difference increased with an increasing number of competing events occurring during the clinical study, and with an increasing duration of follow-up. These survival probability estimates can markedly be influenced by the use of worst-case analysis In our set of data this was more than 30%.Reports in the orthopaedic literature still show a predominant use of the Kaplan-Meier method, although it is obvious that this is not always optimal for observational clinical studies. Also, it is not clear how beneficial is the use of worst-case analysis, because our and other authors' results suggest that not all patients lost to follow-up should be considered as failed. Therefore, insolvement of such analysis might markedly distort the real survival curves and to disadvantage evaluated the orthopaedic method.In observational clinical studies involving a higher number of competing events, it is preferable to use the cumulative incidence method rather than Kaplan Meier analysis for statistical evaluation of the results. The former gives more exact estimates of prosthesis survival probability. It is also recommended to avoid modifying survival curves indiscriminately according to the results of worst-case analysis.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYTotal hip arthroplasty increases the use of alternate bearings to prevent polyethylene wear as the number of younger and more active patients has drastically risen.We carried out a prospective randomized study, to assess and compare clinical results and radiological changes, serumcobalt-and serum-aluminium-levels when metal-on-metal and ceramic-on-ceramic bearings are applicated. MATERIAL AND METHODSAfter giving informed consent 80 consecutive patients were included in this prospective randomized study.They were randomly assigned to receive either a metal-on-metal or a ceramic-on-ceramic bearing in their total hip replacement.Eligible were patients with a primary coxarthrosis or an avascular necrosis of the head of femur.Of the 80 patients 54 were females and 26 males.42 patients were randomized to a metal-on-metal bearing and 38 patients were randomized to a ceramic-on-ceramic bearing.The average patient-age was 65,8 years and the mean body mass index was 27,7 at the time of operation.Surgery was performed through a transgluteal approach in supine position under general or spinal anaesthesia.A forged conical threaded acetabular component made of titanium-aluminium-niobium alloy was used in all patients.The metal inlays and the 28 mm metal heads were made of Co-28Cr-6Mo alloy with a carbon content of 0,2%.The ceramic inlays and the 28 mm ceramic heads are Al2O3 implants.We used as femoral component a conical rectangular stem of a titanium-aluminium-niobium alloy.Cup and stem werde implanted cementfree.Clinical data werde obtained at a follow up at a minimum of two years after implantation.Patients were assessed with the Harris Hip Score and the University of California at Los Angeles activity scale.72 of the 80 patients could be explored clinically and radiologically. RESULTSThe 2 year follow up check showed clinically and radiologically no difference between the two groups.The median Harris HipScore was above 90 points and the UCLA score was about 7 points.The medium serum-cobalt level was in the metal-on-metal group about 1.2μg/L and in the ceramic-on-ceramic group below the detection limit.The medium serum aluminium level showed values of 1.2 respectively 1.3 μg/L.The luminescencies in the metal-on-metal group were increased, but all components of the prosthesis could be regarded as stable. DISCUSSIONIt was the goal of our prospective study to compare clinical and radiological results of hip arthroplasty in metal-on-metal and ceramic-on-ceramic bearings and assess the serum-cobalt and the serum-aluminium levels.The socalled \"biocorrosion\" is still a high risk element for loosening of implants because of aseptic osteolysis.A higher release of polyethylene and metal particles is triggered, which leads to a slow but continuous process of inflammation.Apart from the debris also metal ions in a higher concentration are released, so that we could detect after some years in patients with artificial implants a higher level of metal in blood and urine.So far we did not recognize any carcinogenity or the appearance of renal disorders, or other mutagene effects in our patients.We could also not observe any fractures in ceramic implants.We are convinced that short time and intermediate reports are necessary, although final judgement can only be based on long term data. CONCLUSIONOur prospective randomized study showed after two years no difference clinically between the two groups of metal-onmetal and ceramic-on-ceramic bearings with total endoprostheses of the hip.Although medium serum-cobalt level in the metal-on-metal group with 1,2μ/L is a significant higher value, whereas it lies in the ceramic-on-ceramic group below the detectable limit.",

    "abstract": "Vertebral compression fractures are very common. Symptomatic relief with conservative therapy is often difficult to achieve. Balloon kyphoplasty is a relatively new technique which stabilises the vertebral body and restores spinal alignment in recent fractures, it achieves significant pain relief and improved functional outcome is reported. The aim of this prospective study was to determine the level of pain relief and functional outcome in patients who were initially treated conservatively for 4-6 weeks and if symptoms did not have tendency to resolve, then had kyphoplasty surgery.105 patients underwent balloon kyphoplasty between April 2006 and August 2010 and had 1 year follow up. Total 170 levels were augmented, 65% (n=68) of patients were female and the average age was 74 years. Pain relief was assessed using visual analogue score (VAS) and functional outcome using Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).Results showed decrease of the average pre-operative VAS from 8.2 to 4.4 in the immediate postoperative period (p=0.000). This dramatic improvement remained and was 4.1 at 6 weeks, 3.3 at 6 months and 3.6 at 1 year. The average pre-operative ODI was 58. This improved to 47 in the immediate post-operative period (p=0.002). At 6 weeks this had improved further to 40 and further improvements were seen at 6 months (ODI 37) and 1 year (ODI 38). The average screening time was 2 minutes and 20 seconds. The average volume of cement used per level was 5.5 cm3. Radiographic measurements were performed by independent radiologist. The average pre-operative vertebral angle was 11.6° and 10.9° postoperatively. This was maintained throughout the follow up. This represented a negligible 6% improvement in vertebral body angle. We did not experience any clinically significant complications, we have encountered 11 minor complications which did not require any additional measures (cement leaks, penetration of the vertebral body margins by balloons or K wires and rib fractures).Pain relief and improvement of functional outcome was sustained after one year. Limited number of patients who had 2 year follow up showed trend of minimal deterioration of both parameters (VAS and ODI). This can be explained by incidence of few adjacent segment fractures and progressive overall osteoarthritic changes in this aging population. Radiological evaluation showed maintenance of achieved alignment which did not deteriorate over time. Complication rate was low and did not require any further surgical interventions and did not have any effect on final good clinical outcome.Balloon kyphoplasty proved to be safe surgical technique and should be considered in patients with ongoing pain following an acute vertebral compression fracture that does not improve with initial conservative treatment. It significantly improves pain and functional status in elderly patients.",

The results and complications of surgical correction of this deformity using ring fixators (Ilizarov/Taylor Spatial Frame) have been evaluated.We retrospectively reviewed a consecutive series of 30 patients with CFD, between the ages of 3.3 and 17 years (mean, 9.3 years), with 35 lengthening procedures. Ten cases were treated with an Ilizarov frame, 25 cases with a Taylor Spatial Frame (TSF).The average lengthening at femoral osteotomy was 44.3 mm. Nine patients underwent an additional tibial lengthening by an average of 24.2 mm. The total lengthening was 50.5 mm (28-85 mm). A fracture after removal of the fixator occurred in 25.7% of the cases, and a pin-site infection with the subsequent need of operative revision was found in 8.5%. A subluxation of the knee joint was observed in 11.4% and a persistent limitation of the knee joint range of motion in 22.8%.Despite several complications, the use of ring fixators, especially the TSF, is an effective method for treatment of this complex deformity. The complication rate was similar with the use of either ring fixator. Some complications can be decreased with experience. The risk of knee dislocation can be reduced by joint bridging and fractures after frame removal can be avoided by prophylactic rodding.",

    "abstract": "Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a disorder affecting the development of the acetabulum, proximal femur and joint capsule. The objective of this study was to analyse the results of closed reduction by overhead traction in subluxated and dislocated hips.In the period from 2002 to 2007, a total of 109 patients (124 hips) were treated by overhead traction. The indication criteria included adductor contracture and misalignment of the hip joint assessed as classes III A, III B or IV according to the Graf ultrasonographic classification. There were 96 (88 %) girls and 13 (12 %) boys. The left side was more frequently affected, at a ratio of 83 to 41, and bilateral DDH was found in 15 patients. Teratologic dislocations were not included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups according to age and the place of primary diagnosis. The children primarily diagnosed at our hospital Na Bulovce where placed in group 1, the patients diagnosed outside our hospital fell in group 2. The average age at the beginning of treatment was 2.2 months in the first group and 6 months in the second group. Our method of overhead traction consists of two phases. Horizontal traction is applied for two weeks in phase 1; the hips are then flexed beyond 90 degrees and gradually abducted for another 4 weeks in phase 2.The outcome of traction is examined by arthrography and a spica cast is applied in the safe zone.We observed the relation between the Graf classification and arthrograpy. The outcome of closed reduction was compared between the groups and the development of avascular necrosis was observed. The hips treated by open reduction were assessed in a different study. RESULTS The efficiency of closed reduction was 84 % in group 1 and 60 % in group 2 in which also two cases of recurrent dislocation were found. No significant differences between the Graf classification and the final arthrographic findings were recorded in either group (p ≥ 0.05). Avascular necrosis as defined by the Salter criteria was not diagnosed.Early reduction is essential to ensure normal development of the hip joint. Overhead traction therapy for misalignment of the hip joint is a safe method reducing damage to the femoral head. Its principle lies in gradual distraction of the contracted muscles and joint capsule with a concomitant change in traction direction in order to achieve a reduction manoeuvre without placing increased stress on the femoral head.Overhead traction is the method of choice for management of Graf's class III A, III B and IV hips. For the efficiency of treatment, an early diagnosis and a correct indication are essential. To avoid complications such as avascular necrosis, it is necessary to observe the principle of a safe zone.",

    "abstract": "Ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is the most frequently used bearing surface in currently used total joint replacements (TJR). According to the literature available, UHMWPE is the best polymer material, in terms of biocompatibility, mechanical properties and wear resistance, for this application. In spite of this fact, UHMWPE wear (i.e., release of microscopic particles from the polymer surface) remains one of the main reasons of TJR failures. Consequently, the wear of UHMWPE is a subject of intensive study by both materials scientists and orthopaedic surgeons. The structure and properties of UHMWPE strongly depend on the way of processing and post-processing modifications. The processing includes polymer resin preparation (microparticles about 100 ěm in size) and resin consolidation (forming bulk material). Post-processing modifications aim at increasing wear resistance and oxidation stability which are regarded as major factors involved in TJR failure. In order to maintain high purity materials for medical application, it is not allowed to use additional chemicals during the modification processes. The only exception is the use of vitamin E, a natural stabilizer and antioxidant. Considering all the above mentioned facts, the modifications can be based on (I) ionizing radiation such as gamma rays or accelerated electrons, (II) thermal modification, (III) additional stabilization with vitamin E, and (IV) sterilization. According to the modifications, we usually differentiate three generations of UHMWPE. The 1st generation UHMWPE is not modified except for obligatory sterilization. The sterilization procedures based on chemical procedures (formaldehyde vapours, hot water) have lately been forbidden, abandoned and replaced by gamma-irradiation with doses of 25-45 kGy. In the course of time, sterilization by means of gamma-irradiation showed to be unsuitable due to oxidative degradation of UHMWPE, which resulted in lower wear resistance, worse material properties and a decrease in longevity of joint replacements. The 2nd generation UHMWPE or highly cross-linked UHMWPE is material treated with ionizing radiation (gamma-rays or accelerated electrons) at higher doses (usually 50-100 kGy). The irradiation is followed by thermal treatment in order to eliminate residual radicals and limit oxidative degradation that occurs in the 1st generation UHMWPE types. Finally, the material is sterilized usually by modern procedures using ethylene oxide or gas plasma neither of which causes oxidative degradation (as opposed to gamma-irradiation sterilization). The 3rd generation UHMWPE is basically the same as that of the 2nd generation. The main difference consists in slightly better mechanical properties (strength, fatigue) and further stabilization to oxidative degradation. This is achieved by special procedures, some of which are either controversial (sequential irradiation) or well-accepted by a great majority of the orthopaedic community (vitamin E stabilization). Only the future will show whether the difference between the 2nd and 3rd generations of UHMWPE will play any role in increasing TJR longevity and therefore the quality of its performance. The final objective of all of UHMWPE modifications is, as already mentioned, to increase wear resistance, oxidative resistance and mechanical performance of the polymer. These changes, especially an increase in wear resistance, have been confirmed to prolong the longevity of total joint replacements based on UHMWPE.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSA prospective randomised study on surgical treatment of two-and three-fragment fractures of the proximal humerus was carried out at the Department of Surgery, University Hospital in Hradec Králové, from January 2006 till January 2010.The study comprised patients with proximal humerus fractures indicated for surgical treatment.Study inclusion criteria were as follows: informed consent, AO fracture types A2, A3, B1 or C1, age between 18 and 80 years, and patient compliance.Exclusion criteria included open fracture, associated injury (AIS ≥ 2), open growth plates, or such state of the patient's health that would limit the extent of surgery.Two groups were compared.One included patients treated by the Zifko method of minimally invasive osteosynthesis with intramedullary K-wire insertion (MIO group) and the other (ORIF group) consisted of patients undergoing open reduction with angle-stable osteosynthesis using a Philos plate (Synthes, Switzerland).The patients were randomised to the groups by a computer programme which facilitates the maintenance of homogeneity of the groups compared.The procedure in each patient was based on the sealed-envelope method. RESULTSThe ORIF group comprised 28 patients.It took them an average of 27.2 weeks (9-72) to regain normal upper limb function.The final CM score was 86.6% (64-100%) as compared with the healthy limb.Excellent and good results were achieved in 89% of the patients; complications were recorded in 39% of them.The MIO group included 27 patients.The fractures healed in all of them.Normal upper limb function was regained at an average of 21.4 weeks (13-36).The final CM score was 87.5% (52-100%) in comparison with the healthy limb.Excellent and good results were achieved in 89% and complications developed in 33% of the patients. CONCLUSIONSThe statistical evaluation of the results, using the unpaired t-test, did not show any significant differences either in functional outcomes or the number of complications between the two groups.The only significant difference was found in operative times (117 min and 72 min in ORIF and MIO groups, respectively).The difference in time needed to regain limb function (27 and 21 weeks) was at a marginal level of statistical significance.With both methods 89% of excellent and good results were achieved, and a similar number of patients had complications (11 and 9).",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY To inform on our experience with the treatment of humeral shaft fractures by intramedullary osteosynthesis using Hackethal's bundle nailing and to evaluate indications for the current use of this technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS From January 2001 to December 2009, a total of 184 patients with humeral shaft fractures were treated surgically and, of these, 147 by Hackethal's nailing. From January 2006 60 patients treated by this technique were prospectively followed up and, of them, 50 were evaluated (83.3%) and included in this study. The average age of the study group was 51.2 years. Fifteen fractures (30%) were in the proximal third, 32 (64%) in the middle third and three (6%) in the distal third of the humeral diaphysis. According to the AO classification, the distal-third diaphyseal fractures were mostly type A2 (26.6%) and type B1 (20.1%) , mid-third fractures were mostly type A3 (31.3%) and distal-third fractures were not evaluated because of their low number. Based on radiographic examination, patients with uncomplicated fractures of the humeral shaft were indicated for surgery. This was performed according to the original Hackethal's procedure with the patient in the prone position using Kirschner wires, 2 mm in diameter, as implants. The patients were followed up at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after surgery. On examination, healing of the operative wound, bony union achieved and radiographic findings of the fragment position were evaluated. The range of mo tion at the shoulder and elbow was assessed and subjective patients' feelings were recorded. RESULTS Of the 50 patients evaluated, 45 (90%) healed by first intention, four developed pseudoarthrosis (8%) and one required repeat surgery. No deep wound infection was recorded. Six patients (12%) had humeral angulation up to 10 degrees and one (2%) up to 13 degrees. This angulation was recorded in proximal-third diaphyseal fractures. A deviation in humeral internal rotation was found in two patients (4 %), in one of whom it was 40 degrees. Mild restriction of elbow extension (10 degrees) was found in two patients (4%), five (10%) reported slightly restricted motion of the shoulder and five, chiefly elderly patients with proximal-third diaphyseal fractures, had severe restriction of shoulder motion. Most of the patients (78%) reported full satisfaction, including return to normal daily activities, at 6 months after injury. When the therapy was finished at 12 months after surgery, 44 patients (88%) expressed their full satisfaction. DISCUSSION Our results give support to the previously reported good outcomes of Hackethal's osteosynthesis of the humeral shaft. This method is associated with a minimum of complications if the conditions of correct indication are fulfilled, i.e., uncomplicated fractures of the mid-third humeral diaphysis are considered. Filling the medullary cavity completely with K-wires or nails is an additional condition. Without these being met, good stability of the fracture is not achieved and non-union can develop, as shown by the analysis of cases with non-union in our patient group. CONCLUSIONS Hackethal's technique of osteosynthesis with elastic bundle nailing facilitates safe and easy treatment of uncomplicated diaphyseal fractures of the humerus. Its outcomes are comparable with the other currently used and more expensive methods. It is the method of first choice in the treatment of transverse and short oblique fractures of the mid-third of the humeral shaft. Key words: humeral shaft fractures, bundle nailing, Hackethal's technique.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the highest sensitivity of all methods for the diagnosis of intra-articular knee injuries. In spite of this, its benefit for the decision-making algorithm is questionable. The aim of this study was to evaluate the real situation in our regional conditions.The medical records of the patients who underwent knee arthroscopy in 2008 and 2009, and had pre-operative MRI examination, were retrospectively reviewed. The group included 92 patients (46 women and 46 men; average age, 41.7 years) of whom 49 had knee injury in their medical history.In medial meniscus (MM) injuries, the MRI examination had a sensitivity of 0.92 and a specificity of 0.44, and the congruence of MRI and arthroscopic findings was 0.73. In lateral meniscus (LM) tears, the values were 0.70 for sensitivity, 0.81 for specificity and 0.87 for congruence. In injury to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), MRI sensitivity was 0.66, specificity was 0.85 and congruence was 0.79. In evaluation of articular chondral lesions, the values were 0.45 for sensitivity, 0.87 for specificity and 0.60 for congruence.In our examination of knee structures for MM, LM, ACL and cartilage injuries, the diagnostic value of MRI was lowest for cartilage damage, with sensitivity being only 0.45. This was in agreement with the findings of other authors. Although this fact is known, our arthroscopic findings in patients with no MRI evidence of injury were very high: 22 knees with grade III or grade IV chondral lesions. Therefore, MRI examination is not considered to be sensitive enough to replace arthroscopy in the diagnosis of cartilage injuries. MRI examination is most frequently indicated in suspected meniscal damage. Its sensitivity reported in the literature varies; generally, it is about 0.90 in MM injuries, and about 0.75 in LM lesions, and this is in agreement with our results. However, in view of our previous experience, the high sensitivity of MRI in the diagnosis of MM lesions was an unexpected finding. A detailed statistical analysis showed that its high value was at the expense of a relatively high negative positivity (0.56) and a low predictive value of the positive test (0.65). In LM injuries these values were even worse: in addition to low sensitivity (0.70), the predictive value of the positive test was only 0.50. In the diagnosis of ACL injuries, MRI examination is reported to have a high sensitivity ranging from 0.85 to 0.90. This study showed poorer results; sensitivity was 0.66 and the predictive value of the positive test was 0.62. For injuries in which the orthopaedist is sure about the diagnosis and indicates arthroscopy, it is doubtful to indicate also MRI examination. This should be reserved for clinical presentations that are not clear, for post-operative conditions, serious knee injuries or combined injuries. However, patients with chronic problems and unclear clinical presentations should benefit from MRI examination which can make the diagnosis more accurate and thus reduce the number of arthroscopic procedures done entirely for diagnostic purposes.There is no consensus regarding the role of MRI in the diagnosis of intra-articular lesions of the knee. To a certain extent, its use is related to local conditions. It can be concluded that MRI examination is not currently as important for the diagnosis of knee injuries as expected by both medical and lay communities.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the results of stabilisation of the posterior pelvic segment with a transiliacal internal fixator (TIFI) in type C fractures of the pelvis.Between 2008 and 2011, the TIFI method was used in 27 patients with unstable type C pelvic ring fractures (AO classification) at our department. The patient group included 15 men and 12 women with an average age of 35 years (range, 15 to 65 years). All patients suffered high-energy trauma in traffic accidents (59.3%), by falls from a height (33.3%) or due to other causes (7.4%). In 40.7% of the patients, pelvic injury was part of polytrauma. Fixation was carried out using two polyaxial screws and the rod of a spinal instrumentation Legacy® or Colorado®. The method was employed for unilateral SI joint dislocation in five cases, and for unilateral sacral fractures of Pohlemann type I in six cases, Pohlemann type II in 13 cases and Pohlemann type III in three cases. The patients were mobilised, with associated injuries taken into consideration, at 5 post-operative weeks on the average. They were followed up at 6-week intervals until healing of fracture, then at one year after surgery and every 12 months thereafter. RESULTS All 27 patients achieved bone union within 6 months. The average operative time was 29 min (21 to 45 min). The average hospital stay was 22 days (11 to 66 days). The average duration of bed rest was 36 days (14 to 71 days). Complications included bronchopneumonia in two patients, and a redislocation with displacement of the posterior segment up to 10 mm in one patient.Transiliacal internal fixation is a minimally invasive method used to treat unstable pelvic ring fractures. Compared to other types of fixation, it carries a low risk of injury to nerve and vascular structures as well as a low risk of infectious complications, is associated with low blood loss and is easy to perform. The TIFI provides stability comparable with the use of two iliosacral screws, without the risk of excessive compression even in comminuted transforaminal fractures of the sacrum. However, the need to operate on patients lying in the prone position is a disadvantage because, in polytraumatised patients, it makes implantation at the acute phase impossible.The TIFI technique is one of the options for fixation of posterior pelvic segment fractures. A short operative time and minimum complications are undeniable advantages. Indications should be carefully considered in each patient. TIFI is a minimally invasive method for anterior pelvic segment fixation that can also be used in the acute stage of injury.",

    "abstract": "High doses of methylprednisolone (MPSS) came into use as part of a therapeutic protocol for acute spinal cord injuries following the published results from the NASCIS II study in 1992; they soon became a standard of care around the world. However, the results of this study have been critically reviewed and questioned by many authors since the beginning. The major argument is based on the fact that its effectiveness in reducing post-injury neurological damage has not been conclusively proved; in addition, there has been increasing evidence of serious side effects of steroids administered at high doses. In the Czech Republic, as part of pre-hospital care, MPSS according to the NASCIS II (or NASCIS III) protocol is used in all regional centres of emergency medical service. In the Czech spinal surgery centres involved in treating acute spinal cord injuries, there are 19 of them, attitudes towards the use of MPSS vary. In 16% of the centres a certainty of its beneficial effect is still maintained, faith in its effect together with fear of a \"non-lege artis\" procedure is the reason for MSPP use in 21%, and the fear of sanctions only leads to its use in 63% of the centres. There is no standard practice in application of the NASCIS II and NASCIS III protocols and no standard exclusion criteria exist. The two protocols are used equally, and one institution has its own modification. The recommended MPSS dose is administered with no exception in 63% of the centres; dose adjustment is employed according to the form of spinal cord lesion in 11%, the level of spinal cord injury in 5%, associated diseases in 16% and patient age in 11% of the spinal surgery centres. After the results of studies on MPSS administration in acute spinal cord injury have been analysed, many medical societies have changed their recommendations. In view of later relevant publications it is no longer possible to regard MPSS administration as a standard of cure for acute spinal cord injury. Current evidence suggests that MPSS administration in a 24-hour regimen after an initial dose given within 8 hours of injury is the therapeutic procedure that needs individual consideration in each patient according to their state of health and potential complications. MPSS administration at an interval longer than 8 hours after injury and for more than 24 hours is not justified, nor is it justified to use a high MPSS dose at the place of injury by an emergency ambulance crew.

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to compare two surgical methods of treating diaphyseal fractures of the humerus.A prospective randomised study on the surgical treatment of humeral diaphyseal fractures was carried out between September 2009 and January 2013. The patients indicated for surgical treatment fell into two groups according to the technique used as follows: minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) with a locking compression plate (LCP; Synthes, Switzerland); depending on the fracture type and course of fracture line, either a straight narrow or a Philos or a metaphyseal LCP was used (group 1); and intramedullary nailing (EHN, Synthes, Switzerland) (group 2). A total of 49 patients were entered into the study. The men-to-women ratio was about 1:1 and the average age was 52 years (18 to 83). Of them, 45 patients with 46 humeral fractures were followed up and evaluated. The injury was caused by a fall from standing or while walking (n=21), traffic accident (n=16), sports activity (n=3) or work-related activity (n=5). A single injury was treated in 72% and multiple trauma in 28% of the patients. Using the AO classification, fractures were diagnosed as types A, B and C in 25, 10 and 11 patients, respectively. The patients were randomised into the groups using a computer programme allowing for the maintenance of group homogeneity. Each patient received information on the method to be used in a sealed envelope.The average injury-surgery interval was 6 days (range, 0 to 26). The average operative time was 128 minutes (80 to 200). The average intra-operative exposure to X-ray was 8 minutes (3 to 20). The average hospital stay was 20 days (4 to 100) The average rehabilitation time till functional recovery was 17 weeks (3 to 37), the time of bone union by radiographic assessment was 20 weeks (12 to 40). The functional outcome was assessed using the Constant-Murley (CM) and Liverpool Elbow Score (LES) systems. The relative CM/LES score, as compared with the healthy extremity, was 95/100. Excellent and good results were achieved in 89% and complications were recorded in 26% of the patients. The most frequent complication was impingement syndrome or prolonged rehabilitation both in the patients with proximal humerus fractures managed with the Philos locking plate and in those treated by intramedullary nailing, although this was not necessarily due to a technical error, i.e., osteosynthetic material protrusion. Iatrogenic radial nerve injury was found only in one patient treated by intramedullary nailing and was associated with traction during reduction and nail insertion. Pseudoarthrosis was recorded in one patient of each group and there were no infectious complications.Intramedullary nailing has not yet shown such good outcomes in humeral as in tibial fractures. The results of metaanalysis have indicated that humeral fractures treated by plate osteosynthesis have fewer complications and require repeat surgery less frequently. However, as shown by most recent studies, this difference is getting smaller. The MIPO technique was adopted at our department several years ago and the aim was to compare our results with those of other centres. The studies so far published have show that MIPO and conventional open plate osteosynthesis give comparable outcomes. CONCLUSIONS The statistical evaluation using the unpaired t-test did not show any significant differences in either the functional results or the number of complications between the two methods. Both achieved about 90% of excellent and good results and had 26% of complications. The only significant difference was found in the length of operative time (136 min in MIPO versus 117 min in EHN). With use of the Chi-Square test, a significant correlation between AO fracture type and treatment outcome in the MIPO group was found, i.e., no poor result was recorded for type A fractures, as assessed by the CM/LES score. No such correlation between the fracture type and the functional outcome was seen in the EHN group.",

    "abstract": "Fractures of the medial clavicle third are rare injuries. Even in case of significant fracture displacement, their therapeutic management has been nonoperative. Recently, surgical intervention has become mandatory for displaced fractures types to prevent non-union and functional complaints, but the optimal operative strategy is being discussed controversially.We describe the case of a 63-year-old male patient with a significantly displaced medial clavicle fracture after failed conservative treatment resulting in restricted, painful shoulder function. The patient underwent open reduction and osteosynthesis with an anatomically precontoured locking compression plate (LCP). One year after surgery the patient is free of complaints and has returned to his preinjury activity level without any functional restrictions.As a not yet reported operative approach, anatomically preshaped locking plating seems to be an effective fixation method for displaced fractures of the medial clavicle third. The operative management is described in detail and discussed with the current literature. Based on the presented case, we underline the statement that displaced medial clavicle fractures should be surgically addressed to avoid late damage.",

Furthermore, we aimed to identify factors influencing the overall survival. MATERIAL AND METHODS All patients (n = 74) that underwent intramedullary nailing for metastatic disease of the femur between 2004 and 2008 and were retrospectively reviewed. Data were recorded from the patients' medical record and the outpatients' clinics files. Details about the tumour biology, the surgery performed as well as the postoperative care were documented. Survival data were extracted from patient records or obtained via communication with outpatient oncologists or the community registration office. RESULTS 74 (28 (37.8%) male, 46 (62.2%) female; p = 0.048) patients with a mean age of 64.4 ± 11.7 years were included. Breast (25, 33.8%), lung (18, 24.3%), bone marrow (7, 9.5%) and kidney (6, 8.1%) were the primary tumours in more than 75% of all patients. The mean overall survival was 17.5 (95% CI: 9.6 - 25.5) months. Patients with osseous metastases had a significant longer survival than patients with visceral and/or cerebral metastases (p = 0.025 and p = 0.032). CONCLUSION Intramedullary nailing represents a valuable fixation method for pathologic fractures or impending fractures of the femur in patients with an advanced stage of metastatic disease. It provides adequate stability to outlast the patient s remaining life-span. However, the balance must be found between therapeutic resignation and surgical overtreatment since operative treatment may be accompanied with serious complications.

    "abstract": "Non-union in forearm fractures is an uncommon but complex problem. This is especially given the unique anatomical structure and function of the forearm, making treatment distinctly different to that of other long bone fractures. Anatomical restoration of length, alignment, rotation and the radial bow maintains the optimal stabilising effects of the forearm muscles and interosseous membrane, as well as maximising the range of movement, particularly pronation and supination. Contemporary plate osteosynthesis using variations of the dynamic compression plate (DCP) developed by the AO group combined with established techniques of internal fixation have revolutionised the treatment of diaphyseal forearm fractures. Non-union rates have been minimised to below 5% and good to excellent functional outcomes are achieved. Non-union of the forearm is also intimately associated with a significant pain experience, marked pre-operative functional disability and physical and psychosocial morbidity.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYSurgical techniques for the treatment of supracondylar fractures in children are repeatedly the subject of discussion.The aim of the present study was to compare experience with the technique of crossed Kirschner wires at our own hospital with current literature. PATIENTS AND METHODSIn the period from 2000-2006 a total of 86 children aged 1.7 to 12.7 years were treated by means of crossed K-wire osteosynthesis.Follow up was conducted at an average of 32 months.Outcomes were evaluated based on von Laer's criteria. RESULTSReported complications were migration of the K-wires in 7% of cases and secondary dislocation and re-operation in 4% of cases.Lesion of the radial nerve was diagnosed postoperatively in two cases.Hospital stay was 1.5 days on average.Postoperative immobilization in an upper arm splint and implant removal after 6 weeks on average.57% of the children received physiotherapy during the course of treatment.Slight varization was found in 11% of children and an unsatisfactory range of motion in 13%.Satisfactory outcomes were recorded for 83% of patients. CONCLUSIONK-wire osteosynthesis is associated with a low complication rate and continues to be a safe standard procedure for the stabilization of supracondylar humerus fractures.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to record the frequency of L5 transverse process fractures associated with pelvic injuries and to find out whether in unstable pelvic fractures the frequency is significantly higher.The group evaluated comprised 106 patients (38 women and 68 men; average age, 43.4 years; range, 16 to 95 years) treated for pelvic ring fractures at two trauma centres in the period from January 1 to December 31, 2007. Their radiographs and CT scans were retrospectively reviewed in order to identify fractures of the L5 transverse processes and to obtain exact descriptions of injuries to the dorsal pelvic structures. The results were statistically analysed using the Chi-square test with a 5 % level of significance.The evaluation of radiographs and CT scans identified L5 process fractures in 21 patients; none of these had type A pelvic fracture. An L5 transverse process fracture was found in 10 (15 %) of 69 patients with type B pelvic fracture and in 11 (73 %) of 15 patients with type C pelvic fracture, i.e., only in the patients with unstable injury to the pelvis classified as type C or type B. The occurrence of L 5 transverse process fractures was significantly higher in completely unstable, type C pelvic trauma than in partially unstable, type B pelvic injury (p < 0.001).Our results showed that evaluation of the radiographs was not sufficient for the identification of L5 transverse process fractures and trauma to the dorsal pelvic structures. The reason was either poor quality or incorrect positioning. This gives support to the recommendations of many authors that CT scans should be the standard method for identification of all pelvic injuries. The study also confirmed that L5 transverse process fractures are associated with unstable pelvic injuries. Their significantly high occurrence is in agreement with other relevant studies which, however, have reported the results without statistical evaluation.The study shows a significantly higher occurrence of L5 transverse process fractures in patients with unstable pelvic ring injuries. The finding of such a fracture should focus attention to looking for trauma to the dorsal pelvic structures.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to describe the indication criteria and operative technique and to present the first conclusions of a prospective study dealing with an assessment of functional and radiographic findings in patients with concurrent fractures of the distal ulna and distal radius; the former was treated by osteosynthesis using an LCP Distal Ulna Plate (De Puy Synthes, USA) and the latter by plate osteosynthesis.Between August 2013 and September 2014, 18 patients (3 men and 15 women; average age, 58 years; range, 25-74 years) with a fracture of the distal ulna and a concurrent distal radius fracture were treated by plate osteosynthesis. The indications for surgery included displaced ulnar styloid base fractures in 10 patients, displaced comminuted fractures of the ulnar head in seven patients and a subcapital fracture of the ulna in one patient. The average follow-up was 9 months, with 13 (72%) patients being followed up for 6 months at least. The outcome of surgery was evaluated on the basis of X-ray views and multiplanar reconstruction of CT scans. Functional results were based on measuring the range of motion at wrist and forearm and hand grip strength and on the scores obtained from the Mayo Wrist Score System and Quick DASH Questionnaire.The average values for wrist and forearm range of motion were as follows: 68° in flexion (60-80°), 71° in extension (40- 90°), 87° in pronation (70-90°), 81° in supination (50-90°). This corresponded to a 92% (74-100%) range of motion at the contralateral wrist and forearm. The average hand grip strength measured with a dynamometer was 80.6% (53-100%) of the gripping force exerted by the unaffected extremity. Post-operative X-ray and CT findings showed good reduction of both distal radius and distal ulna fractures as well as good fragment retention by means of LCP implants. During follow-up complete bone union and full stability of the radioulnar joint were achieved in all patients. The functional outcome of treatment was shown by the average Mayo wrist score and Quick DASH score of 84 (55-100) and 7.4 (0-47.7) points, respectively.The functional outcome of treatment in our patients corresponded to the severity of their distal forearm fractures. The patients with more serious distal radius fractures, frequently associated with ulnar head fractures, had poorer functional results than the patients with less serious fractures. According to the AO classification, in the distal radius fractures, prevailing fracture types were 23-C3 (78%) and 23-C2 (16%). In relation to the distal ulna fracture type, the patients with ulnar styloid base fractures had better functional results than the patients with ulnar head fractures, because a fracture of the styloid process does not affect the congruency of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). Fractures of the ulnar styloid process base, following distal radius fracture osteosynthesis, were invariably associated with DRUJ instability. This fracture type is always accompanied by injury to the distal radioulnar ligament of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and, in case of a displaced fracture, surgical management is indicated. In agreement with the results of other authors it was found in our study that, when the anatomical position of the distal radioulnar joint had been achieved, both the functional and the radiographic findings were post-operatively very good. The final average values for the range of wrist and forearm motion, hand grip strength and hand and arm function were assessed as very good. CONCLUSIONS The assessment of our results and their comparison with the literature data showed that osteosynthesis of distal ulna fractures with concurrent distal radius fractures managed by open reduction and internal fixation are indicated in displaced fractures of the ulnar styloid process base, displaced comminuted fractures of the ulnar head where fragments interfere with DRUJ congruency, and unstable displaced subcapital fractures of the ulna. The early results of this study provide evidence for the efficiency of plate osteosynthesis in the treatment of distal ulna fractures.",

    "abstract": "Introduction The intrapelvic approach was originally described by Hirvensalo et al. from Finland in the early 90ies (8) and a further comparable description was published shortly thereafter by Cole et al. (5). Since then, various modifications have been described. Whereas the ilioinguinal approach was used until then to treat acetabular fractures with relevant anterior column involvement from an extrapelvic view, the intrapelvic approach was developed to address the often accompanied central hip dislocation in these fracture types with relevant fractures of the quadrilateral surface. With this approach a complete different view to the antero-medial acetabular pathology was possible. The view from more medial allows a better direct access to joint structures \"below\" the pelvic brim in the true pelvis (intrapelvic) in contrast to the extrapelvic access with the ilioinguibnal approach. Meanwhile, the surgical technique has been described in detail and some modifications and tricks have been published (5, 8, 10, 13, 19). The intrapelvic approach offers several advantages compared to the ilioinguinal approach: • lower invasiveness without substantial muscle detachment, • direct view of the superior pubic rami from superior and medial, the inferior anterior column and the quadrilateral surface up to the posterior border of the posterior column at the greater sciatic notch, • reduction and fixation of the anterior column and the quadrilateral surface under direct visualization, • reduction of antero-superior marginal impactions under direct visualization, • low risk of heterotopic ossification, • low risk of lesions to the lateral cutaneous femoral nerve. The aim of the third part of \"standard approaches of the acetabulum\" is to report on the special topics indication, positioning, exposure, incision, dissection, the anatomical basis of osteosynthesis and present results using the via the intrapelvic approach.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYGrade III open fractures are associated with infectious complications in 25-66% of injuries.Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) applied to an injured soft tissue coverage provides an impermeable barrier between the injured structures and the external environment, in addition to early secretion draining and a positive effect on the site of application.All this also prevents secondary bacterial contamination.The objective of the study was to compare the results of treatment methods in view of infectious complications in patients with soft tissue injury in grade-III open fractures managed either by NPWT and primary closure or by covering with combined dressing fabric (COM) in combination with continual wound lavage. MATERIAL AND METHODSThis retrospective study comprised 77 patients with 80 grade III open fractures treated in the years 2008-2012; of these, 39 patients with 41 fractures met the inclusion criteria and were finally evaluated.The patients were divided into two groups.The control group included 19 patients with 20 fractures treated by the standard surgical procedure using stabilisation with an external fixator or intramedullary nail, thorough soft tissue debridement, continual wound lavage and suture of skin lesions or using a primary coverage of the defect with COM.The trial group consisted of 20 patients with 21 fractures treated according to the same principle, but NPWT was applied to injured soft tissue coverage first and skin suture or any other type of skin defect coverage was carried out when the healing process was good and bacteriological findings were negative.The results of both methods were evaluated based on the following criteria: development of superficial or deep infection in the wound, interval to negative bacteriological findings and osteomyelitis rate.The results were analysed by Fisher's exact test and the Man Whitney U test. RESULTSInfectious complications were recorded in a total of 15 (37%) fractures: 11 (55%) in the control group and four (19.1%) in the trial group (p = 0.025).Recurrent infection was observed in five control group fractures (25%) and in none of the trial group fractures (p = 0.021).Osteomyelitis was found only in two control group fractures.The average interval before negative bacteriological results were obtained was 22 days in the control group and 12 days in the trial group (p = 0.001). DISCUSSIONThe NPWT use as a temporary coverage of soft tissue defects in open fractures results in a significant reduction of infectious complications, as shown by many relevant studies including this study.In comparison with Gopal's \"fix and flap\" concept, the NPWT in our patient group had slightly higher incidence of infectious complications (15.4% versus 19.1%).However, these results can be achieved only if a specialist in reconstructive surgery and appropriate technical facilities are readily available.If this is not possible, then the NPWT, in comparison with conventional methods, provides the best possible way of temporary protection for an injured soft tissue coverage. CONCLUSIONSApplication of NPWT within the primary treatment of injured soft tissue coverage in grade III open fractures results in a statistically significant reduction of bacterial contamination at the site of injury, as well as a reduction of the subsequent incidence of infectious complications.Primary application of NPWT also significantly reduced the risk of recurrent infection.",

MATERiAL ANd METHOdSin the period from 9/2007 to 1/2020, a total of 33 subtalar arthrodesis were performed in 31 patients aged 19-66 years (mean 48 years, median 50 years).The indication for arthrodesis was subtalar arthritis causing pain and gait disorders, or hindfoot deformities (most commonly after a calcaneus bone fracture).The arthroscopic assisted subtalar arthrodesis was performed with autologous tricortical bone block graft harvesting from the pelvis, supplemented by autologous cancellous bone graft.Stabilization was achieved by cannulated screws inserted in neutral ankle position.Patients in our retrospective study were followed up for a mean of 48 months (range, 24-130 months).The patients were evaluated preoperatively and at 2 years after surgery.The hindfoot angles and height (TCA -talocalcaneal angle, CiA -calcaneal inclination angle, TCH -talocalcaneal height) were evaluated on radiographs, bone union was assessed on radiographs and CT scans.The clinical assessment was performed using the ankle-hindfoot scale (AHS) of AOFAS (AOFAS score). RESULTSThe preoperative AOFAS score was 35-68 points (mean 52, median 54), the postoperative AOFAS score at 2 years after arthrodesis was 58-94 points (mean 82, median 82).Both the mean and median values of AOFAS score showed a significant progress from the poor result to the good and excellent result.After 2 years the TCA value decreased in 18 patients (56%) by no more than 3°.The CiA decrease observed in 21 patients (64%) was by 1° on average.The TCH decrease of 1-5 mm after 2 years since the surgery was seen in 16 patients.in 2 patients incomplete healing of arthrodesis was observed, manifested as a clinically asymptomatic non-union.No deep infection was reported. diSCUSSiONin agreement with the current literature, the arthroscopic subtalar arthrodesis has been confirmed to be a safe method for the management of consequences of hindfoot fractures, with minimum complications and leading to accelerated bone fusion.differences can be found in the approach, position, use of cancellous bone graft and surgical techniques. in recent years, prone position, posterior approaches, use of cancellous bone graft, distraction and fixation with 2-3 screws divergently inserted into the bone prevail.The degree of healing of the bone fusion is generally an important factor.in our study population, non-healing was recorded in 2 patients, namely in the form of a clinically silent non-union.Neurological or early complications and/or osteosynthesis material failure occurred in up to a maximum of 10% of cases.The conclusive results of minimally invasive arthrodesis based on the AOFAS score have been confirmed by us as well as by most authors. CONCLUSSiONSOur study confirmed that the arthroscopic assisted subtalar arthrodesis is a successful, reliable and safe minimally invasive method, with minimum complications, leading to stable arthrodesis.",

    "abstract": "Several options for treatment of valgus deformity in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) have been described. In 2002 the lateral approach to the valgus knee with Z-plasty of the articular capsule involving part of Hoffa's fat pad started to be used in our department. In this study the surgical technique, including steps for gradual deformity correction, is described and shortterm results are evaluated.A total of 1136 TKAs were carried out in the period from 1994 to 2004; of these 131 (11 %) were performed on valgus knee. After a visit to the Schulthess Klinik and personal communication with Dr. med. T. Drobny, we began to use the lateral approach to the valgus knee, with Z-plasty of the articular capsule and involvement of Hoffa's fat pad. Forty-two patients (35 women and 7 men) were treated by this technique. The average age of this group was 71 years, and the average preoperative valgus deformity was 20.5 degrees.A skin incision is made along the midline and, in its lower part, it is led toward the lateral border of the tibial tubercle. The joint capsule is incised in the superficial layer at about 2 cm lateral to the patella. Dissection of the superficial and deep layers of the capsule is made laterally, extending up to 4 cm. After joint exposure, the fat pad is separated from the medial attachment and preserved, on a lateral pedicle, with the patellar ligament. If needed, this flap can be used to close a defect in the distal articular capsule. By including both parts of the joint capsule produced by Z-plasty, medial transposition of the patella is achieved after suture. The deformity is corrected in a sequential manner according to its severity and the effect of release in each step, as follows: 1) Point incisions of the iliotibial band at a 5-cm distance above the articular fissure (piecrusting). 2) Subperiosteal elevation of the iliotibial band attachment from Gerdy's tubercle. 3) Release of the posterolateral capsule. 4) Subperiosteal release of the femoral attachment of the lateral collaterall ligament and dissection of the popliteal muscle. 5) Release of the lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle. The evaluation of patients was based on the Knee Society Clinical Rating System.Using this surgical technique, correction of deformity was achieved in all patients. The knee axis after surgery improved to 6.6 degrees on the average. The more extensive dissection of lateral structures resulted in larger blood losses, which were on average 1150 ml, and the procedure also required a longer tourniquet application (55 min). The patients were followed up on average for 22 months. The Knee Score assessment in the whole group (42 knees) was on average 90.6 points, with 92.0, 93.3 and 87.9 for rating system categories A, B and C, respectively. The average range of motion was 0 to 118 degrees , and none of the patients reported femoropatellar problems. Revision surgery for hematoma was performed in one patient and puncture of the knee joint had to be done in several patients. Redress for postoperative motion restriction was carried out in three patients and one patient underwent repeat surgery for infection.The lateral approach with Z-plasty of the capsule and fat pad involvement provides maximal release of and access to the lateral structures, reduces the risk of insufficient blood supply of the patella and also resolves patellar subluxation. This technique thus allows us to reduce the probability of developing femoropatellar problems that are frequently responsible for poor TKA outcomes in the valgus knee.The technique described here is an effective approach to the valgus knee requiring total replacement. It provides good access to exposed lateral structures and, with the use of Z-plasty, permits correct alignment and tracking of the patella. In addition, it minimally interferes with blood supply to the patella and completely avoids problems associated with suture of the articular capsule.",

    "abstract": "Although great advances have been made in both radiological diagnosis and antibiotic therapy of microbial infections, the treatment of spinal infections remains a major clinical challenge. Many of the patients affected are referred to spinal units with long delays. The general population is ageing and the number of immunocompromised patients, as well as the number of operative procedures for spinal disorders are increasing. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical presentations of spinal infections, options for their diagnosis, indications for treatment and their risk factors and the results of surgery.The group of 112 patients evaluated after the treatment of spinal infection comprised 63 men and 49 women at an average age of 59.4 years (range, 17 to 84). The average follow-up was 3.2 years (range, 6 months to 8 years). Of these, 82 patients had primary hematogenous infection, 29 had post-operative infection,and one had an infected gun shot wound. Thirty-six patients showed neurological deficit and six were paraplegic. The diagnostic methods included FBC, CRP and EST tests, examination of blood cultures, aspirates and biopsy samples from the infected site, bone scintigraphy, MRI and CT scanning. Indications for surgery included an infection not responding to conservative treatment,with existing or impending spinal instability, and with or without neurological deficit. The surgical management involved transpedicular drainage of the abscess, wound debridement from the posterior approach and instrumented spondylodesis. Surgery which included spinal decompression with radical excision of infected tissue was augmented with posterolateral instrumented fusion and/or anterior stabilization, as indicated.Of the 112 patients treated, seven died of uncontrollable sepsis after surgery; the remaining 105 were followed up. Another four patients died of causes unrelated to the spinal problem treated within 12 months. All patients recovered except for two in whom the infection persisted, but 13 required more than one surgical procedure. One patient with CSF leakage failed to heal after five interventions. The most frequently isolated infectious agents were Staphylococus aureus, Staphylococus epidermidis and E. coli. Of the 33 patients with neurological deficit, 24 improved by one or two Frankel grades. The neurological status of six paraplegic patients did not improve, but their functional findings did after stabilization of the spine. Clinical evaluation showed 47 (44.7 %) very good, 40 (38 %) good, eight (7.6 %) unchanged and 10 (9.5 %) poor outcomes.Early diagnosis is a prerequisite for good treatment outcomes. Clinical examination, results of laboratory tests, and scintigraphy and MRI findings play the key role. When progressing osteolysis is suspected, a CT scan is necessary. Debridement should be as radical as possible, but always in compliance with the patient's health state. At an advanced stage of disease, spinal stabilization is important because it allows us to remove infected tissue. Intravenous and then oral antibiotic therapy at 2 to 4 and 6 to 12 weeks of follow-up is mandatory. The management of spinal infections is a complex process requiring good multidisciplinary cooperation.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was a retrospective evaluation of our patients with post-dysplastic hips treated by cemented or non-cemented total hip arthroplasty (THA) in order to ascertain which type and position of the acetabular component was most effective.In the years 1999-2002, 111 THA procedures were performed in 93 patients, 76 women and 17 men, with post-dysplastic hip arthritis. The average age of the patients at the time of implantation was 52.6 years. On the basis of pre-operative radiographic findings, the patients' conditions were evaluated using the Hartofilakidis classification into three disease categories: dysplasia, low dislocation and high dislocation, and the patients were placed in two groups. Group 1 included 78 patients, and group 2 comprised 26 patients. None of our patients was classified as having high dislocation. Thirty-nine of these patients had previously undergone surgery for dysplastic hips.A total of 104 THAs were evaluated, because radiographic data was incomplete in seven cases. In addition to X-ray findings, the prosthesis type (cemented, hybrid, non-cemented), post-operative complications and signs of loosening were included in the evaluation. Clinical outcomes were assessed by the Harris score. The follow-up terminating on 31st December 2005 was 67 months on the average.In group 1 patients, the average Harris score increased from 38.6 to 80.3 points and in group 2 patients from 35.5 to 84.9 points, mostly with excellent and good results. In 72.1 % of the hips, a press-fit acetabular component was implanted. In 55.8 % of the cases, the acetabular component was implanted off the anatomical center of rotation, into the high hip center, with the range from 9 to 20 mm and an average of 15 mm. The average limb lengthening was 2.5 cm, ranging from 1.0 to 3.5 cm.Our results show that it is more effective to use non-cemented THA for post-dysplastic hips. The implantation of a noncemented acetabular component into the high center provides better covering of the cup with solid bone, without the necessity of cotyloplasty or structural graft use. Also, it does not markedly affect hip function or patients' subjective feelings.",

    "abstract": "A number of studies have reported a significant improvement of the postoperative alignment, when computer-navigated total knee arthroplasty (TKA) was compared with conventional techniques. However, no studies are available on the functional and patient-relevant outcomes after computer-assisted knee replacement. In a prospective, randomized trial comparing 27 computer-assisted TKAs with 25 conventional implantations, the Knee Society Score was used to assess functional status, and the WOMAC questionnaire was used to record the disease-specific, patient-relevant outcome. At a twelve-month follow-up no significant difference was detected between the two patient groups in either the scores or the number of complications and range of postoperative knee flexion. The results are in agreement with those reported in other studies on the effect of conventional TKA. With the patient group of this size it can be concluded that computer-navigated TKA gives short-term resuits comparable with those achieved by conventional methods of implantation.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe femoral head of a bipolar hip prosthesis (BHP) consists of a steel outer shell and polyethylene liner with an inner steel head moving inside.In this study, indications for and advantages of this endoprosthesis are evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODSThe author presents indications and the surgical technique on a group of 79 patients, mostly physically active women aged 70 to 80 years.A BHP is largely indicated in patients with femoral neck fractures, and then in injuries to the proximal femur that leave the articular surface of the acetabulum intact. RESULTSIn the group of 79 patients, four had dislocation of the prosthesis which, in two, occurred due to stem malalignment.This was repaired by reimplantation.At 3-to 9-year follow-up, 54 patients were evaluated.Protrusion into the acetabulum, which is a feared complication of classical hemiarthroplasty, was not found.Nor was stem failure detected.The endoprosthesis was pain free in nearly all the patients.The Harris hip score was influenced by co-existing diseases of old age. DISCUSSIONMost of the authors dealing with BHP appreciate its advantages in comparison with classical hemiarthroplasty, some even prefer it to total hip arthroplasty and also in indications other than acute injury.The main advantage of BHP is its better stability and, in comparison with total hips arthroplasty, its simpler implantation, which makes the surgical procedure less demanding for both the patient and the surgeon. CONCLUSIONSBipolar hip hemiarthroplasty is a treatment option in acute surgery for proximal femoral fractures.Its advantages include less stress and strain for the patients than in total hip arthroplasty, and greater stability and lower risk of protrusion into the acetabulum than in classical hip hemiarthroplasty.

    "abstract": "Surgical treatment of spondylodiscitis is associated with many complications and raises a number of issues for discussion. The aim of the study was to evaluate a group of patients who had undergone surgery for inflammation of the spine, and to discuss the optimal operative procedure.Between January 2000 and February 2005, a total of 81 patients were treated at our department for pyogenic or tuberculous spondylodiscitis. Of these, 31 (11 women and 20 men) underwent surgery. Patients treated by CT-guided abscess drainage puncture with antibiotic therapy were not included. Indications for surgery included neurological deficit in 20 patients, deformity or mechanic instability in six, and progressing septic condition in three patients.Simple decompression of nerve structures from the posterior approach, combined with drainage, was performed in seven patients, revision surgery from the posterior approach and fusion completed with suction drainage was done in five, anterior radical debridement and stabilization of the anterior column by replacement of the vertebral body was performed in 15 patients, and an anterior procedure completed with posterior instrumentation and fusion was carried out in four patients. The patients were followed up and evaluated at 3, 6 and 12 months post-operatively.Improvement in neurological deficit by one or more Frankel grades was recorded in 30 % of the patients treated by posterior decompression and suction drainage, and in 83 % of the patients undergoing anterior debridement and stabilization. Further progression of deep infection requiring revision surgery and implant removal occurred in one patient. Clinical outcomes assessed as good or satisfactory were found in 68 % and poor results were in 32 % of the patients.The selection of an optimal surgical procedure in spondylodiscitis depends on the primary localization of infectious lesions. In a typical anterior form of spondylodiscitis, anterior debridement and suction drainage are preferred. Reconstruction of the anterior spinal column in the presence of major destruction, and stabilization of an infected spine still remain challenging issues.Radical debridement with deformity correction and segmental stabilization provide an efficient method of treatment for the most frequent anterior forms of pyogenic and tuberculous spondylodiscitis. The use of titan implants does not significantly increase the risk of persistent infection or its recurrence.",

    "abstract": "Orthopedic tuberculosis is number one in non-pulmonary forms of tuberculosis and, among these, knee joint tuberculosis ranks second after spinal tuberculosis. Arthritic lesions are currently treated by total knee arthroplasty (TKA).A group of 10 patients who, after having gone through tuberculous gonarthritis, underwent TKA was evaluated for the period from 1980 to 2005. It consisted of six women and four men, whose average age at the time of arthroplasty was 65 years.The most frequent indication for TKA after tuberculous gonarthritis was post-inflammatory arthritis (80 %); the other indication was fibrous ankylosis (20 %). No conversion of arthrodesis to total replacement was carried in our group. All patients underwent pre-operative microbiological tests including PCR, as well as histological examination. Pre- and post-operative prophylaxis included anti-tuberculous (AT) drugs (rifampicin and izoniazid) combined with a cephalosporin antibiotic. AT drugs were administered for 3 to 5 months after surgery in accordance with the results of laboratory tests.In 1980 to 2005, ten patients after tuberculous gonarthrosis underwent TKA at our department. No complications were recorded. The average range of flexion was 0 to 90 degrees. None of the patients needed any walking aid, and all were able of full weight-bearing on the treated limb. There was no recurrent tuberculosis in this group.Any implantation of an endoprosthesis in a post-inflammatory terrain is always difficult. Subjective evaluation by the patients was good. At long-term follow-up, clinical, radiographic and laboratory findings were within standards, which is in agreement with the results of other authors. The pre- and post-operative therapy with AT drugs and antibiotics was used in all patients.Compared to arthrodesis, TKA brings about a significant improvement in the patient's mobility as well as a better quality of life. Before the patient is indicated for TKA, emphasis is placed on recording a thorough medical history, complete laboratory examination, radiography, CT scans, or magnetic resonance imaging, relevant orthopedic, internal and pulmonary examination including X-ray of the heart and lungs, as well as the assessment of the patient's somatic and psychical state with regard to the post-operative rehabilitation course.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYTo define the role of ultrasonography in the diagnostic algorithm for patients with shoulder joint injury and to show its potential for the detection of rotator cuff tears and Hill-Sachs lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODSA group of 52 patients with clinical signs of shoulder disorders following trauma who were treated in the 2005-2006 period.After ultrasonographic examination, all patients were surgically treated by arthroscopy.In 12 of them an additional magnetic resonance imaging was carried out before surgery.The results of ultrasonography were compared with arthroscopic findings in terms of detection of full-thickness rotator cuff tears and Hill-Sachs lesions.These were the two most frequent traumatic lesions detected by ultrasonography. RESULTSA full-thickness tear of the rotator cuff was correctly diagnosed in 13 patients.In further four the ultrasound finding was incorrectly interpreted as a moderate rotator cuff injury.For the detection of full-thickness tears, the sensitivity of the method was 76 %, its specificity was 94 % and accuracy 88 %.The detection of Hill-Sachs lesions by ultrasonography correlated with arthroscopic findings, with a sensitivity of 86 %, specificity of 93 % and accuracy of 92 %. DISCUSSIONA number of studies report on options for the ultrasonographic detection of various types of traumatic injury to shoulder structures.Examination by ultrasound shows skeletal surfaces, thus permitting detection of a minor bone injury or a Hill-Sachs defect, and reveals soft tissue shoulder structures including tendons, ligaments and bursae.In some studies the possibility of detecting rotator cuff tears by ultrasonography has been described.Although sufficient accuracy of ultrasonographic examination in this region is reported, the results are not consistent. CONCLUSIONSOur results show high roliability of ultrasonography for the diagnosis of shoulder trauma.The detection of full-thickness rotator cuff tears and Hill-Sachs lesions was possible with sufficient accuracy, which makes this quick, simple and available examination a valuable diagnostic tool.The finding of a rotator cuff tear is important information for the orthopaedist and, in the majority of patients, is also an indication for surgery.An ultrasonographic examination can therefore be regarded as a standard part of the diagnostic algorithm for shoulder trauma.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYTo evaluate the efficacy of surgical treatment in pelvic deformities associated with neuromuscular spine deformity, using radiographic parameters and clinical outcome analysis.In the lumbo-pelvic region, spinal deformity is most frequently combined with pelvic obliquity, lumbar hyperlordosis, hip deformity and leg-length discrepancy.Pelvic deformities include an excessive posterior or anterior pelvic tilt, obliquity or rotation and windblown hip syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHODSIn the period from 1994 to 2006, 42 paediatric patients (28 girls and 14 boys) underwent surgical correction of spine and pelvic deformities by the Luque-Galveston technique.The group included 25 patients with an underlying diagnosis of a spastic form of cerebral palsy, seven patients affected by paralysis, six with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and four with spinal muscular atrophy.The average age at the time of surgery was 14 years and 3 months and the patients were followed-up for 7 years and 5 months on the average.The results were evaluated on the basis of findings on antero-posterior and lateral radiographs including the pelvis, hip joints and the whole spine.The patients were examined before surgery, then immediately after it, and at yearly follow-up intervals. RESULTSThe mean pre-operative pelvic obliquity was 37°(+/-6.0)and it improved to 9° (+/-4.5)post-operatively.Horizontalization of the sacrum was corrected from the mean preoperative value of 19° (+/-5.0) to 37° (+/-6.1)post operatively.This difference was statistically significant (p=0.001).Scoliosis curve correction achieved by the surgery was from 79° (+/-21.3)pre-operatively to 35° (+/-14.5)post-operatively, with a mean correction rate of 56 %.The following complications were recorded: faulty insertion of the pelvic fixation resulting in perforation of the medial cortical substance of the iliac crest in one patient, pseudoarthrosis in the region of thoraco-lumbal junction in two patients, instrumentation failure with the need of pseudoarthrosis resection and re-instrumentation in one patient, and deep infection requiring wound irrigation and longterm antibiotic therapy. DISCUSIONThe surgical correction of pelvic deformity is always associated with operative treatment of scoliosis.However, the procedure is regularly preceded by surgical correction of muscular imbalance of the lower limbs and pelvis and of hip deformities.The surgical stabilization of spinal and pelvic deformities brings about the loss of some alternative motor stereotypes.This disadvantage is compensated for by a better sitting stability and better prospects for prosthetic care. CONCLUSIONSThe radiographic and clinical findings in the patients treated showed good correction of pelvic deformities in the frontal and sagittal planes.Pelvic obliquity correction thus contributes to the improvement of sitting stability in physically disabled patients.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYCervical spine injuries in young adults are usually caused by high-energy trauma.However, a typical injury to the cervical spine can also occur in older patients, in whom it is often associated with the presence of osteoporosis and relatively low-energy trauma, similarly to distal radial or proximal femoral fractures, or fractures of the thoracolumbar spine.The aim of this study was to evaluate a group of elderly patients with cervical spine injuries treated at our department. MATERIALIn the period from 2001 to 2005, 66 patients older than 65 years were treated for cervical spine injury at the Department of Spinal Surgery of the Motol University Hospital in Prague.Of these, the 53 patients treated surgically, and followed up longer than 6 months after surgery, were evaluated in detail in this retrospective study.They included 30 men and 23 women at an average age of 75.5 years (range, 65-92 years).",

    "abstract": "Calcareous tendinitis (calcifying tendinitis) of the shoulder is a disease characterized by the formation of macroscopic deposits of hydroxyapatite (a crystalline calcium phosphate) in any tendon of the rotator cuff. It presents clinically as sudden intense pain flares resembling gout. It can be treated most effectively by invasive methods such as surgery or needling. The latter is associated with lower risks and fewer organizational and financial demands. The aim of this study is to promote the use of needling in orthopaedic outpatient departments where ultrasonography is available for diagnosis and guided intervention.In the period from 2000 to 2006, a total of 38 shoulders (36 patients) with calcareous tendinitis were treated. In one patient both shoulders were effected five years apart, and one patient experienced recurrence in the same shoulder after 2 years. Needling was performed in 36 shoulders, two cases were treated arthroscopically.Needling as the primary therapy was indicated immediately after the diagnosis had been established usually on the first patient's visit, and was carried out under local anaesthesia as an outpatient procedure. The tendon with calcareous deposits was perforated with a needle under sonographic guidance and, in the majority of cases, this calcareous material was aspirated. When signs of subacromial bursitis were present, Depomedrol was administered during or following the procedure.The outcome was evaluated at an average follow-up of 23.4 months (range, 5 to 89). All outcomes were from excellent to satisfactory, with no poor result. Five patients underwent further treatment for impingement syndrome which two of them had already had before the needling procedure. One patient reported slightly restricted range of motion due to subsequent adhesive capsulitis. However, she was not limited in her daily activities and therefore did not require any further therapy. Five patients with occasional unspecific complaints, usually in relation to weather changes or exercise, did not ask for any further treatment either.Needling is an effective method to treat calcareous tendinitis and provides results comparable with those of arthroscopy, but without operative risks. It is much less expensive (10- to 20-times) with no additional demands for either the patient or the institution. Today, the majority of orthopaedic outpatient departments in the Czech Republic have the necessary facilities and should include needling in the procedures routinely performed.",

    "abstract": "Owing to advances in operative techniques and biotechnology, bone replacement biocompatible materials have recently come into focus for orthopaedic and trauma surgeons. Bone lytic lesions, such as tumorous bone defects, diseases simulating cancer, chronic inflammatory lesions or skeletal injuries, often require stabilisation of the skeleton and treatment of the bone affected. Juvenile bone cysts are benign lytic lesions posing a threat to bone compactness in childhood. They are benign, fluid containing bone cavities, lined with a membrane consisting of thin vascularised connective tissue with scattered osteoclast-like cells. These cysts are usually diagnosed between; five and twenty years of age outside this age range their occurrence is rare.The group comprised the patients treated for juvenile bone cysts at the Department of Paediatric Surgery, Orthopaedics and Traumatology between 2001 and 2007. In the 2001-2003 period, 24 patients were treated with Depo-Medrol. Between January 2005 and December 2007, 31 patients with the same diagnosis were treated by minimally invasive application of chronOs Inject.The aim of the study was to compare these two methods of juvenile cyst therapy, i.e., the most widely used method of repetitive Depo-Medrol applications against the novel method based on filling the cyst with chronOs Inject, a synthetic biocompatible resorbable material. An alternative hypothesis assumed that the new method would result in fewer necessary operations in patients with juvenile cyst and better treatment outcomes, as evaluated by Neer's criteria for bone cyst therapy.A total of 20 surgical interventions were performed in 18 patients treated by chronOs Inject and 100% cyst healing without necessity of additional surgery was achieved. Of the 24 patients treated with Depo-Medrol, 12 patients (50%) showed cyst healing wit no further surgery required. A total of 69 applications were needed.An impetus to introduce the novel method of juvenile cyst treatment stemmed from the unsatisfactory results of the previous treatment with repetitive Depo-Medrol applications requiring additional open surgery and spongioplasty to fill the cyst. For filling cysts and other benign bone defects jeopardizing bone stability, such as deep metaphyseal fibrous defect, non-ossifying fibroma, enchondroma or fibrous dysplastic lesion, synthetic tricalcium phosphate in the form of chronOs granules was used, but without the possibility of minimally invasive percutaneous application. As soon s the resorbable chronOs Inject became available, the minimally invasive method of filling cysts with this material was adopted.The results showed that, in the patients treated by the chronOs Inject method, the outcomes achieved were significantly better than those in the patients treated with Depo-Medrol. The difference was in the number of operations needed, which were significantly fewer in the chronOs Inject method, as well as in the overall treatment outcome, with significantly more frequent excellent results in the chronOs Inject method.",

In one patient the replacement was performed bilaterally. Two patients had in the contralateral knee the same type of prosthesis with a femoral chrome-cobalt component.The mean age at the time of operation was 65.2 years (range, 38-81 years).The primary indication was 14 times osteoarthritis and 5 times rheumatoid arthritis. The average follow-up period was 6.5 years (range, 2.1-8.5 years).Patients included in the study regardless of age, body mass and the basic diagnosis, agreed with the use of the ceramic femoral component. The evaluation covered a range of motion, mechanical axis, joint stability, pain, swelling, ability to walk on level ground and on stairs, subjective satisfaction (EULAR Knee Chart). Radiograph were assessed at one year intervals in two projections to identify the incidence of radiolucency around the implant. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used and compared with the survival curve in identical chrome-cobalt implants.At he final follow-up, 14 knees were evaluated, because 3 patients died without any connection with the implant, in one case the tibial component migrated due to necrosis of the tibial condyle in a patient with RA and two implants had to be revised and replaced due to polyethylene wear. No infection or negative tissue reaction was recorded in the evaluated group. The average flexion range was 109 degrees. All knees were stable and without swelling, in two cases there occurred slight femoropatellar pain. Twelve patients were fully satisfied, 2 patients were satisfied with a certain reservation. The differences in the course of the survival curves of chrome-cobalt and ceramic implants were statistically insignificant.Although the use of zirconia ceramics in vitro reduces the amount of polyethylene wear, the clinical outcomes of total knee replacements as compared to the hip are not convincing. One of the causes may be the substantially different and more complex biomechanics of the knee. Tribology improvement of the femoral ceramic component cannot compensate the deficiencies in the joint balancing in flexion and extension. The economically and technologically demanding production of these implants may be justified in patients with allergies caused by chrome-cobalt components.The results of mid-term follow-up of the use of zirconia ceramic femoral components proved no impact on the improvement of the period of survival of the knee implant. No adverse response to the material or mechanical failure of the ceramic components was encountered. Key words: total knee replacement, zirconia ceramic femoral component, TKR mid-term results, ceramic knee survival curve.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Regional anaesthesia for the lower extremity distal to the ankle joint, knows as anaesthetic ankle block or foot block, involves a series of injections of local anaesthetic to block the peripheral nerves that supply innervation to the foot. Since the tibial nerve block is not always effective, the aim of this study was to design a modified technique of anaesthetic application. MATERIAL The study was carried out on 30 human cadavers provided by the Institute of Anatomy, 1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, and included data on a total of 60 lower extremities. METHODS Information about position of the tibial nerve (or its branches, i.e., the medial plantar and lateral plantar nerves) and the sural nerve was obtained using a set of special measurement devices designed for this purpose. The following distances were measured; the length of a basic line, i.e., distance between the posterior margin of the medial maleollus and the medial edge of the Achilles tendon (at the level of the upper part of the heel bone); the distance between the medial edge of the Achilles tendon and the tibial nerve; and the distance between the tibial nerve (its deep location) in the neurovascular plexus and the basic line. The location of the sural nerve behind the lateral maleollus was found by measuring the nerve distance from the posterior margin of the lateral maleollus and measuring the distance between this margin and the lateral edge of th Achilles tendon. RESULTS The distance between the posterior margin of the medial maleollus (medial edge of the sulcus for the posterior tibial muscle tenton) and the medial edge of the Achilles tendon (at the level of the upper part of the heel bone) was 46.3 mm +/- 5.2 mm. The depth of tibial nerve location, i.e. distance from the basic line to the neurovascular plexus, was 11.6 mm +/- 1.3 mm. The distance between the posterior margin of the lateral maleollus and the lateral edge of the Achilles tendon (at the level of the upper part of the heel bone) was 37.1 mm +/- 4.3 mm. The sural nerve was located at a distance of approximately 18.3 mm +/- 1.9 mm from the posterior edge of the lateral maleollus. DISCUSSION The study was concluded by proposing a modified technique of local anaesthetic ankle block using two points of anaesthetic injection. The first point is located immediately in front of the medial edge of the Achilles tendon and above the upper edge of the calcaneus. The anaesthetic applied will block the tibial and sural nerves, with the sural nerve being blocked by the anaesthetic delivered with a needle advanced through the soft tissues ventral to the Achilles tendon. The second area of application is located at 2 cm above the ventral fold of the ankle joint on the lateral edge of the anterior tibial muscle tendon and provides subcutaneous infiltration anaesthesia for the superficial and deep peroneal nerves and the saphenous nerve. CONCLUSIONS The results of this anatomical study provided a basis for a modified technique of regional anaesthesia of the foot. Its major clinical attributes involve reduced necessity to manipulate with the patient, and sensory and motor blockage of all nerves supplying innervation to the foot from only two points of injection. Key words: ankle block, foot block, regional anaesthesia.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to verify whether ultrasonography can be considered a reliable method for the diagnosis of low-grade renal trauma.The group investigated included patients with grade I or grade II blunt renal trauma, as classified by the AAST grading system, in whom ultrasonography alone or in conjunction with computed tomography was used as a primary diagnostic method. B-mode ultrasound with a transabdominal probe working at frequencies of 2.5 to 5.0 MHz was used. Every finding of post-traumatic changes in the renal tissues, i.e., post-contusion hypotonic infiltration of the renal parenchyma or subcapsular haematoma, was included. The results were statistically evaluated by the Chi-square test with the level of significance set at 5%, using Epi Info Version 6 CZ software.The group comprised 112 patients (43 women, 69 men) aged between 17 and 82 years (average, 38 years). It was possible to diagnose grade I or grade II renal injury by ultrasonography in only 60 (54%) of them. The statistical significance of ultrasonography as the only imaging method for the diagnosis of low-grade renal injury was not confirmed (p=0.543)Low-grade renal trauma is a problem from the diagnostic point of view. It usually does not require revision surgery and, if found during repeat surgery for more serious injury of another organ, it usually does not receive attention. Therefore, the macroscopic presentation of grade I and grade II renal injury is poorly understood, nor are their microscopic findings known, because during revision surgery these the traumatised kidneys are not usually removed and their injuries at autopsy on the patients who died of multiple trauma are not recorded either.The results of this study demonstrated that the validity of ultrasonography for the diagnosis of low-grade renal injury is not significant, because this examination can reveal only some of the renal injuries such as perirenal haematoma. An injury to the renal parenchyma is also indicated by hypoechogenic areas of varying sizes in the renal cortex. A negative ultrasonographic finding is no proof of the absence of renal trauma. As low-grade renal injury is difficult to detect by mere clinical examination or by a single imaging method, the authors regard as necessary to actively look for them, taking into consideration the mechanism of injury, haematuria findings and evaluation of ultrasonographic and CT scans.",

    "abstract": "The method of choice for the treatment of severe ankle arthritis is either arthrodesis or joint arthroplasty. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. Arthrodesis is the definitive therapy for severe ankle destruction and instability. Joint arthroplasty has an advantage in maintaining ankle mobility. However, its range of indications and its reliability and durability are more limited. The aim of this study is to present our experience with the AES prosthesis and draw attention to some drawbacks of this surgical treatment.From September 2003 till June 2008, 51 AES ankle replacements were carried out in 51 patients (33 women and 18 men). Their average age at the time of surgery was 53.8 years. The youngest patient was 23 and the oldest was 88 years old. The indication for surgery was rheumatoid arthritis in 10, primary arthritis in six and post-traumatic ankle arthritis in 35 patients.The patients were evaluated in 2008. The follow-up ranged from 4 months to 5 years. The patients were examined for ankle joint mobility and pain. Radiographs were assessed for potential signs of component loosening.The results presented here are short-term ones. The pre-operative AOFAS score of 33.7 increased to 82.3 points post-operatively. The range of motion was on average 20 degrees of plantar flexion and 5 to 10 degrees of dorsiflexion. Thirty- five patients (68.7 %) were free from pain, 11 (21.5 %) experienced slight pain while walking, and five (9.8 %) patients reported more intensive pain in the joint treated. Intra-operative complications included a fracture of the medial malleolus in two (3.9 %) patients subsequently treated with screw osteosynthesis. Post-operatively, seven (13.7 %) patients experienced slow healing of the operative wound. One patient had dislocation of the polyethylene liner at 3 months after surgery. Revision surgery was carried out in seven (13.7 %) patients. Two patients suffering from increasing pain around medial malleolus underwent revision and removal of ossifications. One patient developed necrosis of the talus at 1 year after surgery. She underwent extraction of the prosthesis and ankle arthrodesis with a retrograde locking nail inserted through the heel. A large bony effect arising due to extraction of the necrotic talus was repaired using bone graft. Three (5.8 %) patients developed post-operative instability of the ankle that required revision surgery. The radiographs of another three (5.8 %) patients showed bone cysts and signs of tibial component loosening. Of these, one patient underwent surgical revision with replacement of the polyethylene liner. Cavities were freed from granuloma induced by polyethylene wear debris, and filled with bone graft from the iliac crest.Total ankle replacement is a complicated surgical procedure that may results in various technical difficulties and complications. These are inversely proportional to the surgeon's experience, as also shown by literature data.The longevity of a total ankle replacement depends, much more than in other joint replacements, on an accurate implantation technique and correct indication.",

There were 15 patients, six women and nine men, with 17 treated heels (one man and one woman had bilateral surgery).Using the tendon-splitting approach, a prominence of the posteriosuperior border of the calcaneus was resected and the associated conditions were treated. The evaluation was based on a 1-to-5-degree scale and included the patient's clinical state before and after surgery (pain, shoe-wearing and load tolerance), and pre-operative radiography (presence of Haglund's deformity, ossification of the Achilles tendon and/or adjacent tissues). The study was retrospective.The average age of the patients at the time of surgery was 44.5 years (range, 16 to 60). The minimum follow-up was 6 months (range, 6 to 65 months). X-ray and intra-operative findings showed Haglund's deformity in 13 cases, calcaneal bursitis in six, ossified mass at the insertion of the Achilles tendon in six, intratendinous ossification in two, and partial tendon degeneration and subcutaneous bursitis in one case each. Post-operative relief was recorded in 16 treated heels. The condition in one patient deteriorated, as manifested by heel swelling after exercise and a feeling of tension at the insertion site of the Achilles tendon in forced dorsiflexion of the ankle. An average preoperative score of 4.1 improved to 2.1 post-operatively. No serious complications either overall or at the site of surgery (Achilles tendon rupture, poor wound healing) were found. Three heels retained a slight restriction of motion (up to 10 degrees). One heel showed impaired sensitivity in the region treated.The tendon-splitting approach provides a good view of and easy access to the structures to be operated on. The risk of incomplete resection of the prominence or of leaving sharp edges because of an insufficient view is small. Compared with other methods, this approach allows for concurrent treatment of other conditions that may be present at the insertion site of the Achilles tendon. The tendon-splitting approach does not result in any structural changes of the Achilles tendon.The dorsal longitudinal tendon-splitting approach for surgical treatment of Haglund's deformity is an efficient, undemanding and safe method alternative to lateral or medial approaches used more often. It allows for concurrent treatment of several pathological conditions at the insertion site of the Achilles tendon, such as subcutaneous bursitis, ossified mass at the tendon insertion, tendon degeneration, intratendinous ossification, calcaneal bursitis and Haglund's deformity.",

    "abstract": "Clavicle fractures, especially of the mid third, are an injury commonly seen in clinical practice, therefore, there is constant earnest discussion of the optimal approach to therapy. Until recently clavicle fractures were solely the domain of non surgical management. Even displaced fractures have been successfully managed without surgery. However, complications have been reported after non surgical treatment, the most frequent being post-traumatic shortening of the clavicle with varying functional consequences for the shoulder joint and range of arm motion as well as pseudarthrosis, especially after more severely displaced fractures. Recent studies have now shown that outcomes after non surgical management of displaced fractures or shortening of the clavicle are worse than had been previously assumed. Surgical techniques for the stable fixation of clavicle fractures have been improved and a wider selection of implants for osteosynthesis of these fractures has become available. Although there is widespread consensus that undisplaced or minimally displaced clavicle fractures respond well to non surgical management, optimal treatment of displaced fractures or severe shortening is under scrutiny with regard to both the basic choice between non surgical or surgical management and implant selection. According to current research findings, surgical management of displaced clavicle fractures has advantages and appears to be superior to non surgical management. Intramedullary nailing has proven suitable for simple straight fractures, and plate fixation for multifragmentary fractures.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to compare the medical aspects of alternative surgical methods for treatment of proximal humerus fractures in specific indications (two- and three- fragment fractures).A prospective randomised study on surgical treatment of two- and three-fragment fractures of the proximal humerus was carried out at the Department of Surgery, University Hospital in Hradec Králové, from January 2006 till January 2010. The study comprised patients with proximal humerus fractures indicated for surgical treatment. Study inclusion criteria were as follows: informed consent, AO fracture types A2, A3, B1 or C1, age between 18 and 80 years, and patient compliance. Exclusion criteria included open fracture, associated injury (AIS . 2), open growth plates, or such state of the patient's health that would limit the extent of surgery. Two groups were compared. One included patients treated by the Zifko method of minimally invasive osteosynthesis with intramedullary K-wire insertion (MIO group) and the other (ORIF group) consisted of patients undergoing open reduction with angle-stable osteosynthesis using a Philos plate (Synthes, Switzerland). The patients were randomised to the groups by a computer programme which facilitates the maintenance of homogeneity of the groups compared. The procedure in each patient was based on the sealed-envelope method.The ORIF group comprised 28 patients. It took them an average of 27.2 weeks (9-72) to regain normal upper limb function. The final CM score was 86.6% (64-100%) as compared with the healthy limb. Excellent and good results were achieved in 89% of the patients; complications were recorded in 39% of them. The MIO group included 27 patients. The fractures healed in all of them. Normal upper limb function was regained at an average of 21.4 weeks (13-36). The final CM score was 87.5% (52-100%) in comparison with the healthy limb. Excellent and good results were achieved in 89% and complications developed in 33% of the patients.The statistical evaluation of the results, using the unpaired t-test, did not show any significant differences either in functional outcomes or the number of complications between the two groups. The only significant difference was found in operative times (117 min and 72 min in ORIF and MIO groups, respectively). The difference in time needed to regain limb function (27 and 21 weeks) was at a marginal level of statistical significance. With both methods 89% of excellent and good results were achieved, and a similar number of patients had complications (11 and 9).",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to compare two options of how to get the correct anatomical position of both femoral tunnels, using the transtibial or the anteromedial portal technique, during anatomical double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.A total of 36 patients, 29 men and seven women, underwent double-bundle ACL reconstruction between October 2009 and December 2010. Their average age was 26.5 years. The average interval between ACL injury and reconstruction was 7.4 months. A diagnostic arthroscopy for the treatment of cartilage and meniscal lesions was performed in 21 patients and one-stage ACL reconstruction with diagnostic arthroscopy was carried out in the remaining 15 patients. In all 36 patients, the position of the tip of the guide wire in relation to the anatomical insertion sites of both the anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL) bundles was assessed intra-operatively. Three guide wire positions were found: the tip was in the centre of the native insertion site, the tip was within the insertion site but not in its centre, and the tip was outside the insertion site.Using the transtibial technique through the AM tunnels, the tip of the guide wire was centred within the femoral AM insertion site only in one patient (2.8%), out of the centre but within the AM insertion site in four patients (11.1%) and outside the insertion site in the remaining 31 patients (86.1%). With this technique, the position of the femoral PL tunnels was outside the native PL insertion site in all 36 patients. With the transtibial technique using the PL tunnels, the tip of the guide wire was centred within the femoral AM native insertion in 11 patients (30.5%), out of the centre but still within the AM insertion site in 16 (44.5%) and outside the AM insertion site in nine patients (25%). Aiming for the femoral PL tunnel resulted in the tip of the guide wire being outside the native femoral PL insertion site in all cases. Using the technique of guide wire insertion through an accessory AM portal it was possible to achieve the centres of both the AM and PL native anatomical insertion sites in all 36 patients (100%).We agree with the many authors who recommend the reaming of PL femoral tunnels through an accessory AM portal because the transtibial technique does not allow for the placement of their precise native anatomical positions. Our intraoperative findings showed that the transtibial technique was effective to get the correct anatomical position of AM femoral tunnels just in 30.5% of the patients. In view of the fact that the same results can be achieved with the AM transportal technique in 100% of the patients, we prefer this technique in accordance with the majority of other authors.In anatomical double-bundle ACL reconstruction, the native anatomical position of PL tunnels was achieved in all patients and the native AM tunnels in most of them using the accessory AM portal technique. The transtibial technique proved to be unsatisfactory.",

    "abstract": "Both the range of motion and load transfer of the sacroiliac (SI) joint improve considerably after lumbar spine surgery. When, following surgery, SI joint pain develops in spite of appropriate physical therapy, injection of an anaesthetic with added corticosteroid into the SI joint is a first choice treatment. The aim of this presentation is to provide information on our experience with this therapy.Thirty-four patients after lumbar spine fusion reported lumbalgia different form pain before surgery. In 14 (41%) of them, pain in one of the SI joints was diagnosed as the cause. This group included 12 women and two men at an average age of 56 (range, 47 to 68) years. Ten patients underwent lumbosacral fixation and four had segmental (\"floating\") lumbar spine fusion. All patients experienced lumbalgia at more than 3 months following surgery, at 8 months on the average (range, 4 to 12 months). None of them had SI joint pain before surgery. The diagnosis was based on specific manoeuvres on physical examination of the joint. Each patient was given an injection of 20 mg (0.5 ml) Methylprednisolone (Depo-Medrol®, Pfizer, Puurs, Belgium) and 4.5 ml 1% Mesocain (Zentiva, Praha, CR).They were inquired as to pain relief 24 h later and then at 1, 3 and 6 months after injection. Subjective feelings were assessed by a visual analogue scale (VAS). The results were analysed using descriptive statistics.All patients reported pain relief within 24 h of injection, but not its complete resolution. The average VAS score before and after the blockage of the SI joint was 9.1 points (8-10) and 4.8 points (2-7), respectively; this implies improvement by an average of 4.3 points (1-6), i.e., approximately by 47.3% (12.5-62.5). The duration of effects varied greatly from patient to patient. The average interval between injection and pain recurrence lasted for 5 weeks (1-28). Most frequently, relief was experienced for 2 weeks, or for 6.8 weeks with the standard deviation included. DISCUSSION Sacroiliac joint dysfunction is a very frequent cause of lumbalgia, particularly after lumbar spine surgery. Physical therapy may not always be effective. SI joint arthrodesis is indicated only in rare cases. One of the few possibilities of pain relief involves intra-articular injection of an anaesthetic with corticosteroid for booster effect. The treatment of SI joint blockage after spinal fusion has recently been dealt with in three reports in the international literature; their conclusions are in accordance with the results of this study.Lumbar spine stabilisation surgery may result in overloading the SI joints as the \"adjacent segments\". An intra-articular injection of anaesthetic can be considered a reliable method for ascertaining the SI joint as the source of a patient's problems. However, even with corticosteroid added, pain relief is not usually long-lasting.",

    "abstract": "The variability in width, height, and orientation of spinal pedicles makes pedicle screw insertion a delicate operation. Fluoroscopic guidance often exposes the patient and especially surgeons to relatively high doses of ionising radiation. The use of pulsed fluoroscopy is safer, as compared to continuous fluoroscopy, because of reduced radiation exposure. There are increasing numbers of literature reports regarding the high doses of radiation to which orthopaedic and spine surgeons are exposed during surgical procedures. Spine surgery can be associated with significant radiation exposure to the surgical staff. The purpose of this prospective study was to compare a computer-assisted navigation with a conventional procedure in order to assess if it is possible to reduce radiation exposure while preserving the accuracy of screw placement.The first \"conventional\" group consisted of 30 patients, with an average of 1.9 segments of the lumbar spine stabilised. Screws were inserted transpedicularly under image intensifier guidance. In the second \"navigated\" group of 30 patients, stabilisation of 1,8 segments was performed on average. A CT-free fluoroscopic 2D spinal navigation system (VectorVision, Brain LAB, Germany) was used intra-operatively. It combines image-guided surgery with C-arm fluoroscopy. For each surgery (navigated or not), the duration of irradiation was recorded. The irradiation duration was collected from the X-ray image intensifier. In both groups the screw positioning accuracy was controlled intra-operatively according to Learch's, Acikbas's, and Whitecloud's methods from AP and lateral images and by meticulous pedicle palpation.The irradiation duration calculated to one vertebra (two screws) was significantly shorter in the second (navigated) group (3.4 s) than in the first (conventional) group (14.4 s). The mean duration of data registration was 6.0 minutes (range, 3 to 11 minutes). The mean ratio according to Acikbas's calculation method was 43.2 % (range, 32 % to 74 %) in the first (conventional) group and 44.1 % (range, 35 % to 76 %) in the second (navigated) group.During a conventional surgical procedure many X-ray images are made to control the accuracy of screw insertion. If the trajectory is not satisfying, it must be corrected or the pedicle is drilled again, always with a new fluoroscopic control. The process is repeated until satisfactory orientation is achieved. This is the explanation for a much longer duration of irradiation in conventional procedures. Navigation facilitates the surgical act, enabling us to acquire the right position of all screws, with only an AP image and a lateral image at the beginning of instrumentation for data registration; prolongation of the operative time is irrelevant.Navigation allows us to keep the same accuracy of pedicle screw placement while reducing radiation exposure of the surgeons and operating room staff by about one quarter. In multiple-level vertebral instrumentations this reduction is more pronounced. In centres where many procedures involving spine instrumentation are done every day, the \"saved\" exposure time can amount to hours.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to present the effect and advantages of surgical decompression and dynamic transpedicular stabilisation in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis of the lumbosacral spine.This prospective study involved patients undergoing dynamic transpedicular stabilisation using Isolock or Isobar TTL (Scient X, France) systems. Between June 2003 and June 2009, 65 patients were treated and followed-up. They were aged 35 to 75 years (average, 57.17 years), and there were 32 men and 33 women. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 6 years. Based on indications for surgery they fell into two groups. Group 1 included 52 patients with grade I or II degenerative spondylolisthesis or retrolisthesis. Group 2 (control) consisted of 13 patients with degenerative disc disease or failed back surgery syndrome. The disorder had always been manifested by combined axial and radicular symptoms. Treatment included posterior decompression of nerve structures by laminectomy in conjunction with semi-rigid stabilisation, without fusion. Followup clinical (VAS, ODI), neurological and radiographic examinations were carried out at 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 to 6 years after surgery. The VAS and ODI results of both groups were statistically analysed and compared.During follow-up the ODI values decreased by 54 % (from 58.4 % to 26.8 %) and VAS values by 62 % (from 7.9 to 3.0) as compared with the pre-operative values, and this was statistically significant. When both groups were compared, the VAS values decreased significantly (by 5.61) in Group 1, as compared with Group 2 (decrease by 3.54).In the treatment of pseudospondylolisthesis, the semi-rigid stabilisation with spinal decompression, as presented here, is a convenient alternative to simple decompression without fixation or to various forms of instrumented or non-instrumented arthrodesis. A disadvantage associated with arthrodesis is a higher risk of ASD development; dynamic systems do not allow for reduction of spondylolisthesis and involve a change in sagittal spinal balance, and simple decompression carries the risk of slip progression and recurrent problems.The authors demonstrated that decompression combined with semi-rigid stabilisation had a very good effect on the clinical state of patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis (retrolisthesis) at medium-term follow-up. The procedure was less effective in other indications. Semi-rigid stabilisation with Isobar TTL or Isolock systems prevented the progression of anterolisthesis or retrolisthesis; none of the patients experienced instrumentation failure. Neither symptomatic restenosis nor disc herniation was found in the instrumented segment. Semi-rigid stabilisation can, if necessary, be converted to fusion or disc replacement.",

    "abstract": "Aseptic loosening of total joint replacement (TJR) due to wear of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is regarded as one of the major problems in the field of arthroplasty. This work describes a newly developed method, called MORF, which completely describes the morphology of UHMWPE wear particles. The differences in wear particle morphology may help to elucidate individual differences in TJR failures.During the years 2002-2010, a set of 47 typical damaged periprosthetic tissues, coming from 16 TJR revisions, was collected. Isolated on polycarbonate (PC) filters were quantified. Quantification of the particles consisted in determination of their concentration and description of their morphology by means of the newly developed MORF method. Firstly, the micrographs of isolated UHMWPE particles were obtained with a scanning electron microscope (Quanta 200 FEG; FEI) at two magnifications: x1200 and x6000. Secondly, both high- and low-magnification micrographs were processed by a standard image analysis software (program NIS Elements; Laboratory Imaging) in order to obtain basic morphological descriptors. Finally, the results from image analysis of high- and low- magnification micrographs were combined by means of our own program MDISTR in order to obtain correct particle sizes and shapes.In the first stage, the method was applied to 25 samples and yielded an average particle size of 0.51 µm. In the second stage, the method was further improved in order to calculate not only the size of particles but also the shape of descriptors. The improved method was applied to eight samples and gave an average size of particles (equivalent diameter, D) in the range of 0.27 - 0.60 µm, circularity (C) of 0.66-0.85 and elongation (E) of 1.75-1.79, suggesting that the great majority of particles were approximately spherical. Finally, in the third stage, the MORF method was applied to two exceptional samples which contained extremely small wear particles (D = 18.5 nm and 21.2 nm). The shape of these small wear nano- particles (C = 0.97 and 0.93; E = 1.29 and 1.35) was even more spherical than that of wear microparticles described abo- ve. This was one of the first two studies which proved the presence of UHMWPE wear nanoparticles in vivo.Our newly developed MORF method described in this contribution yields both size and shape descriptors of UHMWPE wear particles, with sizes from 0.1 to 10 µm, which are regarded as most biologically active. The main objective of the method is to yield the highest accuracy. This is achieved by parallel analyses of high- and low-magnification micrographs taken of the same sample. In the end, the two analyses are combined together in order to obtain the correct and complete size and shape description of all particles in the sample. The morphology of UHMWPE wear particles influences TJR lifetime both directly (size and shape of the particles is related to their biological activity) and indirectly (for the given total volumetric wear, size and shape of the particles influence their concentration, which is associated with the biological respon- se of the organism).The authors have developed a new method which yields a complete description of the size and shape of UHMWPE wear particles in periprosthetic tissues. The method, which was called MORF, can be applied to studies of TJR failures and also used to evaluate the quality of different UHMWPE components of TJR. The method is quite universal and therefore can be used not only for analyses of wear particles, but also for other types of particles, such as microparticles in polymer blends or inorganic/metallic nanoparticles.",

    "abstract": "When choosing between metal implants of different materials the surgeon mainly needs to balance the pros and cons of steel and titanium. Economic constraints often do not permit both to be kept in stock and it is necessary to decide beforehand which to choose. The arguments for the use of the \"preferred metal\" vary. The present paper elucidates the practical aspects based on the complex scientific background that has identified the differences between the two metals in their mechanical, electrochemical, biological and application behavior. The data presented here are intended to help the surgeon when he is confronted with different and often complex clinical situations and problems. The following is an overview of different aspects to help with selection of the proper material for the clinical application. The first part concerns mechanical aspects the second part the biological aspects. Both aspects are discussed with the practical application in mind. Nonmetallic implant materials have seen an increasing interest in the recent past. Plastic materials needed improvement to achieve good strength and avoid creep with loss of e.g. compression and minimizing leakage of chemicals.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Irreparable rotator cuff tear continues to be a point of discussion. Several surgical techniques have been proposed so far. None of them, however, can be considered the method of choice. This study presents the first clinical results of superior capsule reconstruction (SCR) using the DX Reinforcement Matrix. MATERIAL AND METHODS The evaluation included patients with the minimum follow-up of 6 months. The follow-up period in these patients was 1 year (6-18 months) on average. The active (AROM) and passive (PROM) ranges of motion were assessed-anterior flexion, abduction, external rotation and external rotation at 90° abduction. The patients were assessed using clinical scores before and after the surgery-pain assessment scale (VAS), UCLA (University of California at Los Angeles) Shoulder Rating Scale and ASES (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons) Shoulder Score. RESULTS In the period from October 2016 to October 2018, a total of 20 SCRs were performed. The mean age of patients was 61 years. Nine patients were clinically assessed, with the mean follow-up of 1 year. The mean UCLA Shoulder Score was 10 points preoperatively. Postoperatively, the values went up to 29 points on average. The reported ASES score was 23.8 points preoperatively. Postoperatively, the mean score was 73.2 points. The VAS subjective pain score ranged around 7 points before the surgery. After the surgery, the mean VAS score was 2 points. The mean active shoulder flexion was 74° preoperatively and 161° postoperatively. The mean active abduction was 74° preoperatively and 161° postoperatively. The mean active external rotation of the shoulder joint was 20° preoperatively and 56° postoperatively. The mean active external rotation at 90° abduction was 21° preoperatively and 82° postoperatively. The changes in all the followed-up mean parameters of UCLA, ASES, VAS, AROM and PROM reported by our group show a relatively high level of substantive significance. DISCUSSION Results of arthroscopic superior capsule reconstruction using the DX Reinforcement Matrix have not been published in literature so far. Compared to the results for fascia lata published in literature, our results are slightly worse. By contrast, our results are similar to those achieved by human dermal allograft. CONCLUSIONS Arthroscopic superior capsule reconstruction currently appears to be the method of choice in unreconstructed supraspinatus and infraspinatus tear. Our group of patients shows that early clinical outcomes of SCR using xenograft are very promising. A significant pain relief and a considerable improvement in the range of motion of the operated shoulder joint were observed. No complication specifically associated with the use of xenograft has been reported as yet. A longer follow-up period and assessment of a larger group of patients will be necessary to confirm the success of this surgical procedure.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Fragility fractures of the pelvic ring in the elderly population are a serious problem in orthopaedics. The treatment options range from conservative treatment to diverse operative options. We present a balloon guided new technique of implanting cement augmented screws aiming at improved implant anchorage and reduced cement leakage. MATERIAL AND METHODS We describe a new technique of balloon- guided cement augmented iliosacral screws. After the balloon has been insufflated and contrast medium has been instillated for leakage detection, iliosacral screws can safely be placed with a relevant cement depot. RESULTS All patients (n = 8) treated in this way were allowed to weight bear on both legs and mobilisation was tolerated the next day after surgery. In the post-operative controls including X-ray and CT scan we noticed no cement leakage. Pain level as measured by the visual analog scale was significantly reduced to pre- surgery (mean 7.6 pre-operatively, mean 2.5 postoperatively). In addition pain medication could be reduced gradually soon after surgery. CONCLUSIONS The described procedure to address fragility fractures of the pelvic ring is a safe and easy to handle method. There are three advantages: First the osteoporotic S1 vertebral body can by stabilised by the amount of cement; second the cement leakage can be prevented by the balloon-compaction of the cancellous bone and the possibility to control the created cavity with contrast medium; third the bone - screw interface is much stronger compared to other procedures and is biomechanically superior against vertical shear stress. In contrast to sacroplasty, the cement application is guided by the previous use of a balloon. Key words:pelvic ring, fragility fracture, osteoporosis, elderly.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSA consecutive series of one hundred and twenty-one patients (130 hips) younger than 60 years at the time of surgery was enrolled in the study.Primary arthritis (33.8%) and dysplastic hips (30%) were the most common diagnoses.The patients used crutches for 6 weeks to protect femoral components against subsidence and rotational stress.The mean follow-up was 118 months (range 96-156 months). RESULTSAt the final evaluation, the mean Harris Hip Score was 98.8.A perioperative periprosthetic fracture occurred in two hips and a perioperative ceramic insert breakage was observed in one hip.One hip had ceramic insert fracture 3.5 years postoperatively.In one hip a dislocation occurred.These two hips (1.5%) were revised due to reasons not associated with the stem.One hip has aseptic asymptomatic polyethylene inlay wear.In two hips squeezing was reported.There were two cases of loosening and migration of stems (1.5%) with osteolysis all around the stems.These patients have moderate thigh pain.The radiological survival is 98.5% and the clinical survival is 100% after 10 years on average. DISCUSSIONAlthough improved clinical results were reported in younger patients with standard cementless stems, some problems still prevail: thigh pain, proximal stress shielding, difficult removal of the stem.In an effort to reduce these problems, Proxima ultra-short anatomical cementless stem was developed.Several studies show that this stem design provides good short-and mid-term results, but only in a limited number of patients and relatively short follow-up.Furthermore, the initial fears of early aseptic loosening due to the absence of diaphyseal fixation were not confirmed. CONCLUSIONSProxima ultra-short anatomical cementless stem provided excellent mid-term clinical and radiographic results in patients younger than 60 years.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Mechanical stimulation plays an uncontested role in the surgical treatment of bone fractures. The effect of frequency, shape, amplitude and rise time of usually symmetrical mechanical stimuli is well known. The recovery period immediately after single pulses is potentially a critical period but has attracted little attention so far. The present study addresses the effect of extending the recovery period which may conceivably increase the efficacy of postoperative fracture management and physiotherapeutic intervention. MATERIAL AND METHODS The research method consisted of moving an isolated fragment of bone at a fixed amplitude followed by different recovery periods of between ten seconds and two hours between repeated single pulses. The amount of callus produced was observed radiologically and micro-radiologically and the material property of the healing unit was assessed by measuring the stiffness of the unit. RESULTS The result was that pulses applied after a recovery period of up to two hours produced abundant callus and a large increase of stiffness. Pulses applied after a recovery period of ten seconds produced only traces of callus and no increase of stiffness. The significant differences of mean values at 5 weeks were 74 mm2 vs. 13 mm2, and 31.5 MPa vs. 5.5 MPa, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The working hypothesis postulates a time-dependent change in tissue reaction to deformation in relation to the time allowed for recovery. Damage and consequent irritation inducing callus does not occur below the critical interval. The observed, unexpected lack of reaction to recovery intervals below 10 seconds may trigger the expectation that in postoperative physiotherapy loading at longer intervals would be preferable to activation at frequencies of locomotion. Key words: fracture healing, mechanical stimulation, callus.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYTreatment for tears of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in paediatric patients has been a long-discussed issue because of complications associated with ligament reconstruction in the presence of growth plates.Various fixation materials and their efficiency as well as ACL techniques are still under investigation.The aim of our study was to find an optimal strategy of treating acute intra-articular ACL injury in childhood. MATERIAL AND METHODSThe paediatric patients treated for primary traumatic ACL injury between 2003 and 2013 were retrospectively evaluated.Only patients with a healthy contralateral knee (with no signs of instability or previous injury) and no record of previous ACL repair were included.A total of 78 patients were assessed; there were 39 girls and 39 boys with an average age of 15.4 years (11 -16).The physical development of the patients was assessed on the Tanner scale, their satisfaction was recorded on the basis of the IKDC subjective knee evaluation form and the Tegner-Lysholm scoring system.The instrumented Lachman test using a rollimeter was performed to assess knee stability at 12 and 24 months of follow-up.In addition, the range of knee motion in comparison with the other side, complications and the re-rupture rate of reconstructed ACLs were recorded.Four patients with open growth plates were operated on using the transepiphyseal technique, the remaining 74 underwent reconstruction by the standard transphyseal method. RESULTSThe average Tegner-Lysholm scores were 54 (41-62) pre-operatively and 86.1 (74-96) at 24 months post-operatively.The average IKDC score increased from 48 (42-56) points to 91 (73-97) points.The Lachman test was positive in all patients before ACL reconstruction and negative in 96% of them at 12 and 24 months after surgery.The full range of joint motion was restored after ACL surgery, with minimal motion restriction in flexion and extension, in 70 (89.7%)patients.Motion restriction by 15° or less in flexion and 5° or less in extension was recorded in seven (9%) patients and a significant restriction in extension exceeding 10° was found in one (1.3%)patient.No differences in results were found between the two scoring systems.Five patients (6.4 %) sustained a re-tear in the reconstructed ACL due to a trauma.Non-traumatic subjective instability after the primary repair was not recorded.Revision ACL surgery was carried out due to fixation materials protruding from the bone surface in two patients and because of a Cyclops lesion with extension deficit in one patient.No development of deformity or instability was observed at 24 months in the patients in whom the transepiphyseal technique was used. DISCUSSIONIn the current literature ACL reconstruction by the transphyseal technique has been described in patients older than 15 years of age but no optimal age has been suggested.Animal experiments have shown that tunnels taking up more that 7-9% of the growth plate surface can result in growth restriction or angular deformity.ACL reconstruction in patients with distinct bone immaturity carries a high risk.The effect of growth on the biomechanical properties of a graft and a long-term consequence of surgical intervention in the growth plate is not yet understood. CONSLUSIONSAlthough indications for surgical ACL repair and its timing are bound to be different in each patient, we consider the age of over 15 years to be ideal for ACL reconstruction.In patients younger than 15 years, the necessity of surgical treatment is questionable and conservative therapy can give good outcomes.No adverse effect of an applied graft on the post-operative results was demonstrated.The features of an immature skeleton are specific and complicated therefore, in our view, the relevant health care for paediatric patients should be concentrated into specialised institutions.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The literature is conflicting as to whether the high hip center (HHC) reconstruction in total hip arthroplasty (THA) is an ideal option for patients with severe developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). This study aimed to compare the mid-term functional and radiographic outcomes of THA using HHC versus anatomical hip center (AHC) technique in Crowe types II and III DDH. Our hypothesis was that there may be no differences in terms of functional and radiographic outcomes between patients who underwent THA using HHC or AHC. MATERIAL AND METHODS Fifty-seven patients who underwent a primary THA due to Crowe type-II or type-III DDH were retrospectively reviewed and included. Patients were divided into two groups as per the hip center reconstruction: Group A (AHC technique) and group H (HHC technique). A cementless cup was inserted in 25 hips (19 female, 6 male; mean age = 51 years, age range = 28-67)) at near-AHC in group A and 32 hips (22 female, 10 male; mean age = 53 years, age range = 29-68) at HHC position in group H. To assess clinical status, the Harris Hip Score (HHS) was used at the final follow-up. In radiographical assessment, component loosening and osseointegration of the acetabular cup were examined on follow-up radiographs. Complications were also recorded. RESULTS The mean follow-up was 41 months (range, 25-84) in group A and 40 months (range, 24-86) in group H. The mean HHS was 83 (range, 74-91) in group A and 83.6 (range, 73-94) in group H (p = 0.741). Osteolysis was determined in three patients from each group. The other 51 cups demonstrated a minimum of one radiographic sign of osseointegration. Although the overall complication rate was higher in group A (64%) than in group H (46%), this difference reached no statistical significance (p = 0.11). CONCLUSIONS The HHC technique using cementless acetabular fixation seems to be a valuable alternative option to AHC technique in cases of Crowe types II and III DDH. Key words: High hip center; anatomical hip center; center of rotation; total hip arthroplasty; dysplastic hip; developmental dysplasia of the hip; Crowe type II; Crowe Type III.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYFifth metatarsal fractures, in particular so-called Jones fractures, are relatively common injuries both in the general population and athletes.Although discussions about whether the surgical or conservative solution should be preferred are ongoing for decades, there is no clear consensus.Here, we aimed to prospectively compare the results of osteosynthesis using the Herbert screw with the conservative solution in patients from our department. MATERIAL AND METHODSPatients 18-50 years presenting to our department with Jones fracture and meeting further inclusion/exclusion criteria were offered participation in the study.Those willing to participate signed informed consent and were randomized by flipping the coin into surgically and conservatively treated groups.After six and twelve weeks, X-ray was performed in each patient and AOFAS score was determined.Conservatively treated patients who showed no signs of healing and whose AOFAS was below 80 after six weeks were offered surgery again. RESULTSOf 24 patients in total, 15 were assigned to the surgically treated group and nine were treated conservatively.After six weeks, AOFAS score of all but two patients (86%) in the surgically treated group ranged between 97 and 100, while this score exceeded 90 points only in three patients (33%) from the conservatively treated group.On X-ray, successful healing after six weeks was observed in seven patients (47%) from the surgically treated group but in none of the patients from the conservatively treated group.Three out of five patients in the conservative group whose AOFAS was below 80 after six weeks opted for surgery at that time and all improved significantly by the twelfth week. DISCUSSIONAlthough studies on surgical treatment of Jones fracture using various screws or plates are not rare, we present an uncommon method of surgical treatment of this injury -the use of the Herbert screw.The results of this method are excellent and even on a relatively small sample yielded statistically significantly better results than conservative treatment.Moreover, the surgical treatment facilitated early loading of the injured limb, which allows an earlier return of the patients to normal life. CONCLUSIONSOsteosynthesis using Herbert screw in Jones fracture yielded significantly better results than conservative treatment.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSThis prospective study included four patients, three women and one man, with osteoid osteoma of the lumbar or sacral spine who were treated by percutaneous CT-guided radiofrequency ablation in the period from February 2002 to March 2005.Two tumors were found in the third lumbar vertebra, one in the fourth lumbar and one in the first sacral verstebra.The pre-operative pain values assessed on the visual analogue scale (VAS), and function restriction rated by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were compared with the post-operative values at 2 years after surgery.Patients' satisfaction with surgical outcome was evaluated according to Odom's criteria. RESULTSAll four procedures were accomplished successfully in technical terms and the patients completed the two-year followup.All patients reported significant relief of pain immediately after surgery and this held even after 2 years.The average pre-operative VAS value of 8.3 was reduced to 2.45 at the final examination, and the pre-operative ODI of 70/100 improved to 95/100 post-operatively.The outcome of treatment rated by Odom's criteria was regarded as excellent. CONCLUSIONSPercutaneous CT-guided radiofrequency ablation is an effective and safe method for treatment of spinal osteoid osteoma.It has advantages that could make it preferable to surgical excision of tumors.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of resection of Medial Patellar Plica of the knee. The criteria for inclusion was that resection of the Medial Patellar Plica was the main arthroscopic intervention performed. MATERIAL From 1st January 2002 to 31st December 2006, 1408 arthroscopies of the knee were carried out at the London Knee Clinic, London Bridge Hospital without the use of a tourniquet. In all cases of Medial Patellar Plica the Plica was observed through a supero-lateral portal as well as the standard portals. 53 knees fulfilled the criteria, of which 35 knees were traced and included in the study with an average follow-up period of 23.7 months. Typically patients were between the ages of 20-30 and engaged in sporting activities. METHODS Age, sex, symptoms (onset and duration), VAS (Visual Analogue pain Scale from 1 to 10) before and after operation, return to sporting activity and patient's subjective evaluation of the result were recorded in 31 patients (35 knees). RESULTS The average period of symptom duration prior to the operation was 18.6 months (minimum 2 months). The mean follow- up period was 23.7 months from operation (8-67 months), average VAS score was 6 points before surgery, and 2 points after surgery (0- no pain, 10 excruciating pain). Mean improvement was 4 points. 34 % of patients were totally pain free after arthroscopic resection (0 point on VAS). 65.8% returned to the same level of sporting activity as occurred before the onset of knee problems. When asked whether they would undergo the same procedure on the other knee 72 % replied positively. DISCUSSION Despite numerous publications about knee Plicae describing their anatomical and patho-physiological characteristics, there are still some arthroscopists who do not believe in their significance as a pathological entity and the diagnosis of Plica Syndrome remains controversial. The success of arthroscopic resection of one or more Plicae in most previous studies is rated on the scale excellent, good, poor, and very poor. The present study focuses on the type of Plica which is most frequently pathological, that is the Medial Patellar Plica and evaluates the outcome of surgery in terms of VAS score, return to sporting activity and the patient's satisfaction with treatment. CONCLUSION Plicae are common anatomical structures, which sometimes become symptomatic. When pathological, they can give rise to quite disabling patello-femoral symptoms as well as participating in the acceleration of arthritic changes. In order to evaluate the Medial Patellar Plica properly including its involvement in patello-femur disorders, it is essential to examine the knee through a supra-patellar portal and to undertake dynamic examination of the knee in various degrees of flexion and extension. Resection of pathological Medial Patellar Plica is a successful procedure giving good results in a majority of patients with return to sporting activities. In some cases however, symptoms persist at a lower intensity even after their resection so that the sporting activity has to be reduced in the long term.",

    "abstract": "The utility of scoring systems, which are used to determine health status or treatment benefit in patients with knee osteoarthritis is under discussion. Therefore it was the purpose of our investigation to evaluate the reliability and the concordance of two established knee scoring systems.Thirty-eight patients with unilateral knee osteoarthritis were scored by the Hospital for Special Surgery score and the Knee Society score. Two blinded observers rated the patients independently in order to determine the concordance of the scores, the correlation between the overall scores and their subscales such as \"pain\", \"function\" and \"range of motion\" and the inter-observer and intra-observer reliability.There was a high correlation between the overall scores (r= 0.80) and between the scores and their subscales \"range of motion\" (r=0.89) and \"function\" (r=0.74). The correlation of scores for \"pain\" was slightly less (r=0.61). Mean inter-observer reliability ranged between r=0.58 and r=0.61. Mean intra-observer reliability was high for the overall scores as well as for the subscales of both scoring systems (r=0.64 to r=0.93 and r=0.73 to r=0.92).We have found that the assessment of overall scores as well as of their main subscales is concordant and reliable in our patient sample. The application of these scoring systems in measuring health status in patients with knee osteoarthritis appears to be an acceptable method of audit. However, we feel that presentation of the results of knee scoring systems should include detailed information on the main subscales, since this allows for a better understanding of results.",

Minimally invasive fixation with a cancellous screw and washer was used in 25, and a buttress plate in 27 patients. Spongioplasty was carried out in 11 patients.Clinical and questionnaire-based evaluation was undertaken at 5 to 7 years after the injury and following therapy. The outcome was assessed on the basis of two classification systems, i.e., the IKDC (International Knee Documentation Committee) score and the Lansinger score designed particularly for the evaluation of proximal tibial fractures. The outcomes were evaluated in relation to fracture type, conservative or surgical treatment, method of osteosynthesis, and use of arthroscopic control and spongioplasty.In each of the evaluated patients, radiographs were obtained after injury and then at the completion of therapy. The fractures classified according to the AO system were as follows: type A1 fractures - 9 patients; types B1, B2, B3 - 46 patients; types C1, C2, C3 - 34 patients. The average IKDC and the Lansinger scores achieved at 5- to 7-year follow-up were 70 and 24 points, respectively. This can be regarded as a very good result. Within 5 years of injury, four patients underwent total knee arthroplasty; all of them were over 50 years and had a type C3 fracture. The type B3 and C3 treated by arthrotomy showed similar outcomes on both classification systems (IKDC/Lansinger: 69/67 and 24/24, respectively). The B3 fractures operated on under arthroscopic control had better outcomes (77/69) than those treated by arthrotomy (27/25), because this approach combines advantages of inner fracture fixation with a minimally invasive surgical technique. Better results were also achieved in fractures treated by minimally invasive fixation with cancellous screws.The outcomes of therapy in intra-articular fractures of the proximal tibia related to how serious the fracture was and how well it was reduced and stabilized. Both the approach to fracture reduction and the method of its stabilization (buttress plate, minimally invasive screws, external fixator) are selected according to fracture type and soft tissue state. Spongioplasty is indicated if subchondral bone is affected. Reduction and stabilization performed under arthroscopic control permit more precise reconstruction of the articular surface, but can be used only for certain fractures (type A1 and B1, B2 and B3). For reduction and stabilization of all fracture types, with the exception of AO type 41A-1 fracture, an Y-ray image intensifier system is necessary. The meniscus above the injured bone should be preserved in order to maintain good function of the joint.In intra-articular fractures of the proximal tibia, treatment outcomes depend on the type of fracture as well as correct reduction and use of appropriate fixation. When accurate alignment, joint stability and well reduced articular surfaces are achieved, outcomes are very good. At mid-term follow-up, reduction under arthroscopic control gives better results than stabilization performed by arthrotomy.",

    "abstract": "It is the aim of our study to present the results of our way of treatment of the periprosthetic fractures, with the cemented as well as the cement-free stems.From 1.1.1988 until 31.3.2005 we operated 42 periprosthetic fractures of the hip in 41 patients. 31 of our patients were females, 10 of them males. In 22 cases we operated the right side, 18 times the left side and once we had to operate both sides, but at different times. We used the Vancouver classification scale for the grading of the fractures. In our study we excluded type A fractures; we registered 41 type B fractures and one only type C fracture. The reason for periprosthetic fracture in all these 42 cases was definitely a trauma. In 6 cases we found pre-existing loosening of the stem. We have grouped our patients under two headings: 1. Primary cemented stems (n=13) 2. Primary cement-free stems (n=29) The average age at the time of primary operation was 63.6 years in the group of cemented stems and 67.2 years with the cement-free implants.The principle of this operation lies in a stable technique of osteosynthesis. If one operates on a stable stem one uses a one and only technique of osteosynthesis. Patients who also suffer from a loosening of the stem, are treated by replacement of the stem combined with a particular form of osteosynthesis. We generally use a transgluteal access with an L-shaped detachment of the Musc. vastus lateralis. In the group of cemented stems (n=13) we carried out a replacement of the stem 6 times and in the group of cement-free stems (n=29) we had to replace the implant on 7 occasions. Analysing the osteosynthesis technique we find the use of titanium cerclages and titanium elements on 35 occasions, in both groups taken together. As implant for the stem we preferred the modulated revision stem according to Zweymüller. Clinical post-operational examination of our patients was carried out according to the Merle d'Aubigne score and two x-rays at different levels.After an average post-operational check-up time of 3 years and 2 months, we were able to examine 8 patients with cemented stems (61.5%), 4 of whom had replacement of the stem by a cement-free implant. In the cement-free group we evaluated 24 patients after an average time of 4 years and 11 months. In this group we had 5x a replacement of the stem, 3x of these we could operate cement-free. The post-operational radiological check showed an excellent building-up of bone structure without any dislocation of the implant in all 32 cases.The average age of our patients shows 77 years with those with cemented stems and 74.5 years in the ones with cementfree implants. Analysis of the cemented stems shows a loosening rate of more than 50%, which coincides with the findings of many other authors. After a couple of years using cups of polyethylene we were confronted with the problem of the so-called Polyethylene disease. These alterations may finally lead to a loss of bone quality, to mechanical loosening of the implant and an increase in danger of fracture. When we discuss the group of patients with cement-free stems and compare them to those with cemented ones, we find a number of quite different characteristics. B2 fractures appear in a quite higher number of patients with cemented and loosened stems. In this regard, our own study is congruent with the studies of other authors. In the cement-free group we had 75% B1 fractures with a stable stem. The explanation for these figures is, that the cement-free implants were well incorporated in the bone structure.The choice of operative procedure when treating periprosthetic hip fractures depends on the type of fracture and the stability of the prosthesis. Our own very positive experiences and the then emerging results lead to a certain strategy in procedure. That means, for us, the use of a cement-free modulated revision stem according to Zweymüller combined with a particular technique of osteosynthesis, using titanium cerclages and titanium elements.",

    "abstract": "Occipitocervical fixation and spondylodesis is indicated in various cases of occipitocervical instability. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the results of occipitocervical fixation at our institutions.Between 1997 and 2007, a total of 57 patients underwent occipitocervical fixation (OC) there were 25 men and 32 women, from four to 77 years of age, with an average of 58.7 years. The patients were allocated to two groups according to the method of OC fixation used: tying wires or cables (group 1) screw-rod or screw-plate systems (group 2). Indications for OC fixation included trauma in 15, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 28, destruction due to psoriasis in one, tumour in eight, and congenital anomalies of the cervico-cranial junction in five patients. In five patients with tumour, OC fixation was completed with a transoral or transmandibular procedure. The C0-T 1 or C0-T 2 segments were fixed in 22 patients, C0-C2 segments in 14, C0-C3 segments in six, C0-C4 segments in two, C0-C5 segments in eight and C0-C6 segments in five patients.In atlanto-occipital dislocation, comminuted fractures of the ;atlas or similar injuries, C0-C1-C2 segments were fused in congenital anomaly, the C0-to-lower cervical spine was fixed, with C1 being avoided. The RA patients were treated by fixation of the C0 to T1 or T2 segments. The atlas was fixed by the screw method of Goel, the C2 joint by that of Judet, or stable fusion of the two vertebrae was carried out by the Magerl transarticular technique. For the middle and lower cervical spine, lateral mass screw fixation by the Magerl method was used, and from C7 caudally the vertebrae were fixed transpedicularly. Occasionally, in small children in particular, a Ransford frame fixed with wires or cables was used. In principle, an extent of fixation as small as possible was employed. The patients were evaluated at a final follow-up ranging between 12 and 132 months after the primary surgery (average, 42.7 months). Indications for surgery and the method and extent of instrumentation were recorded. The evaluation included pain and neurological deficit assessment, radiographic evidence of the stability of fixation and bone union and intra-operative and early and late post-operative complications.Of the 57 patients, bone fusion was the objective of surgery in 52. Further five patients died of associated injuries or serious medical complications shortly after the operation. Of the remaining 47, bone union was achieved in 44 patients (93.6%). Pseudoarthrosis developed in three patients who, however, because of a higher age and minimal complaints did not require revision surgery. In terms of bone union, there was no difference between a short (C0-C2) and a long (C0-CX or C-T) fixation. No differences among fixation materials were found. The differences in percent bone union after spondylodesis between the tying-wire and screw-rod fixation systems were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). In the patients treated for RA, psoriasis or congenital anomaly, the Nurick scale score significantly improved at 2 years after surgery (p < 0.05). In comparison with the others, the RA patients had a significantly higher number of complications (p < 0.05). The patients treated for tumour showed a significant difference between the pre- and post-operative VAS values (p < 0.05).Of the patients with RA, psoriasis or congenital anomaly, 57.6% showed post-operative improvement in the Nurick scale score by 1-2 but never more than by 2. A decrease in pain intensity and neurological findings was recorded in 88.2% of the patients. This is in agreement with the results published in the international literature. In the patients treated for trauma, a high proportion (53.3%) had neurological deficit, which is unusually high for craniocervical injuries. This can be explained by the fact that OC fixation is used only in the most serious injuries. Of five patients with neurological deficit of Frankel grade A or B, three died and two required mechanical ventilation. Less serious neurological findings of Frankel grade C or D in three patients improved to a normal condition.Rigid OC fixation is a very effective method for the treatment of craniocervical junction instability. The currently used implants allow us to achieve high stability and efficiency of bone union. Regardless of the instrumentation used, fusion is achieved in more than 90%, and clinical improvement in more than 80% of the patients.",

    "abstract": "To provide a detailed description of the Ponseti method and report the first results of its use, including factors that played a role.In the 2005-2007 period, 91 patients with idiopathic rigid clubfoot (133 feet) were treated by the Ponseti method. The group comprised 62 boys and 29 girls. In most patients the Ponseti method was used as primary treatment, or by 3 months of age when previous treatment failed. In five children this treatment was started between the 3rd and 8th months of age. The result were evaluated by the criteria described by Richards et al., who distinguished four groups. The result was regarded as good when a permanent plantigrade foot was achieved (group 1). Plantigrade feet likely to require posterior release later were considered indeterminate rusults (group 2). Feet that needed posterior release, anterior tibial muscle transfer or lateral column shortening fell in the fair result group (3). Feet requiring complete subtalar release were classified as poor results (group 4). The results achieved in each year were statistically evaluated using Fisher's test (p<0.05).The overall evaluation for 3 years showed good results in 70%, indeterminate in 7.5%, fair in 6.76% and poor in 15.8% of the treated feet. A detailed analysis for each year revealed that, in 2005, good results (50%) were recorded in a significantly lower number of feet than in 2006 (72.2%; p=0.032) and 2007 (93%; p<0.001). On comparison of the years 2006 and 2007, good results in 2007 were found in a significantly higher number of feet than in 2006 (p=0.019). The poor results were due to 1) very rigid feet (6%); 2) initial problems with availability of Denis-Brown splints (19 feet; 14.5%); 3) problems with shoes not made to custom and not fitting patient's little feet (20 feet; 15%) 4) faulty techniques of correcting the deformity (4 feet); 5) poor family cooperation in compliance with the bracing protocol (15 feet; 11.2%). Some of the factors were combined. A delayed beginning of the treatment had no significant effect on the results.Our 3-year results of clubfoot treatment, by which plantigrade foot position was acheved on average in 77.5% of the patients, are in agreement with those achieved outside Ponseti centres. However, there were clear differences, with the worst results in 2005. The results comparable with those of Ponseti and his co-workers were achieved by us only in 2007. In accordance with the findings of Richards et al. we suggest that the percentage of short-term good results can change insignificantly within 4 years because of increased recurrence of deformities.Although our initial results were worse than reported in the literature, it can be concluded that the Ponseti method of treating idiopathic clubfoot is more efficient that the methods used previously and can be recommended as an efficient, safe and economical technique. Good compliance with the protocol improves the therapeutic results.",

DISCUSSIONMost of the complications detected were due to a technical error during surgery and can be minimized by meticulous adherence to the technique.The difference in grip strength is very close to the significance level set for the study, and this will be necessary to clarify in a planned prospective study.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability often develops after distal forearm fracture or severe dislocation of the wrist with damage to its stabilising structures. The instability is usually diagnosed as a chronic condition and only rarely at the time of injury. When the stabilising structures are not treated adequately soon after injury, instability develops and is accompanied with pain, restricted range of motion and reduced grip strength. This study presents the option of chronic instability treatment by tenodesis with use of the palmaris longus tendon. Its aim is to remind the broad medical community of this issue. MATERIAL Between July 1994 and November 2000, tenodesis was performed in 15 patients with chronic DRUJ instability. The right and left sides were affected in 10 and five patients, respectively; of them 12 were dominant extremities. All injuries were diagnosed as dorsal subluxation of the ulnar head, with side dislocation in three patients. METHODS The diagnosis was based on a thorough medical history, and clinical and radiographic examination, including projections in forced maximum radial and ulnar duction, as recommended by Geyer and Luzius as early as in 1964. Tenodesis was done by the Jäger and Wirth method using the palmaris longus tendon. The patients were scored according to the Modified Mayo Wrist System. RESULTS Of the 15 patients treated by this method, 14 were evaluated. Eight patients regarded the results as very good, with no pain at maximal physical activity, and five considered them good, experiencing pain only at maximal but not at everyday activities. One patient reported a poor outcome. The average score increased from pre-operative 40 to 60 points post-operatively. All patients had a slight restriction of rotation movements of the forearm. Residual instability was found in one patient. DISCUSSION It is a common view that this condition is caused by subluxation or dislocation of the ulnar head, while in fact it is subluxation or dislocation of the radius turning around the ulna. As reported in the literature, dorsal dislocation is three-times as frequent as volnar dislocation, and this is in agreement with our findings. There is a wide variety of the operative methods for tenodesis which differ in the distribution of tunnels in bone. Restriction of the range of motion in our patients also agreed with the literature data. No effect of a distal radius fracture on the results of surgery was recorded. CONCLUSIONS Our results show that tenodesis is a method suitable to treat chronic DRUJ instability if the indication criteria are observed, i. e., if no arthritic lesions are present in the joint.",

    "abstract": "Damage control surgery is one of the major advances in surgical techniques used in polytrauma patients in the past 25 years. It is based on a foreshortened pre-operative examination during ongoing resuscitation which includes surgical intervention in an injured patient with severe hypotension due to haemorrhage. In this seven-year retrospective study the authors evaluate the results of damage control laparotomy in patients with injury to the abdominal organs, retroperitoneum and pelvis.The evaluated group included 21 patients with blunt abdominal trauma who underwent damage control laparotomy in the 2001-2007 period. There were 17 men and four women; the age range was 17 to 69 years, with an average of 36 years. Damage control laparotomy was indicated in the patients with blunt abdominal trauma, or with closed or open pelvic fracture, who developed a progressive haemorrhagic shock.Between 2001 and 2007, a total of 21 922 patients were admitted to the Trauma Centre and 12 392 operations were performed. However, only in 21 of them (0.1 %) damage control laparotomy was indicated. The procedure was most frequently performed for liver injury (16 patients), which was associated with multiple injury to the other abdominal organs and retroperitoneum in five patients. Further three patients were operated on for haemoperitoneum at continual bleeding due to type C fracture of the pelvis. In the remaining two patients the damage control procedure was chosen to stop persistent bleeding following splenectomy and nephrectomy for traumatic rupture. In these 21 patients blunt trauma was part of polytrauma (ISS > 15). Repeat surgery was carried out within 48 to 96 hours (average, 58 h). Four patients (19 %) died; two due to progressive traumatic haemorrhagic shock and two because of brain oedema after concussion.Damage control surgery has become a fundamental component of surgical strategy for severe trauma and has been accepted by surgeons although it cannot be evaluated in randomized clinical studies. Survival after damage control laparotomy in serious intra-abdominal injuries involved in polytrauma is reported in relation to the scoring system values (ISS, GCS), but depends, first of all, on blood loss, degree of acidosis and severity of associated injuries, with craniocerebral trauma in the first place.Damage control laparotomy is an effective procedure in the treatment of severe trauma to the abdominal organs and retroperitoneum in critically injured patients. This time-limited, staged surgical intervention is included in resuscitation of patients with hypothermia, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy. The outcome of damage control surgery is related to not only the severity of injury, but also experience with comprehensive acute care in trauma centres.",

American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Hallux Metatarsophalangeal Interphalangeal scoring system (AOFAS-HMI) was used to assess functional results. Patients were also asked if they would undergo procedure again or recommend it to other people. Weight bearing radiographs ware made at final follow up and analyzed for presence of osteolysis and radiolucencies. In 8 patients total joint replacement was introduced as a salvage after failure of previous surgery like Keller resection arthroplasty, failed arthrodesis, avascular necrosis and postoperative arthritis. In 11 patients the reason for prosthetic replacement were hallux rigidus, in 4 cases rheumatoid arthritis and gout in one patient. In two patients additional procedures like Akin phalangeal osteotomy and in one case fifth metatarsal osteotomy, was performed. There were 20 females and 4 males in presented group. The mean age at the operation was 56 years. The average follow up period was 18 months (from 12 to 36 months).The median postoperative value of AOFAS-HMI scores was 88 points (from 75 to 95 points). First metatarsophalangeal joint motion (dorsiflexion plus plantarflexion) was classified according to AOFAS-HMI ranges as: moderately restricted (between 30 to 70 degrees) in 19 patients 80% (20 prosthesis) and severely restricted (less then 30 degrees) in 5 patients (20%). 15 (64%) patients were completely satisfied, 5 (20%) reported moderate satisfaction and (16%) 4 were totally disappointed and would not undergo this procedure again. A limited hallux dorsiflexion was the main dissatisfaction reason. Partial radiolucent line was seen in one patient (4%). Authors noticed two serious complications. In one patient, with rheumatoid arthritis, deep infection occurred 12 months after prosthesis implantation. In second case phalangeal implant was revised due to misalignment.METIS® metatarsophalangeal joint replacement allows alleviate of pain relating to hallux rigidus and partial restoration of joint movement, even in patients after failures of primary metatarsophalangeal joint surgery. AOFAS-HMI results are better than previously reported in the literature in assessment of the first metatarsophalangeal joint replacement. Radiographic results imply satisfactory bone ingrowth into the cementless implants.",

    "abstract": "The primary aim of the study was to identify characteristics predicting the blood loss associated with primary total hip (THA) and knee (TKA) arthroplasty surgery. The other objective was to find out which characteristics were important for peri-operative allogeneic blood transfusion in the same group of patients.This prospective study comprised 210 consecutive patients who underwent primary THA (n = 115) or primary TKA (n = 95) at our department. In each patient, 21 pre-operative and peri-operative characteristics were recorded. Of them, the following characteristics were selected for statistical evaluation: age, gender, BMI, primary diagnosis, Charlson co-morbidity score, type of prophylaxis for deep-vein thrombosis, type of implant fixation (in THA), pre-operative INR value, haematocrit, haemoglobin (Hb) and platelet levels, amount of autologous blood donated by the patient, ASA score, operative time, use of tourniquet (in TKA), type of anaesthesia used, blood recuperation and patient's smoking habits. Multivariate analysis was used as the statistical method. For hypothesis testing, a statistical significance level of 0.05 was stated and, for enclosing (removing) characteristics to (from) multivariate models, the significance level was set at 0.11.The group included 81 men and 129 women; the mean age at the time of surgery was 65.5 ± 11.97 years (mean±SD) in the THA patients and 68.5 ± 8.52 years in the TKA patients. Primary osteoarthritis was the most frequent surgical diagnosis (THA, 64.35%; TKA, 82.1%). The mean amount of blood loss was 1258 ± 402.6 ml in THA and 1580 ± 475.5 ml in TKA. The mean amount of allogeneic blood required was 130 ± 202 ml when all THA patients were considered, and 371.95 ± 159.3 ml when only those who received it were involved. For the TKA patients, the corresponding values were 160.1 ± 278.8 ml for all patients and 507 ± 264.5 ml for blood recipients only. The characteristics that affected the amount of blood loss in THA included BMI, ASA score, blood recuperation, type of anaesthesia, and smoking habits; in TKA these were BMI, pre-operative platelet count, INR and type of anaesthesia. High pre-operative Hb levels made the probability of allogeneic blood requirement lower in both THA and TKA. Autotransfusion decreased the probability of allogeneic blood requirements only in THA. DISCUSSION That the pre-operative Hb level is the strongest predictor for the probability of allogeneic blood transfusion during both THA and TKA is a logical and well-known fact. What remains to be established is the optimal protocol for pre-operative preparation of the patients with low Hb levels undergoing elective replacement (hip and knee) surgery. This study clearly showed that, in THA patients, pre-operative autologous blood donation decreased the probability of allogeneic blood transfusion. Other results of our multivariate analyses were not clinically unambiguous and therefore further research on a larger patient group is warranted. Such studies will also require the development of a more exact method for the assessment of blood loss at the operating theatre.The patients with low pre-operative Hb levels have a high probability that they will require allogeneic blood transfusion during primary THA and TKA. Autologous blood donation can decrease this probability significantly (here proved only for THA patients). The multivariate model of blood loss published here could assist in estimation of peri-operative blood loss and potential risk of blood transfusion requirements.",

The main parameters in decision making are the hemodynamic situation and the grade of instability of the pelvis (36). It has to be considered that the child has a longer hemodynamic compensation before a severe shock state results in a potential near fatal situation. Hauschild et al. found that in children emergency measures were taken in 17.9% compared to a rate of 11.1% in adults patients (19). Due to the anatomical differences of the child's pelvis and the higher risk of injury to the pelvic viscera, it has to be considered that the presence of pelvic and extremity fractures predicts concomitant abdominal and head injuries (5, 6, 50, 61) and therefore the overall risk of bleeding complications (5, 23, 30, 58, 61). Bleeding is commonly secondary to associated solid- -organ injuries (6, 15, 23, 41, 43, 50, 58). Language: en",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe effect of an early surgical intervention in the traumatised spine on resolution of neurological deficit still remains a topic of professional discussions.The aim of this retrospective study was to find a correlation between the length of an injury-to-surgery interval and the development of a post-operative neurological deficit, and thus to answer the question of whether early surgical decompression and stabilization gives better chance of neurological recovery. MATERIAL AND METHODSMedical records of consecutive surgical patients admitted between 2007 and 2010 with traumatic spinal cord injury were reviewed and the injury-to-surgery interval and post-operative development of neurological deficit at a minimum follow-up of 6 months was evaluated.The initial neurological finding and the finding at 6 months of follow-up were classified on the Frankel scale and the outcome was assessed as improved or unimproved.The patients were allocated to four subgroups according to the time that elapsed between injury and surgery, i.e., time up to 24 h, 24-72 h, 72 h -1 week, and longer than 1 week.The percentage of improved patients was calculated in each subgroup and the results were statistically evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test at a significance level of 0.1. RESULTSOut of the total number of 32 evaluated patients, 28 had at least partial neurological recovery.In the subgroup treated within first 24 h, improvement was found in 93 % of the patients, in the 24-72 h subgroup it was 80%, in the 72 h-1 week subgroup it was 60% and surgery later than a week after injury resulted in improvement in 42% of the patients.Based on statistical evaluation, the time between injury and surgery appeared to be a significant prognostic factor.When a paired comparison of subgroups was made, the only significant difference was found between the subgroup treated within 24 hours of injury and that operated on later than a week after injury.The other paired comparisons failed to show a significant difference due to a small number of patients; however, a tendency to better functional results was observed in all earlier-treated subgroups. DISCUSSIONThe authors are aware of few limitations of the study.Its retrospective character, a relatively small number of patients and a single institution setup may limit the interpretation.Despite this fact, the message is clear.Similar studies carried out prospectively at several institutions may, however, provide results with a higher validity. CONCLUSIONSPatients with traumatic spinal cord injury who undergo early decompression and stabilisation have a higher chance of at least partial neurological recovery.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYTo present the TightRope (Arthrex, naples, FL) technique and its results in the arthroscopic stabilisation of acute acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) dislocation carried out at our department. MATERIAL AnD METHODSFrom July 2009 till December 2010, arthroscopic stabilisation of acute ACJ dislocation was performed in 22 patients.The group consisted of 18 men and four women with an average age of 37.4 years.The Rockwood type III to type v ACJ dislocations (III,16; Iv,1; v,5) were indicated for surgery.The average interval between injury and surgery was 5.4 days.In all cases, a second-generation TightRope implant was inserted by the EndoButton technique joining the distal end of the clavicle and the coracoid process.The results were evaluated using the UCLA Shoulder Scale at 6 months after surgery. RESULTSAll 22 patients returned to their pre-operative activities without any restriction of shoulder motion within 5 months of surgery.The average post-operative UCLA score was 31.2 points (range, 28 to 35).Radiographic evidence of the loss of full reduction, with no effect on the clinical outcome, was recorded in four patients (18%) during post-operative rehabilitation.Of these, one had Rockwood type III, two had type Iv and one had type v dislocations.One patient suffered post-operative pull-out of the implant from the coracoid; three patients showed skin wound healing by second intention above the lateral clavicle, with one requiring surgical repair under local anaesthesia.There was no neurovascular complication, intra-or postoperative fracture of the coracoid process or lateral clavicle, or deep wound infection. DISCUSSIOnArthroscopic stabilisation of acute ACJ dislocation is a minimally invasive procedure providing the coracoclavicular ligament complex with dynamic stability.In comparison with open procedures, it is less painful post-operatively, allows the patients to return early to daily activities and has a better cosmetic effect.It eliminates the necessity of removing the osteosynthetic material, as is the case in commonly used techniques such as Bosworth's method, K-wiring, osteorrhaphy or hook plate insertion.The loss of full reduction in four patients, as observed on radiographs during their rehabilitation, was not accompanied by any clinical problems and is in agreement with the findings of other authors.In our group, it occurred in Rockwood grade Iv and grade v dislocations.For these, there is a possibility of using two implants in order to increase stability and prevent the loss of full reduction but this involves a higher risk of coracoid fracture, extension of operative time and higher costs.However, a loss of reduction in some patients has also been reported by the authors who have used two implants.Therefore we prefer using a single TightRope implant, particularly in acute grade III ACJ dislocations requiring surgical treatment in patients engaged in repetitive overhead activities related to sports or occupation. COnCLUSIOnSArthroscopic stabilisation of acute ACJ dislocations using a single TightRope implant is an elegant minimally invasive method with good results in indicated cases.It proves efficient particularly in Rockwood type III injuries in patients who have to do repetitive overhead activities.Acute type Iv and type v ACJ dislocations treated by this technique show a loss of full reduction on radiographs more frequently, although no effect on the clinical outcome is evident.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this prospective study was to investigate whether female gender and revision surgery were significant risk factors for intra-operative periprosthetic fractures during total hip arthroplasty (THA).The group investigated comprised the patients who, in the period 1995-2009, sustained an intra-operative periprosthetic fracture during primary or revision THA. The patients were treated by a therapeutic procedure based on the Vancouver system. The results were related to the total number of patients undergoing THA in that period, Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson's x2 test at the 5% significance level.Intra-operative periprosthetic fractures occurred in 110 patients (89 women, 21 men). The average age of the patients was 69 years (70 in women and 62 in men). The women significantly outnumbered the men (p < 0.001). In the period under study, 2936 primary and 791 revision THAs were performed; the incidence of all intra-operative fractures was 3%. Intra-operative fractures during primary THA were recorded in 95 patients (3.2%; range in individual years, 0.4 to 5.9%); fractures during revision THA were found in 15 patients (1.9%; range, 0 to 8.0%). This difference was slightly above the set significance level (p = 0.057). The majority of intra-operative fractures were minimal Vancouver type-A fractures in the greater trochanter region. They were recorded in 95 of the 110 patients (86%) with either primary or revision THA. Of the 15 type-B fractures, eight were shown by a detailed evaluation to occur during revision THA. An independent analysis of type-B fractures in relation to all replacements showed that their occurrence was significantly higher in revision than in primary THA (p = 0.006). DISCUSSION Intra-operative periprosthetic fractures have primarily been studied in terms of their frequency and the cause of their occurrence. Revision surgery and female gender are regarded as risk and predisposing factors. Our results, in accordance with other relevant data, confirmed that serious intra-operative type-B fracture occurred more frequently during revision THA than during primary surgery. It further showed a significantly higher number of periprosthetic fractures in women than in men. However, this finding is affected by the fact that women in general undergo more THAs than men and that the female median life span is longer. The authors consider a careful pre-operative planning and thorough evaluation of all risk factors related to surgery as basic preventive measures. CONCLUSIONS This continuous 15-year study on patients with intra-operative periprosthetic fractures of the hip has allowed us to conclude that these fractures occur more frequently in women than in men, and that more serious fractures (Vancouver type-B) are significantly more frequent during revision than primary THA. The higher incidence in women is, to a great part, accounted for by osteoporosis of the skeleton in elderly people. In revision THA, poor bone quality plays a role as well as osteolysis due to polyethylene granuloma which may be present.",

The demographic development of the population in Europe with fractures of the neck of femur being typical in the older patient, requires conclusive and stringent concepts of treatment. Adequate and patient oriented therapy should be promoted, regional differences and provisional deficiencies need to be adjusted in order to minimize the rate of complications. The guideline \"Schenkelhalsfraktur\" of the German board of trauma surgeons, the 'Deutsche Gesellschaft für Unfallchirurgie', and the article at hand are meant to serve as a manual for the trauma surgeon. Based on evaluated data it simplifies rational decision-making for treatment of fractures of the proximal femur. Moreover, secondary prophylaxis as well as the subsequent outpatient treatment and the social reintegration of the patients recovering from fractures of the femoral neck remains vital- ly important. After all, even with ideal treatment of the fracture more than half of the patients are impaired for a long time and one out of four permanently depends on nursing assistance.",

The group includes 8 patients treated by a one-stage reimplantation, 19 patients managed by a two-stage reimplantation, 6 patients treated by a revision surgery with implant retention, and 3 patients in whom only the implant removal was possible. In selected patients, all the reported points for all the hospital stays and costs incurred on a separately charged material were ascertained and the final sum was compared with the reimbursement obtained by the hospital in the DRG system valid for the respective year of treatment. The total costs were analysed and also an analysis by type of infection and method of treatment was carried out. RESULTS The average costs of managing infection as a complication of total hip arthroplasty at our department amounted to CZK 320 065 (CZK 56 995 - CZK 953 614), the reimbursement in respect of the monitored cases in the DRG system equalled CZK 220 503 (CZK 89 149 - CZK 589 974). The aforementioned suggests that the average loss per treated patient is CZK 99 562 (CZK + 63 372 - CZK -428 499). DISCUSION Care associated with infections as a complication of total hip arthroplasty is very costly and these costs are not fully covered by the reimbursement from the health insurance companies. In the Czech Republic, these costs have not been quantified as yet, therefore it is only possible to compare the costs with international publications arriving at similar conclusions and with own monitoring of the costs of periprosthetic joint infections after total hip arthroplasty. The most economically efficient is the one-stage replacement which, however, is not suitable for all the patients, and the two-stage reimplantation continues to be the gold standard. In our study, the most expensive was found to be the treatment of periprosthetic joint infection after total hip arthroplasty, in which also the highest financial loss is reported. CONCLUSIONS Due to the very high costs of treatment for periprosthetic joint infections after total hip arthroplasty, it is necessary to exert maximum efforts to prevent periprosthetic joint infections and to consider a change in the method of financing, particularly in centres to which patients are referred from other centres in order to make this treatment economically viable.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY To evaluate the efficacy of the systemic administration of two doses of tranexamic acid (TXA) in total knee (TKA) and hip arthroplasty (THA). MATERIAL AND METHODS The study evaluated a total of 295 patients who underwent total knee and hip arthroplasty for osteoarthritis, prospectively followed up were the patients who had been administered the tranexamic acid (TXA), and this group was subsequently compared against the cohort - control group. Our evaluation was focused on perioperative and postoperative period. The amount of blood loss was monitored during the surgery as well as postoperatively. Moreover, the frequency and the volume of administered allogeneic blood transfusions and in TKA also autotransfusion requirement were observed. The patients postoperative hemoglobin levels were compared in both the groups when the patients were in the ICU and the frequency of all postoperative complications was monitored. The statistical analysis was carried out separately for hip and knee replacement. RESULTS Our study confirmed that the systemic application of tranexamic acid in two 10-15 mg/kg doses in knee arthroplasty resulted in a statistically significant reduction of perioperative and postoperative blood loss, lower frequency of administration of allogeneic blood transfusion, but also in lower frequency in the administration of any transfusion, including autotransfusion. In patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty, the administration of TXA led to a statistically significant reduction of postoperative bleeding. The patients with total knee as well as hip arthroplasty, who had been administered TXA, showed significantly higher haemoglobin levels when transferred from the ICU. No significant difference was found in deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or other postoperative complications among the study groups. DISCUSSION There is no homogeneity in the already published studies proving the efficacy of TXA in TKA and THA, they differ considerably as to the method of administration of the tranexamic acid. The differences concern the systemic and local application, dosage and time of administration. In some studies, TXA was administered in a single dose only, whereas in other studies it was administered repeatedly, in the form of a bolus or continuously. In our study we confirmed the efficacy of systemic administration of tranexamic acid in two repeated bolus doses of 10-15 mg/kg, namely before the commencement of the surgery and at the end of the surgery. CONCLUSIONS The administration of tranexamic acid in two IV doses of 10-15 mg/kg to patients with total knee and hip arthroplasty has proven to be efficient. A higher efficacy of TXA was reported in TKA and due to routine administration of TXA the postoperative autotransfusion system (ORTHO P.A.S.) ceased to be used in knee replacement surgery.

MATERIAL AND METHODSForty patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were included in the study.Patients were grouped by their graft preference.Lachman and Pivot-shift tests were performed to the patients.Laxity was measured by KT-1000 arthrometer test with 15, 20 and 30 pound power.The maximum force values of nonoperated knee and the operated knee were recorded with Cybex II isokinetic dynamometer (HUMAC) and compared to each other.International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form, modified Lysholm and Cincinnati evaluation forms were compared between two groups. RESULTSTwenty patients included into peroneus longus allograft (Group 1) and 20 patients were included into hamstring autograft group (Group 2).The mean age of patients Group 1 and 2 were 34.25 ± 6.73, and 29.6 ± 4.55, respectively.No significant difference was noted between two groups at modified Lysholm, Cincinati and IKDC scores (p > 0.01).There was no statistically significant difference between the Lachman and Pivot hift levels (p > 0.01).No significant difference was found in KT-1000 device measurements between groups according to the performed techniques (p > 0.01).There was no statistically significant difference between Cybex extension-flexion 60 /sec measurement and extension 240 /sec measurement of the patients (p > 0.01). DISCUSSIONAllografts can be preferred because of the advantages, such as lack of donor site morbidity, short operative time, large graft, small incision, minimal scar, good cosmetic appearance, less postoperative pain, less movement restriction, and less arthrofibrosis.However, there are disadvantages, such as disease transmission, low biocompatibility, immune response, long recovery time, and high cost.Although it is difficult to compare the stability and functionality of allografts and autografts because of the differences in graft processing, fixation methods, and surgical techniques in studies, similar clinical results are reported in long-term follow-ups CONCLUSIONSGraft preference is dependent on surgical experience, patient age, activity status, comorbidities, presurgical status, and patient decision.Allograft ACL reconstruction is a good alternative to arthroscopic ACL reconstruction performed with hamstring tendon graft.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSWe retrospectively studied 641 patients operated for hip fractures in one year period.Investigated characteristics were: age, gender, American Society of Anaesthesiologists score (ASA), time of hospital admission, time of surgery, type of surgery, anticoagulant therapy (ACT) and non-routine pre-operative tests (NRPT).Trochanteric (TF) and femoral neck fractures (FNF) were analysed separately.The surgery in first 48 hours was considered early.The time of death was obtained from the federal database.Univariate and multivariable analysis were performed.P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTSAll tested characteristics were significantly different in both time groups.Delay to surgery was significantly influenced by the type of surgery -arthroplasty, odds ratio (OR) 17.2, ACT (OR 6.9) and NRPT (OR 4.0) in FNF group of patients and by ACT (OR 31.1) and ASA (OR 2.2) in TF. 30-day mortality rate was 5.1% and 1-year mortality was 18.4%.ASA (OR 1.9), preinjury residence (OR 1.4) and age (OR 1.1) had statistical influence on survival, but not delay to surgery. CONCLUSIONSThe majority of delays are due to unavailability of operative capacities, after patient optimization.We see solution in dedicated operation rooms and teams for hip fracture treatment.Mortality is influenced by the patients' characteristics, but not by delay to surgery.A multidisciplinary approach and skilled surgical teams are, besides early operation, the most important assurance of a good outcome.",

RESULTS86 patients were found to eligible for the study.The PMF was fixed using anteroposterior percutaneous screw in 50 (58.1 %) patients and with posterior open reduction-internal fixation in 36 (41.9 %) patients.AO 44 B type fracture was determined in 89.5 % of the patients, AO 44 C type was seen in 10.5 %.There were 27 patients (31.4 %) with Haraguchi type 1 fracture and 59 patients (68.6 %) with type 2 fracture.The mean step-off of the articular surface was statistically greater in Group 1 than in Group 2. No statistically significant difference was determined between the two groups in respect of syndesmosis malreduction.The mean arthritis score was higher in Group 1 than in Group 2. Mean scores of the SF-36 and FAOS questionnaire was statistically significantly improved in the patients with open reduction and internal fixation. DISCUSSIONAlthough there is no consensus on the treatment of posterior malleolar fractures, the indication for surgery is mainly based on posterior fragment size in the literature.The anatomic articular reduction has been emphasized recently.In this study, it was determined that the anatomic articular reduction was correlated with better surgical outcomes. CONCLUSIONSThe study results demonstrated that better functional and radiological outcomes was observed with direct open reduction and fixation of the posterior fragment than indirect reduction and percutaneous fixation in the patients with trimalleolar fracture.The arthritis risk and patient satisfaction were seen to be correlated with the anatomic reduction of the articular surface.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Decision-making in treatment of an acute compartment syndrome is based on clinical assessment, supported by invasive monitoring. Thus, evolving compartment syndrome may require repeated pressure measurements. In suspected cases of potential compartment syndromes clinical assessment alone seems to be unreliable. The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of a non-invasive application estimating whole compartmental elasticity by ultrasound, which may improve accuracy of diagnostics. MATERIAL AND METHODS In an in-vitro model, using an artificial container simulating dimensions of the human anterior tibial compartment, intracompartmental pressures (p) were raised subsequently up to 80 mm Hg by infusion of saline solution. The compartmental depth (mm) in the cross-section view was measured before and after manual probe compression (100 mm Hg) upon the surface resulting in a linear compartmental displacement (Δd). This was repeated at rising compartmental pressures. The resulting displacements were related to the corresponding intra-compartmental pressures simulated in our model. A hypothesized relationship between pressures related compartmental displacement and the elasticity at elevated compartment pressures was investigated. RESULTS With rising compartmental pressures, a non-linear, reciprocal proportional relation between the displacement (mm) and the intra-compartmental pressure (mm Hg) occurred. The Pearson's coefficient showed a high correlation (r2 = -0.960). The intraobserver reliability value kappa resulted in a statistically high reliability (κ = 0.840). The inter-observer value indicated a fair reliability (κ = 0.640). CONCLUSIONS Our model reveals that a strong correlation between compartmental strain displacements assessed by ultrasound and the intra-compartmental pressure changes occurs. Further studies are required to prove whether this assessment is transferable to human muscle tissue. Determining the complete compartmental elasticity by ultrasound enhancement, this application may improve detection of early signs of potential compartment syndrome.

Thorough knowledge of the elbow's anatomy and biomechanics is essential to analyze and understand the injury and plan its treatment. The aim of a differentiated therapy approach is to restore the joint's anatomy and kinetics, stable and painless joint function, and to avoid or at least delay posttraumatic joint changes. The degree of dislocation, stability of fragments, size and number of fractured joint surfaces and associated bony and ligamentous injuries (and the instability they incur) must be addressed in the therapy regimen. There are various treatment options depending on the injury's classification, i.e. a Mason I fracture is treated conservatively, while more severe injuries may require osteosynthesis and endoprosthesis. There is a lack of clear therapy recommendations based on solid evidence regarding Mason classification types III-IV. In particular expert opinions diverge and study results are inconsistent.

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to investigate the involvement of osteoporosis during remodelling of the proximal femur after uncemented total hip arthroplasty (THA) and the effect of bisphospohonate treatment on these changes.Sixty evaluated patients with non-cemented THA were divided into three groups on the basis of pre-operative densitometric examinations. Group 1 (15 patients with osteoporosis) received a single dose of 5 mg zoledronic acid in infusion during the second post-operative week. Group 2 (15 patients with osteoporosis) were not treated by bisphospohonate. The patients of both groups took oral calcium and vitamin D medication. Group 3 (control) comprised 30 patients with normal bone density who did not take any osteoactive drugs. By measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) at 12 months after surgery, changes in periprosthetic bone of the proximal femur in 7 Gruen zones were recorded by densitometry. In addition, radiological findings on native X-ray images were assessed and the patients' clinical health status was rated by the Harris hip score.No significant differences in either the average age or the body mass index were found between the groups at the time of THA surgery. The mean BMD value in all assessed Gruen zones measured at the first post-operative week was higher in patients with normal bone density than in those with osteoporosis. The mean BMD value measured at 12 months decreased in all Gruen zones in comparison with the initial value, and this was found in all three groups. The lowest values were recorded in the untreated patients (group 2); in comparison with the patients who had normal bone density, the difference was statistically significant in Gruen zones 1, 2, 6 and 7. Although the patients with treated osteoporosis also showed lower BMD values, these were not statistically significant compared to group 3. The worst post-operative outcome in clinical health status was recorded in the patients with untreated osteoporosis. X-ray examination revealed stable fibrous ingrowth in one patient with untreated osteoporosis and in one with normal bone density. All remaining patients had stable bone ingrowth fixation.In THA the majority of compressive loads are transferred through the stem to the femoral bone below the apex of the stem. This results in reduction of bone density in the calcar and greater trochanter regions. Osteoporosis is the most important factor related to changes in periprosthetic bone mass. Therefore, it can be anticipated that an excess loss of bone mass in the proximal femur may, in a long term, interfere with THA stability and may increase the risk of periprosthetic fractures and aseptic loosening.The results of our study showed that the patients with untreated osteoporosis, who underwent uncemented THA, experienced a considerable decrease in the periprosthetic bone density of the proximal femur and were in worse clinical health. A bisphospohonate therapy was effective in eliminating this negative outcome. Both the clinical and densitometric findings in patients with treated osteoporosis were similar to those in patients with no osteoporosis.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYRecent trends in the experimental surgical management of a partial anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture in animals show repair of an ACL lesion using novel biomaterials both for biomechanical reinforcement of a partially unstable knee and as suitable scaffolds for bone marrow stem cell therapy in a partial ACL tear.The study deals with mechanical testing of the newly developed ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) biomaterial anchored to bone with Hexalon biodegradable ACL/PCL screws, as a new possibility of intra-articular reinforcement of a partial ACL tear. MATERIAL AND METHODSTwo groups of ex vivo pig knee models were prepared and tested as follows: the model of an ACL tear stabilised with UHMWPE biomaterial using a Hexalon ACL/PCL screw (group 1; n = 10) and the model of an ACL tear stabilised with the traditional, and in veterinary medicine used, extracapsular technique involving a monofilament nylon fibre, a clamp and a Securos bone anchor (group 2; n = 11).The models were loaded at a standing angle of 100° and the maximum load (N) and shift (mm) values were recorded. RESULTSIn group 1 the average maximal peak force was 167.6 ± 21.7 N and the shift was on average 19.0 ± 4.0 mm.In all 10 specimens, the maximum load made the UHMWPE implant break close to its fixation to the femur but the construct/fixation never failed at the site where the material was anchored to the bone.In group 2, the average maximal peak force was 207.3 ± 49.2 N and the shift was on average 24.1 ± 9.5 mm.The Securos stabilisation failed by pullout of the anchor from the femoral bone in nine out of 11 cases; the monofilament fibre ruptured in two cases. CONCLUSIONSIt can be concluded that a UHMWPE substitute used in ex-vivo pig knee models has mechanical properties comparable with clinically used extracapsular Securos stabilisation and, because of its potential to carry stem cells and bioactive substances, it can meet the requirements for an implant appropriate to the unique technique of protecting a partial ACL tear.In addition, it has no critical point of ACL substitute failure at the site of its anchoring to the bone (compared to the previously used PET/PCL substitute).",

However, the risk of re-rupture, particularly when severe damage to the tendons has been repaired, is still high.

The aim of the study was to ascertain the reliability of the tangent sign, a commonly used indicator of the degree of suprasupinatus muscle atrophy, in the prediction of risk for tendon re-rupture in the post-operative period.In 2011 the rotator cuff torn tendons were repaired by the method of double-row suture in 37 patients. The surgery was done by an open technique using the deltoid-splitting approach. A pre-operative magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the shoulder was obtained in all patients and each was assessed by a competent independent radiology specialist with a focus on the extent of a tendon lesion and the tangent sign. At 2-year follow-up, the results of repeated MRI were evaluated in view of the state of repaired tendons and, if a re-tear was found, its relation to the original suture and its extent in the sagittal plane were determined. The pre- and post-operative MRI findings were compared to find out how the presence or absence of a tangent sign before surgery relates to the incidence of supraspinatus tendon re-rupture at 2 years after surgery. The results were statistically analysed using Student's t-test and the Chi-square test.Of the 37 shoulders, in the pre-operative period, a tangent sign was identified in 21 (56.8%). The average size of a rotator cuff tear was 29.3 mm for the whole group. For the shoulders with no tangent sign, the average value was 21.8 mm, for those with a tangent sign present, it was 39.6 mm. At 2-year follow-up, no tear was found in the patients in whom preoperative MRI showed no tangent sign while re-tears were recorded in 18 of 21 shoulders (85.7%) with a tangent sign present before surgery. On the average, the re-rupture had 40.8 mm in size and, in all cases, it occurred at the site of tendon re-insertion into the greater tubercle. These results were statistically significant (p < 0.01).In repair of injury to the tendons of the rotator cuff muscles, emphasis is currently placed on a thorough pre-operative examination. MRI is an important part of the diagnostic procedure because it provides a detailed image of the muscle as a whole. Although great advances have recently been made in both the diagnostic and surgical techniques, the incidence of tendon re-rupture within a few years of the procedure is still high.Our results show that the presence of a tangent sign detected by pre-operative MRI examination of the shoulder can be an important predictor of failure in rotator cuff repair and can also turn attention to the selection of an alternative technique to be used.",

    "abstract": "Multiple rib fractures with segmental chest wall instability are caused by high-energy chest trauma and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Flail chest injuries are mostly combined with lung injury (contusion, rupture, laceration) and subsequent pneumothorax or haemothorax. Early mechanical ventilation with internal pneumatic splinting is a conservative treatment for flail chest in patients with respiratory insufficiency. The surgical stabilisation of a flail chest is an effective method of treatment and is beneficial for selected patients. It shortens the duration of mechanical ventilation and thus reduces morbidity associated with prolonged ventilatory support. In addition, it decreases long-term pain and the inability of a flail chest to heal due to malunion, non-union or progressive collapse of the flail segment. Surgical stabilisation of a flail chest is indicated when the clinical examination shows progressive respiratory dysfunction confirmed by the results of multiple detector computer tomography (MDCT) of the thorax.Thirty-three consecutive patients who underwent surgical stabilisation of a flail chest at the Trauma Centre between 2010 and 2014 were retrospectively evaluated. This included patient demographics, chest injury extent, results of pre-operative chest imaging (MDCT), surgical stabilisation technique and post-operative outcome. In addition to providing a radiographic finding of respiratory failure, the result of MDCT chest examination was considered an important criterion for surgical intervention. Surgical stabilisation of the chest wall was performed at an interval ranging from 2 hours to 11 days after injury. Intra-thoracic procedures were indicated in patients with lung injury (pulmonary laceration). The surgical procedure was completed by chest tube placement.Surgical stabilisation was carried out using 3 to 8 plates for flail segment fixation involving 3 to 4 ribs. The duration of post- operative mechanical ventilation was 5 days on the average. It was longer in patients with associated injuries such as craniocerebral trauma or severe pulmonary contusion. Tracheostomy was performed in seven patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. Two patients had superficial surgical site infection. No death was recorded in the follow-up period.Surgical stabilisation of the flail chest segment is considered an effective procedure in selected patients, leading to improvement of respiratory function. By allowing for a shorter period of time on mechanical ventilation, it reduces the occurrence of complications due to ventilatory support. The result of MDCT chest examination in patients with fail chest is an important indication criterion for surgical fixation.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is today the most frequently used bearing surface in total joint replacements (TJR) because of its properties, i.e., excellent biocompatibility, good mechanical and tribological performance and high wear resistance. UHMWPE liners are the most loaded TJR components and, therefore, their properties are decisive for TJR longevity. This study had three objectives: 1) to evaluate the oxidative degradation of explanted UHMWPE components; 2) to look for a statistically significant relationship between the extent of oxidative degradation and the durability of joint replacements; and 3) to investigate whether the durability of a TJR was related to the type of sterilisation used in manufacture. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 26 acetabular components obtained at revision arthroplasty between 2004 and 2013 from patients in whom a Beznoska/Poldi total hip replacement was used in the period from 1977 to 2002. The average age of the patients at the time of primary implantation was 57.9 years, the average longevity of the components removed was 18.63 years (range, 6.9 to 27.9 years). Samples of worn out and unworn areas from explanted components were processed in a three-step procedure in order to finally obtain 2-mm microtome sections. These were studied by infrared microspectroscopy. Oxidative damage to UHMWPE was determined as the oxidation index (OI); radiation damage to UHMWPE during sterilization was evaluated as the transvinylene index (VI); oxidation-induced changes in the polymer structure and its properties were characterised as the crystallinity index (CI); and local changes in mechanical properties due to oxidative degradation were assessed as microhardness (MH). Spearman's correlation coefficient and the Wilcoxon two-sample test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS The OI values (average and maximum) in both worn out and unworn surface areas were related to component longevity. The difference between the oxidation index of ruptured components and that of the other components was statistically significant. Significant differences were also found between the average and maximum OI values of worn out areas and those of unworn surfaces. The relationship between the average oxidation index in both the unworn and worn out areas of UHMWPE components and the longevity of cracked components was statistically significant. DISCUSSION Our results show that the OI values obtained by microspectroscopy correlated with both the microscopic damage and the longevity of UHMWPE liners and the correlation was statistically significant also in relation to the longevity of total replacements. Relationships amongst OI, VI, CI and MH values as well as their relation to failure and longevity of total replacements are discussed. CONCLUSIONS It can be concluded that infrared microspectroscopic measurement of OI values is a simple and fast method to characterise UHMWPE liners. In addition, the IR spectra also show other supplementary characteristics, such as VI and CI indices. These values provide information on the quality of various UHMWPE types currently used in TJR surgery. The types of UHMWPE which exhibit high oxidative degradation should be avoided in clinical practice due to increased risk of early TJR failure. Responsible orthopedic surgeons should be aware of this fact and, if possible, collaborate with an independent, noncommercial laboratory in order to evaluate the quality of various UHMWPE liners used in their hospitals.UHMWPE, oxidation, total joint replacement, infrared spectroscopy, microhardness.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Peripheral fractures of the talus (lateral talar process and posterior talar process) are rare injuries, easy to miss on examination due to their location and clinical manifestation. They account for 0.3% to 1.0% of all fractures of the talus. An incorrect or late treatment of talar process fractures can result in permanent pain, impingement syndrome, healing in malposition, pseudoarthrosis development and also, due to joint instability, in a potential development of severe subtalar arthritis. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the results of surgical management of these fractures in our department. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 14 adult patients with fractures of the peripheral talar processes who met the criteria of the retrospective study and were treated in our department between 2008 and 2014. All patients underwent clinical examination with evaluation based on the AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot score, VAS score and radiographic evidence of arthritis. Follow-up ranged from 24 to 95 months. The average age of the patients at the time of surgery was 34 years (range, 21-59 years); there was one woman and 13 men. All underwent pre-operative CT scanning. The surgical procedure included open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) which, in indicated cases, was preceded by partial or total removal of the processes. RESULTS Of the 14 patients, seven were treated for fractures of the lateral talar process (LTP group) and seven for the posterior talar process (PTP group). All fractures healed completely. The median AOFAS score was 87 (72-100) points in the LTP group, and 84 (58-100) points in the PTP group. Excellent and good results on the AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot scale were achieved in 10 (72%), satisfactory in two (14%) and poor in two (14%) patients. Of the LTP group, six patients (86%) showed the VAS score ≤ 3, and one (14%) had the VAS score = 4. In the PTP group, the VAS score ≤ 3 was reported by three (43%) and values of up to 5 by four (57%) patients. Arthritis in the talocrural and subtalar joints was evaluated as zero or grade 1 in 11 (79%) of all patients; of these 11 patients only two (14%) had a VAS score higher than 3. Only one patient had marginal wound necrosis; no deep wound infection was recorded. DISCUSSION The majority of fractures in our group were due to falls from a height or traffic accidents, which is in accordance with the literature data. In about 70% of these injuries, more parts of the leg are affected and, therefore, a thorough medical inspection is necessary. These mechanisms of injury most frequently produce type II LTP fracture (Hawkins classification). Four patients with a LTP fracture, who had the process partially removed, achieved good results on the AOFAS scale and the VAS score less than or equal to 3. As also published in the literature, the removal of small fragments has no crucial effect on ankle stability. CONSLUSIONS An adequate surgical treatment of displaced peripheral fractures of the talar processes provides good functional outcomes. In fractures with associated leg injuries or high-energy traumata, the prognosis is poorer. Fractures of talar processes often show symptoms and signs similar to those of more serious forms of dislocation of the talus and therefore a careful assessment of standard X-ray images taken for a \"swollen ankle\" is necessary. If the findings are not clear, CT examination is indicated. Key words: fracture, talus, processus lateralis tali, processus posterior tali.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the results of surgical management of patients with ipsilateral injuries to the femur and the pelvis or acetabulum (floating hip). MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 54 patients with injury to the pelvic ring or acetabulum concomitant with an ipsilateral femoral fracture were treated at our Department in the period from 2005 to 2013. The group consisted of 35 men and 19 women with an average age of 36.5 (22 to 72) years. Only patients undergoing surgery were included. Excluded were patients who died within 48 hours of injury, those whose pelvic injury was treated conservatively and patients with Pipkin type IV fracture. The average follow-up was 6.1 (2 to 10) years. The mechanism of injury included a traffic accident in 36 patients, fall from a height in 15 patients and fall off a horse in two patients; one patient was buried under a collapsed trench wall. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Harris Hip Score and the Majeed scoring system. RESULTS Of 15 patients with type A fractures (pelvic ring and diaphyseal femur fractures), 12 (80%) had excellent and three (20%) had good results. The outcomes of type B fractures in 28 patients (acetabular and femoral fractures) were excellent in 12 (43%), very good in 10 (36%), good in four (14%) and poor in two (7%) patients. In the sub-group of seven patients with type C fractures (fractures of the pelvic ring and acetabulum with concomitant femoral fracture), the results were satisfactory in five patients (72%), good in one (14%) and poor also in one patient (14%). DISCUSSION The general health status of a patient after traumatic injury is decisive for choosing amongst treatment options of damage control surgery, primary temporary stabilisation and definitive stabilisation. Early definitive stabilisation of fractures gives best results. Primary external fixation of a diaphyseal femur facture with subsequent conversion to internal osteosynthesis, in relation to a change in the patient's general health state within the concept of damage control surgery, has no effect on the functional results of femoral or pelvic fracture treatment. Delayed definitive fixation of an acetabular fracture, however, makes reduction of the fracture more difficult and results in a poorer functional outcome. CONSLUSIONS Injuries to the femur concomitant with pelvic and/or acetabular fractures are serious traumatic events requiring a correct evaluation of the patient's general health status and soft tissue conditions as well as an appropriate treatment timing. The results do not differ from those of treatment for each isolated injury. They are related to types of fracture and experience of the operating team. Complications in floating hip injuries are not higher in number, but their combination may have unpleasant consequences. Key words: floating hip, surgical treatment, complications, outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The Burch-Schneider cages (BSC) are designed to manage severe acetabular defects by bridging large bone gaps and preventing medial and superior migration of the prosthetic cup. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the results of such revisions after prolonged follow-ups.From 1985 to 2000 sixty-nine acetabular revisions with BSC were performed in 68 patients with an acetabular defect classified as type Paprosky 3A (32) and 3B (37) at our institutions. After meticulous debridement of the entire acetabulum cancellous chips were pressurized into the bone defects to restore the hemispherical shape. The cage flange for the ischium was then placed after slight contouring into the foramen obturatum or inside the ischium. Finally, the cage was fixed against the ilium with at least three screws. The average age at the time of surgery was 67.9 years (range, 51-78), the mean follow-up equalled 8.3 years (range, 5-20), and the mean Harris hip score was 48 points (range, 29-76). A clinical follow-up study was performed with using conventional measures such as Harris hip score, x-ray analysis, strength of the abductor muscles, and ability to walk without support.A total of 55 patients (80.9 %) remained without any revision until the latest follow-up. Six components were removed due to aseptic loosening (8.7 %); five for septic loosening (7.2 %), and two revisions had to be performed for recurrent instability (2.9 %). Moreover, there were another six hips definitely or probably loose according to x-ray analysis resulting in a 17.4 % (12/69) rate of aseptic failure. Successful cage re-replacement was achieved only in two cases while the remaining nine hips ended as resection arthroplasties. At the time of follow-up examinations the average Harris hip score was 74 points (range, 51-91), only twelve patients were able to walk without support (12/68, 17.6 %), and insufficiency of the abductor muscles was found in fifteen hips (15/69, 21.7 %). Consolidation of the bone graft was observed in 79.7 % (55/69) of our hips.The severe acetabular bone defect reconstructions have been deteriorating with time as reported by most of the published studies. The results of the current study are no exception. On the other hand, the rate of complications observed in our study was comparable or even lower than in similar studies.Despite relatively worse results with prolonged follow-ups, the BSC remains a considerable part of the current orthopaedic armamentarium especially when extensive acetabular bone loss is countered. Loosening belongs to the most common complications of the BSC.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSOur method, using a universal measuring microscope, is based on the ability of exact identification of central positions of the head of total hip replacement before implantation and after prosthesis removal.The difference between the original and final positions allows us to calculate both linear and volumetric wear of polyethylene.During one month, the same components were repeatedly measured by two independent investigators and a total of 10 ABG 1 acetabular components were checked.The results of measurements were evaluated by a series of statistical tests, including correlation and regression analyses and analysis of variance. RESULTSHigh correlations were found among individual measurements made by each observer (r = 0.998; r = 0.973) as well as between the mean values obtained from the two observers (r = 0.996).The reliability of measurements was proved by a high correlation of the regression curve of each measurement with the \"ideal\" line.With two exceptions, the differences between paired measurements were not significant.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Arthroscopic treatment of calcaneal spur syndrome is a tissue-sparing and effective approach when conservative therapy has failed. This method, its results and our experience with the treatment of this syndrome are presented here. MATERIAL Between January 2003 and November 2007, 26 patients underwent an arthroscopic procedure for calcaneal spur syndrome; of these, 20 were women with an average age of 49 years, and six were men with an average age of 45 years. Four, three women and one man, were lost to follow-up, therefore 22 patients with 24 heels were eventually evaluated. All had conservative therapy for 3 to 6 monts. METHODS The arthroscopic method used was developed by the arthroscopic group of the Orthopaedic Service of Hospital Hermanos Ameijeiras in Havana, Cuba. The surgical technique insolves treatment of the spur and plantar fasciitis commonly found in calcaneal spur syndrome, but it also addresses adjacent calcaneal periostitis. RESULTS The results were evaluated on the scale that is part of the foot function index developed by Budiman-Mak for measuring rheumatoid arthritis pain. The patients were asked mine questions on pain intensity during various activities before and after surgery. Pain was evaluated on a scale with grades from 0 to 9. The average value was 5.9 before surgery and 1.4 after surgery. A 0-1 pain range was reported by 25 %, 1-2 by 26 % and 2-4 by 22 % of the patients. All patients reported improvement. DISCUSSION The orthopaedic group in Havana led by Carlos achieved 85 % excellent outcomes (pain range, 0-2) at one-year followup; this was 79 % in our study, in which no problems with foot arches or wound infection were recorded. CONCLUSIONS The heel spur syndrome is a result of an inflamed ligament (plantar fascia) due to repeated microtrauma. It is not a traction osteophyte,but a reaction of the tissue where it attaches to the calcaneus. Adjacent calcaneal periostitis is usually present as well. Therefore, this method treting all three causes of the syndrome appears to be more effective than mere fasciotomy.",

The aim of this study was to present the results of total hip arthroplasty (THA) for treatment of post-infectious arthritis or ankylosis, or previous arthrodesis.A group of patients, 16 women and 10 men, treated at the 1st Department of Orthopaedics, 1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, between 1980 and 2007, was evaluated. All patients had tuberculous hip arthritis in their history and subsequently underwent THA. The average age at the time of THA was 65 years.Indications for THA following tuberculous coxitis were secondary post-infectious arthritis in 20 patient, ankylosis (fibrous or osseous) in four and conversion from arthrodesis in two. Intra-operative samples were taken for microbiological examination, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and histological examination. Anti-tuberculous drugs (rifampicin and isoniazid) and cephalosporin were administered intra-operatively following the sample collection and continued post-operatively. Cephalosporin was discontinued on post-operative day 11, rifampicin and isoniazid were administered for further 3 to 5 months with regular laboratory tests.The average post-operative values for flexion ranged from 0 to 90 degrees, for abduction from 0 to 35 degrees and for both internal and external rotation from 0 to 30 degrees. At the end of treatment all patients walked without aid and with full weight-bearing on the operated leg. No complications were recorded. Intra-operative findings of microbiological, PCR and histological examinations were negative. No recurrent tuberculous disease was found.A total joint replacement in any post-infectious condition is a complex issue. The average time between achieving a steady state o tuberculous arthritis and the THA procedure was approximately seven years. The outcome was evaluated as good by 75 % of the patients, who would be willing to undergo the surgery again. The clinical picture and radiographic and laboratory findings were within norms at regular follow-ups, which is in agreement with the literature data. Our system of intra- and post-operative administration of anti-tuberculous drugs and antibiotics proved very efficient.In contrast to arthrodesis or Girdlestone resection arthroplasty, THA results in a marked improvement of painless joint motion. Before any patient is indicated for THA, a thorough medical history with laboratory, internal and pulmonary (including heart and lung radiographs) examination is necessary. When there is more than one tuberculous disease in the patient's medical history, other organ systems such as urinary or reproductive tracts should also be examined. In addition to conventional radiography, examination by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is indicated. The priority is an individual approach of the phthisiology orthopaedist to the indications ensuing from this comprehensive examination, with assessment of both physical and psychic state of the patient in view of post-operative rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "The femoral head of a bipolar hip prosthesis (BHP) consists of a steel outer shell and polyethylene liner with an inner steel head moving inside. In this study, indications for and advantages of this endoprosthesis are evaluated.The author presents indications and the surgical technique on a group of 79 patients, mostly physically active women aged 70 to 80 years. A BHP is largely indicated in patients with femoral neck fractures, and then in injuries to the proximal femur that leave the articular surface of the acetabulum intact.In the group of 79 patients, four had dislocation of the prosthesis which, in two, occurred due to stem malalignment. This was repaired by reimplantation. At 3- to 9-year follow-up, 54 patients were evaluated. Protrusion into the acetabulum, which is a feared complication of classical hemiarthroplasty, was not found. Nor was stem failure detected. The endoprosthesis was pain free in nearly all the patients. The Harris hip score was influenced by co-existing diseases of old age. DISCUSSION Most of the authors dealing with BHP appreciate its advantages in comparison with classical hemiarthroplasty, some even prefer it to total hip arthroplasty and also in indications other than acute injury. The main advantage of BHP is its better stability and, in comparison with total hips arthroplasty, its simpler implantation, which makes the surgical procedure less demanding for both the patient and the surgeon.Bipolar hip hemiarthroplasty is a treatment option in acute surgery for proximal femoral fractures. Its advantages include less stress and strain for the patients than in total hip arthroplasty, and greater stability and lower risk of protrusion into the acetabulum than in classical hip hemiarthroplasty.",

    "abstract": "To analyze our results of screening for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in the Liberec region between 1984 and 2005The study comprised 30,010 infants screened for DDH without any primary selection between 1984 and 2005.The infants were clinically examined on the basis of a three-step screening system (newborn, at 6 weeks and between 3 and 4 months of age) and by an imaging method. In the period from 1984 to 1991, this was plain radiography of the hip at 3 months of age, and a total of 12,944 infants were assessed. Between 1992 to 2005 ultrasonography (USG) was used at 6 weeks (or earlier when clinical signs were present) and again at 3 to 4 months of age, and a total of 17,066 infants were evaluated. In 16,678 of these infants, the sonogram obtained at 6 weeks was evaluated in detail by the Graf method. The presence of the epiphyseal nucleus of the proximal femur was assessed at 3 months, and from 2000 at 4 months of age. Attention was paid to the occurrence of DDH in general and findings of dislocation, both subluxation and luxation, of the hip, the proportion of right-side, left-side and bilateral findings, gender differences, the presence or absence of ossification of the femoral epiphyseal nucleus in infants between 3 and 4 months of age and, in the 1992-2005 period, the stratification of Graf types at 6 weeks. A question of whether the child's months of birth might have any relation to a possibility of DDH occurrence was also raised.Between 1984 and 1991, DDH was recorded in 10.4% of the infants, usually in a light form responding well to conservative treatment; subluxation was found in 1.99% and luxation in 0.6%. Between 1992 and 2005, DDH (mostly light forms) was recorded in 5.2%, subluxation in 0.5% and luxation in 0.2% of the infants. Right-side, left-side and bilateral findings were seen in 29%, 46% and 25% of the infants, respectively, and there were distinct differences between the genders. In an evaluated group of 453 infants with either subluxation or luxation, 86% of girls and 14% of boys were affected. The month of birth had no effect on DDH occurrence. Of the 9878 infants examined at 3 months, ossification of the femoral epiphyseal nucleus was found only in 37%, and of the 7188 infants examined at 4 months this was recorded in 64%. In a total of 33,356 hips (16,678 infants) evaluated at 6 weeks on the Graf scale, the following Graf types were recorded: Ia, 21%; Ib, 58%; IIa, 20%; IIc, 1%; D/IIIa, 0.19%; and IIIb/IV, 0.08%.The occurrence of DDH (formerly congenital dysplasia of the hip), including all forms/grades, is reported to be 3% to 5% in Central Europe. Our recent results obtained by the USG method are in agreement with this, as are our findings of its more frequent occurrence in girls (boys to girls, 1 to 6) and on the left side. Several reasons--medical, statistical or even sociodemographic--can be considered to explain the discrepancies in DDH detection rates obtained with radiography and ultrasonography, i.e., 10.5% vs 5.3%. For instance, the USG detection of DDH at 6 weeks of age initiates early treatment preventing progression of hip dysplasia. Better facilities available for home neonatal care and increased interest in general baby wellness may also play a role.Screening for developmental dysplasia of the hip is fully justified, because DDH prevalence is still high (500 subluxations and 200 luxations per 100,000 population). However, attention should also be paid to reducing factors and conditions that may adversely affect hip development from the baby's prenatal period to spontaneous walking.",

    "abstract": "To make comprehensive diagnoses of the infections associated with revision total knee and hip arthroplasties in our group of patientsFrom September 2002 till November 2004, a group of 69 patients undergoing revision total joint replacement (65 hips and four knees) were evaluated. The period between primary and revision surgery ranged from 6 months to 25 years. The patients were examined for CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and white blood cell (WBC) counts. The samples of their periprosthetic tissue were assessed for biopsy and microbial findings. The removed prosthetic components were sonicated.The samples were cultured in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions for 16 days. A finding of more than 10 neutrophils per viewing field was taken as a positive biopsy result. The definition of an infection was based on the detection of a microorganism with the identical phenotype in two or more samples.Before surgery, 13 patients had a suspected infection which was subsequently diagnosed. A positive culture result in at least one of the collected samples was found in 48 patients; of these, a positive culture finding of a phenotypically identical microorganism in two or three samples was in 32 patients, who thus met the definition of infection. The average values for the whole group were: CRP, 16 mg/L (1-109); ESR, 25 mm/h (3-110); peripheral WBC count, 6.2 x 109/L (3.6-11.6). The microorganisms most frequently growing in culture were coagulase-negative staphylococci and propionibacteria accounting for 41% and 29% of the total isolates obtained, respectively. From the total number of samples, positive culture results were obtained in 36% of sonicate femoral components; 40% of sonicate acetabular cups, 51% of periprosthetic tissues and 48% of swabs. In these positive microbial cultures strictly anaerobic microorganisms were found in 41% of femoral component, 49% acetabular component and 42% periprosthetic tissue samples and in 27% of swabs taken at arthrotomy. Prolonged cultivation of the 151 isolates initially obtained yielded 81 (54%) isolates which would have failed to be detected by primary culture. The results of laboratory tests in the patients with negative culture findings, in those with a phenotypically identical micro- organism found in one sample, and in those with positive findings in two or more samples were: CRP, 4.3 mg/L; 9.8 mg/L; and 21.7 mg/L, respectively; ERS, 13.5mm/h; 20.1 mm/h; and 33.0 mm/h, respectively; and WBC counts, 6.27 x 109/L; 6.25 x 109/L; and 6.16 x 109/L, respectively. The t-test was used for the statistical analysis of CRP, ESR and WBC count values, and it revealed a significant differences between the patients with negative microbial findings and those with positive microbial findings in two and more samples in all three values, i.e., CRP (p = 0.01), ESR (p = 0.01) and WBCs (p = 0.96). Biopsy findings showed a sensitivity of 62.5 % and a specificity of 91% in relation to the microbial findings.Our results as well as relevant literature data suggest that microorganisms may survive on implant surfaces even in the cases regarded as aseptic. They often grow slowly and, theoretically, can have an adverse effect on the longevity of revision arthroplasty. However, because of current endoprosthetic practices and the ubiquitous presence of microorganisms, contamination of some samples cannot be excluded.In our group of patients, the CRP and ESR values proved to be useful in making the diagnosis of infection. For this pur- pose, WBC counts in blood samples were not sensitive enough. Biopsy findings had low sensitivity, but appeared to be a specific marker of infection. Prolonged cultivations of samples and cultivation under anaerobic conditions resulted in a marked increase in isolates obtained, as compared with the routine cultivation technique.",

    "abstract": "Spinal navigation has substantially advanced during the past ten years. Surgeons have gained sufficient skills and confidence, and have introduced this technology to the anatomically challenging region of the upper cervical spine and craniocervical junction. The detailed evaluation of individual anatomy, rational pre-operative planning and final intraoperative control improve the safety and precision of classical surgical procedures. As methods technologically evolve, indication criteria change accordingly, but the basic principles of a relevatn choice remain; these are to reduce morbidity due to its three main causes, i.e., mechanical, neurological and vascular. We present an overview of current techniques and discuss their applicability in the region of the upper cervical spine and craniocervical junction. The systems allowing us to obtain live images intra-operatively, such as fluoroscopy or intra.operative CT, seem to be most versatile and accurate, especially when combined with traditional virtual navigation systems. Based on case histories, the authors suggest trends in the development of this field, with a focus on minimally invasive techniques.

    "abstract": "An unusual case of implant failure after revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is presented and the case report is completed with the results of an ensuing biomechanical study made to explain possible causes leading to a fracture of the tibial stem. For this we used electron microscopic and biomechanical analyses. There was no material defect found at the site of fracture. By computerized modelling of the clinical situation, however, we found out that asymmetrical progressive osteolysis of the proximal tibia could have caused significant changes in mechanical straining associated with qualitative alterations in the process of degradation and erosion of the implant, eventually leading to a fracture of the tibial stem. In this way mechanical straining at the site of fracture could have exceeded the failure threshold of titanium alloy. Stem fracture of a current tibial component design has not yet been described in the literature. The only failure so far reported concerns the stem of a femoral component, and this has also been explained by biomechanical reasons. It follows from this study that patients with progressive osteolysis around the TKA should be followed up more frequently. The conclusions of this biomechanical analysis emphasize the importance of a thorough reconstruction of bone defects in order to improve long-term survival of the implant. Key words: revision, total knee arthroplasty, osteolysis, failure, fracture, tibial stem.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSA total of 108 patients (122 hips) in whom a CLS stem was used in the 1991-1996 period were evaluated.The group included 34 men and 74 women, with an average age of 48 years (range, 28-63).The CLS stem with a neck-shaft angle of 145° and the CLS expansion cup were used in all patients.Clinical outcomes were evaluated by Merle d'Aubigné-Postel score and Harris hip score, radiological examination was completed on AP and lateral views of the pelvis and the operated hip. RESULTSThe average follow-up was 16.4 years (range, 11-17).The average Merle d'Aubigné-Postel score was 14.5 (range, 13.9-17.0)points and the average Harris hip score was 84.8 (range, 70-99) points.Very good or good outcomes were found in 81% of the patients.Three patients underwent revision surgery, in one for septic loosening, in one for aseptic loosening and in one for varus stem position leading to instability.The radiographs evaluated as described by Engh showed 116 stable stems, three fibrous stable and three unstable stems.Subsidence of more than 3 mm, without any further deterioration, was found in five hips at 12 months post-operatively.Seven hips showed one radiolucent line, four showed two radiolucent lines and three hips showed three radiolucent lines, all of them being less than 2 mm wide. DISCUSSIONRadiographic evidence of a stable stem in 116 hips (116/122) suggests a high reliability of the implant.Assessment of radiolucent lines showed 108 hips without radiographic demarcation and 11 hips with slight demarcation.The signs of stress-shielding grade 1 were found in 28 hips.Good results of arthroplasty with the CLS stem can be attributed to its threedimensional wedge-shaped design that allows for an optimal press-fit in the metaphyseal region.The porous surface provides reliable osteointegration.Stress-shielding is prevented by optimal stress distribution in the metaphyseal region and by a modulus of elasticity of titanium alloy which closely approximates the modulus of elasticity of bone. CONCLUSIONSAt 15 years post-operatively, the cumulative probability of clinical survivorship of the CLS stem was 98.3 %, and cumulative probability of radiographic survivorship was 87.7 %.The advantages of this stem include a technically simple implantation, reliable osteointegration and long-term stability even in high demanding patients.",

    "abstract": "Surgical treatment is preferred in our department in all patients with type II and type III dens fractures, regardless of their age, with the exception of non-displaced or completely reduced fractures in young patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate patients over 65 years of age treated by direct osteosynthesis of the dens or posterior atlanto-axial fixation and spondylodesis.In the years 2001 to 2005, 28 patients aged 65 years and older were surgically treated for dens fracture. This included 13 men and 15 women between 65 and 90 years of age, with an average of 77.4 years. According to the treatment, i.e., direct dens osteosynthesis (1) or C1-C2 posterior fixation (2), two groups were evaluated, and two categories were considered by age, i.e., 65 to 74 years (8 patients) and 75 years and older (20 patients). In 23 patients, an isolated fracture of the dens was present and, in five patients, injury was part of a complex C1-C2 fracture. A Frankel grade D neurological deficit was found in three patients.In all patients, surgical treatment by direct osteosynthesis of the dens from the anterior approach, using two cannulated screws, was preferred as the method of choice. However, in the case of distinct osteoporosis, fragmented fracture of the dens base or tear of the ligamentum transversum atlantis, we used the Harms method of posterior fusion with polyaxial screw fixation as the primary treatment, or the Magerl transarticular fixation completed with the Gallie technique from the dorsal approach. The patients were followed up at 3, 6 and 12 weeks, at 6 and 12 months, and then at one-year intervals. X-ray and clinical examinations were made at the regular follow-ups and functional radiographs were taken at 12 months following the surgery. The whole group was evaluated in the range of 18 to 84 months (average, 37.3 months). Neurological deficit was assessed on the basis of the Frankel classification. The results were analysed using the Chi-square test.Of 20 patients still living at the time of this evaluation, 11 underwent direct osteosynthesis and nine were treated by posterior instrumented spondylodesis. In group 1, pseudoarthrosis of the dens or fibrous callus developed in one patient (9.1 %) and a line of fracture was evident in one patient of group 2 (11.1 %), which was not significant (p<0.05). However, a statistically significant difference in mortality was found when the two age categories were compared (p>0.05), with 0 % in the younger and 40 % in the older category. The overall mortality within 6 weeks of injury was 28.6 %. Mortality in group 1 and group 2 was 21.4 % and 35.7 %, respectively; this difference was not statistically significant (p<0.05).We use conservative treatment only in the patients who are able to stand up and move soon after injury. If this is not feasible, we prefer surgical treatment with the same aim achieved as soon as possible without rigid external fixation. In this study, surgery was associated with an acceptable number of minor complications due to poor bone quality or health state of the patient. The higher mortality in the higher age category was obviously related to generally poorer health of these patients.Surgical treatment can significantly improve the quality of life in elderly patients who have suffered a fracture of the dens. The surgical technique should be chosen to take bone quality, degenerative changes of the spine and overall health of the patient into consideration. Mortality after surgery is not related to the technique selected but to patient's age. Elderly patients with neurological deficit usually die due to co-morbidity, regardless of the therapy used.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYOne of the causes of pain on the ulnar side of the wrist is post-traumatic lunotriquetral (LTq) instability, which is difficult to detect on radiographs.For diagnosis, arthroscopic examination is most reliable.The methods for treatment of LTq instability include mere immobilization, ligament reconstructions and LTq joint stabilization with Kirschner's wires in acute conditions, and stabilization of the LTq joint by tenodesis or arthrodesis.In this study our method of treating chronic isolated injury to the lunotriquetral ligament is described. MATERIALThe group comprised 43 wrists with isolated lunotriquetral ligament injuries diagnosed by arthroscopy.In 19 patients with persisting complaints, stabilization was performed using our original method.At 4 months after surgery, the results were evaluated by the method of Green and O'Brien. METHODSAccess to the LTq joint was gained through the fifth extensor compartment.At about 3 cm proximal to the ulnar head, one third of the extensor capri ulnaris (ECU) tendon was detached, without doing damage to the tendinous sheath on the ulnar head, and stretched distally up to the triquetrum-hamate joint level.Using a 3.2-mm drill, a tunnel was made on the dorsal side of the triquetrum, starting at the distal third of the ulnar side of the triquetrum and opening at the attachment site of the dorsal LTq ligament.In the middle part of the dorsal side of the lunate, a groove 4 mm deep and 6 mm long was made with a cutter and a two-suture Mitek anchor was inserted in its radial side.The graft was passed through the tunnel in the triquetrum, tightened up and inserted in the groove on the lunate, and sutured to the anchor.The rest of the tendon was reinserted to the ECU tendon.After suturing the dorsal structures and skin, a high plaster cast reaching up above the elbow was applied for 4 weeks, followed by application of a short plaster splint for another 2 weeks. RESULTSUsing the method of Green and O'Brien, we assessed pain, function (return to full activity), range of motion and grip strength.An excellent result was recorded in 48 %, good in 42 % and satisfactory in 10 % of the patients; there were no poor results. DISCUSSIONOur method gives better results than the published methods of tenodesis, because it secures stability of both the triquetrum and lunate bones.Also, these methods restrict motion to a lesser degree than LTq joint arthrodesis. CONCLUSIONSLTq instability of the wrist is a limiting condition for the patient's daily activities.It appears when, for gripping, the hand is positioned in dorsal flexion and ulnar duction.The diagnosis and therapy are complicated and only arthroscopy is reliable for LTq instability detection.The method described here provides an option for treating this disorder with good outcome and, in case of failure, does not interfere with a subsequent LTq joint arthrodesis.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate a group of patients treated for Guyon's canal syndrome with analysis of the cause for and outcome of surgery.The group comprised 13 patients operated on for compressive neuropathies of the ulnar nerve in the canal of Guyon in the period from 2007 to 2010. The clinical parameters evaluated were the adduction strength of the fifth digit, degree of interosseous primus muscle hypotrophy and degree of hypoesthesia in the area innervated by the ulnar nerve. EMG parameters included motor and sensory nerve conduction through Guyon's canal. Patients' subjective evaluations of the treatment outcomes were also recorded. The results were not compared with a control group.Post-operative improvements in all clinical and EMG parameters were significant (p=0.02-0.003). All but one patient (90%) reported an improved subjective condition after surgery; on the other hand, pre-operative severe impairment of motor nerve conduction highly affected the post-operative motor function. Guyon's canal syndrome accounted for 0.8% of all compressive neuropathies of the upper extremity in our patients.Ulnar nerve compression at the wrist is a relatively rare condition amongst the compressive neuropathies of the upper extremity, and literature data concerning this disease are very few. Although many causes of ulnar nerve compression at the wrist have been reported, only one of our patients had ganglion. We conclude that the majority of cases can be diagnosed as a \"neuritis\" due to chronic microtrauma produced by pressure of a hypertrophic palmar ligament.Syndrome of Guyon's canal can easily be treated by surgery. As in other compression syndromes, the sooner a surgical decompression is performed, the better outcomes are achieved.",

    "abstract": "Transfer of the tip of the coracoid process to the anterior margin of the glenoid is a procedure indicated in shoulder instability due to bone lesion. However, it is also used in inveterated shoulder dislocations refractory to conservative treatment that require open reduction of the joint. The bone block thus created allows for more effective and safer rehabilitation than does a temporary rigid Ki-wire fixation of the humeral head. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the group of patients treated for irreducible inveterated shoulder dislocations by the Latarjet procedure.Between 2005 and 2009, 16 patients with inveterated anterior shoulder dislocations were operated on. The group comprised 11 men and five women with an average age of 58 years. In all patients the duration of shoulder dislocation was longer than 3 days and reduction that would keep the humeral head in the glenoid socket was not possible even under general anaesthesia. The reasons for the late treatment included a delayed visit to the doctor's because the injury was not considered serious, the dislocation being missed in the presence of other more serious conditions, and even an overlooking by the attending physician. The longest time between the dislocation and its treatment was 23 days. Alcohol abuse was evident in some of the patients.In the patients with irreducible inveterated shoulder dislocations who were referred to us, closed reduction was attempted in the first place.When this failed or when spontaneous dislocation subsequently occurred, open revision surgery was carried out. After coagula and synovia were removed from the glenoid socket, the head still had a tendency to dislocate spontaneously. Subsequently, the Latarjet procedure ;was performed this involved osteotomy of the coracoid process, retaining the attachment of the short head of the biceps brachii, and its transposition, through a split in the subscapularis ten- don, to the anterior lower margin of the glenoid. The process was fixed with two traction screws to create a firm bone barrier preventing dislocation.The functional outcome was assessed at 6 months after surgery, ;using the Constant score its average value was 60 points (35 to 85). From the evaluation of individual cases it appeared that the longer the time of shoulder dislocation, the worse the functional outcome of treatment. In comparison with the patients treated by open reduction with a temporary rigid Ki-wire fixation, the Latarjet procedure was clearly beneficial.Before the Latarjet procedure has been adopted, inveterated dislocations were treated by open reduction and a temporary fixation of the head in the socket by means of Ki-wires for three weeks. The functional outcomes following inveterated dislocation and rigid fixation were pitiable. Although the shoulder was articulated, its motion was restricted and painful. The procedure described here allows the patient to start early rehabilitation while maintaining shoulder stability.Inveterated irreducible shoulder dislocation is a rare diagnosis which is usually associated with the patient's personality disorder or is missed in patients with a disorder of consciousness. The treatment is difficult, but with the use of the procedure described here it is possible, with some limitation, to restore the shoulder function and its range of motion.",

MATERIAL AnD METHODSA group of 52 patients in whom proximal femoral osteotomy using the LCP was performed on a total of 55 hips between September 2009 and February 2013 were retrospectively evaluated.The following diagnoses were treated: unstable hip in cerebral palsy, 18 operations; Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, 10 operations; coxa vara of aetiology other than coxa vara adolescentium (CvA), eight operations; true CvA, six operations; femoral shortening by the Wagner method, six procedures; proximal femoral derotation osteotomy, four procedures; and post-traumatic pseudoarthrosis of the proximal femur, three operations. RESULTSCompared with the pre-operative plan, the average deviation of the colodiaphyseal angle was 5.2° (1° to 11°) in 18 unstable hips; 4.7° (1° to 10°) in 10 cases of Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease; 4.5° (3° to 6°) in eight hips with coxa vara of aetiology other than CvA; 6.5° (2° to 13°) in six CvA hips; 4.5° (1° to 10°) in six cases of femoral shortening; 3.5° (1° to 5°) in four derotation osteotomies; and 3.7° (0° to 6°) in three corrections of pseudoarthrosis.In one patient, osteosynthesis failed due to screws being pulled out from the proximal fragment; re-osteosynthesis was carried out using a conventional angled blade plate. DISCUSSIOnAs in other international studies, our results confirmed a high accuracy of proximal femur correction with use of the LCP instrumentation.The reported higher time requirement for this technique seems to be related to the learning curve and, with more frequent use, will probably be comparable to the time needed for application of conventional hip angled plates. COnCLUSIOnSThe up-to-date LCP fixation system using the principle of angular stability for correction of the proximal femur in children is a clear advancement and its higher costs are certain to be outweighed by its higher accuracy and thus better results.",

The group comprised 15 women (55.5 %) and 12 men (45.5 %), with an average age of 53.6 years (range, 18 to 84 years).Conservative reduction and subsequent immobilization were done in all fractures. The surgical procedure was indicated within 24 hours of injury, with neurological deficit or an open fracture this was 6 hours. Access to the fracture was from a longitudinal dorsal incision with intra-articular osteotomy of the olecranon. The ulnar nerve was released and transposed.The fractures were reduced with an effort of maximal restoration of the articular surface, and then fixed with LCP-distal humerus plates. Antibiotic prophylaxis was administered and the wound was drained and a drain was inserted. The arm was immobilized in a plaster cast or a removable brace for 2 to 4 weeks, according to the fracture type. The patients had clinical and X-ray follow-up at 6 weeks, then at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. The evaluation was based on the Mayo elbow performance score (MEPS).The injury was caused by a fall in 24 patients (88.9 %), sustained in a car accident in two (7.4 %) and as the result of a gunshot in one patient (3.7 %). Multiple injuries to the musculoskeletal system were diagnosed in five patients (18.5 %). One patient with polytrauma after a fall from 6 metres suffered an ipsilater fracture of the distal femur (3.7 %). The two patients involved in car accidents (7.4 %) had injury to the contralateral acetabulum. Two patients (7.4 %) sustained distal radial fractures on the other side. Surgery was carried out within 10.5 hours (4 to 47) of injury on the average. The average hospital stay was 6.4 days (2 to 12). All 27 fractures were classified as AO type C fractures, of these seven were open fractures. Complete bony union was achieved at an average of 4 months, with a range of 3 to 9 months (in two patients 7.4 %) after surgery.The early post-operative complications included wound dehiscence due to superficial infection in two patients. In two patients early removal of the implants was indicated, and this was for ulnar nerve irritation and motion range restriction in one and deep infection in the other. No migration or failure of the implants was recorded. The average MEPS of the patient group was 91.6, which is in the range of excellent to very good results.The group of our patients is by age, sex and AO type C fractures comparable with the groups of other authors.The number of complications is lower and the MEPS evaluation is comparable. Even when full anatomic reduction and stable fixation are achieved, the outcome may be compromised by heterotrophic ossification, joint rigidity or ulnar neuropathy, the facts described by the majority of authors. Similarly, it is reported that good results are obtained with intra-articular osteotomy of the olecranon and ulnar nerve transposition. An important component of the treatment is good quality physical therapy restoring a satisfactory range of motion. CONCLUSIONS The study provided evidence that the use of LCP-DHP provides stable fixation of type C fractures, even in patients with osteoporosis, and when completed with early rehabilitation, it has good clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The study presents a retrospective evaluation of clinical data and arthroscopic findings in a group of our patients with symptomatic knee instability due to a partial tear of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).The group included 31 patients diagnosed with symptomatic partial ACL tears, i.e. an isolated tear of the posterolateral (PL) or the anteromedial (AM) bundle. The patients' average age was 26.5 years. A side-to-side difference in ventral knee laxity was assessed using the anterior drawer test and the Lachman test under general anaesthesia before arthroscopy was commenced; rotational knee laxity was evaluated by the pivot shift test. An objective evaluation of side-to-side ventral laxity differences in both knees was performed on the GNRB® arthrometer with an applied pressure of 134 N and 250 N in the conscious patient. During arthroscopic examination, findings on the two ACL bundles were recorded.All 31 patients were diagnosed with symptomatic partial ACL tears, of them 22 had a PL bundle lesion and nine had an AM bundle tear. All patients with PL bundle lesions only reported problems in association with pivot sports, and all patients with AM bundle tears had problems regardless of any sports activities. In all patients with isolated AM bundle tears, the lesion was located close to its femoral attachment. In the patients with PL bundle tears, femoral location was found in 68% and tibial location in 32% of the patients. In the patients with partial PL bundle lesions, + and ++ results in the pivot shift test were recorded in 32% and 68% of the treated patients, respectively. The Lachman test showed + and ++ results in 71% and 9% of the patients, respectively. The anterior drawer test had negative results in 87% and positive + results in 13% of the patients. The side-to-side difference on the GNRB arthrometer ranged from 0.4 to 2.3 mm at a pressure of 134 N and from 1.2 to 4.2 mm at 250 N in the patients with isolated PL bundle lesions. In the patients with AM bundle lesions, the results were as follows: pivot shift test, 89% negative. 11% positive +; Lachman test, 56% negative, 44% positive +; anterior drawer test, 89% +, 11% ++; GNRB test, 2.2 to 4.4 mm at 134 N, and 4.3 to 7.1 at 250 N.The diagnosis of partial ACL lesions, i.e., isolated tears of the AM or the PL bundle, requires accurate knowledge of knee anatomy and its biomechanics. In accordance with other authors our results showed that an arthroscopic examination of both bundles of the ligament as well as knee laxity evaluation under general anaesthesia are most essential for making the definite diagnosis in partial ACL tears. They also confirmed that, in isolated AM bundle lesions, ventral laxity is present more often particularly at a higher degree of knee flexion while, in PL bundle lesions, rotational laxity is more frequent and ranges from 0 to 30 degrees of knee flexion.To make the definite diagnosis of partial ACL tears, patient medical history, clinical knee examination including instability type and degree assessment under general anaesthesia and, most importantly, arthroscopic findings on both ACL bundles are necessary.",

MATERIAL AnD METHODSA retrograde nail for tibio-talo-calcaneal arthrodesis was developed at our department in cooperation with MEDIn Company.This is a titanium double-curved nail, with the distal part bent at 8 degrees ventrally and 10 degrees laterally.It is inserted from the transfibular approach. RESULTSSixty-two patients, 35 women and 27 men, were treated at our department from 2005.Since one patient had bilateral surgery, 63 ankles were included.The indications for arthrodesis involved rheumatoid arthritis in 42, post-traumatic arthritis in 10, failed ankle arthrodesis in two and failed total ankle arthroplasty in five ankles; tibial stress fractures close above the ankle in two RA patients, one patient with dermatomyositis and one with lupus erythematodes.The average age at the time of surgery was 64.2 years (range, 30 to 80).The average follow-up was 4.5 years (range, 1 to 9 years), Satisfaction with the treatment outcome and willingness to undergo surgery on the other side were reported by 82% of the patients.The AOFAS score improved from 35 to 74 points.Three (4.8 %) patients complained of painful feet due to the fact that exact correction of the calcaneus was not achieved and the heel after arthrodesis remained in a slightly varus position.Of them, two had a failed total ankle arthroplasty.Post-operative complications included early infection managed by antibiotic treatment and early surgical revision with irrigation.intwo (3.2%)RA patients, who were undergoing biological therapy.Late infection developed at 2 to 3 years after surgery in three (4.3%)patients (two had RA).The infection was managed by revision surgery with nail removal and irrigation.All patients healed well.necrosis of the talus and development of a pseudoarthrosis were recorded in four (6.4%) patients, who subsequently underwent nail removal and repeat fusion using an external fixator. DISCUSSIOnRetrograde nailing for tibio-talo-calcaneal arthrodesis is used by many authors.Its complication rate is comparable with the other methods of arthrodesis. COnCLUSIOnSThe use of tibio-talo-calcaneal arthrodesis aims at a painless and stable joint.Arthrodesis of the talus and the subtalar joint using a retrograde nail is an effective surgical treatment of the joints affected.It is especially recommended for RA patients who have severe deviations.Retrograde nailing provides a stable osteosynthesis which does not require plaster cast immobilisation.The double-curved nail allows for its insertion in the solid part of the calcaneus and helps avoiding injury to the neurovascular bundle.",

    "abstract": "The flexor hallucis brevis (FHB) is one of the short muscles of the foot. It divides in front into two portions, which are inserted into the medial and lateral sides of the base of the first phalanx of the great toe. The detailed knowledge of its insertion into the proximal phalangeal base is decisive in any surgery involving the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, such as implant arthroplasty, resection arthroplasty or amputation. Complications resulting from injury to this insertion are commonly known. The aim of this study was to describe in detail the morphology of FHB insertion sites and to determine a safe extent of resection to be done at the base of the proximal phalanx.In 36 cadaver specimens we measured FHB insertion length from the plantar side of the proximal phalangeal base and from the plane perpendicular to the long axis of the phalanx and passing through the base of the concave articular surface of the phalanx.Measured from the plantar base of the proximal phalanx, the mean length of the medial insertion site was 11.5 ± 0.9 mm (range, 9.5 to 13.0 mm) and that of the lateral insertion site was 9.5 ± 1.1 mm (range, 8.0 to 11.5 mm). After resection, the mean values for medial and lateral FBH insertion sites were 8.5 ± 1.7 mm (range, 6.5 to 11.0 mm) and 7.1 ± 1.4 mm (ran- ge, 5.5 to 9.5 mm), respectively. The mean total proximal phalangeal length was 33.1 ± 2.2 mm (range, 28.5 to 37.0 mm), reduced after resection to 30.5 ± 2.1 mm (range, 26.0 to 34.5 mm).Our results show that the medial insertion site, where the medial FHB tendon and distal part of the abductor hallucis muscle are joining, is longer than the lateral site. Therefore the length of the lateral site is decisive for preserving FHB function. Since the plane perpendicular to the long axis of the phalanx and passing through the base of the concave articular surface of the phalanx is almost identical with the beginnings of FHB insertions, it seems optimal for clinical practice to perform the initial resection along this plane.To preserve at least one third of the FHB insertion, the final resection should not exceed 4 mm or 13 % of the proximal phalangeal length, as measured from the reference plane defined above.",

    "abstract": "The study presents the evaluation and comparison of two groups of patients surgically treated for ankle fractures at our department in 2007 and in 2010, respectively. Our analysis included patients' age, the mechanism of injury, fracture morphology and the method of osteosynthesis. The aim of the comparison was to ascertain recent trends in the development of the selected characteristics.The 2007 group comprised 62 patients, 31 men and 32 women, the 2010 group had 123 patients, 55 men and 68 women. The ankle fractures were classified according to the Weber and Lauge-Hansen systems. The selected characteristics were analysed in each group and the results were compared to obtain information on changes during the interval of 4 years. The data were evaluated using the methods of descriptive statistics; categorical data were analysed by the chi-square test with the level of significance set at 5%.The average age was 44 years in men and 59 in women in the 2007 group and 40 years in men and 56 in women in the 2010 group; in the whole patient group, the average age decreased from 52 years in 2007 to 47 years in 2010. Based on the Weber classification, the incidence of fractures in 2007 and 2010 was as follows; type A, 5% in both years; type B, 68% and 72%; type C, 27% and 23%. There was no significant difference between the groups in the incidence of either type B or type C fractures (p = 0.823 and p = 0.659, respectively). The majority of fractures were caused by low-energy mechanisms. High-energy injuries due to falls from a height or traffic accidents did not exceed 6 %. In men, who sustained sports-related injury more often, fractures were found in 23% and 16% in 2007 and 2010, respectively; this difference approached statistical significance (p = 0.050). Most of the fibular fractures were managed by plate osteosynthesis, often in combination with lag screws. Medial malleolar fractures were usually fixed with two cancellous screws, or with a screw and a K-wire. The number of surgical inspections of the medial structures of an injured ankle with no medial malleolar fracture decreased from 68% in 2007 to 37% in 2010. Osteosynthesis of a fractured posterior margin of the distal tibia was carried out in 7% of the patients in 2007 and in 23% in 2010.The morphological and epidemiological characteristics described were selected to obtain a comprehensive notion of the patients studied. Only the patients who had surgery were included. An increase in the number of ankle fractures managed surgically during a four-year period of our study was due to a growing number of patients and the fact that surgery was indicated more frequently because stricter criteria for assessment of post-reduction findings or secondary displacement were adopted. In surgical treatment, the recent trend preferring primary osteosynthesis to transfixation or external fixation has been evident because it allows for early rehabilitation and return to normal activities.The number of ankle fractures treated by primary osteosynthesis grew between 2007 and 2010. There was also an increase in the number of fractured posterior margins of the distal tibia managed by osteosynthesis. The results of the Weber and Lauge-Hansen classifications were in agreement with the relevant literature data. In the majority of cases the ankle fracture occurred as a single trauma.",

MATERIAL AnD METHODSA group of 19 patients (15 women and four men; mean age, 24.3 years) who underwent arthroscopic transcapsular iliopsoas tenotomy for internal snapping hip syndrome in the period between September 2010 and December 2011 were prospectively evaluated.no injury, hip surgery or feeling of hip instability was recorded in their personal histories.Radiographs did not show any dysplasia, retroversion of the acetabulum or cam lesions.The patients were allocated to two groups using sealed envelope randomisation: Group 1 patients (n = 10) were treated by tenotomy from the peripheral compartment and group 2 patients (n = 9) underwent tenotomy from the central compartment during traction of the lower extremity.The evaluation included pre-operative 3T MRI findings, arthroscopically detected intra-articular lesions, duration of traction and post-operative complications.The pre-operative WOMAC scores were compared with those at one-year follow-up.In comparison of the two groups, the Mann-Whitney exact test was used for WOMAC scores and Fisher's exact test for post-operative complications.Statistical significance was set at a 0.05 level. RESULTSIn comparing post-operative complications, a significant difference (p = 0.0468) between the groups was found only for genital paresthesia, which did not occur in group 1.The other differences were not statistically significant.The pre-operative WOMAC scores did not differ significantly between the groups (p = 0.79).The post-operative WOMAC scores were significantly higher in group 1 (p = 0.02).In each group the change in WOMAC scores was different and was statistically significant in group 1 (p = 0.0014).Associated intra-articular hip pathologies, most frequently synovitis of the peripheral compartment, acetabular chondropathy, or labral lesions, were diagnosed in 90% of group 1 patients and in 66.7% of group 2 patients. DISCUSSIOnMost of the authors comparing the results of two different ilioproas tenotomy techniques at one-year follow-up did not report any statistically significant differences in WOMAC scores between them.In accordance with the data reported, an increase in the post-operative WOMAC score, i.e., improvement of clinical outcome, was achieved in all our patients and, in group 1, it was significantly higher (p=0.0015), as compared with a similar study by Ilizaliturri.However, further follow-up of the patients and evaluation of long-term results will be necessary. COnCLUSIOnSThe technique of arthroscopic ilioproas tenotomy approached from the peripheral compartment resulted in significantly fewer cases of genital paresthesia and provided significantly better clinical outcomes in comparison with tenotomy from the central compartment.",

MATERIALThirty-five patients with ICE avulsion fracture, 17 girls and 18 boys at an average age of 13 years (7-18), were included in this study.All were indicated for surgical treatment on the basis of radiographic evidence of McKeever type II and III fractures. METHODSThe technique of arthroscopic reduction and fixation with crossed K-wires was used.The clinical evaluation of knee stability (anterior drawer test and Lachmann s-test) was made by one clinician.The modified Tegner-Lysholm score was assessed. RESULTSOf the 35 patients, 26 (74%) had minimal knee instability (anterior drawer up to 5 mm), two patients were primarily converted to open reduction with good results, and three (8.5%)experienced temporary knee instability (anterior drawer of 5-10 mm) that resolved spontaneously within 24 months of surgery.Four patients (11.5%) had symptoms of persistent residual instability (anterior drawer more than 10 mm) and were indicated for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction at a later stage.The average Tegner-Lysholm scores were 86.3/100 and 98.6/100 at 6 and 24 months, respectively. DISCUSSIONAt the present time at our department, McKeever type II and III avulsion fractures of the intercondylar eminence are indicated for minimally invasive surgical treatment.By exact reduction it is possible to decrease the risk of post-operative knee instability.The current trend is the use of arthroscopy-assisted minimally invasive techniques such as the method of K-wire fixation described here. CONCLUSIONSArthroscopic surgery for ICE avulsion fractures shows good results, is associated with low post-operative risks, is minimally invasive and easy to reproduce.It can be recommended as the method of choice for treating ICE avulsion injury in children.",

    "abstract": "To present the authors' technical experience with the use of the Expert Tibial Nail (ETN) technique and its clinical results.Between December 2005 and the end of 2007, the ETN technique was used in 41 patients to treat 41 diaphyseal tibial fractures. All patients were followed-up prospectively.The injury Severity Score (ISS) was in the range of 4 to 25 (average, 5.9). Eight patients suffered multiple trauma, 33 had isolated injuries. Of the 41 fractures, 31 were closed and 10 were open injuries. The fracture types according to the Tscherne classification were as follows: closed 0 type (n=10); closed type I (n=18); closed type II (n=3); open type I (n=3); open type II (n=5); open type III (n=2). The injury-to-surgery interval ranged from 1h and 50 min to 25 h and 12 min (median, 8 h and 52 min).The operative time ranged from 50 to 170 min (average, 87 min). Infectious complications or a secondary loss of reduction were not recorded. Three cases of insufficient primary reduction underwent repeat surgery during the first stay in hospital. Full weight-bearing with no pain was reported in the range of 10 to 24 weeks (average, 18 weeks) after surgery.A choice of the nail diameter in relation to the marrow cavity width can be made during surgery with no loss of reduction (guidewire; undreamed/reamed nail). Because of a shorter straight lower part of the nail (compared to a UTN), a very steep position of the nail is necessary at its insertion in a short proximal metaphyseal fragment. The blunt lower ETN end can produce fracture line distraction when an effort is made to drive the nail as deep as possible into the short distal meta- physeal block, if this has not been reamed.The ETN provides sufficient stability of diaphyseal tibial fractures including those involving the metaphysis. However, in some instances, poler screws are still indispensable. Sufficient reduction is necessary before nail insertion.",

It included 116 patients (72 men and 44 women) at the age between 17 and 86 years (average, 38 years). The urine was examined for the presence of blood by clinical and laboratory methods and, based on the results, the patients were allocated to three groups with macroscopic haematuria, microscopic haematuria and negative findings, respectively. The results in each group were then related to those of the imaging methods (computed tomography /CT/ and ultrasonography /US/) and, using Epi Info Version 6 CZ software, the statistical significance was evaluated by the Chi-square test with the level of significance set at 0.5 %.Haematuria, either macroscopic or microscopic, was confirmed in 102 (88 %) patients. No blood in the urine was detected in 14 (12 %) patients. Positive CT or US findings were recorded in 76 (66 %) patients with subcapsular haematoma, renal contusion or perirenal haematoma. In the patients with haematuria, the confirmation of their diagnosis by imaging methods was not significant (p=0.076). The sensitivity of macrohaematuria was 53 ;% and that of microhaematuria was 21 % the specificity was 21 % and 13 %, respectively. The sensitivity of imaging methods was 62 % and their specificity was 38 %.A consistent exclusion of all patients diagnosed with injury to the lower urinary tract allowed us to relate haematuria in our group only to renal parenchymal trauma. The authors consider this an important part of the study method. However, although this method of patient selection was strictly observed, haematuria failed to be detected in all patients diagnosed with low grade renal trauma. The CT or US findings of renal trauma in the patients with no haematuria can be explained by the fact that the lesion occurred in the superficial renal cortex with bleeding detected as a subcapsular haematoma or perirenal collection without blood leaking into the renal tubular system. The statistical evaluation of the results confirmed the randomness of both the clinical manifestation of a trauma and the diagnostic method presentation of a renal trauma. The changes in tissues and their manifestations are highly variable including a potential negative finding without causality. Even though the group under study fails to be exactly evaluated by statistical methods, it is obvious that the validity of a diagnosis of low grade renal trauma is higher if haematuria is present together with positive CT or US findings.The finding of haematuria is a valuable piece of information in low grade renal trauma. Particularly, if imaging methods fail to detect an injury, haematuria is a sign indicating renal trauma following a typical blunt force mechanism, even though our results of its evaluation were not statistically significant. The absence of macroscopic or microscopic haematuria did not exclude the existence of renal trauma in our group, and it is therefore necessary to pay increased attention to the evaluation of findings obtained by imaging methods in patients involved in a typical blunt force accident.",

The distal tibia is one of the most common locations for transitional fractures second only to the distal radius. Aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological results after surgical treatment of transitional fractures of the distal tibia.From May 2003 to March 2009 24 children (median age 14 years) received surgical treatment for transitional fractures of the distal tibia. 89% (21/24) of patients were followed up after 27.5 (range 6 to 72) months to assess functional out come (using the AO Foot and Ankle Score).Nine girls and 15 boys were included in the study with the girls being younger on average (12.4 ± 0.9 vs. 14.3 ± 1.1 years, p = 0.00013). Two-plane fractures were present in 4 cases, 15 and 5 children sustained tri-plane I and II fractures, respectively. Median preoperative fracture displacement was measured at 4 mm (range 3 to 11 mm). Traumatic supination of the ankle joint during sports activities was the predominant injury mechanism (18/24 cases) followed by bicycle or motorbike accidents (6/24). A satisfactory reduction (1 mm or less) was achieved in all but one patient. In this case revision surgery was necessary to restore anatomical reduction. No perioperative complications occurred in the remaining 23 cases. Metal implants were removed upon fracture consolidation after 8.2 ± 6.7 months. At the time of follow-up none of the children were impaired in activities of daily living and there were no restrictions in sporting activity. All patients sco- red good or excellent results on the AO Foot and Ankle Score.Surgical stabilization can be recommended as a safe and effective treatment strategy in displaced transitional fractures of the distal tibia and will lead to good or excellent mid term results.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS In total, 27 patients (mean age 43.6 ± 13 years, range 18-69) with a pilon tibial fracture and a minimum follow-up of 24 months were included in the study. Medical recordings (discharge documents and surgical reports) and radiographic examinations were analyzed. All enrolled patients were invited for a clinical and radiological follow-up examination (ROM, AOFAS hindfoot score, Kellgren score). The mean follow-up time was 44.5 ± 16 months (range 24-82). RESULTS In 21 cases a two-stage operative strategy with initial closed reduction and external fixation was necessary prior to definitive osteosynthesis. Overall, the patients scored 82.1 ± 20 points (range 30-100) in AOFAS hindfoot score, which represents a good clinical outcome. Patients with B-type fractures scored significantly better than those with C-type fractures. Patients with closed pilon tibial fractures reached significantly higher values in the AOFAS hindfoot score than those with open ones. Age and gender did not affect the functional outcome. Total ankle range of motion was 41° ± 10° for B-type fractures (range 20°-55°) and 35° ± 17° (range 0°-60°) for C-type fractures respectively (p > 0.05). Only five patients reached higher scores (Grade III) in Kellgren classification system. DISCUSSION Within the last decades, the therapeutic algorithm of pilon fractures underwent a paradigm shift; a two-stage protocol has prevailed today. However, the initial severity of the fracture in terms of initial absorbed energy, bony comminution and softtissue trauma still affects the outcome. Moreover, the necessity for bone grafting, as an indirect measurement of bone comminution and bone defects, resulted in higher degrees of osteoarthritis in the final follow-up. Higher initial soft-tissue injury also had an impact on the functional outcome of the patients, as patients with closed fractures scored better in AOFAS at the final follow-up. In order to counteract these risk factors and to reduce complications that define the outcome of these severe injuries, clearly defined surgical principles and standardized treatment protocols are needed. CONCLUSIONS The present study confirms the fact that meticulous planning, respect of the soft-tissues and choice of the optimal timepoint for the definitive osteosynthesis and overall treatment according to standardized protocols can optimize the outcome of this severe injury.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYNon-operative and operative treatment of acetabular fractures is associated with a risk of development of posttraumatic avascular necrosis of femoral head or with the development of posttraumatic coxarthrosis.The purpose of the study was to identify the occurrence of these two complications in patients in our group and to determine the risk factors for the development of these complications. MATERIAL AND METHODSThe retrospective study was conducted in two Level I trauma centres in the period from 2009 to 2014.The group included patients with an acetabular fracture.The inclusion criteria were the following: outpatient follow-up for the period of 3 years after the injury, full radiology and CT documentation.The exclusion criteria were the following: pathological fractures, missing documentation after the union, insufficient follow-up period or dissent of the patient.The inclusion criteria were met by 192 patients, 48 women and 144 men, with the mean age of 48.9 years.The following basic epidemiological data were monitored: age, sex, cause of injury, type of fracture according to the Letournel classification, occurrence of associated injuries and type of therapy.The patients undergoing non-operative treatment as well as patients undergoing operative treatment underwent clinical and radiological examinations at 3 and 6 weeks after the injury, then at 3, 6 and 12 months after the injury, subsequent follow-up checks were done at a year-interval up to 3 years after the injury. RESULTSThe posttraumatic avascular necrosis of femoral head developed in 22 patients (11.7%, 17 men, 5 women, p = 0.1159), with the mean age of 55.3 years (STDEVP 15.5, range from 22 to 82).The average time to the development of femoral head necrosis was 13.1 months (STDEVP 17.0, range from 1 to 80), median 6 months, 95% percentile 34 months.In a total of 16 patients necrosis developed within 18 months after injury, while in 6 patients after a longer period of time.Progression of coxarthrosis was observed in 63 patients (33.5%, 44 men and 19 women, p = 0.0447).Within 24 months progression was seen in 55 patients, beyond 2 years in 8 patients.Confirmed as risk factors for the development of posttraumatic avascular necrosis of femoral head and progression of posttraumatic coxarthrosis were the age 60 years and above (p = 0.0023), posttraumatic medialisation of the femoral head greater than 2 mm (p < 0.0001), displacement in the weight bearing area within the acetabulum greater than 2 mm (p < 0.0001), operative treatment (p = 0.0014), combined surgical approach (p = 0.0044), and higher caput-collum-diaphyseal (CCD) angle of proximal femur (p = 0.0142).At risk for the development of avascular necrosis were the A5 type fractures (p = 0.0214) and B2 type fractures (p = 0.0218), at risk for the development of coxarthrosis were the C1 type fractures (p = 0.0122).The isolated fractures of the anterior column were by contrast associated with a significantly lower risk for development of both the AVN (p = 0.0052) and posttraumatic coxarthrosis (p = 0.0006), the isolated fractures of the posterior wall were associated only with a higher risk for AVN and coxarthrosis summation (p = 0.0399), and the same applies to the T fractures (B3, p = 0.0200). DISCUSSIONMajority of current studies regarding acetabular fractures focuses on operative treatment, short-term complications and comparison of outcomes of operative and non-operative treatment.Only a few studies are dedicated to epidemiological data, or risk factors for the development of medium-term and long-term complications.In the presented study attention was paid to two main complications arising from these fractures and requiring subsequent operative treatment: posttraumatic avascular necrosis of femoral head and posttraumatic coxarthrosis.The limitations of the study are its retrospective nature, summation of groups from two trauma centres (potential bias in patient enrolment or in assessing radiographs), lower frequency of clinical surveillance in non-operatively treated patients after healing, a fairly low number of non-operatively treated patients -especially those with osteoporosis-related insufficiency fractures.Ranking among the relative limitations is also the Letournel classification which, though most commonly used at present, shows a low level of correlation in comparisons by more evaluators. CONCLUSIONSConfirmed as significant risk factors for the development of posttraumatic avascular necrosis of the femoral head and posttraumatic coxarthrosis progression were the age of 60 and above, posttraumatic medialisation of the femoral head",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The study aims to evaluate the long-term results of computer-navigated total knee arthroplasties performed by less experienced surgeon performing a small number of procedures per year. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the prospective randomised study functional and radiological results, rate of revision and probability of clinical and radiological survival were compared in 30 computer-navigated (in 28 patients: 19 women, 9 men, with the mean age of 66.9 years) and 31 conventionally implanted (in 30 patients: 27 women, 3 men, with the mean age of 66.5 years) cemented total knee replacements without patellar resurfacing. The group was composed of patients who underwent surgery performed by the same surgeon who at the time of enrolment of patient in the study had no previous experience with the total knee replacement surgery and performed up to 30 such procedures annually. The mean follow-up of patients was 11 years. RESULTS No statistically significant differences were detected regarding the mean age, sex, body mass index and etiology of osteoarthritis of the operated knee. The mean duration of computer-navigated surgeries (101±14.1; 80-140 min) was considerably longer than the duration of conventional joint replacements (94±8.2; 80-100 min; p = 0.01). When evaluating the radiological results, a statistically significant difference was found between the groups only with respect to the mean value of dorsal inclination of the tibial component (88.2˚±2.1 vs 86.2˚±3, p = 0.02). The mean values of other monitored angles did not show any significant differences. The number of correct implants (with a deviation of 3 degrees from the target values) was statistically significantly higher in the group of computer-navigated joint replacement surgeries in all the monitored parameters (aFT: 87% vs. 67%, p = 0.04; α: 87% vs. 71%, p = 0.04; β: 87% vs. 65%, p = 0.03; γ: 93% vs. 74%, p = 0.02; δ: 90% vs. 77%, p = 0.04). Radiologic signs of unstable fixation were detected in 2 cases of computer-navigated joint replacement surgeries and in 7 cases of conventional replacements. Cumulative probability of radiologic survival at 10 years reached 93% in the compute-navigated surgery and 77.4% (p = 0.047) in the group with conventional procedure. In total, 4 revision surgeries with a reimplantation of at least one prosthetic component were reported. All the cases came from the conventional implantation group due to aseptic loosening of the endoprosthesis. In the computer-navigated group, one revision was performed for patellar pain, without replacing or adding any endoprosthetic component. The probability of clinical survival in computer-navigated replacements after 10 years was 100%, in conventional total knee replacements it was 87% (p = 0.04). The cumulative total endoprosthesis revision rate in the computer-navigated group was 3.3%, whereas in the group with conventional total knee replacements it was 12.9% (p = 0.04). The clinical assessment based on the WOMAC and Knee Society Scores showed no statistically significant differences. DISCUSSION The most common cause of the failure of total knee arthroplasties is the malposition of implants which results in early aseptic loosening. The radiologically correct position of knee endoprosthesis is seen in 80% of standard replacement surgeries performed by experienced surgeons. The potential error rate can even increase if the arthroplasties are performed by less experienced orthopaedic surgeons. The computer-navigated total knee replacement was introduced to make the position of implants more accurate. However, the question remains unanswered if more accurate positioning of the implants achieved with computer navigation decrease the revision rate and extend the long-term survival of knee endoprostheses. CONCLUSIONS Kinematic computer navigation allowed a less experienced and low-volume orthopaedic surgeon to make the implantation of endoprostheses more accurate, to decrease the total revision rate, and thus to ensure a higher probability of long-term survival of total knee arthroplasties.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis affects primarily postmenopausal middle-aged and older women. Total joint replacement is one of the surgical treatment options for symptomatic advanced degenerative changes of the carpometacarpal joint. This study aims to evaluate the short-term functional and radiological results of the Ivory ® prosthesis with the minimum followup period of three years after the surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS Presented are the results of 48 total trapeziometacarpal joint replacements in the group of 40 patients composed of 36 women and 4 men. The age of patients ranges from 41 to 75 years (median 56 years), with the ratio between the dominant and non-dominant upper extremity 23:25. The follow-up period ranged from 36 to 63 months (median 52 months). The surgery was indicated in patients with symptomatic trapeziometacarpal arthrosis of stage II, III and early stage IV according to Eaton-Glickel once the conservative therapy had failed. In all the patients, the evaluation of the function and pain of the operated joint by DASH score, the range of motion -thumb opposition by Kapandji score were carried out at regular intervals pre- and postoperatively, the radiological evaluation of the stage of degenerative joint condition was done preoperatively, whereas the position of the implant and the lengthening of the first column of the finger were assessed postoperatively. RESULTS Subjectively, the patients were satisfied with the result of the surgery. After the joint replacement, in 65% of cases the patients reported full satisfaction with no difficulties present, in 31% of cases the patients suffered from pain during loading, in 4% of cases the patients reported also occasional pain at rest. Postoperatively, the total DASH score values decreased from the mean preoperative value of 52.79 to 10.4 points at a three-year follow-up. The average value of pain dropped from 3.46 to 1.44 points 3 years after the surgery. The average range of motion - thumb opposition by Kapandji score increased from 8.57/10 to 9.85/10 one year after the surgery. The difference between the values of average increase in length of the first column of the finger was 0.14 mm in favour of the sub-group of symptomatic cases. In the evaluated group, the need for revision was determined in 4 implants. In 1case for aseptic loosening of the cup and three times for dislocation. After 36 months, 47 of 48 implants were in situ, the overall three-year survival was achieved in 97.9%. The most frequent postoperative complication was the occurrence of De Quervain s tenosynovitis (10%). DISCUSSION Currently, most of the newer types of modular uncemented hydroxyapatite-coated total \"ball and socket\" joint replacements present acceptable medium-term, and in some cases even long-term, results regarding the survival. The most pressing issue continues to be the survival of implants, particularly the failure of the trapezial component and the associated risk of revision surgery. Good postoperative results can be achieved by accurate indication, carefully applied cup implant and good postoperative cooperation of patients. The complementary study did not confirm that the lengthening of the thumb causes the postoperative development of De Quervain s tenosynovitis. CONCLUSIONS The uncemented first carpometacarpal joint total replacement using the Ivory ® prosthesis brings about very good shortterm functional and radiological results, with no occurrence of early aseptic loosening of the implant.

Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) has been popular for improving functional outcomes. This study compares the results of HA and RSA in the treatment of comminuted proximal humeral fractures in the elderly. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients over 60 years of age with three- or four-part proximal humeral fractures were included in the study. Twenty-five patients were treated with HA and 33 patients with RSA. The patients were evaluated with/using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and Constant scores, active and passive ranges of motions of the shoulders and muscle strength measurements of HA and RSA patients were compared. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 66 (60-85) years in the HA group and 73 (60-83) years in the RSA group. The mean ASES and Constant scores were 44.6 and 70 (p=0.06), 24 and 49 (p=0.022), respectively. The mean active abduction was measured as 50° and 90° (p=0.001), flexions as 70° and 120° (p=0.02), and external rotation as 30° and 50° (p=0.210), respectively. CONCLUSIONS In the treatment of three- or four-part proximal humeral fractures of the elderly, RSA gives significantly better functional results compared to HA.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYTo present the authors' own experience with Scarf osteotomy in a group of patients treated by this technique in their institution since 2004, together with emphasis on the aspects leading to successful outcome as well as to potential complications. MATERIALBetween May 2004 and January 2008, 70 operations were performed in 60 patients, 50 women and 10 men, with an average age of 56 years.The use of an appropriate surgical technique was decided on the basis of the IMA angle, as seen on an anteroposterior load radiograph of the forefoot.Scarf osteotomy was indicated when the angle was 12 to 20 degrees.There were 21 Scarf osteotomy procedures, 14 Scarf/Akin osteotomies and 35 operations combined with procedures on other rays. METHODSPre-operative evaluation included HVA and IMA angles and the AOFAS score.Tourniquet-induced ischaemia was used and surgery was completed with lateral release of the soft tissues of the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint.Osteotomy was always carried out extra-articularly, carefully avoiding damage to the vascular supply of the metatarsal head.It was fixed with original Barouk screws.At regular follow-ups, the radiographic findings, AOFAS score and patient's satisfaction with surgical outcome were assessed. RESULTSThe average follow-up was 26 months.The pre-operative values decreased from 37 to 15 degrees for the average HVA and from 18 to 8 degrees for the average IMA at 2 years after surgery.The average pre-operative AOFAS score of 48 increased to 91 points at 2 years post-operatively.At 6 months after surgery, the outcome was subjectively evaluated as excellent or good by 66 patients (94 %).One rapid progression of first MTP arthritis and one second metatarsal stress fracture were recorded.Two operative wounds showed prolonged healing.A first metatarsal stress fracture in the proximal part of osteotomy occurred in two cases, one of which required further surgery. DISCUSSIONOur results are in full agreement with the published data, including the frequency and types of complications.These are, as indicated by both literature reports and our experience, most often due to an incorrect operative technique.This is true, in the first place, for fractures at the site of osteotomy as a result of an insufficiently tilted or a too short longitudinal cut of osteotomy, or wrongly applied fixation. CONCLUSIONSScarf osteotomy is a reliable and effective method for hallux valgus treatment.It provides excellent primary stability and permits good IMA correction up to 20 degrees.However, perfect management of the operative technique is a prerequisite for minimising the risk of serious post-operative complications.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence of osteopenia and osteoporosis in the patients elected to cementless total hip replacement.The group evaluated comprised 100 patients with primary or secondary forms of coxarthrosis who underwent cementless total hip arthroplasty (THA). The results of densitometric examination of the lumbar spine and proximal femur were analysed. Based on the lowest T-score value, the patients were divided into three groups, i.e., fist, normal bone density; second, osteopenia; third, osteoporosis. Clinical examination included patient medical history, Harris hip scores and visual analogue scale assessment for pain intensity; the Kellgren-Lawrence classification was used to measure the grade of hip osteoarthritis; blood tests were made to assess the levels of total calcium, ionised calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D and the markers of bone resorption and formation.Osteoporosis was found in 32 and osteopenia in 21 patients; 47 patients had normal bone density. Osteoporosis was detected in the lumbar spine of 21 patients, in the proximal femur of nine patients and at both sites in two patients. In 13 patients this diagnosis was made for the fist time. The patients with osteoporosis had a significantly lower body mass index. There were no differences in the other characteristics, i.e., age, functional, radiological and laboratory findings, among the groups; all three showed the mean vitamin D concentration below the lowest level of its physiological range. Insufficient vitamin D levels were found in 54 women and 18 men. Of all patients, only 13 women and four men took vitamin D supplements. DISCUSSION Osteoarthritis and osteoporosis are the most frequent complex musculoskeletal diseases. Several studies have suggested that these disorders are mutually exclusive. This assumption has been based on the absence of radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis seen in many elderly patients with femoral neck fractures. Our relatively frequent findings of osteopenia and osteoporosis in this study show that patients with osteoarthritis may not be protected from the development of generalised osteoporosis. Our results are compared with the relevant literature data and potential effects of osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency on total hip arthroplasty are discussed.Hip osteoarthritis does not reduce the risk of generalised osteoporosis. We found a relative high incidence of osteopenia and osteoporosis as well as vitamin D deficiency in patient with advanced form of hip osteoarthritis.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDyFractures of the thoracic spine involve injury at the levels of Th2 to Th10.Because of pedicle morphology, pedicle screw fixation is a demanding procedure.However, evidence on the reliability and efficiency of this technique has recently been provided by several studies.The aim of this study was to analyse a group of patients with thoracic spine fractures treated by pedicle screw fixation and to evaluate treatment outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODSA total number of 33 patients treated by pedicle screw fixation for thoracic spine fractures between January 2007 and December 2011 were enrolled in this retrospective study.The mean age was 39.7±16.7 years.The evaluation included demographic data, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, neurological status, fracture type (AO classification), levels of the fractured vertebrae, injury-surgery interval, type and duration of surgery, type and length of pedicle screw fixation and complications.The position of pedicular screws in relation to the pedicle walls and correction of kyphotic deformity were assessed on post-operative CT scans. RESULTOf the 33 patients, 24 had associated injuries (72.7%), 22 had thorax injury (66.7%) and 17 had neurological deficit (51.5%).The most frequent spinal fracture type was type B2, 15 (45.5%); followed by type C, nine (33.3%); and type B1, five (15.1%).The mean injury-to-surgery interval was 5.2±4.3days.The mean operative time was 210±56 min.The most frequently used configuration of pedicle screw fixation involving two segments above and two below the fracture level was used in 20 cases (58.8%).The position of 149 out of 282 pedicle screws (52.8%) was evaluated on post-operative CT scans as follows: 98 % of the pedicle screws were placed in acceptable positions, 76% were placed completely within pedicle borders.The mean pre-operative Cobb angle was 18.7°±8.2°,the mean post-operative Cobb angle was 9.3±3.4°.Six intraoperative and three post-operative complications occurred.During follow-up no instrumentation failure or apparent loss of correction was recorded. DISCUSSIONEarly stabilisation of thoracic spine fractures reduces the risk of complications, shortens the hospital stay and allows for faster recovery of patients.Early thoracic spine stabilisation is most beneficial in patients with a high ISS (Injury Severity Score).In the case of small-sized pedicles there is the possibility of pedicle screw insertion via an extrapedicular or parapedicular trajectory.Recommended pedicle screw fixation is two levels above and two levels below the fracture level. CONCLUSIONSPedicle screw fixation of thoracic spine fractures is a safe therapeutic method with a low risk of complications.It facilitates effective reduction and stable fixation with a low risk of secondary displacement and implant failure.",

    "abstract": "Arthrodesis of the trapeziometacarpal joint is the method of choice in the treatment of degenerative arthritis of this joint. This procedure was indicated most frequently in middle-age patients doing hard manual labor. Methods for achieving a solid fusion of the trapeziometacarpal joint are known and often reported in the literature. Frequently, they are associated with some failure rate, particularly as concerns bone union. Our study presents a simple and effective method verified in cadaver specimens and then currently used at our department.The procedure for arthrodesis of the trapeziometacarpal joint was verified fist in fixed wrist and hand specimens at the Institute of Anatomy, 1 st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague. If the original shape of the basal thumb joint between the trapezium and the metacarpal is maintained, it allows for correct reduction and subsequent arthrodesis in a required position. In patients, surgical treatment included the use of implants, two DePuy shape-memory staples, which facilitate sufficient fragment compression and provide stable fixation. The staples were inserted in pre-drilled and gauged tunnels in the body of the trapezium and in the proximal metaphysis of the fist metacarpal.Between 2011 and 2014, the procedure was used in 14 patients diagnosed with primary arthritis of the trapeziometacarpal joint. The group comprised nine women and five men, the average age was 52 years and the range was 44 to 69 years. Surgery was most frequently carried out on the dominant upper extremity (85%); there was no bilateral surgery. The average follow-up was 18.3 months (range, 5 to 39 months). Solid fusion was recorded at 7 weeks after surgery in all patients except for the one still treated at the time of this paper submission. All patients were free of pain, ten reported satisfaction with grip strength and hand function, the rest would have preferred improvement in fine motor skills of the thumb. All of them found the cosmetic appearance of the hand satisfactory..The methods generally used for trapeziometacarpal joint arthrodesis are reported to carry some risk of pseudarthrosis development. A lot of modifications have been described, from conventional procedures using AO lag screws or Kirschner wires to up-to-date plate systems involving angle-stable fixation. Total fusion of the trapeziometacarpal joint is disputable in patients with rheumatoid arthritis from the technical point of view as well as the relevance of indication criteria. Some authors consider this procedure a contraindication for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The use of joint replacement in treating trapeziometacarpal joint arthritis is another complex issue.An arthrodesis of the trapeziometacarpal joint based on careful assessment of indication criteria proved to be a simple, effective and low-cost method of stable osteosynthesis that provided good conditions for solid fusion of the trapezium with the base of the fist metacarpal. It allowed for sufficient abduction and opposition of the thumb, thus permitting satisfactory hand grip strength and full involvement in everyday life activities and occupations. It provided stability of the thumb, its painless movement and good cosmetic looks.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe aim was to determine indication criteria for use of arthroscopy in the treatment of post-traumatic changes in the elbow joint, to present the surgical technique and to evaluate the results of a prospective study involving early follow-up of functional and radiographic outcomes of this treatment. MATERIAL AnD METHODSBetween February 2010 and February 2013, arthroscopic surgery was carried out on 14 elbows in 14 patients at the Clinic of traumatology of Masaryk hospital in Ústí nad Labem.The group comprised seven men and seven women, with an average age of 40 years (range, 20 to 67 years).The indications for elbow arthroscopy included conditions after intraarticular fractures in five, elbow dislocation in one, severe elbow contusion in four and complex injury to the elbow joint in four patients.Arthroscopic surgery was performed at an average of 11 months after the primary injury.The prospective follow-up lasted for an average of 12 months (range, 6 to 25).The outcomes of surgery were evaluated on the basis of radiograms and multiplanar reconstructions of CT images, elbow function was assessed using two rating systems, i.e., the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) and Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score. RESULTSThe average active range of motion (ROM) at the elbow joint was 118°/33° (145°-90°/60°-5°) before surgery and improved to 131°/5° (150°-90°/15°-0°), i.e., by 13°/28° (150°-90°/60°-0°) intra-operatively.The average final value of elbow ROM after functional stabilization was 126°/16° (145°-90°/70°-0°), which means improvement by 8°/17° (45°-0°/50°-0°) or a total of 25°.On post-operative radiograms, the findings were stable in 11 (79%) patients; elbows in three patients (21%) showed progression of degenerative changes (osteophyte formation and periarticular ossification).The final functional scores, as assessed using the MEPS and HSS score systems, were 88.93 (55-100) and 88.29 (50-100) points (average/ range), respectively. DISCUSSIOnThe study showed, in agreement with other authors' reports, that the degree of improvement in active range of motion and functional performance of the elbow is directly related to the severity of post-traumatic conditions.A certain residual ROM restriction usually remains.The outcome was poorer in patients with complex injuries of the elbow or in those with displaced intra-articular fractures of the joint and was also related to the severity of joint injury.Patients who were treated after a longer injury-to-surgery period and who suffered a more serious joint injury had more advanced arthritis, higher degree of joint contracture, worse pre-operative functional scores and less improvement in post-operative ROM of the elbow joint. COnCLUSIOnSFrom the results of early functional assessments and radiographic findings it can be concluded that the elbow joint arthroscopy is a safe and reliable technique to treat post-traumatic conditions caused by intrinsic factors in mild and moderate elbow stiffness.However, this method cannot be recommended in severe stiffness of the elbow or in stiffness due to extrinsic causes.Although the improvement in ROM achieved during the surgical procedure cannot be maintained in its full extent, this technique relieves persisting pain and significantly improves ROM of the elbow joint.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYWe present the results of a prospective study of patients with symptomatic partial ACL tears comparing the pre-operative findings with the clinical results at two years after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) augmentation. MATERIAL AND METHODSA total of 29 patients (7 women, 22 men; average age, 27.8 years) who were diagnosed with an isolated tear of the posterolateral (PL) bundle (18 patients) or the anteromedial (AM) bundle (11 patients) at 9 to 24 weeks after injury, and underwent ACL augmentation by isolated PL or AM bundle replacement, were evaluated.The characteristics assessed before surgery and at two years after it included the Lysholm and subjective IKDC scores and knee laxity measurement with a GNRB arthrometer (at 134 N and 250 N) and its assessment by the Lachman, anterior drawer and pivot shift tests.In addition, the presence of cyclop syndrome, graft failure and post-operative complications were evaluated. RESULTSThe patients with isolated reconstruction of the PL bundle showed post-operatively statistically significant improvement in the degree of rotational knee laxity (p < 0.05) and the ventral knee laxity assessed by the Lachman test (p < 0.05).Postoperative improvement in the anterior drawer test results was not statistically significant (p = 0.07).The median value of side-to-side difference in knee laxity measured with the GNRB arthrometer decreased at 134 N from 1.7 mm pre-operatively to 0.8 mm at two years post-operatively (p < 0.05) and, at 250 N, from 2.8 mm to 1.5 mm (p < 0.05).The median Lysholm score increased from 74 to 91 points at two post-operative years and the median IKDC score improved from 76 to 92 points (p < 0.05).Graft failure was reported in one patient (5.6%) and 14 subjects (77.8%) reported return to pre-injury sports activities.The patients undergoing isolated reconstruction of the AM bundle achieved, at two years after surgery, a statistically significant decrease in positivity of the Lachman and anterior drawer tests (p < 0.05), while the results of the pivot shift test did not improve significantly (p = 0.09).The decrease in median values of side-to-side difference in knee laxity measured with the GNRB arthrometer was from pre-operative 3.1 mm to 1.2 mm at 134 N (p < 0.05) and from 6.2 mm to 1.9 mm at 250N (p < 0.05).The median Lysholm and IKDC scores increased from 68 to 92 points and from 70 to 94 points, respectively (p < 0.05).Nine patients (81.9%) reported return to pre-injury participation in sports.Apart from early wound bleeding in one patient, no complications were recorded. DISCUSSIONBy permitting maintenance of a healthy bundle and replacement of only a torn one, ACL augmentation provides several benefits.It allows for accelerated revascularization and re-innervation of the graft through mechanoreceptors of the healthy portion; it enables the surgeon to get a good anatomical orientation and achieve precise tunnel reaming; in addition the healthy bundle provides protection for the graft in the early post-operative period.Thus rehabilitation can be faster and also return to sports activities. CONCLUSIONSOur results show that ACL augmentation using isolated replacement of either the AM or the PL bundle brings about statistically significant improvement of all subjective and most of the objective criteria by two years after surgery.",

    "abstract": "Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent which blocks plasmin-mediated fibrin degradation. It is used in surgery to reduce intra-operative and post-operative blood loss. The aim of our study was to assess the effect of tranexamic acid administration on blood loss after elective primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty.A total of 119 patients (50 men, 69 women) with an average age of 69.2 years were included. The patients were randomised into two groups: Group A received a single dose of tranexamic acid (Exacyl, 1.5 g i.v.) before the operation; Group B (control) did not receive any antifibrinolytic agent. All patients underwent surgery under spinal anaesthesia with a tourniquet applied to the operated leg. The intra-operative blood loss, post-operative blood loss based on drainage, pre- and post-operative levels of haemoglobin and haematocrit, and the number of administered blood transfusions were analysed.The administration of tranexamic acid led to a reduction in post-operative blood loss at all intervals tested, including the total blood loss (504 ± 214 vs 815 ± 231 ml; p < 0.001), and to reduced requirements for blood transfusion (1.18 ± 0.51 vs 1.54 ± 0.84 transfusion units; p < 0.05). A similar effect was observed in the subgroups of men and women; the total blood loss was higher in men than in women in both group B (non-significant) and group A (p < 0.05) patients. There was a gradual decline in haemoglobin and haematocrit levels during the post-operative period, with no significant differences between the two groups. Nor were there any differences in intra-operative blood losses either. No severe complications such as stroke, acute myocardial infarction or thromboembolic disease were recorded. DISCUSSION The administration of tranexamic acid before the application of a tourniquet resulted in reducing post-operative, but not intra-operative, blood losses in patients undergoing elective total knee arthroplasty. Transfusion requirements were reduced as well.Our study confirmed the efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid administration in relation to blood loss after total knee arthroplasty. In this indication, the administration is in accordance with the literature data.",

    "abstract": "Purulent inflammation of the pubic symphysis is a rare condition involving the symphysis and parasymphyseal parts of the pubic bones. It is usually found in immuno-compromised patients and its most frequent cause is Staphylococcus aureus. Conservative treatment is based on long-term administration of antibiotics and has been efficient, as reported, in about 50% of the patients. The authors treated five patients with a late diagnosis of purulent infection of the pubic symphysis in whom the antibiotic therapy had to be completed by surgical intervention. Three patients undergoing surgery with removal of the infected necrotic tissue healed fast and well. One patient required repeated surgery because of recurrent purulency; eventually, the infection cleared up. One patient was treated only conservatively because she refused surgical treatment. Consequently, pubic diastasis developed and she suffered from persistent pelvic pain. One year after treatment her condition became complicated by pelvic fracture following a fall. The patient refused surgery again. However, the development of non-union and progression of complaints made her agree to a surgical treatment; fixation of the non-union had a satisfactory outcome. In the literature, infection in the symphysis region is referred to by several different names. One - in the authors' opinion incorrect use - is \"arthritis\" (septic arthritis of the pubic symphysis; pubic symphysis septic arthritis; infectious osteoarthritis of the pubis). Another term is \"osteomyelitis\" (acute pubic osteomyelitis; pubic osteomyelitis; osteomyelitis of the pubis; osteomyelitis pubis; osteomyelitis of the pubic symphysis; osteomyelitis of the symphysis pubis). None of the names shows clearly whether it is primary an infection of the symphysis or of the parasymphyseal bone. A combination of the term \"osteitis\" with \"infectious\" (infectious osteitis pubis) is an attempt to distinguish purulent symphysitis pubis from osteitis pubis. The authors completed both the Czech and English title of this paper with the Latin designation symphysis pubis purulenta. A possibility of using a new name, such as \"pubosymphysitis\", in analogy to \"spondylodiscitis\" can also be discussed. However, the use of simple terms \"infection of symphysis\" or \"infection of pubic symphysis\" seems to be most practicable. Based on the experience with the treatment of five patients with infection of the pubic symphysis, the authors suggest that the late phase with abscess formation or purulent discharge should be managed by surgery. This treatment has good clinical outcomes although it may be complicated by slow healing of soft tissues around the symphysis and instability of the anterior pelvic segment with its sequelae. Key words: infection of the symphysis, infection of the pubic symphysis, septic arthritis of the pubic symphysis, pubic osteomyelitis.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of angle-stable implant systems in surgical treatment of proximal humeral fractures, the number of indications to shoulder hemiarthroplasty decreased dramatically, because these modern implants provide certain fixation of osteoporotic bone fragments in elderly patients.The authors report on their experience with shoulder replacement surgery in 29 patients, of which 26 underwent urgent surgery. The indications for acute hemiarthroplasty included humeral head fractures in which destruction of the articular surface exceeded 40 %, and fractures with evident or suspected insufficient vitality of the humeral head in elderly patients. Other indications included intra-operative osteosynthesis with the necessity of subsequent intra-operative conversion. Two patients with late implant failure and one with bone malunion, after conservative treatment of a fracture, were indicated for second stage hemiarthroplasty. The authors draw attention to the most frequent errors associated with this surgery and describe guidelines used in post-operative care. A total of 20 patients were evaluated by the Constant Score at an average follow-up of 12.5 months (range, 6-39 months).Shortly after the operation, loosening of parts of the modular prosthetic system occurred in two patients. Aseptic loosening of the stem was observed in two patients, and early deep wound infection was found in two patients. The implant was removed in two cases, once for its loosening, and once for persisting infection. None of the patients died due to causes related to shoulder hemiarthroplasty. The functional outcomes corresponded to the choice of patients, because the indications for hemiarthroplasty involved the most serious fractures in elderly patients. Post-operative subjective evaluation usually showed only intermittent and mild pain; only four patients complained of severe pain. Arm elevation in the youngest age group, i.e., up to 59 years, was 100 degrees on the average, with a range of 70 to 140 degrees. In the patients 60 to 69 years old, the average elevation was 95 degrees, with a range of 90 to 110 degrees; in the oldest group, i.e., 70 years and older, the average elevation was 75 degrees and the range was 30 to 130 degrees. Excellent outcomes with elevation over 120 degrees were achieved in four patients only. The average Constant Scores in the three age groups were 68, 54 and 42 points, respectively.When deciding the indications for hemiarthroplasty, many factors must be considered. Beside the type of fracture and patient's age, a possible impairment of blood supply, which is associated with avascular bone necrosis, must also be taken into account. Criteria for correlation between vascularisation impairment and X-ray findings, with the analysis of advantages and disadvantages of hemiarthroplasty, are described in this article. In the end, an indication scheme for the treatment of proximal humeral fractures is suggested.Good results achieved in shoulder hemiarthroplasty are related to both the development of modular prosthetic systems for shoulder replacement and a faultless surgery procedure itself. Careful and long-term post-operative care also plays an important role. Functional outcomes after acute hemiarthroplasty are clearly better than those after a second-stage operation performed when conservative treatment or previous osteosynthesis have failed.",

Thirteen patients died or dropped out of the study during follow-up.The patients were followed up at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery and then, according to their conditions, every one or two years. In each patient, the following information was recorded: age at the time of implantation, gender, pre-operative diagnosis, physical activity, body mass index, Harris hip score, acetabular cup size, stem type, cup and stem alignment immediately after arthroplasty, intra-operative complications, early complications during hospital stay, and late complications. Attention was paid to infection, aseptic loosening and polyethylene wear. Loosening of both the cup and the stem was evaluated in each zone, using the criteria of Krbec and Cech. Malalignment of the stem and cup as well as thinning of the acetabular wall, as signs of loosening, were also recorded.Of the 133 patients treated, 35 had poor results (24.5 %) and 17 of them underwent revision surgery. Deep wound infection was recorded in seven hips, the prosthesis was removed from six, and subsequently three of them had reimplantation. Loosening of the stem occurred in nine patients and two were revised. In three patients with a thin acetabular wall, indication for surgery was not correct; in another patient an operative fault occurred. All of them underwent revision arthroplasty. One hip showed asymmetric wear of the polyethylene liner without sings of acetabular cup loosening. Aseptic loosening was found in 15 patients (10.5 %), eight were revised. In the group of patients who had surgery 5 and more years before, 13 cups out of 81 implanted ones were loosened (16 %). In the group operated on at 8 and more years earlier, aseptic loosening was found in nine hips out of 49 (18.4 %). DISCUSSION The mid-term results of the use of uncemented Beznoska acetabular cups are fully comparable with those of cemented Beznoska acetabular cups. However, the outcomes initially hoped for in relation to this component have not been achieved.The uncemented BMT acetabular cup cannot be recommended for the same indications as are those for which other uncemented components are used. It is not suitable for young and active patients under 70 years of age and for patients who have a thin wall of the acetabulum. Also, it is not recommended to combine this component with an uncemented femoral component. In our opinion, it is not suitable for revision hip arthroplasty, either.",

MATERIALOne group comprised 111 patients with 133 sides who underwent acetabular revision for aseptic loosening or extraction of an infected acetabular component with subsequent implantation of an oblong cup (Langs-Ovale Revisionspfanne [L.O.R.], Allopro, Switzerland).The average age of this group at the time of surgery was 62.2 (range, 31-83) years, and average follow-up was 9.7 (range, 0.6-13.9)years.The other group consisted of 134 patients with 152 sides who for the same indications as the L.O.R. group received a Walter Oval cup (Medin Orthopaedics, Czech Republic).The average age at the time of surgery was 64.6 (22-86) years, and average follow-up was 7.3 (range, 1.1-9.8)years.The proportion and nature of defects and underlying clinical diagnoses in the two groups were statistically comparable The patients requiring replacement or removal of the acetabular component were not included in clinical evaluation, but their data were used for survival analysis.The clinical evaluation included: in the L.O.R. group, 115 hip joints at an average follow-up of 10.8 (range, 4.5-13.9)years and, in the Walter Oval group, 144 hip joints at an average follow-up of 7.5 (range, 2.3-9.8)years.The data of patients who died during ;the study (L.O.R., 7 Walter Oval, 11) were included in the clinical evaluation as of the date of the final follow-up. CONCLUSIONSAcetabular defects in the range of Paprosky types IIB to IIIA are indicated for the use of oblong implants in a basic position.The Arbond hydroxyapatite coating providing an osteoactive surface for the oblong cup described significantly improves the survival of this implant in comparison with the original model.",

    "abstract": "To present a new type of percutaneous compression plate (PCP) for a minimally invasive method of treating trochanteric hip fractures.Between September 2004 and December 2006, a total of 66 patients with hip fractures were treated by minimally invasive percutaneous osteosynthesis involving a PCP. The average age of the patients was 74.5 years (range, 27-95 years). The fractures were classified as pertrochanteric (AO31, A1.1-A2.3) in 73%, femoral neck fracture (AO31, B2) in 20%, and intertrochanteric fracture (AO31, A3.1) in 7% of the patients.Reduction was performed under conduction or general anaesthesia on a traction table, using an X-ray image intensifier system. Reduction and intra-operative temporary stabilisation of the fracture was facilitated by a posterior reduction device. Access was gained and a PCP was inserted through two incisions at the lateral side of the proximal femur.The patients were followed up for at least 6 months. Radiographic union was found on average at 3 months post-operatively. No pseudoarthrosis or implant failure was recorded. At 6-month follow-up, 81% of the patients were able to walk without walking aid or with one walking cane only. Two crutches were used by 8% of the patients.To walk without help was impossible for 11% of the patients whose mobility had already been limited before the injury.PCP osteosynthesis for trochanteric fractures is a novel minimally invasive approach providing a better treatment of the fracture. Compared to dynamic hip screw osteosynthesis used before, PCP allows for earlier weight bearing and noticeably reduces blood loss. Implant construction as well as post-operative controlled impaction of the fracture minimize the risk of osteosynthesis failure. The simple instrumentation construction enables us to reduce operative time.The percutaneous compression plate is a contribution to minimally invasive osteosynthesis of trochanteric fractures. An increase in rotational stability of the implant due to its biaxial telescopic construction allows for earlier weight-bearing of the extremity, thus facilitating the patient's earlier return to everyday life activities. It also reduces operative trauma, blood loss and post-operative complications.",

    "abstract": "Previous surface EMG studies have shown that chronic rotator cuff tears (RCT) may be associated with a altered activation of adjacent shoulder muscles. The effect of RCT on central neuromuscular control mechanisms of the shoulder girdle muscles such as the deltoideus muscle (MD), a key muscle of shoulder function, has as yet not been studied in detail. This study investigated the cortico-spinal excitability of the MD to assess the effects of RCT on the central neuromuscular function of upper limb muscles.The motor evoked potentials (MEP) in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation of MD and first dorsal interosseus muscle (FDI) on both sides were obtained of six right-handed men with chronic, symptomatic, full-thickness RCT on the dominant sides. Stimulus response curves at four different levels were measured at two tasks (MD at rest and during activity).Different interactions were found between stimulus intensity, task and side for MEP of the MD (F = 3.9, P = 0.03), indicating that MD excitability on the affected side were lower when compared with the non-affected side. No correlation was found between the correspondent MEP amplitudes of MD and FDI at rest (r = 0.1, P = 0.44) and MD activation (r = 0.3, P = 0.05) on the affected side whereas a correlation existed on the non-affected side at rest (r = 0.5, P = 0.007) and during activation (r = 0.8, P < 0.001).These decreased cortico-motoneuronal excitability of the MD on the affected side seems to related to adaptive chan- ges in motor cortex as a consequence of chronic RCT. The data suggest an involvement of central mechanisms and seem to precede severe changes of osteoarthritis of the shoulder.",

    "abstract": "Intra-articular fractures of the distal radius are treated predominantly by open reduction and internal fixation with various types of angle-stable plates. In this study we compare functional and radiographic outcomes in patients with intra-articular distal radius fractures treated with either angle-stable plates with rigid-direction screw insertion or multidirectional angle-stable plates.The LCP group included 37 patients with an average age of 50 years (range 20-81 years) who were treated using angle-stable plates with rigid-direction screw insertion (LCP, Synthes). The APTUS group comprising 41 patients with an average age of 48.9 years (range 22-77 years) was treated by angle-stable implants in which screws can pivot freely in all directions (Aptus, Medartis). There was no significant difference between the groups in relation to fracture severity, age or other relevant characteristics. In all cases we used the volar approach. The final evaluation of treatment outcome was made at 12 months after surgery. We measured the range of wrist motion and hand grip strength, and compared the values with those obtained in the contralateral wrist. The results evaluated on the scoring systems of Gartland and Werley and of Castaing, and the DASH score were compared between the groups. The findings on radiographs were compared with the anatomical standard in the distal radius region. RESULTS In the LCP group, the average values, as compared with the contralateral side, were as follows: volar flexion, 84.2 %; dorsal flexion, 82.4 %; radial deviation, 83.2 %; ulnar deviation, 89.1 %; pronation, 98.6 %; supination, 97.4 %. In the APTUS group, the values in comparison with the other wrist were: volar flexion, 84.1 %; dorsal flexion, 91.8 %; radial deviation, 95.1 %; ulnar deviation, 92.8 %; pronation, 99.0 %; supination, 98.1 %. The values statistically comparable with the contralateral side were those in pronation, supination and hand grip strength in both groups. In addition, in the APTUS group, the values corresponding to the healthy wrist function were achieved in both radial and ulnar deviation. There were no differences in the values based on the scoring systems between the LCP and APTUS groups. As for the radiographic parameters, only the reconstruction of radial length was optimal. The other parameters differed from the anatomical standard. However, all patients met the criteria of successful healing of a distal radius fracture. Secondary fragment displacement during healing was recorded in two patients of the LCP group and in one of the APTUS group. Transient irritation of the median nerve was observed in five LCP group patients and in only one APTUS group patient. One patient in each group had an extensor tendon rupture. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome was diagnosed in two LCP group patients and in three APTUS group patients. DISCUSSION The surgical treatment of complex fractures of the distal radius using the angle-stable implants has generally achieved very good functional and radiographic outcomes with a low rate of complications. In the APTUS group, in contrast to the LCP group, the extent of radial and ulnar deviation corresponded to that found in the healthy wrist. The reason was a low-profile design of the plate and the screws, and the system with multidirectional angle-stable screws. The fewer cases of median nerve irritation in the APTUS group can be explained by the use of a different operative approach reducing the risk of direct mechanical nerve injury. In contrast to other authors, flexor tendon ruptures were not recorded in our groups. CONCLUSIONS The treatment of distal radius fractures by the angle-stable locking plate system from the volar approach achieved comparable functional and radiographic outcomes with both rigid-direction screw insertion and multidirectional screw insertion.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSDuring a 20-month period, ten patients aged between 25 and 70 years (average age, 53.2 years) were indicated for surgical treatment of a juxtafacet cyst by percutaneous insertion of an In-Space interspinous spacer without surgical exploration of the spinal canal.The group comprised six men and four women.At a follow-up of 6 weeks to 18 months, each patient underwent MRI examination of the LS spine and the degree of cyst resorption was assessed.The visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and range of motion (ROM) values, and a sagittal angle (SA) of the segment treated obtained for the whole group at 3 to 18 months after surgery were compared with the pre-operative values.The surgeon evaluated the effect of surgery on radicular and axial pain. RESULTSComplete resorption of the cyst was found in seven patients (70%) and three (30%) showed partial resorption.Complete resolution of radicular symptoms was reported by five patients (50%); five experienced partial relief (50%).Lumbago was relieved completely in three (30%) and partially in seven (70%) patients.The average VAS score was 6.7 points (range, 4-10) pre-operatively and 3.5 (0-8) post-operatively, i.e. it decreased by 3.2 points, which meant an improvement by 48%.The average ODI value was 58.4% (range, 32-80) pre-operatively and 23.9% (0-70) post-operatively, i.e., it decreased by 34.5 percentage points and was an improvement by 59%.The average ROM measures were 5.65 degrees (range, 2°-10°) pre-operatively and 5.55 degrees (0°-19°) post-operatively.The average pre-and post-operative sagittal angles in normal lumbar lordosis were 7.1 degrees (1°-13°) and 6.2 degrees (1°-11°), respectively. DISCUSSIONThe conventional surgical procedure involves cyst extirpation.However, the procedure only relieves nerve root compression but does not remove the cause of juxtafacet cyst development, which is due to facet joint degeneration and instability.This may results in persistent or recurrent clinical symptoms.On the other hand, a reduction of both mobility and loading of the intervertebral joints achieved by implantation of an interspinous spacer is the mechanism allowing for resorption of the cyst and resolution of symptoms.CONCLUSIONS 1.The original method of treating juxtafacet cysts of the LS spine by an In-Space interspinous spacer, as presented here, was efficient in all patients and resulted in complete, or at least partial, resorption of the cyst.2. Segmental mobility and spondyloarthritis are the major aetiological factors of juxtafacet cyst development.3. Dynamic interspinous stabilisation will reduce loading of the intervertebral joints and will thus allow for cyst resorption and clinical symptom resolution.4. Percutaneous implantation of an \"In-Space\" interspinous spacer is a minimally invasive method of dynamic stabilisation that means no restrictions in patients' activities and reduces the length of hospital stay.",

    "abstract": "Calcaneal fractures are frequent injuries which may interfere with the patient's daily activities for a long time. They usually occur as the result of an axial load causing impaction of the talus into the calcaneus. They can also be bilateral. Falls and jumps from height are the most frequent causes.Between August 2005 and December 2011, the method of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with a calcaneal locking compression plate (LCP) was used to treat 98 patients with 114 calcaneal fractures. Of these, 16 were bilateral fractures found in two women and 14 men. In each patient, plain lateral and axial X-ray films of the calcaneus were taken on the day of injury. Computer tomography (CT) scans in the sagittal, transverse and coronary planes were obtained. Based on these, the fractures were classified as type I to type IV according to the Sanders system. The patients with type II and type III calcaneal fractures were indicated for ORIF treatment. The results were evaluated using the Rowe score.The most frequent cause of fracture was a fall or a jump from height, which was recorded in 81 patients. Bilateral fractures were found in 16 patients. Of the 98 patients, excellent results were in 31, good in 39, satisfactory in 20 and poor in eight patients, as assessed with the Rowe score. Unilateral fractures achieved excellent results in 28, good in 35, satisfactory in 15 and poor in four patients. The results in bilateral fractures were excellent in three, good in four, satisfactory in five and poor in four patients. Early post-operative complications were recorded in a total of 24 patients, of whom 13 had unilateral and 11 had bilateral fractures.The Sanders classification based on CT examination is used as an indication scheme in our department. Type II and type III fractures are indicated for ORIF treatment. A calcaneal LCP and an extended lateral approach are preferred. This allows for an almost perfect view of the fracture, an accurate reduction of the subtalar and calcaneocuboid joints and a stable internal fixation. In the patients with bilateral fractures, the occurrence of complications, multiple trauma and associated injuries was significantly higher. Also, they had less satisfactory results than the patients with unilateral fractures.The surgical treatment of intra-articular fractures using open reduction from the extended lateral approach and internal fixation with a calcaneal LCP has achieved good results. CT scans are necessary for the diagnosis, fracture classification and indication for a surgical procedure. The timing of surgery plays a decisive role. Open fractures and fractures associated with severe soft tissue injury are treated urgently, other fractures at an appropriate time. Our results showed a significantly higher rate of complications in the patients with bilateral calcaneal fractures, as compared with the patients with unilateral fractures, as well as less satisfactory outcomes. High-energy trauma resulting in bilateral fractures predisposes to comminuted fractures with dislocation, which leads to more serious damage to subtalar joint function.",

    "abstract": "Malleolar fractures rank among the most frequent skeletal injuries. The majority of orthopaedic and trauma surgeons incline to surgical therapy with anatomical reposition and retention going for absolute stability. Recommended surgical techniques with screws, plates or tension-band wiring usually presents no problems for surgeons. Unsatisfactory postoperative radiological results, however, are often tolerated because revision surgery may not always have expected results. Difficulties in decision-making for right treatment are (a) the classification and right interpretation of the fracture type, (b) the question of stability and right treatment of syndesmotic injury, (c) the reconstruction of the distal fibula in length and without malrotation, (d) the question of surgical stabilization of the posterior tibial edge, and (e) the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the medial osteoligamenteous complex. It is necessary to realise that, whatever classification has been used, injury proceeds in connected stages and can stop in each stage (Lauge-Hansen). Both supination and pronation osteoligamenteous injuries have specific patterns. It is important to analyse these patterns and put right therapeutic consequences. Included in this analysis must be the question of the right management of syndesmotic injury. It needs attention for exact reposition and retention of the distal fibula. Also, a fracture analysis of the medial complex is very important for right osteosynthesis following the principles in fracture treatment. In fractures of the anterior colliculus of the medial malleolus, the deep part of deltoid ligament can also be injured. The listed problems with their critical analyses and interpretations show that injuries of the ankle joint can be difficult to diagnose and treat. In conclusion references to these problems are critically interpreted.",

MATERIAL AnD METHODSIn 713 patients treated by arthroscopy for knee joint injuries at our department between 2000 and 2010, ACL injury ranked fifth among knee injuries and was found in 85 patients (12%).All patients in this group were under 19 years of age.The average age at the time of arthroscopic surgery was 15 years and 3 months.The patients were followed up at regular intervals for the symptoms and signs of anterior knee instability.Skeletal maturity achieved by the final follow-up (in 2010) was recorded in 69 (82%) of them. RESULTSOf the 85 patients with ACL injury, 50 subsequently underwent ACL reconstruction.This procedure was used only when they achieved skeletal maturity.Correlation between pre-operative clinical diagnosis and arthroscopic findings was found only in 52% of the patients. DISCUSSIOnThe problem of anterior knee instability in children and adolescents still remains unsolved.Although surgical procedures for ACL reconstruction in skeletally immature patients have been described, most of the authors support the option of ACL reconstruction at the age of skeletal maturity.This view is also maintained by our team.

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate in vivo and compare, in terms of the quality and number of ultra high-molecular polyethylene (UHMWPE) wear particles, total knee replacements of identical construction differing only in the material used for femoral component production, i.e., CoCrMo alloy or ZrO2 ceramics.Samples of peri-prosthetic granuloma tissue were collected in two patients with total knee replacement suffering from implant migration, who were matched in relevant characteristics. The primary knee replacement in Patient 1 with a CoCrMo femoral component was done 7.2 years and in Patient 2 with a ZrO2 implant 6.8 years before this assessment. The polyethylene wear-induced granuloma was analysed by the MORF method enabling us to assess the shape and size of wear debris and the IRc method for assessment of particle concentration.In the granuloma tissue samples of Patient 1, on the average, particles were 0.30 mm in size and their relative volume was 0.19. In the Patient 2 tissue samples, the average size of particles was 0.33 mm and their relative volume was 0.26. There was no significant difference in either particle morphology or their concentration in the granuloma tissue between the two patients.One of the options of how to reduce the production of polyethylene wear particles is to improve the tribological properties of contacting surfaces in total knee replacement by substituting a cobalt-chrome femoral component with a zirconia ceramic femoral component. The previous in vitro testing carried out with a mechanical simulator under conditions approaching real weight-bearing in the human body did show a nearly three-fold decrease in the number of UHMWPE wear particles in zirconia components. The evaluation of granuloma tissue induced by the activity of a real prosthetic joint for nearly seven years, however, did not reveal any great difference in either quality or quantity of polyethylene debris between the two replacements. The difference of surface roughness between CoCrMo (Ra = 0.05) and ZrO2 (Ra = 0.02) components did not play any role in in vivo conditions. CONCLUSIONS In accordance with a previous clinical study, this evaluation of the quality and quantity of UHMWPE wear particles produced by a ceramic femoral component in vivo failed to demonstrate any advantage of zirconia ceramic components over the cobalt-chrome femoral components so far used.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to compare the exactness of correction of proximal femoral deformities between the patients treated with AO angled blade plates and those managed by the cannulated paediatric osteotomy system (CAPOS).In the period from 1994 to 2003, corrective osteotomy of the proximal femur using the conventional AO angled blade plate (90°, 120°, 130°) was performed on 57 hips in 42 children. In the period 2004-2012, 68 hips in 59 children were treated by the CAPOS method. In each child, the pre- and post-operative X-ray views were compared and a real deviation from the pre-operative plan was determined. A deviation larger than 10° in the frontal plane was recorded as an error. Penetration of the blade into either the posterior or the anterior femoral neck cortex seen on axial views was regarded as an error as well.Corrective osteotomy with AO angled blade plates performed on 57 hips failed in 12 (21.1%) on anteroposterior views and six hips (10.5%) on axial views. Of 68 hips treated by the CAPOS, failure was recorded in four (5.9%) and one (1.5%) on anteroposterior and axial views, respectively. DISCUSSION No information on the CAPOS technique is available in either international or national literature, with the exception of our preliminary report. On the other hand, locking compression plates for paediatric hips, developed later, have been described in several publications. The authors appreciate a higher accuracy of bone correction and higher stability for the whole fixation, which results in earlier mobilisation of the treated extremity. These advantages are also true for CAPOS instrumentation.The CAPOS can be seen as an intermediate stage of development between conventional angled blade plates and locking compression plates for paediatric hips. However, it should be noted that surgery involving insertion of an angled blade plate takes less time than insertion of a locking compression plate. For this reason, in procedures combining femoral osteotomy with, for instance, triple pelvic osteotomy the use of CAPOS instrumentation is still preferred.",

The minimum follow-up was 18 months (41 to 18 months). Impressions on more than 30 % of the articular surface, or those whose critical size was larger than one-eighth of the humeral diameter (on CT scan) were taken as indications for surgery. Four patients had had previous surgery for anterior instability and three had a primary procedure. Four men underwent acute surgery and three had elective operations.Trans- humeral head plasty was used in five and massive osteochondral allograft in two patients.In the patients with large lesions in the anterior aspect of the shoulder joint, transhumeral head plasty involving repair of the ventral structures from the anterior approach was indicatedúúú in those with an isolated posterior bony defect, a massive osteochondral allograft was transplanted through the posterior approach. The Constant-Murley score was used to assess clinical status before (not in acute conditions) and after surgery.All patients reported improved clinical status. The average Constant-Murley score at final follow-up was 95.9 points (83-100 points). In the patients not having an acute procedure in whom pre-operative Constant-Murley scores were obtained, the average improvement was by 22.7 points (8 - 37 points). No general surgical complications were recorded. All patients reported subjective satisfaction and willingness to undergo surgery under the same conditions again.A Hill-Sachs lesion is a frequent injury to the humeral head resulting from anterior shoulder dislocation. To distinguish between major and minor defects in terms of clinical significance is essential for the choice of appropriate shoulder treatment. Up to now large lesions have mostly been managed by non-causal techniques affecting shoulder biomechanics. Transhumeral head plasty or transplantation of a massive osteochondral allograft, on the other hand, offers a causal treatment. However, these two methods have rarely been mentioned in the international literature, and usually only as case reports.Transhumeral head plasty and transplantation of a massive osteochondral allograft offer a causal therapy for the management of Hill-Sachs lesions that does not alter shoulder biomechanics. They are not associated with a higher percentage of post-operative complications. Neither technique is more demanding than non-causal procedures. Operations carried out as primary and not as \"salvage\" procedures restored the function of the shoulder joint to normal. After secondary surgery, occasional shoulder pain may persist as well as its restricted range of motion.",

    "abstract": "To test the hypothesis that the application of tricalcium phosphate (TCP) mixed with autologous bone marrow can achieve better and faster healing of benign bone lesions than the application of tricalcium phosphate granules alone.The prospective study included two groups, each consisting of 10 patients, treated for benign cystic bone lesions at the Department of Paediatric Surgery, Orthopaedics and Trauma Surgery from July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2010. The bone cysts involved non-ossifying fibroma, enchodroma, fibrous dysplasia, aneurysmal bone cyst and juvenile bone cyst. One group was treated using ChronOS(TM) Beta-Tricalcium Phosphate (Synthes GmbH, Switzerland) granules mixed with autologous bone marrow harvested during surgery (BM group). The other (CH group) received treatment with ChronOS granules alone. Relevant clinical data were obtained from all 20 patients treated for one of the bone cyst forms mentioned above. The patients were followed up till the end of 2010.TCP application was a one-step procedure in both groups. In the BM group, bone regeneration ad integrum (Neer 1) was achieved, with only an occasional very small residue of the cyst seen on radiographs (Neer 2). None of the patients reported any problems, not even at 6 months after surgery. In the CH group, two patients required further surgical treatment because of insufficient bone healing (Neer 3) and two other patients reported pain persisting at the site of the lesion at 6 months post-operatively. In these patients TCP was used to fill a defect after excochleation of an aneurysmal bone cyst or fibrous dysplasia. The rest of the patients showed satisfactory healing.The main objective of the use of synthetic biocompatible materials in surgical treatment of benign bone cysts requiring filling of the lesion is to reduce the post-operative stress of paediatric patients as much as possible. Although our first results were not statistically significant to give unambiguous support to our hypothesis that lesions would heal better with the use of synthetic tricalcium phosphate mixed with autologous bone marrow, there is plenty of evidence that further development of cell technologies will result in a more exact definition of bone substitute materials in both their components, i.e., well-defined cells and non-biological scaffolds close in structure to inorganic compounds of bone, i.e., biodegradable osteoinductive materials.The patients with benign bone lesions treated by TCP mixed with autologous bone marrow showed neither recurrent disease nor complications. The group treated with TCP alone had recurrent lesions in two and persisting pain also in two patients. Other complications were not recorded.",

    "abstract": "From an initial group of 206 hips in 190 patients we carried out a retrospective clinical and radiological control of 74 hips in 72 patients covering a period of 20 years.Indications in 74 operated hips evidenced 48x(64.9%) primary and 26x(35.1%) secondary coxarthrosis. The average age at the time of operation was 53 years (37 years-68 years). All 72 patients with 74 hips received cement-free self- cutting Alloclassic screw cups of pure Titanium together with a cement-free square Alloclassic stem consisting of Titan- Aluminium-Niob alloy according to Zweymüller. Regarding the technique of operation we used the approach after Watson-Jones in the supine position. As prophylaxis against thrombosis 40% of the patients received derivates of heparine and 60% had anticoagulant therapy with cumarine. Prophylaxis against heterotopic ossifications were not carried out at this juncture in our department.After an average post-operational examination lapse of 20 years we were able to examine 72 patients (37.9%) with 74 hips (35.9%) clinically and radiologically. Further classification of the 72 patients records 47 females and 25 males. The average age at the time of operation was 53 years and at the time of post-operational check-up to 74 years. For the clinical post-operational check-up (n=74) we used the Harris Hip Score. Further evaluation shows 12x(16.2%) excellent results, 26x(35.1%) good and 29x(39.2%) fair results. In 7 patients (9.5%) we had to observe poor results because of multimorbidity, although also in these cases stability of TEP had been achieved. The radiological post-operational check-up of the 74 stable hips (35.9%) shows an average excentric position of the head of 1.4 mm (0 mm up until 4 mm) compared with 1 mm after 10 years. Over an average of about 20 years we carried out an exchange of the inlay and the head because of excentric position of the head, which correlates to a rate of reoperation of 6.8%.In 2000 and 2001 we published our 10 year results with cement-free Alloclassic screw cup and cement-free stem in 133 hips in 123 patients and compared our findings with those of other authors. After 10 years we saw only 3 % complications with cups and an overall re-operation rate of 6.7%. The 20-year-results show in all cases stable components of both cups and stems. 5 patients (6.8%) had to undergo re-operation with an exchange of inlay and head, whereby the components of the prosthesis themselves turned out to be stable. An average polyethylene abrasion of 1 mm after 10 years compares with a value of abrasion of 1,4 mm after 20 years. The 6.8% rate of re-operation after 20 years indicates the excellent results of the use of cement-free Alloclassic total endoprosthesis system of the hip according to Zweymüller.The biocompatible qualities of modern prosthesis material lead to a quicker and optimal bony incorporation of the pros- thesis components. The excellent 20-year-results show a broad indicative spectrum, component stability of the prosthesis in all patients and therefore encourage the further use of cement-free hip implants in the future.",

    "abstract": "Intramedullary nailing is a minimally invasive technique that respects humeral head. However, limited surgical approach does not permit an anatomical reduction. The significance of the reduction on the functional outcome has not been sufficiently investigated. The aim of the study was to examine the functional and radiological postoperative outcome in patients with proximal humeral fractures treated with intramedullary nailing and the significance of reduction.The study population consisted of 43 patients with proximal humeral fractures that were treated with the Proximal Humerus Nail System (Targon, Aesculap). Mean follow-up period was 23.2 months (SD: 8.9). Shoulder function was assessed with the Constant-Murley Score. Reduction was examined radiographically anteroposterior and true lateral plane. Radiographs of 50 healthy shoulders served as controls. Malreduction was analyzed for 10°, 15° and 20° in both planes.The overall functional results were satisfying; mean CS of all patients at the last follow-up visit was 74.8 (SD: 19.3). Mean normalized CS for age and gender was 78.15 (SD 17.8). Fracture severity seemed to affect clinical outcome to a certain extent; 4-part fractures exhibited inferior results. Mean NSA was 126.5 (SD: 16.9) in anteroposterio and 137.4 (SD: 15.4) in true lateral view. The respective values in the control group were 134.1° (SD 7.1°) in anteroposterior and 133.7° (SD 12.8°) in true lateral view. A malreduction of >20° in the anteroposterior plane and >15° in both anteroposterior and true lateral planes resulted in significantly inferior clinical outcome. Thirteen complications were recorded, four of them being major. DISCUSSION The quality of reduction affected the postoperative outcome to a certain extent. Especially the anteroposterior reduction seemed to play a more important role in the postoperative function than reduction in the true lateral plane. However, this difference was statistically significant only after > 20° malreduction. The worst results in Constant Score were shown, as expected, in the group with malreduction in both planes; even a 15°malreduction resulted in statistically significant difference. The importance of anteroposterior reduction could be due to achievement of better ROM in the frontal plane, most probably because of better levers on the tuberosities. However an absolute anatomical reduction does not have to be achieved at all costs. The overall good results of the fractures in this study despite absence of anatomical reduction could partly result from the limited surgical approach.The majority of the patients treated with closed reduction and internal fixation with PHN show good postoperative functional results. However, fracture malreduction reduction cannot be always avoided with the use of PHN. Nevertheless, the evaluation of the Constant-Murley score shows an absolute anatomical reduction in not necessary for satisfying functional outcome. The reduction in anteroposterior plane seems to play a more important role in the postsurgical functional outcome. A malreduction that exceeds 15° in both planes or a malreduction of more than 20° in either plane should be avoided.",

    "abstract": "Post-traumatic ventral shoulder instability is a frequent disorder resulting from ventral and caudal dislocation of the humeral head. The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the long-term results of arthroscopy-assisted reinsertion of the ventral labrum using absorbable bioknotless suture anchors.A group of 129 patients with unidirectional ventral instability of the shoulder was evaluated for the results of treatment involving labrum reinsertion with use of absorbable bioknotless anchors. This arthroscopy-assisted method is performed from two minimal incisions, with the patient in a beach-chair position. The shoulder rating scale of Rowe and Zarins was used to compare the pre-operative status with the treatment outcomes during follow-up ranging from 12 months to 5 years.Return to the pre-injury level of activities was recorded in 93.8 % of the patients. The methods failed and dislocation recurred in 4.6 % of the patients. These underwent repeat surgery with the same technique and implants.Arthroscopy-assisted stabilisation of the shoulder is a minimally invasive technique allowing for anatomically exact and complete treatment of traumatic injury to the intra-articular structures. It results in faster convalescence and provides better results than open methods. It requires short hospital stay and is performed as one-day surgery in our department; consequently, the costs of care for one patient are reduced. The use of absorbable suture anchors permits reimplantation of other anchors, either when suture material at primary stabilisation fails or at a potential repeat operation. The cosmetic effect of only two minimal incisions also plays a role. CONCLUSIONS Arthroscopic labrum repair with absorbable knotless anchors is, after a perfect mastering of the surgical technique, an effective treatment and, based on the results achieved, also the method of choice used at our department for managing labral lesions caused by traumatic unidirectional instability of the glenohumeral joint.",

A Targon Ph nail was used in 32 and a Philos plate in 23 patients. These patients were compared with a group of nine patients, one man and eight women, treated by percutaneous K-wire fixation (K-wire group). At a follow-up of 12 months at least, final Constant (CS) and DASH scores were assessed. The CS was related to the values for the unaffected limb, and an individual relative CS was calculated and expressed in percent. The mean follow-up was 30 (range, 13-55) months in the ASI group and 58 (range, 39-76) months in the K-wire group. The following seven characteristics were evaluated : fracture type, surgical technique, dominance of the affected limb, patient age, injury-surgery interval, and individual relative CS and DASH scores. The results were statistically analysed with a 5% level of statistical significance set for all tests.The average age in the ASI group was 62.1 years, with 64.7 (range, 29-95) years for women and 35.5 (range, 26-76) years for men. In the K-wire group the average age was 66.1 (range, 53-84) years. The functional outcomes in four-fragment fractures were significantly worse than in three-fragment fractures (mean relative CS and DASH scores of 56 and 21 versus 72 and 32). The K-wire group showed a significantly worse functional outcomes than the ASI group in both the mean relative CS score (p<0.001) and the mean DASH score (p=0.003). No significant relationship was found in any other pair of variables. The patient's age had no effect on functional outcome, as assessed by CS (p=0.412) and DASH (p=0.076) and the injury-surgery interval had no influence, either (CS, p=0.220; DASH, p=0.118). There was no relation between the patient's age and choice of the surgical method (p=0.467), between the patient's age and a fracture type (p=0.356) and between the patient's age and injury to either a dominant or a non-dominant limb (p=0.659). Dominance or non-dominance of the affected limb had no effect on CS or DASH scores (p=0.662 and p=0.302, respectively) or on a type of fracture (p=0.183).Several surgical techniques used for the treatment of proximal humerus fractures suggest the absence of consensus in therapy. Novel angle-stable implants show better biochemical properties and meet criteria required in minimally invasive techniques. Some authors prefer intramedullary nailing for three-fragment fractures and the use of an angle-stable plate for four-fragment fractures. These indication criteria were also confirmed by the results of our study.The analysis of functional outcomes showed that the therapeutic effect of K-wire transfixation was significantly worse than the effect of the angle-stable plate technique, and therefore the authors stopped using this method. At present intramedullary nailing is indicated in two- and three-fragment fractures and in some less displaced four-fragment fractures. An angle-stable plate is used in severely displaced four-fragment fractures. If the head is broken or dislocated, older patients are primarily indicated for hemiarthroplasty and younger ones for humeral head reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporotic vertebral fractures can be treated by minimally invasive percutaneous vertebral augmentation with bone cement using vertebroplasty or balloon kyphoplasty. Transcutaneous reduction and vertebral body stenting has been the most recent principle. In contrast to balloon placement in kyphoplasty, the stent remains in the vertebral body and supports both the vertebral body and cement filling. In this retrospective study we present the essential information on the method and our first results.The method of vertebral body stent placement was used in 22 patients treated at 29 levels. Of these, 19 patients with 26 segments followed up for 3 months were evaluated. The group included 12 women and seven men with an average age of 68.3 years (12 to 83). The patients assessed their subjective complaints on the visual analogue scale (VAS) before surgery, and then at 1, 6 and 12 weeks post-operatively. The value of vertebral body reduction was obtained by measurement of anterior, middle and posterior vertebral body heights (AVBH, MVBH and PVBH, respectively) and a change in the vertebral body kyphotic angle (VBKA).Twenty-four vertebrae were treated for osteoporotic fracture and two as preventive stenting in metastatic breast cancer. In 24 fractures, the stents extended fully in 20 vertebrae, i.e., 40 stents. These fractures evidently were not older than 3 months. In four segments, a total of eight stents did not extend at all or did only slightly. The 20 stabilised vertebral bodies had an average AVBH value of 19.41 mm pre-operatively and that of 22.775 mm post-operatively, which is an average increase by 3.365 mm in absolute numbers and by 17.34 %. The average pre- and post-operative MVBH values were 16.625 mm and 23.065 mm, which was improvement by 6.41 mm or by 38.56 %. The average PVBH values pre- and post-operatively were 26.835 mm and 28.31 mm, which meant improvement by 1.475 mm or by 5.5 %. The average correction of the kyphotic angle was 4.58°, i.e., 35.2 %, from a VBKA of 11.71° pre-operatively to 7.13° post-operatively. There were five cases (22.7 %) of cement leakage, i.e., two of ventral leakage, one of lateral leakage, one of dorsal leakage through a canal left in the pedicle by cannula insertion, and a dorsal leakage in metastatic disease. No neurological findings were recorded. The average VAS scores were as follows: 81.4 before surgery, 30.6 at 1 week, 16.3 at 6 weeks and 15.4 at 12 weeks after surgery.Two experimental and one clinical study on vertebral body stenting only have been available in the recent relevant literature. In comparison with their results as well as with those of previous reports on vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, our results showed high quality fracture reduction in all vertebrae. The rapid decrease in pain intensity in our group is comparable with all available groups treated by any method of vertebral body augmentation by cement injection; and cement leakage was recorded in even fewer cases.The novel method of vertebral body stenting with cement augmentation provides a rapid pain relief, gives stability to fracture reduction and has a low rate of cement leakage. However, care must be taken not to indicate cases with a damaged posterior corticalis of the vertebral body.",

Easy radiological measurement of wear in cups coated with X-ray dense material, such as metal or ceramics, is not applicable.

Changes between the two centers on subsequent images allowed the estimation of wear. Data from 148 randomly selected patients with cemented THP were compared with that from 50 with cementless THP (head diameter always 32 mm). RESULTS Within the cemented group metal heads showed significant more wear than ceramic heads (1.244 mm vs. 0.504 mm). However, calculating the wear rate per year showed no significant difference. No significant differences were observed comparing cemented and cementless group. A comparison of the own results with those of the literature revealed analogous values.Data of the cementless group were comparable with those obtained from conventional wear measurements on cemented hip cups thus validating the technique.The method offers the potential to define wear of metal cups with a polyethylene inlay or with X-ray dense components such as ceramic or metal inlays.",

However, the Monteggia fracture is often still associated with various complications, poor functional outcomes and a relatively high rate of revision surgeries. Rigid anatomic fixation of ulnar fracture is paramount. Open relocation of the radial head and soft tissue procedures are redundant. Monteggia fractures are challenging to treat. Critical analysis with respect to the high rate of complications and unsatisfactory functional outcomes is required. The type of fracture and associated injuries such as coronoid fracture and radial head fracture appear to influence the outcome in most cases. Negative prognostic factors such as prolonged immobilization, associated coronoid and radial head fractures must be minimized and treated appropriately. Prior to surgery the patient should be informed regarding the possible risk of residual functional limitations and the potential need for further revision surgeries.",

    "abstract": "Operations of hallux valgus deformity are very well known in orthopaedic surgery. The important part of these procedures is the release of soft tissue on the lateral side of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. Soft tissue procedures became routinely used in the 1920s and 1930s and several techniques of soft tissue release have been published in the past seventy years. We found several inaccuracies between the anatomy published and the routine clinical performance. The purpose of the study was to describe the anatomy of the first metatarsophalangeal joint's lateral part, especially the adductor hallucis muscle attachment, and to assess to what extent the lateral structures of the first metatarsophalangeal joint should be released to correct hallux valgus deformity.We described and compared the anatomy of the lateral part of the first metatarsophalangeal joint on 30 dissected specimens obtained from cadavers that met the criteria of hallux valgus deformity.The standard preparation method was used for anatomical dissection; whole leg specimens including the pelvic girdle were fixed in formaldehyde, acetone, ethyl-alcohol and glycerol. The detailed course and shape of the adductor muscle attachment was described as well as its relation to the lateral sesamoid bone, lateral portion of the flexor hallucis brevis and the transverse metatarsal ligament. Dissection of the joint's lateral capsule was used to show the course of the lateral collateral ligament, sesamoid ligament and conjoined tendon of the adductor hallucis and flexor hallucis brevis muscles. Subsequently, we released the lateral sesamoid ligament with a standard longitudinal cut and then released the conjoined tendon and lateral collateral ligament at the level of the joint gap in the frontal plane. We evaluated the proposed technique in terms of the extent of soft tissue release and the size of tenotomy necessary to correct the deformity.The mean valgus deformity was 32° (range, 18° to 50°). We were not able to define space between the medial border of the adductor hallucis and the flexor hallucis brevis in 23 cases (77%). The mean size of release was 6.4 mm (range, 5 to 15 mm) and the width of a conjoined tendon at the level of release was 11.2 mm (range, 8 to 15 mm). We did not achieve satisfactory release with our technique in two cases (7%, deviation 45° and 50°).We compared our results with those of similar anatomical studies. We found several inaccuracies in anatomical descriptions of the adductor hallucis attachment. We confirmed the difficulty in separation of the adductor hallucis from the lateral head of the flexor hallucis brevis in total tenotomy of the adductor. Our technique was successful in releasing the first metatarsophalangeal joint's lateral structures.Our study showed than even partial tenotomy of the conjoined tendon of the adductor hallucis and flexor hallucis brevis muscles is successful in correcting hallux valgus deformity. The release has to be combined with release of the lateral sesamoid ligament.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY This study aims to articulate regional guidelines for curative and suppressive antibiotic therapy of total joint replacement infections. MATERIAL AND METHODS When developing the standard, used as source materials were the published foreign guidelines for antibiotic therapy of prosthetic joint infections, the analysis of resistance of bacterial strains conducted in the Hospital in České Budějovice, a.s. and the assessment of strain resistance for the Czech Republic published by the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net). Considered was also the availability of individual antibiotics in the Czech Republic and restricted prescription according to the Summary of Product Characteristics as specified in the State Institute for Drug Control marketing authorisation. The expert group composed of orthopaedists, microbiologists and infectious disease specialists elaborated the basic antibiotic guideline for choosing an appropriate antibiotic/antifungal drug based on the usual susceptibility, its dose and dosage interval for initial and continuation therapy. The comments of individual specialists were gradually incorporated therein and in case of doubts majority rule was applied. The drafted document was sent for peer reviews to clinical orthopaedic, infectious disease and microbiological centres, whose comments were also incorporated and the finalised document was submitted for evaluation to specialised medical societies. RESULTS The outcome is the submitted guideline for antibiotic curative and suppressive therapy suitable for managing the prosthetic joint infections, which was approved by the committee of the Czech Society for Orthopaedics and Traumatology andthe Society for Infectious Diseases of the Czech Medical Association of J. E. Purkyně. DISCUSION Curative therapy of total joint replacement infections consists primarily in surgical treatment and has to be accompanied by adequate antibiotic therapy administered initially intravenously and later orally over a sufficient period of time. Bearing in mind the wide spectrum of pathogens that can cause infections of a joint replacement and their capacity to form a biofilm on foreign materials, the correct choice of an antibiotic, its dose and dosage interval are essential for successful treatment. Such standard should respect regional availability of antibiotics, regional pathogen resistance/susceptibility and ensure the achievement of sufficiently high concentrations at the requested location including anti-biofilm activity. CONCLUSIONS The submitted guideline is not the only treatment option for joint total replacement infections, but it makes the decisionmaking easier when treating these complications in the form of infections. The final choice of an antibiotic, its dose and duration of therapy shall be based on a critical assessment of results of microbiological (blood culture and molecular genetic) tests and reflect the patient s clinical condition. Since these are multidisciplinary issues, we consider useful for this guideline to be commented upon and approved by the committee of both the Society for Orthopaedics and Infectious Diseases so that it can become the starting point for treatment. Key words: total joint replacement infection, TEP, ATB, antibiotic therapy, consensus meeting, guideline.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYAccurate radiographic measurements are crucial in treating hallux valgus (HV).This three-dimensional deformity should not be evaluated from one joint on one plane.However, in practice, surgeons measure the deformity only on transverse dorsoplantar radiographs.We determined the amount of error associated with positioning the foot incorrectly on radiographs. MATERIAL AND METHODSTo simulate incorrect positions of the foot in radiographic evaluation, we designed an angled device that can move in transverse and frontal plane.In four patients with symptomatic HV, we took weight-bearing radiographs of the involved foot in seven different positions.These 28 radiographs were given identifying but meaningless labels.On each radiograph, six surgeons blinded to the position of the radiograph measured the HV angle (HVA) and the inter-metatarsal angle (IMA) and state the treatment plan according to five treatment options were given to participants. RESULTSInter-observer agreement was high for measurements of HVA and IMA in all positions (interclass correlation coefficients, 0.96 and 0.88, respectively).However, intra-observer agreement was poor for HVA (intra-observer agreement, 0.17) but good for IMA (intra-observer agreement, 0.64).According to the measurements in different positions, intra-observer treatment choices revealed moderate results (ICC: 0.524). Clinical RelevanceRadiographic measurements are very important on the treatment decisions of hallux valgus.The foot position can influence the measurement accuracy and can cause incorrect decisions.In this study, we evaluated the impact of foot positions on measurements of hallux valgus angle and inter-metatarsal angle.Additionally, we evaluated the incorrect foot positioning on treatment decisions.Moreover, we analyzed intra-observer and inter-observer agreements of these angles in various positions. CONCLUSIONSWe recommend that measurements of IMA are more reliable than those of HVA for managing hallux valgus in terms of false weight bearing radiographs taken in different positions.Positional changes during foot radiographs could lead clinicians to perform incorrect HVA and IMA measurements.This could change the treatment option.HVA measurements were more affected with foot positioning.It is important to take full weight bearing foot radiographs in correct technique.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Anxiety may have negative repercussions on the surgery including poorer outcomes. On the other hand, the majority of patients reporting preoperative anxiety fear not receiving enough attention from a caregiver. In patients undergoing fast-track knee arthroplasty, we determined the relationship between patients' preoperative anxiety and the anxiety the patient's caregiver. We also analyzed the influence of selected psychosocial and demographic variables on the relationship between caregivers' and patients' anxiety. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a prospective, descriptive study in which baseline assessments of patients scheduled to undergo fast-track total knee arthroplasty between 1st November 2014 and 30th April 2015 were compared with those of their caregivers. Patients were recruited from a large teaching hospital through the orthopedics joint replacement clinic. Information on sex, age, body mass index (BMI), educational status, employment status, marital status, and living status was recorded for all patients. Patients and their caregivers completed the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Baseline trait anxiety was assessed with STAI scores in the initial interview, 2 weeks before hospitalization, and state anxiety was assessed the day before the surgery. The patients' caregivers were contacted during a scheduled postoperative clinic visit and asked to complete the STAI and to provide information on their age, degree of consanguinity with patient, and living status. RESULTS The mean age was 66.4 years for the 118 patients and 55.7 years for the 93 caregivers. In male caregivers, caregiver anxiety and patient anxiety were positively related but not statistically so, and in women was not significant. In male patients, a relationship between caregiver's anxiety and patient's anxiety was positive, although not statistically significant, and in women was neither present nor significant. DISCUSSION Given the widespread impacts of anxiety before knee arthroplasty, it is critical for surgeons to gain a better understanding of how to identify and reduce preoperative anxiety in operated patients. We found that male sex among caregivers was associated with more preoperative anxiety among patients than was female sex and that male patients more quickly accepted anxiety from their caregivers than did female patients. CONCLUSIONS Anxious male caregivers appear to impart their anxiety to male patients but not to female patients. The anxiety of unrelated caregivers is associated with low preoperative anxiety among patients. Preoperative interventions should focus on caregivers, especially male caregivers, and to related caregivers to help patients cope with anxiety before knee arthroplasty.

CONCLUSIONSDespite the negative pre-operative urine culture, frequent incidence of leukocyturia and symptomatic urinary infections were detected in a fairly high number of cases.Therefore, we recommend asking the patients during the hospital admission process specifically about the urinary infection symptoms.The results of our study show that antibiotic prophylaxis during the removal of indwelling urinary catheters placed for a short-term is unnecessary.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Our retrospective study presents the comparison of the preoperative magnetic resonance imaging of the knee joint - MRI - and the arthroscopic finding - ASC. Its aim is to find out how a positive or a negative finding of MRI corresponds with the operative finding and how much the experience of radiologist contributes to the conformity. MATERIAL AND METHODS The MRI findings of knee joints treated surgically at two departments in 2013 and 2014 were assessed. The MRI was performed in a total of 470 patients who subsequently underwent an arthroscopic surgery. A conformity or a non-conformity in anterior, posterior horn and complete rupture of both menisci and in partial or complete tear of anterior cruciate ligament - LCA was searched for. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of MRI were established. The difference between experienced and less experienced radiologists was evaluated. The analysis of the radiology report, surgical protocol of ASC and medical history in the documentation was performed. The cartilage was not subject to evaluation. The finding of Grade 1 meniscus tear on MRI was evaluated as negative. Grade 2 and Grade 3 were evaluated as positive. RESULTS Comparison of the preoperative MRI and the arthroscopic finding 1. The group with MRI reported 3 % of diagnostic arthroscopies. The control group without MRI (551 ASC) reported 15 % diagnostic arthroscopies. 2. Low sensitivity of MRI (0.67) in negative findings of ASC. It concerned 7 cases in which a pathological finding was identified on a MRI scan, but not by ASC. In two cases the repeated arthroscopy confirmed that a pathology inside the knee joint was overlooked by the arthroscopist. In the remaining five cases, the clinical finding improved without a repeated surgery. 3. High sensitivity of MRI is shown in the most frequent finding - posterior horn of medial meniscus (0.94). 4. Lower sensitivity (0.76) in partial and (0.83) in complete ACL tear. It increases to 0.93 if partial and complete tear are put together. Both MRI and ASC detect the pathology of ligament, but do not agree in terms of terminology. 5. Lower sensitivity (0.78) was seen in posterior horn of lateral meniscus, most likely due to its complicated anatomy. 6. Specificity of complete tear of medial meniscus tear is 0.99. Lower specificity in the posterior horn of medial meniscus (0.81) shows a higher number of positive MRI findings in negative ASC findings. Some posterior horn tear can be overlooked by an inexperienced surgeon. The MRD findings need to be studied. 7. High specificity (0.99) was described in negative findings. In three cases only, the surgeon discovered a pathological finding, not revealed by MRI scan. It always concerned a tear within the posterior horn of the medial meniscus. 8. Specificity (0.88, 0.93 or 0.86, respectively) in partial, complete and all ACL damages in total. 9. We concluded that contributing to the degree of agreement between MRI and ASC is also the experience of a radiologist. The most experienced radiologist evaluated 190 of 470 MRI scans, the remaining twelve radiologists assessed 280 scans. The posterior horn of the medial meniscus - sensitivity or specificity evaluated by an experienced radiologist (0.98 and 0.88, respectively) and inexperienced radiologist (0.91 and 0.79). The specificity and sensitivity in complete ACL tears - by experienced radiologist (0.91 and 0.94, respectively) and inexperienced radiologist (0.81 and 0.90, respectively). The test accuracy of the experienced radiologist in evaluating the most frequent injuries of soft knee structures was by 9-10 % higher than of the inexperienced radiologist. DISCUSSION The results obtained by the other authors show that the sensitivity and specificity range from 0.6 to 0.9. They agree that the MRI is unsuitable for assessing the cartilage. We confirm that the results are worse when evaluating the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus. We have also proven that the radiologist s experience does play an important role. It can be the reason for a high degree of difference between the results of various authors. Some of them give preference to a clinical examination or a diagnostic arthroscopy instead of the MRI. At our department, MRI is indicated if we are convinced it can help with the indication or where it will suggest what to focus on during the surgery. CONCLUSIONS A preoperative MRI scan can prevent an unnecessary arthroscopy. It displays structures to the surgeon which shall be reviewed in detail during the surgery. We recommend paying attention to Grade 2 MRI findings, positive MRI findings on the posterior horn of medial meniscus and to MRI findings on partial ACL tears. Such menisci and ligaments shall be carefully reviewed. Clinical preoperative examination and cooperation between the surgeon, the \"arthroscopist\", and the radiologist is essential. The experience of the radiologist also plays a role when evaluating the MRI scan. We have introduced MRI ward rounds.

    "abstract": "Conventional documentation of surgical procedures using only pre- and postoperative X-ray images and possibly a few intra-operative pictures does not allow secondary analysis of the technical performance in detail. In particular, the quality of the handling of tissues and surgical tools cannot be judged «post hoc», i.e. after the end of the surgical procedure. The invasiveness of the surgical act cannot yet be quantified. Surrogate invasiveness indices have therefore been developed. Furthermore, conventional documentation does not allow evaluation of the proper use of the C-arm both technically and with regard to fluoroscopy time. Documentation that follows the ICUC® documentation concept includes all fluoroscopy shots and images covering all key portions of the entire surgical procedure by multiple still images or videos. In certain cases, such documentation can help to explain post-operative courses that might be difficult to understand based only on X-rays and written operation reports. Finally, the data included in ICUC® documentation are a valuable source for knowledge extraction. In addition, time saving is conceivable if operation reports can include images of the key stages of the procedure with a few additional comments dictated during the surgery.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYSince 2000 arthroscopically-assisted surgery on hip joints has become more widely used.The technique is relatively demanding and should be used only after arthroscopic procedures on other large joints are mastered to perfection.A thorough study on cadaverous specimens should be a prerequisite for adopting it as a routine method.The aim of this study was to evaluate indications for hip arthroscopy as, from the year 2006, this was gradually introduced and more widely used at our department. MATERIAL AND METHODSForty-two hip joints were assessed out of the 83 hips which had been treated by arthroscopic surgery before the date of evaluation and which had been followed up for at least 2 years.The patient group evaluated consisted of 25 men and 17 women, with an average age of 40.3 years and a range of 21 to 65 years.Patients with a follow-up shorter than 2 years and those subsequently undergoing total hip arthroplasty were not evaluated.Indications for arthroscopic surgery included the presence of intra-articular bodies, labro-cartilaginous lesions and impingement syndromes.Neurovascular disorder affecting the limb and a higher degree of osteoporosis were considered contraindications.The outcome of surgery and its indications were evaluated on the basis of the questionnaire which recorded the patient's objective findings and subjective feelings at 3 and 6 months and then at 1 and 2 years after surgery. RESULTSThe average VAS score was 7.83 points before surgery, and 3.87 points at 3 months and 2.01 points at 2 years after surgery.Nearly all patients (98%) reported their willingness to undergo the surgery again.The complications included transient hyperesthesia in the perineal region completely resolved within 4 weeks of surgery in three cases and subcutaneous extravasation after extensive capsulotomy in one patient.It subsided within 48 hours without compartment syndrome development. DISCUSSIONA good view allowing for comprehensive exploration of the central as well as peripheral compartments enables us to treat all pathologies, which are manageable by arthroscopic intervention, in one procedure.Patient recovery is faster and the risk of intra-and post-operative complications is lower that in open surgery.The avoidance of extensive capsulotomy and the possibility of leaving the femoral head in place with only minimum distractions and without injury to the ligamentum capitis are the most important advantages of this method.Complications were found in 8.4% of the cases, which is in agreement with the literature data.The method can be applied in both the diagnosis and therapy of chronic conditions such as femoroacetabular impingement, as well as in the treatment of post-traumatic conditions ranging from traumatic labral lesions to the correction of incongruence of articular surfaces in acetabular fractures. CONCLUSIONSArthroscopically-assisted surgery enables us to achieve very good results, but requires appropriate, high-standard facilities and a well-mastered operative technique.It should be adopted as the method of choice for young adults still free of arthritic changes including hip impingement syndrome.Similarly to arthroscopic procedures on shoulders and knees, it is associated with low risk factors, and rapid recovery allows the patient to return soon to normal daily activities.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The treatment of distal tibial fractures requires a stable fixation while minimizing the secondary trauma to the soft tissues by the surgical approach and implant. The experimental Retrograde Tibial Nail is currently investigated as a minimally invasive alternative to plating and antegrade nailing. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the surgical feasibility in a cadaver model for all distal tibial fracture types generally considered treatable by nailing. MATERIAL AND METHODS Five different fracture types (AO/OTA 43-A1/A2/A3 and 43-C1/C2) were created on separate cadaveric limbs. In simple fractures (AO/OTA 43-A1/A2/A3) primary nailing was performed. In intraarticular fractures (AO/OTA 43-C1/2) reduction of the articular block and lag screw fixation was performed before nailing. Intraoperative complications, quality of reduction, fluoroscopy duration and operative time were evaluated. RESULTS Retrograde intramedullary nailing is feasible in simple fracture types by closed manual reduction and percutaneous reduction forceps. Retrograde nailing is possible in fractures with simple intraarticular involvement after primary lag screw fixation. The duration of surgery averaged 51.8 minutes (range 40-62 min). No major complications occurred during nailing. CONCLUSIONS The minimally invasive retrograde nail combines a minimally invasive local osteosynthesis with the ability to adequately fix extraarticular and simple intraarticular distal tibial fractures. The results suggests that retrograde tibia nailing is a promising new concept for the treatment of distal tibia fractures. Key words: minimally invasive surgery, tibia, metaphyseal fractures, intramedullary nailing, retrograde nailing.",

    "abstract": "Celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy) is currently regarded as a multisystem autoimmune disorder; its clinical signs and symptoms do not involve merely the gastrointestinal tract but are associated with several other medical specialties, including orthopaedics and traumatology. In orthopaedic and trauma patients, celiac disease should be suspected in the following diagnoses: osteomalacia, premenopausal osteoporosis, post-menopausal osteoporosis more severe than expected and refractory to medication, osteoporosis in men under 55 years of age, recurrent bone fractures in the limbs, large joint arthralgia or arthritis of unclear aetiology, erosive spondyloarthropathy particularly in patients with the history of chronic diarrhoea, anaemia or associated autoimmune disorders (type 1 diabetes mellitus or autoimmune thyreopathy), and in women with secondary amenorrhea or early menopause. The orthopaedist or trauma surgeon should be aware of suspected celiac disease in patients who do not respond adequately to the standard treatment of pain related to the musculoskeletal system, in patients with recurrent fractures of the limb bones and in young patients with suspected secondary osteoporosis. With the use of appropriate screening methods, celiac disease as-yet undiagnosed can be revealed. A long-life gluten-free diet in these patients results in the alleviation of metabolic osteopathy and joint and muscle problems, in reduced requirements of analgesic and antiphlogistic drugs as well as in reduced risks of fracture.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe aim of the study was to assess treatment outcomes in patients undergoing K-wire transfixation of unstable ankle fractures and compare the results with those of patients in whom it was possible to perform primary one-stage osteosynthesis. MATERIAL AND METHODSBetween 2009 and 2012, a total of 358 patients (191 women and 167 men) had surgery for unstable ankle fracture.At 1-year follow-up, their subjective feelings, objective findings and ankle radiographs were evaluated.The fractures were categorised according to the Weber classification.A patient group treated by one-stage osteosynthesis, a group with definitive transfixation and a group of patients in whom temporary transfixation was converted to definitive osteosynthesis were assessed and compared. RESULTSThe group treated by one-stage osteosynthesis included 278 patients with an average age of 47 years; the group of 20 patients with definitive transfixation had an average age of 67 years, and the group of 60 patients who had temporary transfixation with subsequent conversion to internal osteosynthesis were 55 years on average.In the group with one-stage osteosynthesis, 223 (80%) ankle fractures on post-injury radiographs were associated with minor joint dislocations and 55 (20%) with major dislocations.On the other hand, the radiographs of the patients treated by temporary transfixation and delayed open reduction with internal fixation showed major dislocations in 38 (63%) and minor dislocations in the rest of the patients (37%); the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (p<0.001).Posterior malleolar fractures were most frequent in the group with temporary transfixation (60%) and least frequent in the group with primary osteosynthesis (44%); also this difference was statistically significant (p=0.032).At one-year follow-up, in the group with one-stage osteosynthesis, 220 patients (79%) had no radiographic signs of posttraumatic ankle osteoarthritis while, in the group with temporary transfixation, no radiographic evidence of ankle osteoarthritis was recorded in 25 (42%) patients.While tibiofibular synostosis was recorded in only few patients (9%) of the group with one-stage osteosynthesis, it showed a high occurrence in the group with temporary transfixation (35%).The patients with one-stage osteosynthesis (188/68%) had a higher proportion of excellent outcomes measured on the Olerund-Molander ankle scoring scale than the other two groups (temporary transfixation, 47%; definitive transfixation,10%); in both cases the difference was significant (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). DISCUSSIONIn this study the morphological and clinical aspects of surgically treated ankle fractures were assessed.The patients with one-stage osteosynthesis were compared with those treated by temporary or definitive transfixation.The majority of patients undergoing temporary transfixation had a fractured posterior margin of the tibia and major ankle joint dislocation, which suggested serious injuries to bone and ligament structures.Generally, the use of only two K-wires inserted through the calcaneus and talus into the distal tibia is recommended.Patients with K-wire transfixation usually require a longer hospital stay because of the serious nature of their injuries. CONCLUSIONSThe therapy of choice for unstable ankle fractures is one-stage osteosynthesis.Temporary transfixation is an effective method of primary management when an unstable fracture cannot be treated by definitive osteosynthesis at the early stage due to local or general health conditions of the patient.The temporary transfixation provides good alignment of the ankle joint necessary for successful healing of soft tissues.A higher occurrence of post-traumatic ankle osteoarthritis, ossification and distal tibiotalar synostosis found in the patients treated by temporary transfixation is more related to serious types of ankle fractures the patient had suffered than to the method itself.",

MATERIAL AnD METHODSDuring cadaver sutdy a total of 24 implantations using the Philos angular stable plate were performed from the minimally invasive anterolateral approach.A five-hole plate inserted with the aid of new Philos aiming device was used in all cases.The plate was fixed with four screws proximally and with three screws to the diaphysis.After implantation either of the incisions were joined and the axillary nerve was exposed on the lateral side of the arm. RESULTSThe nerve was not found to be injured during plate implantation in any of the cases.The average length of the proximal incision was 56±2.8 mm (52-64 mm) and that of the distal incision was 32±2.5 mm (28-35 mm).The middle free part covering the axillary nerve was on average 45±4.3mm (38-54) long.The average width of the nerve was 1.9±0.35mm (1.4-2.8 mm).The average distance of the axillary nerve was 39±2.9 mm (37-44 mm) from the superior facet of the greater tubercle and 53±3.9 mm (48-60) from the lower edge of the acromial process.In 80% of the cases the nerve was located in the area determined for the screws going to the medial calcar region; in 20% it was over a hole for the screw directed towards the centre of humeral head.nerve location above the first six most proximally placed screws was not recorded in any of the cases. DISCUSSIOnThe minimally invasive anterolateral approach is an alternative technique for osteosynthesis of proximal humerus fractures using angular stable plates.Advantages reported by a number of authors include lower incidence of avascular necrosis of the humeral head, an easier way of reduction and a better view of the rotator cuff.On the other hand, this approach is associated with a higher risk of damage to the axillary nerve.Distance of axillary nerve from acromion is very variable.It may be located in the range of 30 to 85 mm from the acromial edge. COnCLUSIOnThe anterolateral approach is, when respecting the anatomical position of the axillary nerve, a safe alternative to the conventional deltoideopectoral approach.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSA prospective study was carried out in 47 patients (average age, 30.7 years) with clinical symptoms of wrist instability from 2013 to 2014.The patients were examined with the MR device Philips Achieva 1.5T using a microscopic coil and subsequently by direct MR arthrography.The results of examination were evaluated independently by two groups of physicians using a modified arthroscopic classification.The results were verified arthroscopically.For evaluation, an adjusted Geissler's classification was used.The study was approved by the Multicentre Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine in Brno and informed consent was obtained from each patient. RESULTSA total of The MRI examination was evaluated and included in the study in 44 patients (three were excluded for the presence of motion artefacts).Only 20 patients underwent arthroscopy.Examination with a microscopic coil correctly classified 14 of them; an accuracy of 70 % (95 % CI: 45.7 % -88.1 %) and p = 0.021.Direct MR arthrography correctly classified 16 of 20 injured ligaments, i.e., an accuracy of 80 % (95 % CI: 56.3 % -94.3 %) and p = 0.002. DISCUSSIONCurrently, the diagnosis of pathological changes in the wrist is made by routine MRI especially when there is the possibility of using sequences with high spatial resolution.Even though we achieved poorer results by native examination using these techniques, when they were compared with the results of direct MR arthrography, they were still better than those reported in the recent literature. CONCLUSIONThe optimal method for an examination algorithm of scapholunate ligament lesions is direct MR arthrography.In our study correct findings of direct MR arthrography using Geissler's classification were shown in 80 % of the patients.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the effect of topical application of tranexamic acid (TXA, Exacyl) on the amount of post-operative blood loss, and blood transfusion requirement in patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Attention was paid to early complications potentially associated with TXA administration, such as haematoma, wound exudate, or knee swelling. In addition, the economic benefit of TXA treatment was also taken into account. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 238 patients (85 men and 153 women) who underwent primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) at our department between January 2013 and November 2015. A group of 119 patients (41 men and 78 women) received intraarticular TXA injections according to the treatment protocol (TXA group). A control group matched in basic characteristics to the TXA group also consisted of 119 patients. The average age in the TXA group was 69.8 years, and the most frequent indication for TKA surgery was primary knee osteoarthritis (81.5%). In each patient, post-operative volume of blood lost from drains and total blood loss including hidden blood loss were recorded, as well as post-operative haemoglobin and haematocrit levels. On discharge of each patient from hospital, the size and site of a haematoma; wound exudate, if present after post-operative day 4; joint swelling; range of motion and early revision surgery, if performed, were evaluated. Requirements of analgesic drugs after surgery were also recorded. RESULTS In the TXA group, blood losses from drains were significantly lower than in the control group (456.7 ± 270.8 vs 640.5 ±448.2; p = 0.004). The median value for blood losses from drains was lower by 22% and the average value for total blood loss, including hidden losses, was also lower than in the control group (762.4 ± 345.2 ml vs 995.5 ± 457.3 ml). The difference in the total amount of blood loss between the two groups was significant (p = 0.0001), including hidden blood loss (p = 0.030). The TXA patients had significantly fewer requirements for allogeneic blood transfusion (p < 0.0004), higher post-operative haemoglobin levels (p = 0.014), lower incidence of haematomas (p = 0.0003), and a significantly higher flexion degree on discharge from hospital (p < 0.0001). No higher volume of wound drainage was found (p = 1.000). Only one patient of the TXA group underwent revision surgery due to wound healing disturbance. The total costs of blood transfusion requirements were significantly lower in the TXA group than in the control group (p = 0.0004). DISCUSSION Topical administration allows the antifibrinolytic effect of TXA to act directly at a bleeding site. Its advantages involve easy application, maximum TXA concentration at the site of application, no danger associated with administration of a higher TXA dose and minimal TXA resorption into the circulation. On the other hand, there are no exact instructions for an effective and safe topical application of TXA and some authors are concerned that a coagulum arising after TXA application might affect soft tissue behaviour (healing, swelling, rehabilitation) or result in infection. CONCLUSIONS The study showed the efficacy and safety of topical TXA administration resulting in lower peri-operative bleeding, fewer blood transfusion requirements and higher haemoglobin levels after TKA. The patients treated with TXA had less knee swelling, lower incidence of haematomas and used fewer analgesic drugs in the early post-operative period. The economic benefit is also worth considering. In agreement with the recent literature, it is suggested to add topical TXA application to the recommended procedures for TKA surgery.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Exploring the therapeutic potential of pathological fractures treatment of the proximal femur in childhood with LCP paediatric hip plate system according to the principles of AO. MATERIAL AND METHODS Six children with pathological fractures of the proximal femur and with an unicameral bone cyst have undergone surgery in our institution, in the period between June 2018 up until December 2020. All patients were young boys with a mean age of 11.83 ± 3.43 years. According to the classification of Delbet-Colonna, three of the fractures were Type IV - intertrochanteric fractures and three were Type III - basocervical fractures. ccording to the AO Trauma classification, one of the fractures was complete transtrochanteric multifragmentary (31-M/3.2.III), two were complete transtrochanteric simple (31-M/3.1.III), one was Complete basocervical multifragmentary (31-M/3.2.II) and two were complete basicervical simple (31-M/3.1.II). All patients have undergone open reposition and osteosynthesis with a 130° LCP pediatric hip plate system (DePuy Synthes Pediatric LCP Plate System). In four of the patients, one or two of the proximal locking screws pass through the growth plate, to ensure more stability. The anatomical correction of the proximal femur has been measured through the cervico-diaphyseal angle, consolidation of the fracture, the spontaneous reparation of the cyst according to the Capanna classification and cystic index, presence of avascular necrosis of the epiphysis, shortening of the extremity, and functional grading by the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) staging system. The Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon W) test was used for data processing. RESULTS The mean timing of the follow-up after the surgery was 22 months (range 6-32). A radiographically supported consolidation of the fracture has occurred at an average timing of 4.8 months (range 3-6) in all patients. There is no clinical or radiological evidence of postoperative avascular necrosis in any of the patients. According to the classification of Capanna, in five of the six patients a spontaneous reparation of the cyst has occurred. In one of the cases, the reparation is classified as grade II with a pathological cystic index of 2.27. A postoperative correction of the varus fracture deformity of the proximal femur has been achieved in all children. The cervical-diaphysary angle of 112.50° preoperatively has been corrected to 137.17° (p=0.002). The achieved correction is lasting and the average value of the CDS at the final follow-up is 138.17° (p=0.794). Intraoperative correction, statistically equal to the CDA of the healthy side (p=0.942) is achieved with this operative technique. Data from the MSTS show functional correction on the third postoperative month with 38.33% of the norm (p=0.002) and 85% on the final follow-up (p=0.002). A contralateral distal femoral surgical epiphysiodesis by the method of Métaizeau has been used for the correction of the difference in the length of the extremities (with an average of 2.9 cm). CONCLUSIONS Osteosynthesis with an LCP paediatric hip plate system gives the opportunity for anatomical correction of the proximal femur with a low risk of avascular necrosis and achieving optimal functional results in pathological basocervical and intertrochanteric fractures in childhood. The use of 5mm plates and penetration of the proximal screw through the growth plate holds an increased risk of growth disruption.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Unplanned revision spinal surgeries constitute a complication in the treatment algorithm for the patient, surgeon and the entire treatment team. Any complication leading to an unplanned revision surgery is therefore undesirable. The percentage of complications referred to in publications on this topic focusing on unplanned revision surgeries only varies from 0.7% to 29.8%, with obvious diversity of causes and significant risk factors. The purpose of the submitted paper is to carry out a prospective evaluation of the most serious complications requiring unplanned revision spinal surgeries in the course of 13 years at a single department performing a broad range of spinal surgeries, namely 1300 procedures annually on average. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the period 2006 - 2018, a total of 16872 patients underwent a surgery at our department. During this period, in 556 patients an unplanned revision spinal surgery was performed. In agreement with literature, the patients were categorised by cause for revision: 1/ impaired wound suprafascial (superficial) healing - superficial infection, 2/ impaired wound subfascial (deep) healing - deep infection, 3/ surgical wound hematoma, 4/ deterioration or occurrence of new neurological symptoms, 5/ cerebrospinal fluid leak (liquorrhoea) and 6/ others. The patients operated on for inflammatory diseases of the spine with subsequent infectious complications, primarily treated at another department, and the patients with open spinal injury were excluded from the study. According to these criteria, a cohort of 521 patients was followed up, namely 236 (45.3%) women and 285 (54.7%) men, aged 1 year to 86 years, with the mean age of 55.0 years (median 60 years). Demographic effects, tobacco smoking and comorbidities were followed up in the cohort, together with the effects of surgery, diagnosis, surgical approach and physician. All parameters were statistically evaluated at a p-value below 0.05, including comparison with the control group. RESULTS Of the total number of 16872 operated patients, a group of 521 (3.09%) patients undergoing a revision surgery for complications was analysed in detail. Impaired wound healing - infection (SSI) was found in 199 (1.18%) patients, of whom superficial infection in 124 cases (0.73%) and deep infection in 75 cases (0.44%). Hematoma in a surgical site was detected in 149 (0.88%) patients. In 63 (0.37%) cases, deterioration of the existing neurological finding or occurrence of a new neurological finding were observed, in 68 (0.40%) cases cerebrospinal fluid leak was reported and in 40 (0.24%) cases other complications were identified. As concerns the surgical assistant, the percentage of complications in a board-certified physician is 2.77 (1.14 - 3.29%), in a medical resident it increases to 3.60 (0.00 - 9.38%) (p<0.05). The prevalence of smokers in the group with complications (N=521) was 34.7%. The control group (N=3650) included 30.1% of smokers (p<0.05). The mean age of patients in the group with complications (N=521) was higher, i.e. 55.0 years, with the median age of 60.0 years, than in the primary cohort (N=16872) with the mean age of 49.8 years and the median age of 52.0 years (p<0.05). The mean BMI in the group with complications was (N=521) 27.3, the median BMI was 26.9. In the control group (N=16872), the mean BMI was 27.11, the median BMI was 26.8. In this case the significance (p>0.05) was not confirmed. The complications prevailed strongly in posterior surgical approach, namely in 483 patients (92.7%). As concerns the surgically treated segment, lumber spine dominates with 320 (61.4%) cases. Corticosteroid therapy was used twice as often in women, namely in 13.1% vs. 6.3%. The group of patients with complications (N=521) showed a much higher average length of hospital stay of 12.8 days compared to the average of 4.6 days (N=16872). DISCUSSION In our cohort, the complication rate was 3.09%, of which infections constituted 1.18%, which is in agreement with similarly focused papers. As regards the patient-related factors, in our study the results reported by literature were confirmed with respect to the age, smoking and comorbidities. Moreover, the posterior surgical procedure, lumber spine surgery and presence of a medical resident are essential (p<0.05). No major age difference was observed between women and men (p>0.05). Obesity is one of the key risk factors, especially in infectious complications. In our cohort, a higher BMI did not increase the risk of complications in general (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS In correlation with current literature, our cohort confirmed a significantly higher risk of complications leading to revision spinal surgery associated with age, smoking, posterior surgical procedure in thoracic or lumber spine, and presence of a medical resident as a surgical assistant. The average length of hospital stay was demonstrably longer in complicated patients, it almost tripled compared to the whole cohort. Contrary to literature, the effect of obesity on the occurrence of complications was not confirmed.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Fixation of osteochondral fragments are relatively common procedures in pediatric orthopaedic surgery. The use of biodegradable magnesium implants in these indications appears to be a promising alternative to polymer implants due to their favorable mechanical properties and biological behavior. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the short-term clinical and radiological outcomes of the fixation of unstable or displaced osteochondral fractures and osteochondritis dissecans lesions in the knee joint using MAGNEZIX® screws and pins in pediatric patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, 12 patients (5 girls, 7 boys) were included. The inclusion criteria were as follows (1) age below 18 years; (2) unstable or displaced osteochondral fragments secondary to trauma or as a result of osteochondritis dissecans, Grades III and IV in the ICRS (International Cartilage Repair Society) score, confirmed by imaging methods and indicated for surgical fixation; (3) fixation performed using screws or pins made of the magnesium-based MAGNEZIX® alloy; (4) minimum postoperative interval of 12 months. X-rays and clinical evaluation were assessed 1 day, 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months after the operation. MRIs were performed 1-year postoperatively for evaluation of bone response and degradation behavior of implants. RESULTS The mean age at surgery was 13.3 ± 1.6 years. A total of 25 screws were used in 11 patients, a mean of 2.4 ± 1 per patient, 4 pins were used in 1 patient. In 2 patients, fixation with screws was complemented with fibrin glue. The mean follow-up was 14.2 ± 3.3 months. All patients exhibited complete functional recovery while showing no signs of pain at 6 months postoperatively. No adverse local reactions were observed. At 1-year follow-up, no implant failure has been reported. Complete radiographic healing occurred in 12 cases. Mild radiolucent zones were observed around the implants. CONCLUSIONS The use of screws and pins MAGNEZIX® has been found to provide satisfactory outcomes in terms of fracture healing and very good functional outcomes at 1 year postoperatively.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The current study aimed to investigate the intra- and inter-observer reliability of the Ellman classification system in partialthickness rotator cuff tears through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans instead of arthroscopic views. MATERIAL AND METHODS Pre-operative MRI scans of 45 patients, with confirmed partial-thickness rotator cuff rupture in previous arthroscopic surgeries (performed by the senior author), were obtained from Picture Archiving and Communication Systems records. The observers (n=8) were asked to categorize MRI scans according to Ellman's classification of location and grade. There were four orthopedic surgeons less experienced in rotator cuff operations in the first group and four more experienced orthopedic surgeons in the second group. They were asked to re-evaluate the MRI scans six weeks later, without access to their previous answers. Reliability evaluation was performed within and among the groups. It was also evaluated if the surgeon's experience increased the reliability of the classification. Fleiss kappa coefficient was used for the inter-observer reliability and Cohen kappa coefficient for the intra-observer reliability, and post hoc analysis was performed. RESULTS When all observers were examined in the inter-observer evaluation, it was seen that there was moderate agreement in the first location evaluation (κ=0.414); however, there was fair agreement in all other evaluations in both groups (κ=0.339- 0.383-0.337, respectively). When all observers were examined in the mean intra-observer evaluation, it was seen that there was substantial agreement in both evaluations (κ=0.795-0.721, respectively). DISCUSSION A classification system must be valid, reliable, and reproducible. It should establish a standard terminology for both surgeons and researchers. The correct identification of the tear configuration is crucial for selecting the correct repair technique. In our study, in which we evaluated the Ellman classification, which is frequently used in arthroscopic diagnosis, we investigated its intra-observer and inter-observer reliability on MRI scans. Although the mean intra-observer evaluation results were substantial agreement (κ=0.795-0.721, respectively), inter-observer evaluation results were fair agreement (κ=0.339- 0.383-0.337, respectively) except for the first location evaluation (κ=0.414). CONCLUSIONS Although intra-observer reliability was satisfactory, the Ellman system used in the classification of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears was not found to be useful by using only MRI views because of fair inter-observer reliability except for the first location evaluation, which was moderate agreement.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The purpose of this study was to minimize tourniquet-induced ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery using the remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) model, as well as to assess antioxidant balance with thioldisulfi de homeostasis (TDH). The secondary goal is to evaluate the impact of RIPC on TKA clinical outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients in the ASA I-III group who underwent elective TKA were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical research. TDH parameters were measured individually in groups with (Group I) and without (Group K) RIPC at the following times: preoperative (T0), right before the pneumatic tourniquet was opened (T1), 1 (T2), 6 (T3), and 24 (T4) hours after it was opened. In addition, at 3-hour intervals, the postoperative pain level was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS). RESULTS This study included 60 cases (Group K; n=30, Group I; n=30). Both groups had equal native thiol, total thiol, disulfi de levels, disulfi de/native thiol, disulfi de/total thiol, and native thiol/total thiol ratios (p>0.05 for each). The change in native thiol, total thiol, and disulfi de values at T0 and T4 periods, however, was not statistically signifi cant for Group K (p=0.049, p=0.047, p=0.037, and p=0.217, p=0.191, p=0.220, respectively). At the 15th hour, VAS values in group I were considerably lower than in Group K (p=0.002). DISCUSSION This prospective, randomized, controlled trial examined how RIPC affected tourniquet-induced IRI-induced oxidative stress in TKA surgery. Lower native, total, and disulfi de levels at each postoperative time point were signifi cant. RIPC may reduce tourniquet-induced IRI-induced oxidative stress and TDH in TKA surgery. RIPC also reduced postoperative discomfort. CONCLUSIONS Our fi ndings suggest that RIPC may protect against the oxidative stress caused by IRI during limb surgery with a tourniquet and improve postoperative clinical outcomes.

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to show advantages of post-operative collection of shed blood and its return to the patient's circulation, using blood-reinfusion sets, in terms of requirements for homologous blood, transmission of infections and posttransfusion reactions in total knee arthroplasty.Two groups of patients were studied. In group 1, comprising 88 patients, shed blood was collected by means of sets for post-operative wound drainage and subsequent autotransfusion. In group 2, with 44 patients, the standard Redon drainage system was used and blood losses were compensated for by homologous blood. Osteoarthrosis of the knee joint was the indication for total knee arthroplasty. Patients with a hemoglobin level lower than 110 g/l, rheumatoid arthropathy, hemophilic arthropathy, coagulopathy, infectious or cancer diseases, or liver or kidney failure were not included, as well as patients who were treated with non-steroid anti-rheumatic drugs, steroids or anticoagulation drugs.Post-operative blood losses within 6 h of surgery, by 24:00 hours on the day of operation and on the 1st and 2nd postoperative days were recorded. The amount of returned blood and requirements for homologous blood transfusion were also recorded. None of the patients had donated autologous blood. The patients were examined for blood pressure and heart rate; their body temperature was taken, blood samples were collected for blood cell counts and ion (Na(+), K(+), C1(-)) assessment, and urine samples were collected for laboratory tests. All side-effects and complications during hospitalization were recorded as well as all late consequences. The drainage systems used included Redyrob CAT, Retrans and Bellovac ABT.In group 1, the median value for total post-operative blood loss was 1065 ml, with the median reinfusion value of 500 ml; 31 % of the patients required homologous blood transfusion. In 36 % of the patients, body temperature increased by more than 1 degrees C, as compared with the value before reinfusion, by 24:00 hours on the operative day, and in 2 % it was higher than 38.5 degrees C. No infection occurred in the early post-operative period, but late infectious complications resulted in reimplantation in one patient (1 %). In group 2, the median value of post-operative blood loss was 1045 ml and all patients received homologous blood transfusion. Post-operative complications directly related to blood reinfusion, such as febrile reaction, shivering, pruritus, blood pressure or heart rate fluctuation, renal failure or coagulopathy, were not recorded in either group.The use of drainage system allowed us to reduce the need for homologous blood transfusion by 63 %. Blood salvage reported in the relevant literature varies between 8 and 80 %, which reflects differences in views on lost blood compensation. The total blood loss in both our groups was in agreement with the data reported by other authors, and the same held true for the reinfusion volume; most of the authors recommend to use a maximum of 800 ml. A higher blood volume carries risks due to a high level of free hemoglobin. The recommended period of 6 h for blood reinfusion was respected (to eliminate potential complement activation). We assume that the temperature higher than 38.5 degrees C found in 2 % of our patients was caused by a changed environment and post-operation reactions. The slightly higher losses recorded by 24:00 hours in group 1 were caused, in our opinion, by the resetting of suction pressure after reinfusion had finished. This difference in shed blood was eliminated during the following day and the total losses were comparable in both groups.Our results showed that, in total knee arthroplasty, post-operative collection of shed blood and its reinfusion in the circulation can lower the need for homologous blood transfusion and reduce associated risks. If all conditions are observed, i. e., blood reinfusion within 6 h of surgery and the maximum of returned blood not exceeding 800 ml, the method is a safe way of compensating for blood losses in elective knee surgery.",

    "abstract": "The management of intracapsular femoral neck fractures remains an unsolved issue of the present-day trauma surgery of the musculoskeletal system. These fractures are conventionally treated with the use of spongious screws or a dynamic hip screw combined with an antirotational spongious screw. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of surgical therapy using a different type of implant (proximal femoral nail) for intracapsular femoral neck fractures.From January 2000 to March 2004, intracapsular fractures were treated with the use of a proximal femoral nail in 70 patients. In this retrospective study, 56 patients (28 men and 28 women) were evaluated at a minimum of 12 months after surgery. The average follow-up was 22.4 months. According to the AO classification, the fractures were categorized as 31- B1 in 20, 31-B2 in 12 and 31-B3 in 24 patients.The implant used was a bi-axial proximal femoral nail (Targon PF, B. Braun Aesculap, Germany) inserted by the standard surgical procedure.In 33.3 % of the patients the operative stabilization was performed early, within 6 hours of injury, in 51.8 % the operation was carried out within 24 hours, and 14.3 % of the patients underwent surgery later than 24 hours after injury. At one year after injury, fracture union without complications was recorded in 45 patients (80 %). Complications included avascular necrosis of the femoral head in seven patients (12.5 %), pseudoarthrosis in two patients (3.6 %) and other serious complications in two patients (3.6 %). Reoperations were indicated in five patients, and these underwent total hip replacement. No refracture occurred in the vicinity of the implant. No or little pain after the implantation procedure, as assessed at 12 months and later, was reported by 83 % of the patients. The patients in whom fracture union was achieved without complications were allowed to walk with full weight-bearing at 13.8, 16.4 and 20.4 weeks, when their injury was 31-B1, 31-B2 and 31-B3, respectively.Our results show that the bi-axial proximal femoral nail (Targon PF, B. Braun Aesculap, Germany) is useful for management of intracapsular femoral head fractures because of the following advantages: it eliminates the risk of lateral protrusion of the implant, it allows for even distribution of weight bearing and thus reduces the risk of pseudoarthrosis development, it has a low probability of the sliding screw getting jammed.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYTo present the results of total wrist replacement with a cementless prosthesis designed by us. MATERIAL AND METHODSA group of five men and 27 women treated between 2004 and 2007 was evaluated.The average age was 51.6 years and follow-up ranged from 4 to 38 months, with an average of 9.4 months.Indications for surgery included wrist destruction due to rheumatoid arthritis, arthritis or psoriatic arthropathy.Subjective evaluation recorded satisfaction of the patients with the wrist range of motion, cosmetic appearance of the hand and pain relief.The range of motion was assessed with a goniometer at 4 months of follow-up on average.Radiographs were made immediately after surgery and then at 6 and 12 months post-operatively. RESULTSAll patients reported pain relief, 23 were satisfied with wrist mobility and hand appearance, and seven were only partly satisfied and would have preferred a greater range of motion.Two patients were dissatisfied with an ulnar deviation of the carpal axis and therefore revision arthroplasty of the radial ligamentary and tendinous structures was planned.No aseptic or septic loosening of the implant or its migration was found. DISCUSSIONThe current total wrist arthroplasty has evolved from Swanson silastic implants to prostheses with a metal-on-polyethylene bearing whose active surfaces are firmly fixed in bone.In today's Europe, the most frequently used prostheses are Meuli implants or the latest modification of the Guepar implant, which is very close to the Universal 2 implant.In the USA since 1985, Professor's Beckenbaugh's BIAX implant has continuously been improved.The implant designed by us is based on all well-tired implant components and aims at being as similar to the anatomical wrist structures as possible.The socket is fixed in the distal radius.The carpal components involve the main fixation shaft for the third metacarpal and a short antirotation pin for the second metacarpal base.A metal head is assembled onto a tapered shaft extending from the carpal component transversal zone.The implant is made of titanium alloy, in some parts coated with hydroxyapatite; the sockets has a polyethylene liner. CONCLUSIONTotal wrist replacement is usually preceded, particularly in surgery for rheumatoid arthritis, by operations intended to prevent or slow down gradual wrist destruction.The usual salvage procedures include surgery on soft tissues (synovectomy, tenodesis, tendon reconstruction) and/or bone (limited wrist arthrodesis, Sauve-Kapandji procedure).These procedures usually have a temporary effect and total replacement will be the next step in surgical treatment.For the most severe destruction associated with subluxation and wrist instability, total arthrodesis in a neutral wrist position still remains the method of choice.The first results with use of the implant of our design show that this total wrist replacement allows us to preserve or restore the wrist range of motion and to improved grip strength.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate a group of 11 patients with L5 burst fractures treated by L4-S1 posterior instrumented spinal fusion without reconstruction of the anterior column.The group included seven men and four women aged between 14 and 66 years (average, 37.5 years), followed for 12 to 36 months (average, 18 months). Ten patients were treated by posterior instrumented spinal fusion at the L4-S1 level, and one with an associated injury to L3 underwent L2-L4-S1 posterior instrumented spinal fusion. The spinal column was inspected in eight patients in whom neurological symptoms or significant stenosis were present.On admission, the evaluation of post-traumatic radiographs included measurements of the angle between the L4 lower and the S1 upper end-plates, the angle between the upper and lower end-plates of L5 and height of the anterior and posterior rims of the L5 vertebral body. CT scans were assessed for a relative narrowing of the spinal canal. The patient's neurological status was also evaluated. At 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months of follow-up, radiographs, neurological findings and subjective complaints were assessed.On comparison of pre-operative values with those 3 months after surgery, the differences were on average 3.6 degrees for L4-S1 lordosis, 2.5 degrees for the angle between the upper and lower end-plates of L5, and 1 mm for the height of the anterior rim; there was no difference in posterior rim height. Eight patients had the same values at the latest as at 3- month follow-up. Three patients with broken screws showed the loss of L4-S1 lordosis by 4 to 13 degrees (average, 9 degrees). Neither the angle between the upper and lower end-plates of L5, nor vertebral body height were changed. The narrowing of the spinal canal by vertebral body fragments ranged from 0 to 60 % (average, 35 %) of canal space. On admission, neurological findings were normal in two patients and involved nerve root syndrome in five patients. In four patients it was not possible to assess their neurological status. At he latest follow-up, ten patients were free from peripheral neurological lesions, one still had lumbar radicular syndrome, two patients reported mild or moderate lumbosacral pain and seven patients were without complaints. Subjective complaints could not be assessed in two patients because of their mental state. An early post-operative complication included wound dehiscence in one patient (9 %) and, in three patients, broken screws in S1 were recorded as late complications.Only a few references referring to a relatively low number of patients with L burst fractures treated by surgery were found in the literature. Most of the authors report limitations of reduction and good clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS The posterior instrumented spinal fusion of L5 alone is sufficient for the treatment of most L5 burst fractures. Early removal of the fixator is indicated in active patients. Often good clinical outcomes are in contradiction with radiological findings. The possibilities of spinal canal decompression by ligamentotaxis at this level of injury are limited. When significant spinal stenosis is present, laminectomy or hemilaminectomy is necessary to achieve decompression of the spinal canal.",

Six patients failed to come to the final follow-up at 5 years after surgery. Coxarthritis was the indication for primary surgery in the majority of the patients. The average age of the group, which comprised 20 men and 20 women, was 63 (50-75) years.At the end of 2007, 40 patients were evaluated at an average follow-up of 62.5 months. The patients' age, gender, body mass index, physical activity, diagnosis on which indication for surgery was based, size of each cementless component and intra- and post-operative complications were recorded. The objective outcome was assessed using the Harris Hip Score (HHS), signs of secondary stability were evaluated on radiographs at 3, 6 and 12 months, then at 3 and 5 years after the primary THR.The primary fixation of all components was always good. In the post-operative period there was no THR dislocation and no loosening of the polyethylene acetabular liner from the titanium shell. One patient suffered a periprosthetic fracture following a fall. At 5-year follow-up, no evidence of acetabular loosening was found one patient required polyethylene liner exchange for excessive wear. Thirty-eight stems were evaluated as stable, with three stems showing ingrowth of a fibrous intermediate layer. Only one femoral component was assessed as unstable with a suspected late haematogenous infection. The mean HHS value was 45.6 before THR and 90.3 at 5 years after the primary surgery. The results were excellent in 24, very good in 12, fair in two and poor in two patients.If the correct surgical procedure is observed, a perfect press-fit fixation of both components can always be achieved. The S.F. type implant can also be used for a dysplastic acetabulum in this case a deeper reaming of the acetabular bed in preferred to acetabular augmentation (acetabuloplasty). The excessive polyethylene wear in one patient can be accounted for by the patient's overdone daily exercise the imperfect secondary osteointegration of three stems was probably due to the selection of a smaller femoral component than it was appropriate. When an undersized stem is used, insufficient implant osteointegration and a higher incidence of pain symptoms should be expected. The findings of signs of stress shielding were in accordance with those reported in the literature. CONCLUSIONS The mid-term clinical results and evidence of good osteointegration of both components five years after primary implantation of the THR type S.F. in 40 patients are very satisfactory. This group of patients will be followed up for another 5 years and evaluated.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYDevelopmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a serious anatomical abnormality.The aims of the study were to compare the current views on general screening for DDH and, in a group of patients diagnosed for DDH both clinically and ultrasonographically, to analyse the results of their treatment with Wagner stockings. MATERIAL AND METHODSIn the years 2000 to 2001, a total of 3,221 children were examined at birth clinically and by ultrasonography using Graf's method.DDH was diagnosed in 137, and Wagner stockings were used for treatment in 127 patients.This Wagner abduction device consists of linen stockings buttoned to a linen baby shirt.It is based on the Pavlik harness treatment of DDH, and enables us to start therapy at neonatal age.The group was followed up, with checkups including clinical examination and AP radiography to evaluate position of the femoral head in relation to avascular necrosis (AVN) by the Salter method.The data obtained was statistically analysed by the SPSS software, version 14 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). RESULTSOut of the 127 children, 106 (95 girls and 11 boys) completed the treatment.In 87 (82 %) children with Wagner stockings only, the treatment took place for an average of 82 days (range, 28 to 167), with abduction therapy starting on average at 13 days (range, 1 to 76 days).In 19 (18 %) children it was necessary to continue abduction therapy and Wagner stockings were replaced by a Pavlik's harness.The total abduction treatment then lasted on average for 152 days (range, 81 to 289).After January 1, 2005, 75 children (follow-up rate, 70.7 %) were examined, 33 at regular checkups and the rest at invitation.The average follow-up was 5.9 (3.8-7.5)years.On two early radiograms with left-side findings, proximal femoral lesions met the Salter criteria of AVN diagnosis.The AVN rate was 2.6 % or 1.8 % when related to either the patients or the affected hips.At the latest follow-up even in these cases the radiographic findings were resolved. DISCUSSIONAt present there is no consensus concerning either screening of newborns for DDH or its early therapy.In the Czech Republic the general screening known as three-step examination of infant hips attained a legal frame by the Regulation issued by the Ministry of Health in 1977 and its amendment in 1996.In Austria the general clinical and ultrasonographic screening is regarded as the gold standard.On the other hand, some official bodies such as the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, American Academy of Pediatrics or Canadian Task Force do not recommend any general screening.The results of this retrospective study were compared with those of treatment with the Pavlik harness or Frejka pillow, which are both based on a passive mechanical mode of therapy.The comparison has shown that the treatment with Wagner stockings is highly effective and has a low AVN rate. CONCLUSIONThis retrospective study has shown that, in DDH, therapy with Wagner stockings is sufficient to provide for physiological development of the hip, while the AVN rate is very low.Early diagnosis and treatment related to general screening are both beneficial.Based on these results we recommend Wagner stockings as a useful aid in the treatment which is initiated early in infancy and is in agreement with the Pavlik method of functional DDH therapy.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY To evaluate the results of primary total hip replacement with the CLS acetabular cup at a minimum of 15 years of follow- up. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 105 patients, with 112 hips, undergoing hip arthroplasty with the use of CLS acetabular cup between 1991 and 1993 were evaluated. The group comprised of 33 men and 72 women with an average age of 51.3 years (range, 28 to 66) at the time of surgery. All patients received the CLS expansion cup with a polyethylene Sulen-type liner. Cemented femoral stems were used in 75 hips and uncemented CLS stems were implanted in 37 hips. Ceramic heads of the femoral component were used in 86 hips and metal heads were used in 26 hips. The clinical outcome was assessed by the Merle dAubignnd Postel score and the Harris hip score, and the radiological results were evaluated on anterior posterior X-ray films of the pelvis and the affected hip. RESULTS The average follow-up was 16.2 years (range, 15 to 17). The average Merle dAubignnd Postel score increased from 8.1 (range, 5.7 to 9.8) pre-operatively to 14.6 (range, 14.1 to 16.8) post-operatively. The average Harris hip score improved from 42 to 86 points (range, 71 to 99). The complications requiring revision arthroplasty included aseptic loosening in two hips, fracture of the CLS shell in three, dislocation in three and replacement of the liner due to high wear in two hips. The cumulative proportion of clinical survivorship with revision for any reason was 92 %. Fixation by bone ingrowth, assessed by the method of Engh et al. occurred in 98 cases, fibrous tissue fixation was found in ten hips. Unstable fixation was recorded in four hips (two with aseptic loosening and two with fracture of the shell). There were no signs of rarefaction of bone along acetabular shell in 98 hips. No noticeable migration was found in the stable cups. Only in ten cups from 112, polyethylene wear exceeded 4 mm. Cumulative probability of radiological survivorship of the CLS acetabular cup with any radiological sign of loosening was 86.6 %. DISCUSSION The causes of fracture of the CLS cup can be explained by insufficient bone support or bone resorption in the proximallateral part of the acetabulum in patients with developmental hip dysplasia, by low bone quality due to severe osteoporosis or by insufficient primary stability of the cup. The advantages of the CLS cup include removal of a small amout of bone and favourable force distribution in circumferential anchorage. The cup showed good osteointegration even in a bone of lower quality and with defects of the acetabular bottom. CONCLUSIONS The CLS acetabular cup shows good results at 16-year follow-up period. No increase in fractures of the shell, migration or radiolucent lines, or in bone rarefaction or osteolysis was recorded with time. The reliability of this implant has been recently increased with the use of cross-linked polyethylene (Durasul). Key words: primary total hip replacement, uncemented cup.",

    "abstract": "Bone overgrowth of the femur after fracture in childhood treated either conservatively or surgically is well documented. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of bone overgrowth in childhood fractures treated by elastic stable intramedullary nailing (ESIN), to evaluate it in relation to conservative treatment and to compare its presence in the youngest age categories.A total of 49 patients, age range 4 to 17 years, with femoral shaft fracture treated in our department by ESIN osteosynthesis between 2001 and 2005 were asked to appear for a follow-up not earlier than one year after the fracture had healed to be examined for the presence of bone overgrowth. The results were statistically analysed and compared with a group of 99 patients treated conservatively (CONS) between 1987 and 1997.In the ESIN group, femoral overgrowth ranging from 5 to 22 mm was found in 15 out of 49 patients. It was most frequent in children up to 6 years of age; with an increasing age overgrowth frequency decreased. In the CONS group, overgrowth was recorded in 30 out of 99 patients and ranged from 4 to 20 mm. Similarly to the ESIN group, it was most frequent in the youngest age category (up to 6 years). In relation to age categories, there were no significant differences in overgrowth values between surgical and conservative treatment.ESIN osteosynthesis is currently the most universal method of surgical treatment for long-bone fracture. Although it has undisputable benefits, it may also be associated with longitudinal femoral overgrowth. Children in youngest age categories are often not indicated for ESIN for the fear of bone overgrowth.The use of ESIN for treatment of femoral fractures in childhood is not associated with a higher risk of long-bone over- growth, as compared with conservative therapy. Moreover, the authors' experience shows that the method of retrograde insertion of osteosynthetic material is safe even in distal diaphyseal fractures and does not increase risk of bone over- growth.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe postoperative delirium is a frequent, oftentimes underestimated complication of total hip arthroplasty.Its occurrence is reported to be between 10% and 50%.The postoperative delirium increases mortality, the length of hospital stay and leads to worse functional results.Even though there is evidence of efficiency of preventive measures and effectiveness of treatment interventions, inadequate attention has been paid so far to this serious complication related to inpatient hospital care.This paper aimed to determine the incidence of cognitive function impairment in relation to the total hip replacement, to determine the influence of the defined parameters on changes in cognitive functions and to draft practice guidelines for the care of patients after a total hip replacement in the framework of prevention and early detection of changes in cognition of patients after total hip replacement. MATERIAL AND METHODSProspective observational descriptive study, the evaluated parameters included: type of anaesthesia, duration of surgical procedure (operation), type of analgesia, O2 saturation, haemoglobin levels, changes in the ionogram, body temperature, presence of concomitant diseases, polypragmasia, abuse, level of self-sufficiency of patients evaluated by ADL.In order to obtain the data, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS), Recall and naming test, and the Activities of Daily Living Test (ADL) were used.The monitored group of patients included a total of 116 persons, of whom 68 men and 48 women.The mean age was 71.16 years; the range from 65 to 86 years; median -72.36 years. RESULTSA statistically significant dependence was revealed between the change in cognitive functions and all the monitored parameters, except for the haemoglobin levels after 120 hours postoperatively, ion levels after 120 hours and sex by the 10-point Mini Mental Test score.A statistically significant dependence was revealed between the change in cognitive functions and 0 2 saturation, ion levels, elevated body temperature after 120 hours postoperatively, age, diabetes, polypragmasia and in correlation with the ADL 120 hours postoperatively by the MMSE test.A statistically significant dependence was revealed between the change in cognitive functions and all the monitored parameters, except for anaesthesia and analgesia, haemoglobin levels after 24 and 120 hours, ion levels after 120 hours, renal insufficiency and in correlation with the ADL after 24 hours by the \"Recall and naming\" test. DISCUSSIONThe correlation between delirium and long-term cognition impairment was described by several studies.Both the recent literature and our study clearly indicate a correlation between the postoperative cognitive impairment on the one hand and polypragmasia, age, presence of concomitant diseases on the other hand.In some parameters such as the sex of the patient its influence was not clearly established by the relevant literature or our study.The perioperative factors influencing the onset of delirium referred to in literature are anaesthesia and its duration.Our study reveals the correlation between the anaesthesia and the onset of cognitive impairment when evaluated by the Abbreviated Mental Test Score.As regards the monitored postoperative parameters, the influence of postoperative hyposaturation, decreased haemoglobin level, changes in ionogram, elevated body temperature, lower self-sufficiency of the patient was established.Also our study shows the correlation between the change in the aforementioned parameters and the cognitive impairment, even though not quite clearly in all the parameters.The most sensitive evaluation tool turned out to be the Abbreviated Mental Test Score. CONCLUSIONSOur study clearly showed that a highly sensitive test to detect the current changes in cognition in a short-term horizon is the Abbreviated Mental Test Score.Based on the statistically significant factors determining the onset of the change in cognition that we had revealed, we elaborated a clearly arranged scheme of identified risk factors and interventions for the prevention and early identification of the onset of changes in cognitive functions and potential delirium.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The purpose of the prospective randomised study was to assess the benefits of the platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) application during the anatomic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) for tendon graft healing. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 40 patients with an isolated rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament in the knee. The MRI findings on the tendon graft were evaluated at 6 months and 12 months after the surgery in a total of 33 patients, namely in 10 women/23 men (21 right knee/12 left knee), with the mean age of 29.1 years and at the mean follow-up of 15.9 weeks after the injury. The randomisation using envelopes was carried out at the beginning of arthroscopy either in the group with the PRF application (Group 1) (17 patients) or in the group without the PRF application (Group 2) (16 patients). The followed-up patients underwent the ACLR with targeting the femoral tunnel through anteromedial portal using the autografts of m. semitendinosusand m. graciliswith Tightrope femoral fixation and Inion implant in tibia. In Group 1, during the surgery PRF was applied both in the drilled tunnels (intraosseously) and directly to the surface of the tendon graft itself (intraarticular part). The Group 2 was a control group in which the same intervention was performed, however without the PRF application. In the 6 th and 12 th month after the surgery, the signal intensity of the knee and occurrence of the ACL graft failure, bone (marrow) oedema rate near the tunnels were assessed by an independent radiologist using a 3 Tesla MRI. RESULTS In the 6 th and also in the 12 th postoperative month, neither a complete, nor a partial graft failure was found in the group with PRF, whereas in Group 2 a complete or a partial graft failure was observed in 12.5% (p = 0.23). In the 6th month, a bone marrow oedema near the intraosseous parts of the graft was reported in 94.1% of patients in Group 1 and in 81.3% of patients in Group 2, while in the 12 th month it was 23.5% of evaluated patients in Group 1 and 37.5% patients in Group 2. The differences between the two groups were not statistically significant in the 6 th (p = 0.096) or in the 12 th month (p = 0.43). In the 6 th month, a fully ligamentised graft was found in 52.9% of patients in Group 1 and in 37.5% of patients in Group 2 (p = 0.061), a partially ligamentised graft was present in 47.1% of patients in Group 1 and in 50% of patients in Group 2. In the 12 th month, a fully ligamentised graft was seen in 94.1% of patients in Group 1 and in 75% of patients in Group 2 (p = 0.26) and a partially ligamentised graft was present in 5.9% of patients in Group 1 and in 12.5% of patients in Group 2. In the remaining 12.5% of patients in Group 2, the finding was assessed as a graft with no signs of ligamentisation. DISCUSSION We have not encountered a paper in the Czech or world literature which would present results of a similar study, i.e. which would evaluate the potential benefits of the platelet-rich fibrin application in the course of the anatomic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Majority of studies evaluate the benefits of the application of platelet-rich plasma aimed to achieve a positive effect on the LCA graft healing. CONCLUSIONS Our study proved a higher percentage of ligamentisation and healed grafts into the bone as well as a lower occurrence of graft failure in the group with PRF compared to the group without the PRF application, namely both in the 6 th and in the 12 th month. Nonetheless, the differences between the two groups assessed at the same time were not statistically significant.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY In recent years attempts have been made again to repair anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in order to maintain native kinematics and knee joint proprioception. The method of choice is the arthroscopic suture of the ligament using the InternalBrace ligament augmentation. This study presents the first experience gained with this surgical technique and the clinical outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the period from November 2016 to December 2018, a total of 46 patients with acute ACL rupture underwent the ACL repair using the InternalBrace ligament augmentation. This study includes only the patients followed up for a minimum period of 12 months postoperatively. For the evaluation of patients, the well-established clinical scores were used - the Tegner Activity Level Scale, the IKDC (International Knee Documentation Committee) subjective scale and the Tegner Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale. The measurements were taken preoperatively and at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. RESULTS The evaluations concerned 20 patients who had undergone surgery in the period from February 2017 to February 2018. In the aforementioned group of patients, there were 3 cases of reconstruction failure (15%), subsequently requiring the ACL reconstruction. The average preoperative Tegner Activity score was 8.2 (6-10; median 8.0). At six months postoperatively, the average value of this score was 7.35 (5-10; median 7), and at 12 months postoperatively it was 7.35 (4-10; median 7). The average preoperative Lysholm score was 66.4 (16-100; median 69). At six months postoperatively, the average value of this score improved to 90.70 (71-100; median 92) and at 12 months postoperatively to 91 (75-100; median 90). The average IKDC subjective score before the surgery was 49.8 (36-74; median 49). At six months postoperatively the average achieved score was 87.70 (71-99; median 90) and at 12 months postoperatively it was 88.9 (63-99; median 93). The differences between the preoperative values and the values at 6 months after the surgery were significant in all the followedup parameters. Conversely, the differences between the values at 6 and at 12 months were not significant. DISCUSSION The clinical outcomes of the patients after the ACL repair are valuable and comparable to the data published in literature. They were largely achieved within 6 months after the surgery. A fairly high percentage of failure of this method compared to literature (Jonkergouw 7.5%, McKay 1.5%) can partly be ascribed to the learning curve even though the surgeries were performed exclusively by experienced surgeons. A certain role could also be played by more challenging indication for this procedure or a faster return to postoperative load. CONCLUSIONS Anterior cruciate ligament suture with the InternalBrace ligament augmentation judging from the results achieved by our group of patients brings very good clinical outcomes already at 6 months postoperatively. This method allows the athletes to return to full load soon. It maintains the kinematics and knee joint proprioception, and thus can potentially contribute to the prevention of post-traumatic arthritis. Strict application of indication criteria is a precondition to success. A longer follow up and evaluation of a larger number of patients will, however, be necessary to definitely confirm the success of this surgical technique.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThere are several treatment options for bone tumors at diaphyseal/metadiaphyseal sites of long bones (with joint preservation) including massive intercalary allografts, autografts (vascularized or non-vascularized fibular autograft, devitalised tumor bearing bone), endoprosthetic replacement (intercalary spacer), cementoplasty with ostheosynthesis and distraction osteogenesis.Reconstruction using massive intercalary bone allografts is for us the method of choice in case of curable primary bone tumors at the diaphyseal/metadiaphyseal region.The purpose of this study is to evaluate our results and complications. MATERIAL AND METHODSOur retrospective study reviewed 41 patients after intercalary allograft reconstruction following the resection of primary bone tumors in the years 2000 -2014.The group consists of 27 men and 14 women with the mean age at the time of diagnosis 27 years and the mean follow-up (from primary surgery) was 7 years.The patients were diagnosed with the Ewing sarcoma ( 14), chondrosarcoma (9), osteosarcoma (8), adamantinoma (6), OFD-like adamantinoma (2) and aneurysmatic bone cyst (2).The site of tumor were tibia (18), femur (16), humerus (5), radius (1) and ulna (1).We retrospectively evaluated the results of this intercallary allograft reconstructions, the incidence of failures and complications as well as the role of risk factors. RESULTS14 patients (34.1%) successfully healed without complications.In the same number of patients (14 patients, 34.1%) the allograft reconstruction failed.7 of these patients underwent amputation (17.1%), 6 of whom for oncological complications (local recurrence) and only 1 for complications of the reconstruction (infection).Other 7 patients with an allograft-related failure were successfully treated with a limb salvage procedure and underwent a new reconstruction.The remaining 13 patients (31.7%) suffered from complications that did not result in a failure of the reconstruction.The major complications of the reconstruction were the non-union (53.7%), fractures and allograft resorption (14.6%) and infection (7.3%).By statistical evaluation of common risk factors a statistically significant relationship was found between uncomplicated healing and stable bridging osteosynthesis (p = 0.014), between allograft fractures/resorptions and non-bridging osteosynthesis (p = 0.018), and the lowest reoperation rate was connected with plate osteosynthesis (0.037). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONSThe intercalary allograft reconstruction is an important biological method in orthopaedic tumor surgery.Even though it is connected with a high rate of complications (non-union, fracture and resorption, infection), in the vast majority of cases they can be solved, while achieving limb-salvage and good function of extremity.The essential prerequisite for successful uncomplicated healing of reconstruction is the stable bridging osteosynthesis, preferably with a plate.In high risk patients with a combination of recognized important risk factors described in literature (adult patients, large resection (more than 15 cm), femoral location and aggressive oncological treatment) we nowadays try to reduce the complication rate with a primary combination of an allograft with vascularized fibular autograft.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYAlthough distal chevron osteotomy (DCO) is considered as an intrinsically stable osteotomy, various fixation methods have been used to date.The purpose of this study was comparison of two commonly used methods in DCO, Kirschner (K)-wire and titanium fully threaded headless cannulated screw fixation, based on the clinical and radiological results, and their complications. MATERIAL AND METHODSThirty patients were included in K-wire group and 36 patients were included in screw group.Mean age was 43.4 11.1 (rage; 19-65) years, and mean follow-up was 21.2 5.5 (range; 12-35) months.American Orthopaedic Foot Ankle Society (AOFAS) metatarsophalengeal-interphalangeal score was used for clinical evaluation.For radiological evaluation, hallux valgus angle (HVA), first-second intermetatarsal angle (IMA), distal metatarsal articular angle (DMAA), medial sesamoid grade (MSG), and lateral sesamoid distance (LSD) to mid-axis of the second metatarsal were measured for all patients on both preoperative and postoperative final follow-up radiographs. RESULTSMean AOFAS scores were significantly improved and radiographic measurements were significantly reduced at postoperatively in both groups (p < 0.01 for AOFAS, HVA, IMA, DMAA and MSG; p = 0.01 for LSD).Mean preoperative and mean postoperative, as well as the mean difference (difference between postoperative and preoperative) of the radiographic measurements, and AOFAS scores were not significantly different between two groups (p > 0.05).A total of 5 complications were observed (four in K-wire group, one in screw group).Complication rates between two groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.12). DISCUSSIONInitial description of DCO did not include any fixation material.Afterwards, the procedure was modified by using single K wire in order to enhance the stability of the osteotomy.Previous studies were unable to demonstrate significant differences between K-wire fixation and cortical or Herbert type screw fixation based on clinical and radiological outcomes.Differently, in this study we compared two K-wire fixation with 3.5-mm titanium fully threaded headless cannulated screw fixation.Our results demonstrated that function and radiological measurements significantly improved after both fixation methods.Despite the increased complication rate in K-wire group, it was not statistically significant.Moreover, none of the complications was associated with unstable osteotomy, and required re-operation. CONCLUSIONSBoth fixation methods provided comparable radiological and clinical outcomes with favourable results after DCO.",

    "abstract": "The authors report on three cases in which a custom-made 3D printed titanium acetabular component of total hip arthroplasty was used to manage an advanced acetabular bone defect with pelvic discontinuity.The implant surface structure impeded long-term bone integration.Nonetheless, the stable bridging of the acetabular defect resulted in full integration of impacted bone allografts at the base of the implant.The pelvic continuity was restored within 12 months after surgery, and thus the acetabulum was prepared for potential further implantation of a standard revision acetabular component.Only one of the three female patients underwent a revision surgery at 18 months after surgery, the other two female patients were satisfied to such a degree with the clinical outcome at 6 years and 5 years, respectively, after surgery that they refused to undertake the revision surgery, despite X-ray images showing signs of loosening of the custom-made titanium acetabular component.The authors concluded that the implantation technique of three-point fixed custom-made 3D printed acetabular component made of titanium combined with impaction grafting of the acetabular base is a good alternative in managing the advanced bone defects of acetabulum with pelvic discontinuity after the failure of total hip arthroplasty.Even though inadequate surface porosity of the thus produced component did not allow its permanent osteointegration, the assembly was stable enough to allow the bone allografts to rebuild and restore continuity of the pelvis and facilitated future implantation of the standard revision acetabular component.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSPatients who underwent surgery in our hospital for septic arthritis and acute osteomyelitis between 2011 and 2019 were retrospectively analyzed.Seventy-two of 96 patients were included in the study.The patients had documented joint swelling, redness, pain with joint movement and weight-bearing failure.Fever was assessed preoperatively.Sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, white blood cell count and the leukocyte count in aspiration material as well as complications were evaluated preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. RESULTSTwenty patients underwent surgery of the hip; 39 of the knee; 7 of the foot, ankle and distal tibia; 1 of the elbow; and 1 of the distal radius.Additionally, 4 patients had septic arthritis and acute osteomyelitis of the femur.The mean age of the patients was 7.8 years (1-16).The mean follow-up period was 16.2 months (3-42).Preoperative aspiration was performed in 44 of 72 patients.Thirty of 72 patients had positive cultures.No statistically significant difference in age, preoperative duration, C-reactive protein, sedimentation, white blood cell count, preoperative fever or complications was found when compared between patients with culture growth and those without reproduction (p > 0.05).There was a significant difference between the leukocyte count in the aspiration material (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONSPrediagnosis of septic arthritis or acute osteomyelitis in pediatric patients is important in terms of future joint health and sepsis.According to our findings an inability to obtain bacteria does not exclude septic arthritis as a diagnosis.Empirical antibiotic therapy with a wide postoperative spectrum is important for joint health in these patients.Preoperative serum parameters cannot predict the agent needed for treatment.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) can be considered a proven method for the treatment of the most severe shoulder joint affections. In this study, we present 14-year experiences of the authors with the LimaCorporate SMR® RSA system in 496 cases. MATERIAL AND METHODS Included in the study are 496 RSAs performed between 2007 and 2020. We successfully followed up 368 shoulders in 358 patients. This was a prospective study with function being evaluated preoperatively and at the last follow-up in 2020. We evaluated the range of motion in active elevation and the classic Constant Score (CS). According to this score, the pain level was also evaluated. Standard statistical methods were used with a paired t-test used for comparisons of values. RESULTS The mean follow-up in our group was 5.5 years (0.7-13.6, SD 3.22, median 4.96). Indications were: primary osteoarthritis (84), acute trauma (69), posttraumatic sequelae (79), cuff tear arthropathy (37), RA (29), chronic dislocations (18), final treatment of infectious complications (7), avascular necrosis (6), tumours (4) and TSA revisions (9). The mean post-operative CS of all patients was 71.9 (2-94, SD 11.26, median 73). The mean post-operative active elevation was 127.35° (30°-180°, SD 28.36, median 130°). The mean pain level at final follow-up was 0.65 (0-3, SD 0.65, median 1). There was a statistically significant improvement In the CS (26.9 to 71) and the final achieved elevation (48.5° to 127.35°) in all groups except acute traumas for obvious reasons. A significant decrease in pain (2.8 to 0.65) was observed in all groups. We saw no implant failures or UHMWPE component wear. DISCUSSION We compared our results with those published by other authors. When considering the functional outcomes, our results are comparable with those published previously. Compared to other studies, an interesting result is the low incidence of scapular notching. In our cohort of patients, it was only present in 10 (2.7%) cases. We attribute this to the design of the SMR® implant which meets the main criterium of a modern shoulder arthroplasty system: modularity of both glenoid components. The glenospheres are available in 36, 40 and 44mm sizes with standard and distalised options. Furthermore, the system also contains the Axioma® revision glenoid component. Humeral stems are available in a range of sizes and lengths including revision stems. The humeral body is also available in two sizes. The short variant is optimal for revision with hemiarthroplasty to reverse conversion. CONCLUSIONS During a period of 14 years, we performed 496 implantations of RSAs using the SMR® system. We evaluated 368 cases with an average follow-up of 5.5 years. During long-term follow-up we experienced no implant failures or complications indicative of any constructional insufficiencies. We saw no signs of UHMWPE liner wear. The SMR® system allows for treatment of even the most complex shoulder affections due to its high modularity.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYTo present the results of an independent mono-centric prospective study on patients with a mobile ProDisc-C implant.This cervical artificial disc replacement (CADR), which is one of the options for avoiding cervical spine fusion, was evaluated during twoyears follow-up. MATERIALA total of 61 patients underwent CADR with a ProDisc-C in one or two segments at the Department of Spinal Surgery of the University Hospital in Motol, Prague, in the period from October 2004 to May 2006.Of these, 39 were included in the study and followed up for 2 years at least.Except for one patient, one segment was replaced in all patients. METHODSThe surgical procedure recommended by the manufacturer (Synthes, USA) was used througout the study.Clinical evaluation.Each patient was examined before and immediately after surgery, and followed up at 6 and 12 weeks, and 6, 12 and 24 months.At each follow-up the patient answered the questionnaire which included the Neck Disability Index (NDI) and Visual Analoque Scale (VAS) assessment for neck and radicular pain, analgesic use and the patient's satisfaction.Radiographic examination.Radiographs were taken in antero-posterior and lateral projection, and on bending films in flexion, extension and lateral flexion on both sides.The height of the intervertebral space of the involved segment and motion of the replaced and adjacent discs in flexion and extension were measured.The radiographs were examined for potential sinking, loosening, failure or migration of the implant.Statistical evaluation.The results were statistically analysed using Student's t-test. RESULTSClinical outcome.The NDI evaluation showed that the mean value of the index improved from 44.9 pre-operatively to 26.1 and 25.9 at 1 and 2 years of follow-up, respectively, i.e. by 42.5 % in two years.The mean VAS score for neck pain changed from 5.8 pre-operatively to 3.0 and 2.7 at post-operative years 1 and 2, respectively, which is an improvement by 53.7 % in two years.The mean VAS score for radicular pain improved from 6.3 to 2.9 and 2.8 at the same intervals, which is an improvement by 53.9 % in two years.Radiographic findings.The mean height of the afected intervertebral space was 3.2 mm before and 7.4 mm after surgery and it did not change significantly thereafter.The mean range of motion at the involved segment was 4.1 degrees before and 11.1 degrees after surgery.Statistical evaluation.In assessment of both neck and radicular pain, the difference between the mean VAS score pre-operatively and that 6 weeks post-operatively was significant (t = 4.4 and t = 5.3, respectively; p < 0.05).The difference in mean VAS scores between 6 weeks and 3 months post-operatively was not significant (t = 1.69 and t = 0.3, respectively; p > 0.05).At the next follow-ups the mean VAS scores changed only minimally and the differences were not significant.The difference between the mean NDI before and that at 6 weeks after surgery was significant (t = 11; p < 0.05) and significant was also the difference between 6 weeks and 3 months after surgery (t = 3.8; p < 0.05).After that changes were minimal and were not significant. DISCUSSIONCurrently, mobile implants are in the focus of interest amongst spinal specialists, their materials and shapes, primary implant stability, the centre of rotation, indications for replacement and correct operative techniques being discussed.The situation appears similar to that of 20 years ago when large joint replacement was being introduced, and it is the future that will show the right development. CONCLUSIONSThis two-year prospective study on patients with CADR shows very good and promising outcomes.It is evident that the implant increases the range of motion at the treated segment and reduces degenerative changes in the adjacent intervertebral spaces.On the other hand, CADR is associated with complications such as artificial disc kyphosis and heterotopic ossifications.An unequivocal requirement for a correct indication and a faultless operative technique was the conclusion drawn from a detailed analysis.",

    "abstract": "Femoral bone lysis in total hip arthroplasty is thought to be primarily due to polyethylene or metal debris arising from the femoral or acetabular components. The debris appears to gradually seep into the cement/ bone interface, eventually generating the chemical reaction that produces lysis.We experimented with a surgical technique that attempts to construct a proximal bony barrier preventing migration of debris. Following the injection of the acrylic cement and the insertion of the femoral component, but prior to complete polymerization of the cement, bone chips are pressed over the cement, in contact with the viable femoral cortex. The bone chips become rigidly fixed; probably regain viability from the femoral cortex, and seal the proximal femur. In this manner, debris cannot travel into the femoral canal. Although we do not have anatomical evidence that a viable bony seal has formed the absence of lysis and bone/cement radiolucent lines over a period of time ranging from three to fourteen years suggests the permanent presence of a physiological barrier. Attempts to identify the permanency of the bony seal by means of CT scans proved inconclusive. Key words: total hips, lysis, femoral lysis, cortical graft.",

    "abstract": "Many hind foot problems can be treated by endoscopic procedures. It is essential to identify the best candidates for this treatment and also to assess the risk associated with these surgeries. Here we present our first experience with posterior ankle arthroscopy.Between September 2007 and September 2009, we performed 21 arthroscopic procedures on the posterior ankle (one-stage combined anterior and posterior surgery, 11x; posterior procedure, 7x; two-stage anterior and posterior surgery, 3x). The group included 21 patients, 18 men and three women, with an average age of 36 years (20 to 64) at the time of surgery. The average follow-up was 27 months (16 to 38). Both posterolateral and posteromedial approaches were used, with major landmarks being the processus posterior tali, posterior talofibular ligament and long flexor tendon of the big toe. Surgery was performed by experienced specialists. Outcome evaluation was based on the AOFAS and Kitaoka clinical rating scales and the complication rate.In our group, the diagnoses treated by arthroscopic surgery were as follows: arthrofibrosis (16x; 76 %), hypertrophic processus posterior tali (13x; 62 %), and loose intra-articular bodies (8x; 38 %). All patients reported improvement in clinical condition after surgery. The differences between the mean pre- and post-operative values were 24 points for the AOFAS score (58 versus 82; p<0.00015) and 23 points for the Kitaoka score (58 versus 81; p < 0.00015). The most effective outcomes were achieved in the patients operated on for loose bodies or hypertrophic processus posterior tali. The worst result was found in the patient with advanced arthritis of the ankle that had to undergo arthrodesis 13 months following arthroscopic treatment. There were eight complications in five patients (24 %), including excessive bleeding in five cases, temporary loss of sensation in two, and a damaged tendon of the long flexor of the big toe.Arthroscopic surgery has recently been advocated by many authors. The majority of them have reported good results and an acceptable risk of complications. Almost all use either the posteromedial or the lateral approach, which are anatomically safe procedures. Surgery is followed by a thorough rehabilitation programme that allows most patients to resume their normal daily activities in 8 weeks. Our results were not so good because we mostly treated post-traumatic conditions, with advanced ankle arthritis in several patients.Arthroscopy is an effective method for treating both intra- and extra-articular pathologies in the posterior ankle. The best effect of treatment was recorded in posterior tibiotalar impingement syndrome or after extraction of loose intra-articular bodies. In advanced ankle arthritis, on the other hand, the use of arthroscopic treatment should be carefully considered. The risk of complications is high and the procedure requires good knowledge of anatomy and high surgical skills.",

    "abstract": "Iatrogenic injuries to blood vessels in joint replacement surgery are rare events that occur as few per thousand.However, their sequelae are serious.The patient may either bleed to death, because vascular injury is not obvious and therefore difficult to diagnose, or lose the limb due to ischaemia.The highest risk of vascular injury is associated with repeat surgery and loosening of the acetabular component.We distinguish sharp and blunt force injuries.The former are caused by implants, sharp instruments, bone fragments or bone cement debris.The latter arise from stretching over a part of implanted material.Bleeding can be inapparent or apparent.Inapparent bleeding is difficult to diagnose and is recognized from the dynamics of blood losses.Haemodynamic instability or, in a worse case, even hypovolaemic shock may be the only signs of bleeding.Occlusion of an artery is manifested by limb ischaemia.The seriousness and progression of ischaemia depends on the rate of arterial occlusion, potential pathways for collateral circulation and the degree of atherosclerotic vascular disease.The patient with conduction anaesthesia does not feel pain and therefore the diagnosis must primarily be based on arterial pulsation in the limb and its skin colour.A pseudoaneurysm can develop due to a partially weakened vascular wall and its rupture is a life-threatening complication.Its presence is recognized as a pulsating mass in the groin.An arteriovenous fistula which arises from traumatic communication between the two vessels may lead to cardiac failure.The diagnosis is based on examination by sonography and digital subtraction angiography.The results of CT angiography and MR angiography are difficult to evaluate because of the presence of metal implants.In apparent bleeding it is sometimes difficult to locate the source.It is recommended to perform digital compression and gain access to the vessels from the extraperitoneal approach.When an expanding haematoma or ischaemia is present, the artery can be treated by surgical exploration or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.A possibility of vascular injury should be taken into account particularly in revision arthroplasty.To check blood flow in the limb before surgery is advisable.If the procedure entails a significant risk of post-operative complications, a vascular surgeon should be available.In the case of acute intra-operative bleeding, the source should be localised as soon as possible, the site compressed and an expert assistance called in.When the source is not obvious, it should not be attempted to apply vascular clamps or clips at random; this may do even more damage to the vessel.",

    "abstract": "Total elbow arthroplasty is associated with a higher occurrence of complications than is usual for large-joint replacements. Two kinds of prostheses, unconstrained and semi-constrained, are currently used and each has its supporters or opponents. In this study the results of the two techniques used in our patients are evaluated and compared.Two groups of elbows in patients with rheumatoid arthritis were evaluated. One comprised 58 elbows treated by Souter-Strathclyde total elbow arthroplasty (S-S group). The mean age of the patients at the time of surgery was 53 years (range, 22 to 71) and the mean follow-up was 9.5 years (range, 0.7 to 16.7). The other group included 63 elbows treated by Coonrad-Morrey elbow arthroplasty (C-M group). The mean age of the patients at the time of surgery was 54 years (range, 26 to 75) and the mean follow-up was 4.21 years (range, 0.28 to 7.87).The Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate implant survival in each group. Clinical assessment included range of motion and pain experience. The Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) was used as a clinical rating scale for the whole group. Radiographs were taken in two basic projections. The elbows with an implant removed or re-implanted were excluded from the evaluation. The patients were studied prospectively. The results were statistically analysed, with the level of significance set at 0.05.All patients experienced pain relief after surgery. In the S-S group, 35 elbows were free from pain (77.7 %), in the C-M group this was 53 elbows (88.3 %). The range of motion improved after arthroplasty in both groups. Flexion more than 110° was achieved in twice as many elbows in the C-M group than in the S-S group. Flexion contracture in the S-S group did not improve significantly. MEPS values after surgery improved in both groups, with significantly better results in the C-M group. In the S-S group, four elbow arthroplasties (6.9 %) showed instability, which was treated by replacement with a semi-constrained implant in one case and managed by articulated external fixation of the elbow for 6 weeks in three cases. Radiolucent lines were detected in five replacements (11.1 %) along the whole ulnar component width, in 12 (26.6 %) in the olecranon region and in 14 (31.1 %) in the distal humeral component. In the C-M group no radiolucency was recorded around the component. In the S-S group, revision surgery was carried out in 13 arthroplasties (22.4 %); of these, 10 (17.2%) were due to aseptic loosening, one (1.7 %) due to instability and one (1.7%) because of deep infection. In the C-M group, three elbows required revision (4.8 %), one for periprosthetic fracture (1.6 %) and two for deep infection (3.2 %). The results of survival analysis did not differ between the two groups.The weak point of Souter-Strathclyde total elbow arthroplasty is the ulnar component whose impairment and subsequent wear are involved in all cases of aseptic loosening. An insufficient length of the humeral component is another risk factor. Even natural movements of the elbow joint produce concentration of stresses on a small surface; this gradually weakens component fixation in bone and results in aseptic loosening. A higher risk of failure in Coonrad-Morrey elbow arthroplasty is associated with polyethylene lining of the hinge mechanism.The Coonrad-Morrey total elbow replacement is at present considered the method of choice. It is easier to perform and provides better functional outcomes than the Souter-Strathclyde elbow implant.",

The range of motion (ROM) of both the injured and the contralateral hand was recorded and evaluated with a modified Geldmacher scoring system; a response to the DASH questionnaire was obtained. The mean follow-up was 24 months (19-31 months).For the ROM of the operated hand, the mean Total Active Motion (TAM) of 98.75 degrees (60-140, SD 22.74) was calculated. The mean extension lag at the interphalangeal (IP) joint was 5.42 degrees (0-25, SD 8.77) and the mean IP flexion was 65.8 degrees (40-80, SD 13.2). In order to evaluate body side differences, the ROM of the contralateral thumb was recorded. The values were as follows: mean TAM, 141.3 degrees (115-190, SD 20.43); mean IP extension lag, 0 degrees (0-0, SD 0); mean IP flexion, 68.8 degrees (50-80, SD 9.6).The extension lag at the IP joint was detected in both the operated and the contralateral hands. The patients examined at a longer interval after surgery showed an increase in extension lag. This may have been caused by undesired adaptation of the donor muscle, the presence of adhesions or suture loosening.The results showed increased adaptation of thumb motion to the extension lag at the IP joint, which had a mild effect on the patient's hand function. The difference in wrist extension between the operated and the contralateral hand corresponded to the pre-operative condition.",

    "abstract": "Injuries to the upper cervical spine in children are rare and account for 0.6 to 9.5% of all cervical spine injuries. We present a detailed analysis of the children and adolescents with unstable upper cervical spine injuries treated at our spinal centre.During 16 years of follow-up, unstable injury to the upper cervical spine was recorded in 23 children and adolescents. Two patients (8.7%) were treated conservatively and 21 (91.3%) underwent surgery. The patients were allocated by age to three groups: 0-9 year, 10-14 year and 15-18 year categories. Twenty patients were seen at the final clinical and radiographic follow-up. One patient died at 62 months after surgery and two patients unfit for transport were evaluated on the basis of mailed interviews. The interval between injury and final evaluation ranged from 6 to 137 months, with an average of 53.4 months.The patients treated conservatively first wore a Philadelphia collar, then a custom-made brace, and eventually a soft Schanze cervical collar to finish the healing process. Application of a halo vest was considered a surgical procedure and was used only in very small children. In unstable odontoid fractures, direct osteosynthesis with two cannulated titanium screws was performed from the anterior approach in older children while, in small children, transoral or submandibular retropharyngeal decompression to treat spinal stenosis caused by bone fragments was carried out and a halo vest was applied. Hangman's fractures were treated by anterior cervical discectomy, fusion with bone graft and anterior plate fixation. The other types of unstable fractures were managed from the posterior approach by occipitocervical fixation, atlantoaxial fixation or instrumented fusion extended caudally. The patients characteristics included gender, age, mechanism of injury, type of injury, neurological findings, type of therapy or surgery, complications and treatment outcome. Neurological status was evaluated using the Frankel classification.The patient group comprised 14 boys (60.9%) and nine girls (39.1%), which gave a gender ratio of 3 : 2. The age of patients at injury ranged from 2 to 18 years, with an average of 11 years and 6 months. The most frequent injuries included rotational or vertical atlantoaxial dislocation in eight (34.8%) and odontoid fractures in seven (30.4%) patients; atlas fracture was recorded in three (13.0%) and hangman's fracture also in three (13.0%) patients; occipitocervical displacement was found in one (4.3%) and complex atlantoaxial fracture also in one patient (4.3%). At the time of injury, 17 patients (73.9%) had no neurological deficit (Frankel grade E), three had Frankel grade A (one paraplegic with a concomitant T5 spinal cord injury) and three had Frankel grade D neurological deficits. Of the six patients with neurological deficit, two showed improvement by one or two Frankel grades. The method of dorsal atlantoaxial fixation was used in eight patients (Magerl fixation in 2 and Harms method in 6). Direct osteosynthesis of an odontoid fracture was performed in four patients, halo fixation was applied in four, C2-C3 discectomy with tricortical bone grafting and plating was carried out in three, occipitocervical fixation was used in three patients, and direct atlas osteosynthesis, simple decompression and simple non-instrumented dorsal spondylodesis each was performed in one patient. Neither intra-operative complications nor post-operative complications related to the surgical technique were recorded. Osteoarthritis or bone non-union, as late post-operative complications, were found in two patients. All other patients showed bone healing by first intention in the desired extent. Superficial or deep wound infections were not recorded.In the first age category, the number of boys and girls with injuries to the upper cervical spine was equal while, in the third one, the boys outnumbered the girls more than twice. Of the 23 patients, 91.3% were surgically treated; the anterior approach was used in approximately one third of the patients and the posterior approach in the rest of them. The high number of surgical interventions is due to the fact that the most serious paediatric spinal injuries are referred to our centre.1. Injuries to the upper cervical spine are most frequently found in the youngest children and in adolescents who, however, frequently have injury also to the lower cervical spine. 2. Neurological deficit is relatively frequent but has a better prognosis than in adults. The youngest children with mild deficits have the best prognosis. 3. The mortality rate in young children with upper cervical spine injuries is evidently high, mostly due to associated head, chest and abdomen trauma 4. Therapy, particularly in small children, is strictly individual.",

    "abstract": "Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is more sensitive for the detection of injury to the thoracic wall and intra-thoracic organs than a plain chest radiograph. The chest wall deformity and instability following multiple rib fracture involves fractures of four or more adjacent ribs at two levels, sometimes including a sternal fracture. It may also be associated with lung trauma (pneumothorax, haemothorax, rupture, laceration or pulmonary contussion). An isolated multiple-rib fracture can successfully be treated conservatively. Early intubation and mechanical ventilation are indicated in patients with progressive respiratory insufficiency. Indications for surgical stabilisation of this fracture are based on the signs of respiratory failure and the results of imagining methods (MDCT at the present time).Examination by MDCT was carried out in patients with severe thoracic trauma. In five patients with multiple rib fractures, the CT findings were included in indication criteria for open rib osteosynthesis and thoracotomy. A clinical indication criterion was respiratory insufficiency after the patient's weaning from a ventilator, manifested by paradoxical chest motion. A radiographic indication included an extensive chest deformity with rib displacement into the pleural cavity in 3D reconstruction from MDCT images. Surgery was performed within one hour to five days of admission. Access was gained through an oblique skin incision and by cutting though the chest wall muscles to release fractured ribs. To explore the thoracic cavity, a defect in the intercostal muscles was extended by an incision at the site of rib fracture. Suction of a haemothorax was done and lung ruptures were sutured in three patients. After chest drain insertion, the fractured ribs were stabilized by plate osteosynthesis (fy Medin).In the post-operative period, mechanical ventilation was continued for 3 to 6 days in four patients. There were no complications. In the patients with flail chest, the 3D reconstruction from MDCT images allowed us to make more exact pre- operative decisions concerning the extent of rib osteosynthesis and the method of exposure. If lung injury was also shown, this was an indication for thoracic cavity exploration.The pathophysiological effects of flail chest involve several factors including the size of a flail segment, change in intra-thoracic pressure during spontaneous breathing and multiple injuries to the intra-thoracic organs. Therapy is related to the seriousness of respiratory disorder associated with flail chest, the degree of chest wall deformity and other complications of conservative treatment (dependence on mechanical ventilation with no possibility of weaning). Surgical stabilization of the chest wall is the most reliable method of treatment which allows us to avoid or interrupt the adverse effect of rib displacement and chest instability. A contribution of MDCT examination to the indication for surgical stabilization lies in that MDCT provides imagining of the details decisive for the classification of fracture types including their tendency to displacement. MDCT permits a better visualisation of chest injury and a better understanding of the respiratory disorder.Based on 3D reconstruction from MDCT images, it is possible to make the pre-operative considerations for rib osteo- synthesis more specific and to choose the best approach. At the same time MDCT enables us to diagnose associated intra-thoracic injuries and provides indications for their treatment. In addition, it gives us a possibility to evaluate the role of a flail segment in breathing dysfunction and to establish indications for surgical stabilization in multiple rib fractures. Rib osteosynthesis allowed for early stabilization of the chest wall and improved the mechanics of breathing, thus requiring a shorter period of mechanical ventilation. The evaluation of statistical significance of these facts will be made when a larger group of patients examined by MDCT is available.",

Here we report the case of an 82-year-old women who underwent primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for advanced primary grade III gonarthrosis. At 3 post-operative months the joint was stable and painless, with radiographic evidence of good TKA alignment and integration. At 4 months the patient suffered injury to the ankle involving a bimalleolar fracture and damage to knee soft tissues. The fracture was surgically treated. Subsequently, dorsal tibial dislocation was manifested. This was managed by individual intramedullary nail arthrodesis. At 8 months following the operation, the knee condition was satisfactory, with rigid arthrodesis and leg shortening of 4 cm. The patient was satisfied because she was free of pain and able to walk. Arthrodesis of the knee joint with an individual nail is an option for a definitive treatment of TKA instability. When other joints, such as ankle or hip joints, are injured, it is recommended to pay attention also to any TKA implanted previously because of potential development of instability or infection.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to assess the clinical outcomes and permanent sequelae of pelvic fractures at one year after injury and to identify factors that influenced these results.The group evaluated consisted of 151 patients older than 15 years treated for pelvic fractures in 2007 at seven hospitals in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. This one-year descriptive prospective study included all basic epidemiological data concerning the patients and the evaluation of their clinical results using the Majeed score. The obtained data were statistically analysed by the 2% test of independence and contingency tables at a 5% level of significance. For data obtained at a low frequency, only descriptive statistical methods were used.From the original group of 237 patients (101 women and 136 men), 16 died (7 women and 9 men) and 70 were lost for follow-up (28 women and 42 men), leaving 151 patients (64%) for evaluation. This final group comprised 66 women (44%) and 85 men (56%) with the age range of 16 to 82 and an average age of 42.7 years (women, 45.3 years; men, 40.7 years). Age distribution, causes of injury, types of pelvic fracture, associated injuries and methods of treatment in this group were similar to those in the original group. The clinical outcomes evaluated using the pelvic Majeed score were excellent and good in 85%, fair in 12% and poor in 3% of the patients. The prediction of clinical outcome was more accurate when based on the extent of dislocation of the dorsal segment after fracture healing than on the type of pelvic fracture The permanent sequelae were recorded in 22 patients (15%) and a total of 43 specific complaints were identified; some patients had multiple sequelae involving neurological, urological and sexual problems. Neurological deficit was related to the type of pelvic injury and its highest occurrence was associated with type C pelvic fractures. Permanent neurological deficits were found in 15 patients (10% of patients in the final group), of whom 10 were diagnosed early after injury as having neurological lesions (7% of the final group) and in five the diagnosis was made after surgery (8 %of surgically treated patients). Fifteen permanent urological disorders were recorded in 13 patients and they also were most frequent in type C fractures. However, they were more strongly associated with primary urethral injury and primary or post-operative neu-rogenic lesions. Sexual sequelae were also found in association with type C fractures; almost all patients with these problems had injury to the lower urinary tract or neurogenic lesions. Permanent gastrointestinal sequelae were in three patients; all of them sustained unstable pelvic fractures and were diagnosed with post-operative neurogenic lesions.Based on the evaluation of basic patient data, the patient group described here can be regarded as a representative sample of the originally treated patients. Therefore, in the authors' view, the results presented here can be taken as valid. In agreement with other authors, the study recorded poorer clinical outcomes in the patients with more serious types of pelvic injury, and dramatically worse results in relation to the extent of dislocation of the dorsal segment after the pelvic fracture had healed. The authors confirmed that permanent neurological and urological sequelae occur more frequently in patients with a more serious pelvic injury. Urological and sexual problems were more often associated with the presence of neurologi- cal deficit than with the type of pelvic fracture and injury to the lower urinary tract.The evaluation of patient data at one year after pelvic injury in this prospective longitudinal study justify the authors to draw the following conclusions: clinical outcomes were worse in unstable pelvic fractures; worse clinical results were related to the extent of residual dislocation of the dorsal pelvic segment; permanent neurological sequelae were most frequent and were perceived by the patients with strong negative feelings particularly when they manifested clinically after surgery; permanent urological, sexual and gastrointestinal problems were more closely associated with neurological deficits than with the severity of primary injury to the pelvic skeleton, lower urinary tract, sexual organs or digestive system.",

CONCLUSIONTransplantation of a composite scaffold seeded with mesenchymal stem cells and chondrocytes into a physeal defect following bone bridge excision prevented growth disturbance and angular deformity development in the distal femoral epiphysis.In comparison with the control group, it resulted in a more frequent production of a tissue similar to hyaline cartilage, with a cell formation reminiscent of a typical columnar arrangement of the growth plate.",

    "abstract": "Type B3 thoracic and lumbar fractures are often found in spines with previous hyperossification processes such as ankylosing spondylarthritis (AS) or diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH). They occur most frequently due to high-energy trauma in a healthy spine and as fall-related domestic injury in a spine affected by hyperossification. Generally, they are less frequent than type B3 cervical spine fractures. In this retrospective study involving two centres, the incidence of these fractures, their characterisation, therapy and complications associated with them were investigated.Between March 2003 and March 2012, 21 patients with type B3 injuries (Magerl classification) were treated in our centres. The thoracic spine was involved in 14 and the lumbar spine in seven patients. The patients' average age was 61.8 years, with a range of 33 to 87 years. There were three women and 18 men. Six fractures occurred in previously healthy spines, five and 10 were in AS- and DISH-affected spines, respectively. The evaluation included the mechanism of injury, patient's weight and height, neurological findings, type of treatment and its result, outcome after treatment termination, complications and associated diseases and injuries.The mechanism of injury differed between the healthy and disease-affected spines. All five AS patients suffered low-energy fractures while patients with previously healthy spines had high-energy injuries. The DISH patients had both low- and high-energy fractures. Type B3.1.1 fractures were diagnosed in two AS patients and six DISH patients, and in no previously healthy patient. Type B3.1.2 fractures were found in one AS patient, two DISH patients and one previously healthy patient. Type B3.2 fracture occurred in one patient with a previously healthy spine, in two AS and two DISH patients. Type B3.3 fractures were in four patients with previously healthy spines. Neurological deficit was found in five injured patients, four of whom had complete paraplegia (Frankel grade A) which did not improve. One AS patient in whom the spinal fracture was associated with Frankel grade C injury improved to Frankel D after surgery. All patients had an elevated BMI, ranging from 25.1 to 41.9; the average value was 32.2, which is within grade 1 obesity. Associated injuries were found in 11 patients, mostly in those with high-energy trauma. Seventeen patients were treated surgically, four conservatively. Posterior stabilisation was carried out in 10 patients who had either AS or DISH conditions; seven patients had a short spinal stabilisation. Complications included early infection in two patients, cerebrospinal fluid fistula in one, urinary tract infection in one and confused state of mind in two patients. All patients healed well but for one patient who died at 4 months after injury due to multiple complications.In the majority of relevant publications these injuries are reported in patients suffering from hyperossification disorders such as AS or DISH. In patients with healthy spines they occur less frequently and the traumatic hyperextension mechanism must have great intensity. Fractures of a hyperossified spine are related to obesity and this was also confirmed by our study in which all patients were overweight or obese. This factor plays an important role in the hyperextension mechanism that produces a sudden overcoming of the resistance of a spinal segment to force, resulting in a type B3 fracture.A different approach to these fractures is required in comparison with other spinal fractures. Type B3 fractures have some features common with type C fractures and are frequent in spines affected by spinal disease. In hyperossification disorders, paradoxically associated with advanced osteoporosis, fracture treatment requires long instrumentation. In healthy spines, fractures are treated with short instrumentation. In AS and DISH patients, the diagnosis may be delayed because these patients suffer from chronic spine pain and the pain due to fracture may be attributed to an accelerated chronic condition.",

Get to know the fractureStandardized conventional X-rays of the affected shoulder are the first diagnostic step.The trauma-series after Neer includes three plains (AP, axial and Y-scapula-view), with the axial view not being possible in some patients because of pain (abduction of the shoulder is required).However, conventional X-rays are not always enough for fracture analysis (32), and an additional CT-scan is needed.The possibility of multiplanar reconstructions, including 3D views, (Fig. 1), that are freely rotatable facilitate the identification of the number and degree of displacement of all fragments (22).Although the CT-scan provides necessary information Treatment of Geriatric Proximal Humerus Fractures",

    "abstract": "The absence of active knee extension in cerebral palsy patients is often due to elevation of the patellar ligament causing the patella to run outside the intercondylar groove. Distal patellar realignment can be achieved by either patellar ligament shortening or transposition of the patellar ligament distally.In the 1992-2008 period we indicated 95 knees for the distal realignment procedure involving a bone block in children 12 to 18 years old, and 46 knees in children aged between 8 and 16 years for shortening of the patellar ligament using the method of rafage in the early period, and modified plication from 2003.Clinical and radiographic findings were evaluated pre-operatively and at 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year after surgery. In the cases treated by patellar ligament shortening, the Insall-Salvati index was assessed post-operatively. Physical examination included local findings and the patient's ability to change locomotion.Improved locomotion and maintenance of knee extension during standing and walking were recorded in 89 of the 95 knees with distal patellar realignment (93.68%) and in 40 of the 46 kness with patellar ligament shortening (86.96%).Distal realignment of the patellar ligament or its shortening should be indicated as a follow-up treatment after muscular balance has been gained at persistent knee joint flexion during standing and walking, and the inability of active extension. The distal realignment procedure with a bone block should be indicated only after growth cessation because otherwise genu recurvatum may develop. Concurrently with this procedure, it is necessary to carry out distal realignment of the proximal ligament of the rectus femoris muscle.Shortening of the patellar ligament using modified plication or its distal realignment involving a bone block are two options for the treatment of patella alta that is indicated in the absence of active knee extension in cerebral palsy patients.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The alloplastic materials currently used for protective surface layers on implants were tested in vitro under microbiological laboratory conditions by contamination with microbial agents most frequently found in deep infection of total joint replacements. The objective was to find out how the resistance to bacterial colonisation was related to different surface finishes. MATERIAL AND METHODS Each of 14 samples of alloplastic material currently used in the manufacture of orthopaedic implants was inoculated with each of the group of microorganisms most frequently infecting joint replacements; these were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. At 24 hours of incubation, biofilms produced on sample surfaces were collected, stained with crystalline violet and assessed by spectrophotometry. The average value of biofilm absorbances (AV595) for the group of microorganism tested was taken as a basic characteristic of each material sample indicating its sensitivity to bacterial. RESULTS Of the metal materials with smooth surface finish, Vitalium (AV595, 0.368) showed the lowest affinity to microbial colonisation; next was titanium (AV595, 0.459) and steel (AV595, 0.505). A significant increase in sensitivity to bacterial colonisation was recorded in all types of surface finish of steel (AV595, 0.571) and in titanium alloy with a rough surface texture (AV595, 0.737 to 1.676); p < 0.05. Porous titanium surfaces significantly increased material affinity to colonisation. DISCUSSION Our study had certain limitations concerning in vitro evaluation of porous surfaces that have high affinity to bacterial colonisation. Porous titanium, and its hydroxyapatite layer in particular, considerably promotes osteoblast colonisation of the surface as well as implant osseointegration in the bone bed. Microorganisms therefore have no room for surface colonisation. Problematic may remain the surface parts outside contact with bone that keep their affinity to bacterial colonisation. CONCLUSIONS The material of choice for cemented implants is Vitalium which, of all metal surfaces, has the lowest sensitivity to bacterial colonisation. The materials of choice for cementless implants are titanium alloys. However, an osteoactive surface not in contact with bone remains a problem. On the one hand, its roughness and porosity are crucial to good osseointegration, on the other hand, its affinity to bacterial colonisation is high.alloplastic material, biofilm, joint replacement infection.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Evaluation of short-term functional results in patients undergoing one-stage surgery involving sequential bilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and comparison with the results of patients after unilateral TKA. MATERIAL AND METHODS The group with bilateral TKA consisted of 171 patients with 342 total knee replacements treated between 2009 and 2013. The control group included 50 patients with 50 TKAs operated on in the years 2010 to 2012. The indications to bilateral knee replacement included bilateral gonarthrosis, grade III or more in patients who were in good health and had a stable knee joint with axis deviation up to 20 degrees. A cemented TKA was used and the posterior cruciate ligament was preserved. Assessment of functional results was based on the Womac score, Knee Society Score (KSS 1, 2) range of motion and presence of specific complications in both groups. The follow-up lasted three years. RESULTS The average results in the bilateral vs the control group were as follows: the Womac score, 39.4/42.2 pre-operatively, 87.2/71.0 at 3 years; KSS 1, 48.5 / 44.8 pre-operatively, 87.4 / 79.9 at 3 years; KSS 2, 44.1 / 50.6 pre-operatively, 86.1 / 72.8 at 3 years; motion-flexion, 105.2° / 105.7° preoperatively, 114.0° / 100.2° at 3 years. In the bilateral group, infection was recorded in one patient. DISCUSSION Bilateral total knee replacement is a controversial issue. A higher risk of non-specific complications has been reported. Functional outcomes are good. The key problem is to set the correct indication to this procedure after an individual assessment of the patient's general health condition and the state of his/her knee joints. CONCLUSIONS The patients undergoing bilateral TKA at one-stage surgery showed functional results comparable (range of motion was even better) with the results of the unilateral TKA group. The number of specific complications was low. Every patient should be carefully assessed. Key words: total knee arthroplasty, bilateral implantation, functional results.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to provide a method of measurement and data collection, based on morphologic analysis of the proximal humerus, that would facilitate precise placement of the humeral stem and would be easy to apply in clinical medicine in patients requiring shoulder arthroplasty.Three groups of materials were used. Materials for the first and second groups were provided by the Department of Anatomy, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University. The first group included 10 specimens (five left and five right humeral bones) obtained at routine anatomical dissection. The second group contained 110 so-called dry preparations from the collections of the Department of Anatomy and the third group comprised nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) scans of 20 patients. To show spatial relationships between the proximal and the distal humerus, another coil was applied to the epicondylar region in addition to the one placed over the proximal humerus.The first group material was used to study proximal humerus morphology and to determine reference points for the other two groups. The points were constructed to make seven planes perpendicular to the axis of the proximal humeral metaphysis. Based on the reference points, parameters of the proximal humerus were assessed in the defined planes also in the other two groups. We measured angles between the reference points and the transepicondylar line or the humeral head axis. The vertex of each angle was always placed in the point of intersection of the metaphyseal axis and the given transverse plane. Reference points of the greater tubercle were marked on the medial margin continuous with the intertubercular groove, on the lateral margin of the lesser tubercle and in the \"deepest\" place of the intertubercular groove. We also measured humeral head retroversion and the position of maximal bony mass of both the greater and the lesser tubercle (this parameter can be used with advantage for optimal insertion of screws in proximal humerus reconstruction).The angle between the medial margin of the greater tubercle and the humeral head axis was on average 164.8 degrees on the left side and 163.2 degrees on the right side; the angle between the great tubercle margin and the transepicondylar line was 137.0 degrees on the left humerus and 137.7 degrees on the right humerus. The lateral margin of the lesser tubercle and the humeral head axis formed on average an angle of 124.4 degrees and of 122.6 degrees on the right and the left side, respectively. The intertubercular groove/ humeral head axis relationship was 143.4 degrees and 144.8 degrees for the left and the right humerus, respectively, and the intertubercular groove/transepicondylar line angle was 115.6 degrees for the left and 119.5 degrees for the right humerus. The humeral head axis and the transepicondylar line made an angle of 27.8 degrees for the left and 25.3 degrees for the right humerus. These values corresponded to the angle of the humeral head retroversion. The reference point of maximal bony mass of the greater tubercle and the humeral head axis made an angle of 181.1 degrees and of 180.2 degrees for the left and the right humerus, respectively; between this point and the lesser tubercle was an angle of 120.2 degrees for the left and 126.9 degrees for the right humerus.One of the most important parameters in restoring shoulder function by alloplasty is humeral head retroversion. If this is not correct, ventral or, less frequently, dorsal instability of the shoulder may result. The correct setting of retroversion is guided by the transepicondylar line or several specific landmarks on the greater and the lesser tubercle of the humerus. Another important factor is the correct reconstruction of anatomic position of the greater and the lesser tubercle in relation to the insertion of rotator cuff muscles into the humeral head. Relationships of diaphyseal, metaphyseal and humeral head axes have been reported in the relevant literature dealing with proximal femoral morphology. None of the reports, however, has dealt with tubercular angles and position of the maximal body mass, which is a decisive factor for insertion of screws fixing the prosthetic stem.The values provided here can be used for a more precise construction of implants for shoulder replacement. The method of three-dimensional presentation of the proximal humerus may aid in a more exact implantation procedure during shoulder arthroplasty. An optimal position of the implant can also be based on parameters obtained from the healthy contralateral shoulder joint.",

A well-designed rehabilitation program avoids potential graft damage and speeds up patients' return to their full function level. The course of rehabilitation depends on the type of surgery, mode of fixation and possible co-existing injury to the knee's soft tissues. The rehabilitation program presented here is based on the present-day knowledge of neurophysiological and biomechanical principles and is divided into five phases. In the pre-operative phase (I), the main objective is to prepare patients for surgery in terms of maximum muscle strength and range of motion. It also includes providing full information on the procedure. In the early post-operative phase (II) we are concerned with pain alleviation and reduction of knee edema. After suture removal we begin with soft techniques for the patella and post-operative physical therapy to reduce scarring. In the next post-operative phase (III) patients are able to walk with their full weight on the extremity operated on, and we continue doing exercises that improve flexor/extensor co-contraction. In this phase we also begin with exercises improving the patient's proprioceptive and sensorimotor functions. In the late post-operative phase (IV) we go on with exercises promoting proprioception of both lower extremities with the aim of increasing muscle control of the knee joints. In the convalescent phase (V) patients gradually return to their sports activities.",

To treat this after bone maturation is completed, Bernese periacetabular osteotomy, also known as the Ganz procedure, has recently been used as the method of choice at our department. The evaluation of the first results is presented here.The group evaluated comprised 25 hips (21 female and 4 male) in 22 patients. Nineteen hips were treated for residual dysplasia of the acetabulum due to DDH, and six for a spastic hip. The average age was 26 years (range, 12 to 44) and 14 right and 11 left hips were involved On pre- and post-operative radiographs the AC index, Wiberg lateral CE angle, Wagner index, improvement in Shenton's line, and lateralisation and anteversion of the acetabulum were compared. Bernese periacetabular osteotomy is an extensive surgical procedure requiring special instrumentation. It may be associated with serious complications and has a relatively long learning curve.The average follow-up was 18 months (range, 2 to 36). The average duration of surgery was 2 hours and 44 min (range, 2 to 31/ 2 h). The average values improved in the AC index by 24 degrees, lateral CE angle by 29 degrees and Wagner index by 18 %. Shenton's line was corrected by surgery in 20 hips and lateral migration in 16 hips. In two hips lateralisation did not changed. Two serious complications were recorded: para-articular ossification requiring excision and concomitant acetabular trimming, and great intra-operative blood loss.Various mechanisms of damage to the hip are discussed and the methods of treatment outlined, together with prerequisites for successful surgery. Potential complications and their treatment are mentioned.Bernese periacetabular osteotomy makes the range of roofing procedures for hip joint treatment wider. These, as well as hip joint reduction techniques, should be performed in major specialized centres.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYRevision surgery with implant retention and exchange of mobile prosthetic parts is considered to be the method of first choice in acute periprosthetic infections with a stable endoprosthesis and good condition of soft tissues, where the symptoms did not last longer than 3 weeks.The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term outcomes and to identify the factors affecting the success rate of this procedure. MATERIAL AND METHODSThis unicentric retrospective study evaluated the results of 18 surgeries with implant retention performed at the Department of Orthopaedics of České Budějovice Hospital in the period 2009-2016.The failure of the procedure was defined as the presence of at least one of the following criteria: removal or replacement of endoprosthesis within 2 years after the DAIR procedure, detection of the same pathogen during the DAIR procedure and in the later performed revision surgery, necessity of chronic suppressive antibiotic therapy, death related to periprosthetic infection.The cured patients were invited for a clinical check-up.The postoperative condition was assessed using the Knee Society Score and the Harris Hip Score. RESULTSThe overall success rate of the procedure reached 61.1%.Hematogenic dissemination was the cause of periprosthetic infection in 13 followed-up cases (72.2%), with the average time after the implantation of 153.2 weeks.Treatment through the DAIR procedure was successful in 53.8%.Early postoperative complications were observed in 5 cases (27.8%), in 4 of which, i.e. 80%, they were successfully managed by a surgery with implant retention.The most frequently identified etiological agents were Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains.In primo-implanted endoprostheses the success rate reached 90.9% (in case of early postoperative infections even 100%), whereas surgeries in repeatedly operated joints were successful in 14.3% only.The mean value of the Knee Society Score in patients after a successful knee joint surgery was 81.2 of the maximum score of 100 (σ = 8.5), the Function Knee Society Score was 70 of 100 (σ = 34.6).In the case of the Harris Hip Score in patients after the hip replacement, the mean hip function score was 89.8 of the maximum of 100 (σ = 7.3).The patients with knee and hip joint endoprosthesis after the performed DAIR procedure were satisfied on average to the level of 82.5% and 90%, respectively, while 28.6% of patients experienced certain functional decline during daily activities.Postoperatively, 25% of patients reported continuing stronger pain as compared to the past medical history.No patient experienced any change in terms of a limited range of motion or decreased joint stability. DISCUSSIONThe overall success rate of the DAIR procedure of 61.1% corresponds with the values stated in the literature.A significantly higher success rate was achieved in early postoperative complications.This can be explained by a lower specificity in determining the actual pathogenesis of late periprosthetic infections and potentially longer lasting colonisation of endoprosthesis.The medical history of previous surgeries performed on the affected joints for septic arthritis or with a surgical instrument retention was identified as an important risk factor of failure of the subsequently performed DAIR procedure.Significant effects of pathogenicity of the detected agent or systemic comorbidities on the success rate of the procedure were not confirmed in our group.Successful performance of the DAIR procedure results in maintaining a very good function of endoprosthesis as well as subjective satisfaction of patients. CONCLUSIONSThe DAIR technique is an ideal solution in correctly and early diagnosed acute periprosthetic infections.The results suggest that it is particularly appropriate in early postoperative infections of primary total joint replacements.Its indication in late periprosthetic infections, especially of repeatedly operated joints, shall be carefully considered.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The authors evaluate the results of endoscopic treatment and analyse the causes of persisting difficulties in retrocalcaneal bursitis unresponsive to conservative treatment. Stated as one of the causes is the possible chronic irritation of minor/partial tears of anterior parts of the distal portion of the Achilles tendon, which have no chance to heal due to continued overload and impingement syndrome of the superior prominence of the calcaneal tubercle. MATERIAL AND METHODS The authors evaluate the group of 24 patients (10 women and 14 men) diagnosed with retrocalcaneal bursitis, who reported more than 12 months of difficulties and in whom the conservative therapy options have already been exhausted. The decision to perform a revision arthroscopy was made by the authors based on chronic long-lasting difficulties, clinical examination, calcaneus radiograph, ultrasound examination and negative response to the performed conservative treatment. The MRI scan was obtained in 4 patients. In 11 patients during arthroscopy the Achilles tendon was intact, in 13 patients (54.2%) minor tears were detected on the anterior aspect of the distal Achilles tendon, not diagnosed preoperatively (by ultrasound examination). In all the patients, resection of the prominence of the calcaneal tubercle was performed, whereas in patients with affected Achilles tendon also the loose tendon fragments were resected. RESULTS A total of 23 patients reported an improvement of their condition, the pain subsided at 21-43 days. Altogether 21 patients returned to activities carried out before the onset of pain. The AOFAS score values measured preoperatively in patients with an intact tendon were 59.5 ± 15.0, in patients with an injured tendon it was 45.57 ± 9.6, while 6 months after the surgery the values were 95.7 ± 6.2, or 88.71 ± 7.8 respectively. In 1 female patient, with one prior surgery, diagnosed with a partial tear of the Achilles tendon, the effect of the surgery was unsatisfactory. After six months the patient underwent an open revision surgery and the Achilles tendon reinsertion. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were observed. DISCUSSION The endoscopic technique facilitates a more visible bone resection, with better control of resection, which is less invasive than the open technique. The source of irritation can be removed, which is not always only the prominence of the calcaneal tubercle, but another cause of persisting problems can also be a microtrauma affecting the anterior portion of the Achilles tendon, with a reactive hyperaemia in bursal tissue. Compared to literature and also based on the results of the authors of this retrospective study, the endoscopic calcaneoplasty is less invasive than the open surgery. It is always necessary to properly diagnose the causes of difficulties and to timely respond to persisting symptoms in patients, not responding satisfactorily to conservative therapy. CONCLUSIONS The findings presented by the authors provide a new perspective on the causes of chronic problems such as the \"posterior heel pain\" and tend to give preference to the active endoscopic approach in patients with persisting problems, not responding to conservative treatment, predisposed based on the radiological examination and with a positive finding on ultrasound or MRI scan.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe aim of this study was to summarise the current approaches to diagnostics and therapy of the medial meniscus tear, and to evaluate the short-term results of meniscus repair by outside-in and all-inside techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODSThe study included 24 patients who underwent medial meniscus repair for vertical longitudinal tear 10 mm or longer in length localised in the rear two-thirds of meniscus in the red-red or red-white zone at the author's workplace between June 2012 and December 2014.As regards the method, either outside-in or all-inside techniques were used, or the combination of both.The Steadman technique was used in cases of LCA ruptures.Before the surgery standard radiographs of the knee joint of each patient were taken.The Lysholm Knee Score was used to evaluate the function of the knee pre-and postoperatively.The Barrett's criteria were used to evaluate the healing of repaired meniscus.The clinical success was defined as an absence of any of such criteria.The satisfaction of the patients was evaluated by the visual analogue scale (VAS).The patients were followed up for 13.5 (6-36) months. RESULTSThe functional results presented by Lysholm Knee Score demonstrate the improvement of all patients.When comparing the score measured before and after the surgery, this score increased from 67.1 ± 11.4 (24-81) preoperatively to 90.4 ± 13.0 (34-100) postoperatively.The outcome was excellent in 11 patients (45.8 per cent), good in 12 patients (50.0 per cent), and poor in one patient (4.2 per cent).According to the Barrett's criteria, 19 repaired menisci were healed (79.2 per cent) = success rate.In five patients at least one of the monitored criteria was positive.In these cases, the result was considered a failure.Patient satisfaction averaged at 8.0 ± 1.5 (3-10).Only one patient with the concurrent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear with poor functional result, positive Barrett's criteria and VAS 3 agrees with the proposed revision surgery.Regarding possible complications, no neurovascular injury, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or deep infection were reported. DISCUSSIONThe results presented in this research correspond to the outcomes of other authors, in particular as regards the shortterm follow-up.Other authors state that even the long-term results of Lysholm Knee Score related to meniscus repair are considerably better than the results after meniscectomy.When assessing the Barrett's criteria, the success rate of 79.2 per cent (19 patients) was reached; therefore, the failure rate was 20.8 per cent (5 patients).These results are comparable with the results of other authors whose success rate of meniscus repair ranges between 60 and 90 per cent.Based on the assessment of the VAS patient's satisfaction, the average rate of 8.0 points (3-10) was reached.A similar average rate of the patient's satisfaction amounting to 8.35 ± 1 (6-10) was reached in a similar designated study of Keyhani et al. carried out in 2015.Regarding possible complications, no neurovascular injury, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or deep infection were reported.Similar observation of the low complication rate can be seen in the research studies of other authors. CONCLUSIONSOur short-term follow-up revealed that the postoperative results of Lysholm Knee Score considerably improved, the satisfaction rate of the patients was high and the failure rate is entirely in line with the values stated in literature.The results of our study confirm that in the indicated cases the meniscus repair is an effective method of treatment of vertical longitudinal tears located in both RR and RW zones.The preserved meniscus is considerably supportive to ensure stability of the knee joint, in particular in the event of concurrent rupture of anterior cruciate ligament, and to prevent early osteoarthritic changes.Nevertheless, it is necessary to carry out further randomized clinical studies with a larger number of patients and a longerterm follow-up to confirm our results.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Traumatic bone injuries or pathological processes may sometimes result in very extensive bone defects. Currently, the standard procedure applied in clinical humane as well as veterinary medicine to fill a bone defect is the autogenous bone graft which, however, necessitates a more invasive procedure for the patient and in the cases of extensive defects it fails to provide adequate amount of graft. Synthetic bone replacements can be used with no further burden for the patient and can simultaneously be used as the carriers for bioactive molecules or therapeutic drugs. For clinical use, an easy and simple application is one of the requirements that have to be taken into consideration. These requirements are best satisfied by preparations in the form of gel, which may be injected into the defects of various shapes even through minimal surgical approach. MATERIAL AND METHODS Synthetic transparent PGD-AlphaProA hydro-peptide-gel was used as a basis to develop a composite hydrogel scaffold. This gel was enriched by cryogenically ground poly- -caprolactone nanofibers (PCL) in a ratio of 1 ml of gel to 16 μg of nanofibres. In experimental animals (laboratory rat Wistar, n=20), a single regular circular defect of 1.5 mm in diameter was drilled by a low speed drill machine across the whole width of distal femur diaphysis, identically in both the hind legs. In the right hindleg, this defect was filled by injection of 0.05 ml of the composite peptide gel with nanofibers (experimental defect). In the contralateral limb a similar defect was left untreated, without filling (control defect), for spontaneous healing. The group of experimental animals was subsequently divided into four sub-groups (A, B, C, D) for the purpose of further follow-up. One week after the surgical implantation, in the first group of experimental animals (Group A; n = 5) lege artis euthanasia was performed, a radiological examination of both the hind legs was carried out and a sample of the bone from both the control and experimental defect was collected for histologic examination. The other groups of experimental animals were evaluated similarly at 2, 4 and 6 weeks after the surgical procedure (Group B, C, D; n = 5). These groups of experimental animals were assessed using various histological techniques by two independent pathologists. RESULTS A difference between the control and the experimental bone defect was observed only at the healing stage at two weeks after the implantation, when a tendency for greater formation of new bone trabeculas was seen in the defect treated with the composite hydro-peptide-gel with PCL nanofibers. The results show a slightly higher angiogenesis and cellularity at the bone defect site with an increase of newly formed bone tissue and faster colonisation of lamellar bone structures by bone marrow cells at early stages of the healing process (1-2 weeks old defect). In the experimental and control groups, at the later stage of healing (4-6 weeks old defect), the process of healing and bone modelling at the defect site shows no detectable morphological differences. CONCLUSIONS The experimental use of hydro-peptide-gel with PCL nanofibers in vivo in laboratory rats shows very good applicability into the defect site and, compared to the untreated defect within two weeks after the implantation, accelerates the bone healing. This fact could be an advantage especially at the early stage of healing, and thus accelerate the healing of more extensive defects.

RESULTSAll the penetrating cardiac and great vessels injuries were repaired by cardiac surgeon, in one case only (6%) the extracorporeal circulation support was used.The injury of coronary arteries was in one case managed by CABG and in the other case by ligation of the peripheral part of the coronary artery.In 4 patients (25%) also a penetrating injury of other organs was simultaneously managed.The mean ICU stay reached 85.8 ± 91.9 hours, on average 5.6 ± 9.3 units of red blood cells were administered during the in-hospital stay which lasted on average 7.1 ± 2.4 days.In the group a nonsignificant increase of left ventricular ejection fraction (44.1 ± 4.7 vs. 49.3 ± 3.2, p = 0.882) was reported at discharge of the injured patients.One patient died on the 78 th day of hypoxic brain damage (6% three-month mortality).The long-term survival analysis showed 94% one-year and 88% five-year cumulative survival in the group. DISCUSSIONThe incidence of the penetrating cardiac and great vessels injury is directly dependent on the crime level in the respective countries and regions.A cardiac arrest, severe hemodynamic instability, unconsciousness, serious concomitant injury, gunshot injury, multiple or atrial injury represent independent predictors of death in these injuries.The total three-month mortality in penetrating cardiac and great vessels injury ranges from 18 to 42%, the presence of vital signs at the time of hospital admission is associated with 78-92% probability of survival.The surviving patients show excellent long-term results with the exception of those who suffered a severe damage to valve apparatus or with significantly depressed left ventricular function. CONCLUSIONSOur experience proves a high survival rate of patients with penetrating cardiac and great vessels injury.The centralisation of the care into the major trauma centre with a cardiac surgery background, a unified treatment algorithm, and a vital interdisciplinary cooperation are the key goal of successful management of these injuries.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYTo determine the optimal strategy for tranexamic acid (TXA) administration in diabetic patients, smokers and obese patients (BMI > 30 kg/m 2 ) undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). MATERIAL AND METHODSThe total of 400 consecutive patients indicated for primary TKA were randomised into 4 basic groups with different TXA administration regimens.Group 1 (IV1) had a single intravenous dose (15 mg TXA/kg) applied prior to skin incision.Group 2 (IV2) got two intravenous doses (15 mg TXA/kg): one prior to skin incision and one subsequently 6 hours after the first dose.Group 3 (TOP) had 2 g TXA in 50 ml of saline irrigated topically at the end of the surgery.Group 4 (COMB) combined IV1 and TOP regimens.We monitored the amount of total blood loss (TBL), haemoglobin drop, use of blood transfusions (BTs), and complications in each patient.Follow-up period was one year postoperatively. RESULTSIn the group of diabetic patients (n = 87; 21.7%) the lowest TBL was observed in the order: IV1, IV2 > COMB > TOP.In the obese patients (BMI > 30 kg/m 2 ; n = 242; 60.5%), TBL was significantly lower in the intravenous regimens (IV1: p = 0.002; IV2: p = 0.005, respectively) than in the TOP regimen.In the smoking patients (n = 30; 7.5%), TBLs were significantly lower in the order: IV1 > IV2 > COMB > TOP. DISCUSSIONIndividualised approach to prevention and therapy is a recent trend, also because comorbidities significantly affect the result of the intervention.In the case of diabetes, obesity and smoking, there is a proven link to early post-operative infections, mainly due to poorer innate immunity.It is conceivable, though, that the occurrence of infectious complications is also contributed to by larger hematomas or hemarthroses which are largely preventable. CONCLUSIONSIn the diabetic and obese patients (BMI > 30 kg/m 2 ), the combined topical/intravenous TXA application and two intravenous doses of TXA interventions were shown to be the most effective.However, no evidence of superiority of any of the TXA administration routes was obtained in the smokers.None of the TXA protocols was associated with a higher incidence of complications or early reoperation following TKA surgery.",

    "abstract": "To present the results of surgical treatment of carpometacarpal joint arthritis of the thumb, using cannulated screw fixation which is stable and, after bony union, allows the patient to do also harder manual workIn the years 2000 to 2005, this method was used for 20 operations in 18 patients (16 women and two men); one man and one woman had bilateral surgery. The right hand was operated on in seven cases and the left one in 13 cases. The average age of the patients was 61 years.The procedure was performed from the dorsoradial approach, access to the joint was gained between the extensor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis longus tendons, and care was taken to protect the superficial branch of the radial nerve. The articular surface of the trapezium bone and the first metacarpal base including osteophytes were resected and arthrodesis was carried out by means of a 4.5 mm cannulated screw. The final position of the thumb axis was at 40 degrees to 45 degrees palmar abduction, 20 degrees to 25 degrees extension and 10 degrees to 15 degrees pronation. A plaster hand splint was applied for 6 to 8 weeks post- operatively. The patients were capable of full use of the hand at 3 months after surgery.Evaluation included a pain scale of 1 to 5 grades, range of motion, reduction of muscle strength and fine motor function. All operative wounds healed by first intention, no infection or neurological complications were recorded. Primary union was achieved in 18 cases, two developed pseudoarthrosis. The patients reported improvement on the pain scale by 2 grades on average. However, in thumb opposition tasks, the range between the tip of the thumb and the fifth metacarpophalangeal joint decreased on average by 20 mm. Fourteen patients reported deterioration of fine motor function. All patients were satisfied with improved muscle strength enabling them to do more demanding physical work.The results of carpometacarpal joint arthrodesis by means of a cannulated screw are comparable with those of arthrodesis using other implants. The final thumb position is discussed as well as the use of suitable fixation material in order to prevent pseudoarthrosis. Issues such as the use of interpositioned tissue, shortening of the radial column and the resultant limited muscle strength in resection arthroplasty, and the choice of a most suitable implant and possibility of its failure in alloplasty are also discussed.Arthrodesis with cannulated screw fixation is best for treatment of the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb with stage III rhizarthritis (Eaton classification). It results in an axis-stable thumb that is pain free and capable of physical activity and firm grip.",

In this study the development and construction of a custom-made implant and the operative technique used for the treatment of an extensive tibial defect are described. The patient was a 65-year-old man treated for over 20 years for psoriatic arthritis and severe instability of the right knee, particularly in the frontal plane, with a worsening varus deformity. The radiogram showed an extensive destruction of the medial tibial condyle that also deeply involved the lateral condyle. The extent of defect made it impossible to use any commercial tibial augmentation. The geometry of the custom-designed implant for the medial tibial condyle was constructed on the basis of a 3D defect model and the shape of the medial tibial condyle of the collateral knee seen on CT scans. After its correct shape was verified on a plastic model, its coordinates were set in the software of a machine tool, and a titanium augmentation otherwise compatible with a standard knee replacement was produced.The use of such a custom implant to complete standard total knee arthroplasty has so far been demanding in terms of organisation and manufacture. Its production in the future could be facilitated by substituting titanium for plastic material such as poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK).

    "abstract": "A failure of total hip or knee artroplasty is associated with an increased production of joint fluid. This contains wear particles and host cells and proteins, and is assumed to be involved in the pathogenesis of aseptic loosening and periprosthetic osteolysis. This study investigated the effect of synovial fluid from patients with aseptically failed joint prostheses on osteoblast cultures.Synovial fluid samples were obtained from patients with failed total joint prostheses (TJP; n=36) and from control patient groups (n = 16) involving cases without TJP and osteoarthritis, without TJP but with osteoarthritis, and with stable TJP. The samples were treated in the standard manner and then cultured with the SaOS-2 cell line which shows the characteristics and behaviour of osteoblasts. Each fluid sample was also examined for the content of proteins, cells and selected cytokines (IL-1ß, TNF-α, IL-6, RANKL and OPG detected by ELISA). We tested the hypothesis assuming that the fluids from failed joints would show higher cytotoxicity to osteoblast culture and we also expected higher levels of IL-1ß, TNF-α, IL-6, and RANKL in patients with TJP failure and/ or with more severe bone loss. The statistical methods used included the Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA and Mann-Whitney U test.The fluids from failed TJPs showed the highest RANKL and the lowest OPG levels resulting in the highest RANKL/OPG ratio. However, there was no evidence suggesting that the joint fluids from failed TJPs would be more toxic to osteoblast culture than the fluids from control groups. In addition, no correlation was found between the fluid levels of molecules promoting inflammation and osteoclastic activity and the extent of bone loss in the hip (in terms of Saleh's classification) or the knee (AORI classification). In fact, the fluids from failed TJPs had higher protein levels in comparison with the controls, but the difference was not significant.The finding of high RANKL levels and low OPG concentrations is in agreement with the theory of aseptic loosening and periprosthetic osteolysis. The other cytokines, particularly TNF-α and IL-1ß, were found in low levels. This can be explained by the stage of particle disease at which the samples were taken for ELISA analysis. It is probable that the level of signal molecules reflects osteolytic process activity and is therefore not constant. The reason for no correlation found between cytokine levels and the extent of bone loss may also lie in the use of therapeutic classifications of bone defects that is apparently less sensitive to the biological activity of aseptic loosening and/or periprosthetic osteolysis.Synovial fluids from failed total hip or knee joint prostheses are not toxic to osteoblast cultures. Cytotoxicity indicators and levels of pro-inflammatory and pro-osteoclastic cytokines (IL-1ß, TNF-α, IL-6, RANKL and OPG) do not correlate well with the extent of periprosthetic bone loss.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term results in a group of patients treated by proximal tibial valgus osteotomy. MATERIALA group of 92 high tibial osteotomies performed in the 1985/1994 period were evaluated.All were indicated for primary osteoarthritis.Closing wedge osteotomy was the technique used.Staple-fixed osteotomy was immobilised in a plaster cast for 6 weeks in 44 cases.Osteotomy fixed with a plate in 35 or with a cerclage in 13 cases was immobilised for two weeks. METHODSRecurrent intensive pain and walking problems were regarded as a termination of the favourable effect of osteotomy.This was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.The tibio-femoral angle 5 to 10 degrees of valgus was considered as an optimal deformity correction.The results were compared in relation to complications, correction, duration of immobilisation and patient age. RESULTSThe mean age of the patients was 59.8 ± 8.7 years (range, 42 to 78).During surgery, medial unicompartmental arthritis, grade II or higher, was recorded in 59 patients (64.1%) and multicompartmental knee arthritis was found in 66 patients (71.7%).The absence of noticeable problems was reported by 80.4% of the patients at 10 years and by 30.4 % at 15 years after osteotomy.Surgery decreased the range of motion from 100 ± 6.9 to 94.5 ± 17.7 degrees flexion (p = 0.04).Poor correction and post-operative complications were found in 21 patients (22.8 %) who also experienced significantly worse outcomes (p = 0.003).Good results after 10 and 15 years were reported by 47.6% and 14.3% of the patients, respectively.Of 71 patients (77.2%) who had good correction and surgery without complications, the osteotomy showed a good effect in 90.1% at 10 post-operative years and in 35.2% at 15 years.A longer immobilisation resulted in significantly worse results (p = 0.04) and a restricted range of motion (p = 0.02).The patients younger than 60 years achieved better results than the elderly patients (p = 0.38), but the difference was not significant. DISCUSSIONGood results were recorded up to 10 years after osteotomy, although some patients had had worse arthritis than recommended for this procedure.Inadequate correction and complications deteriorated the effect of osteotomy.With the opening wedge technique it is easier to achieve good correction, and stable fixation allows for active physical therapy.Better long-lasting results are achieved with total knee arthroplasty (TKA).However, in young active adults TKA can fail prematurely.Osteotomy can postpone the necessity of this implantation.If TKA is performed after osteotomy, functional outcomes are similar to those after primary implantation. CONCLUSIONSCorrective osteotomy is an effective method in patients below 60 years who have an early-stage osteoarthritis of the knee with axial mal-alignment.If the tibio-femoral angle is over-corrected to more than 10 degrees valgus, patelo-femoral pain will ensue.Post-operative active physical therapy is necessary.After bone healing, implants must be removed.Corrective osteotomy has not been overcome by the development of joint replacement techniques, but both methods are complementary in the treatment of osteoarthritis.",

    "abstract": "Making pre-operative diagnosis of intermediate and low-grade infections of prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is demanding and requires both clinical experience and good knowledge of diagnostic test performance. It is also necessary to know the rules of working with diagnostic tests based on the expected change in pre-test probability of PJI or the diagnostic odds ratio. This also requires a multi-modal approach with a rational combination of relevant tests because none of them can have both 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Suspicion of a developing PJI should be aroused by relevant information present in the patient s medical history and confirmed by clinical examination. Patients with an increased starting PJI probability, i.e. after taking the medical history and clinical examination, should be examined for the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (screening tests). When both of these tests are positive and no other alternative explanation for their increase is plausible, then the post-test probability of PJI is significantly increased (up to 70%). Under such conditions the diagnosis is made definitive by positive results of synovial fluid analysis (leukocyte count, percentage of neutrophils and lymphocytes, IL-1, IL-6) or an increased IL-6 serum levels. On the other hand, when both ESR and CRP are negative, the post-test probability of PJI is significantly decreased and no further examination for the presence of infection is usually necessary. In case of inconsistent results of ESR and CRP or if there is a high suspicion of joint infection regardless of these test results, joint fluid aspiration (cytology, IL-1, IL-6) and IL-6 serum levels should be assessed. In this situation scintigraphy imaging (three-phase bone scan combined with labelled leukocytes or anti-granulocyte antibodies) can also support or exclude the diagnosis. In low-grade infections or after previous administration of antibiotics it is recommended to repeat the above-mentioned laboratory tests and joint aspiration after at least a two-week interval without antibiotics.

MATERIAL AnD METHODSThe PSO technique for correction of rigid deformity of the C/Th spine was used in five patients with the aim to restore their ability of horizontal vision.The follow-up in all patients lasted two years at least.Clinical assessment of treatment results was based on the patients' neurological status and their satisfaction with the correction achieved.Improvement in a vertical 2) line of sight was evaluated using the angle measured between the forehead-chin line and the vertical (FCv angle) in a lateral view photograph of the standing patient.The achieved correction of kyphotic deformity was assessed by comparing the pre-operative Cobb's angle between the second cervical and the fourth thoracic vertebra with the post-operative one. RESULTSThe average operative time was 4 hours (range, 3.5 to 5 h).The average blood loss was 1600 ml (range, 800 to 2100 ml).On the average, the FCv angle was reduced by 45.2° and Cobb's angle was corrected) by 54.6°.All patients were satisfied with the degree of correction achieved and reported alleviation of neck pain.none of the patients showed any significant loss of correction or neurological deterioration at two-year follow-up. DISCUSSIOnThe theoretical and technical principles of corrective osteotomy at the C7 level performed for rigid kyphotic deformity of the spine at the C/Th junction are presented in our group of patients.Our results give support to the superiority of instrumented PSO used currently over the previous techniques.In accordance with the relevant literature data, attention is drawn to a relatively higher risk of this procedure in comparison with corrective surgery performed at the other spinal levels. COnCLUSIOnSCorrective osteotomy of a rigid kyphotic deformity at the C/Th spine level in AS patients involves a complex reconstructive surgical procedure.The PSO technique reduces the risk of injury to the visceral structures ventral to the spine, and provides optimal conditions for bone healing at the site of vertebral body resection.If the patient heals well, a successful PSO procedure will markedly improve the quality of his/her life.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYHemiarthoplasty or total replacement of the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint has been used in orthopaedic surgery for the last 60 year, but good post-operative outcomes have been achieved only in the last ten years.Joint replacement is mainly used in stage 3 and stage 4 hallux rigidus conditions for which arthrodesis is not indicated.The operation on the first MTP joint has its place in the present-day orthopaedics.This study describes anatomical measurements and the development of the first Czech implant (MEDIN Orthopaedics) to replace this joint. MATERIAL AND METHODSThirty cadaver specimens were used to develop basic shapes of phalangeal and metatarsal components.A standard technique was used for anatomical dissection of the first MTP joint.Fifteen specimens were cut in the sagittal plane and fifteen in the transverse plane in order to open the intramedullary cavity of the proximal phalanx of the great toe and the first metatarsal bone.The basic shapes of phalangeal and metatarseal components were designed based on the shape of cortical bone of their inner surfaces.Data for the shape, size and scale of articular components were obtained by measurement on 58 dry bone specimens of the first metatarsus and on 30 calibrated X-ray images.In order to adjust the scale and size of components, the final shape and the range of implant size were tested on 50 specimens of dissected lower extremities fixed in formaldehyde, acetone, ethyl-alcohol and glycerol. RESULTSThe new type of a first MTP implant designed by us was based on cone-shaped anchor components coated with hydroxyapatite.The implants can be used in hemiarthroplasty or total joint replacement.The metatarsal insert was designed with a declination angle of 20 degrees to facilitate good dorsiflexion and with a flattening to ensure good function of the sesamoid bones, The phalangeal articular insert was made of either CoCr alloy or low-weight polyethylene for use in hemiarthroplasty and total joint replacement, respectively. DISCUSSIONThe new implants are designed for treatment of stage 3 or stage 4 hallux rigidus.We recommend to use hemiarthroplasty or total joint replacement only in the case of first metatarsal head destruction or severe joint destruction due to rheumatoid arthritis. CONSLUSIONSOur anatomical study of the first MTP joint, proximal phalanx of the great toe and first metatarsal bone was used to design the first Czech implant of this joint.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe aim of the study was to analyse the long-term clinical and radiographic results of total hip arthroplasty (THA) with the Bicontact-Plasmacup prosthesis, MATERIAL AND METHODSIn this retrospective observational study, 34 consecutive patients undergoing Bicontact-Plasmacup THA between August 1998 and July 2000 were evaluated.The group included 15 women and 19 men with an average age of 56 years (30 to 67 years).The mean ± SD of follow-up was 132 ± 9 months (122 to 149 months).Patients' satisfaction with the treatment outcome and selected clinical and radiographic features were evaluated.The data were analysed using the concordance test, Spearman's correlation coefficient and chi-square test. RESULTSAt the final follow-up, 94% of the interviewed patients reported satisfaction with the surgery outcome.The mean Harris score was 93 (67 to 98) points, with excellent or very good results in 91% of the patients.Compared with the post-operative radiographs, the mean ± SD value for vertical migration of the acetabular cup was 2.43 ± 3.21 mm (0 to 12 mm) and that for horizontal migration was 0.35 ± 1.0 mm (0 to 4.3 mm).The mean stem subsidence was by 3.87 mm (range, 0.36 to 21.11 mm; SD 4.03).At the final follow-up, all implants showed radiographic stability and absence of radiolucent lines.Early acetabular osteolysis was detected in two patients (5.9 %).In 19 patients (56%) a change in bone architecture, similar to alterations due to weight-bearing adaptation, was seen around the cup following surgery.The stress shielding effect of the femoral component was recorded in 79%, bypass phenomenon in 41 % and pedestal formation under the apex of the stem in 18% of the patients.The mean rate of polyethylene wear measured by the Dorr and Wan method was 0.106 mm per year (range, 0.00 to 0.267 mm) or it was 0.078 mm per year (0.00 to 0.19 mm) when assessed by a modification of the method described by Kang et al. DISCUSSIONThe clinical and radiographic findings presented here are in accordance with the relevant literature data.This implant design is associated with a relatively infrequent osteolysis around the cup probably due to a low wear rate of polyethylene and a stable polyethylene liner-metal cup interface.Based on this work and some other studies it can be concluded that a post-operative migration of several millimetres is compatible with a long-term, stable cementless THA. CONCLUSIONSThe Bicontact-Plasmacup THA meets the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) criteria for a very good implant (ten-year survival rate of over 90%).At 10 years after surgery, however, the first signs of complaints about surgery outcome // dissatisfaction with surgery outcomes were recorded.This may, at least partly, be related to aseptic loosening which is one of the symptoms of particle disease.",

    "abstract": "Prosthetic joint infection is a feared complication in total hip arthroplasty. The use of antibiotic-impregnated bone cement is the important part of preventive and therapeutic strategies. At present a number of commercial bone cements are available and support of their use by the results of experimental trials and clinical studies has varied. In relation to this issue we studied essential microbiological and pharmacological characteristics of VancogenX in comparison with gentamicin-loaded bone cement used conventionally.Based on a previously described protocol, we tested pellets of four commercial bone cements, namely, Hi-Fatigue G, Palacos R+G, VancogenX, and Palacos R as a control. Bone cement was prepared in a vacuum-mixing system. The strains used for bacterial load included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Each cement was tested for its antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities and the results were evaluated by standard methods. In addition, we investigated time-related release of gentamicin and vancomycin from the bone cements tested.All antibiotic-loaded cement pellets were able to prevent growth of the bacterial strains tested. The bactericidal effect lasted for several days in relation to the bacterial species and cement used, with the exception of S. epidermidis whose growth was inhibited by gentamicin-loaded cement only for one day. The antibiotic-loaded pellets also prevented the formation of a biofilm for 24 hours at least. The major amount of vancomycin (32.915 mg/l) was released from VancogenX to MH medium within 24 hours and the last measureable amount (4.327 mg/l) was recorded at 48 hours after the start of the experiment. In physiological saline the highest level of vancomycin was 139.852 mg/ml measured at 24 hours, and the antibiotic was detectable at a level of 2.334 mg/ml as late as 8 days after the experiment started. Release of gentamicin from VancogenX was as follows: the 24-hour level was higher in MH medium than physiological saline (178 versus 131.4 mg/ml); however, gentamicin was still detectable in physiological saline at 192 hours after the start of the experiment while no gentamicin was found in MH medium after 72 hours.The antimicrobial effect of VancogenX bone cement was not an unexpected finding since both gentamicin and vancomycin have been used with bone cement for a long time and their combination is optimal in terms of preventing prosthetic joint infection. However, there is a disputable issue of poor release of vancomycin from bone cement. In MH medium we were able to detect the vancomycin released from VancogenX only for two days after the initial rapid elution while its release into physiological saline seemed to be slower but much longer. It is possible that more vancomycin is released from bone cement, but this amount is immediately bound to proteins in the cement vicinity and this process is not detectable by any analytical method.The bone cement VancogenX showed excellent antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties and can be recommended for use in orthopaedic practice. Therapy of prosthetic joint infection is the main indication. Extension of the indication to the prevention of prosthetic joint infection in high-risk patients should be preceded by biomechanical studies demonstrating that the cement is appropriate for long-term implant fixation.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study is to remind the medical community of the occurrence of rare dorsal glenohumeral dislocations and of the need to pay increased attention to radiographic and clinical examination in the patients in whom signs of this injury are also supported by medical history. When this dislocation becomes a chronic disorder, it can frequently be managed only by surgical intervention. The treatment algorithm used at the authors' institutions is described.In the period from 2000 to 2008, a total of l7 patients (9 women and 8 men) with an average age of 65.5 years (51 to 89 years) had surgery for inveterated dorsal glenohumeral dislocation. The average injury-surgery interval was 5.6 weeks (1 to 18 weeks). The average follow-up was 38 months (101 to 13 months).Surgery was performed via an anterior deltoideopectoral approach. Under pathological conditions, the subscapular muscle was identified. When a large reverse Hill-Sachs defect was present, the lesser tuberosity with the subscapular tendon was osteomited (10 patients). After scar and granulation tissue had been removed, the humeral head was reduced. Using Neer's modification of the McLaughlin procedure, the excised lesser tuberosity fragment was transferred into the antero-medial defect in the humeral head and fastened with a screw. In the case of an unstable humeral head, this was held in the reduced position by two Kirschner wires either passed through the acromion or fixed to the glenoid (11 patients). The arm was immobilized in a brace for four weeks. Then the wires were removed and rehabilitation was started with avoidance of internal rotation.None of the patients had recurrent dislocation. All were satisfied with the outcome and capable of resuming their daily activities sufficiently. Six patients complained of occasional pain. The average value of active elevation was 113° (40° to 160°). Reduced muscle strength in abduction, as compared with the contralateral arm, was observed in two patients. Injury to the axillary vein was recorded in one patient. Two patients had a large haematoma of the arm with swelling of the whole extremity. Two of the 11 patients treated with Kirschner wires developed infection around the wires that healed after their removal at four weeks after surgery. DISCUSSION The open reduction and stabilization of a posterior inveterated glenohumeral dislocation can be regarded as a rare procedure performed only occasionally even in specialized institutions. The international literature also provides information on only a few tens of such cases over a number of years. Causal procedures, performed through both an anterior and posterior approach, as well as extrafocal (rotational) osteotomy have been recommended. Currently, surgery from an anterior approach is preferred, because a reverse Hill-Sachs defect, if present, can be managed either by transfer of the lesser tuberosity with the subscapular tendon or by massive allograft. CONCLUSIONS The authors' experience suggests that Neer's modification of the McLaughlin procedure is the optimal treatment for posterior inveterated glenohumeral dislocation with an anteromedial defect of the humeral head. The excision of the lesser tuberosity with the subscapular tendon provides good access to the shoulder joint and thus allows for its reliable reduction. The fastening of a tuberosity fragment into the compression defect resolves one of the major risks for recurrent dislocation, without necessity to use allogenic material. Transfixation of the humeral head with Kirschner wires for four weeks is a reliable method of holding the head in the glenoid without risk of significantly restricting shoulder motion in the future.",

Talus partitus is an unusual developmental anomaly in which the talus is partitioned although it ossifies from a single centre. The cause of its split has not been explained although this may also be due to a previous unrecognized injury. In the Slovak medical literature no report of this anomaly has been found.

    "abstract": "The aim of the study is to present our surgical method of treating degenerative spondylolisthesis, which includes radical bilateral laminectomy to relieve compression on the spinal cord, transpedicular fixation of the segment and arthrodesis by bilateral intra-articular fusion.This surgery was indicated in patients with grade I or grade II of degenerative sponylolisthesis with a 4-mm or more slippage. Our prospectively studied group consisted of 46 patients (17 men, 29 women; average age, 64.2 years; range, 39-84 years). Before surgery and at 1 year after the procedure, the intensity of axial pain and that of radicular pain were each assessed using the visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Difficulty in performing daily living activities was measured by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). The surgical procedure included laminectomy, partial medial facetectomy, foraminotomy to relieve pressure on the spinal nerve roots and transpedicular fixation to provide stability. Using a cutter, cartilage was separated off the cortical bone and, in order to facilitate fusion, bone cavities thus produced were filed with corticospongious grafts harvested from the removed vertebral arch with Kerrison forceps. At 1-year follow-up, dynamic X-ray was used to evaluate spine alignment and, on a CT scan, the degree of intra-articular fusion was assessed. Fusion was achieved when bone density measurement showed more than 350 Hounsfield Units (HU). For the measurements, the authors used their own modified method by means of a Region of Interest (ROI) analysis. The clinical and radiographic results were statistically evaluated.At 1 year after surgery, lumbar flexion-extension bending X-ray films revealed stability of the treated segments in all patients (100%). CT examination showed bone density higher than 350 HU at both joints, i.e., complete bone fusion, also in all 46 patients. The mean post-operative ODI score was significantly lower than its mean pre-operative value (23.6 vs 55.4), which was improvement by 57.4%. The differences in pre- and post-operative VAS scores were also statistically significant. The mean VAS score for low back pain decreased from 7.61 to 1.74, i.e., improvement by 77.1%, and the mean vAS score for radicular pain dropped from 6.98 to 1.24, i.e., improvement by 82.2%. Assessed by Odom's outcome criteria, the results were excellent in 26 patients and very good in 20 patients, and they were not related to age, gender or the spinal level treated. Any complications associated with the operative procedure or wound healing and requiring repeated surgical treatment were not recorded.The surgical technique described here has advantages over other methods in reliable achieving nerve decompression, joint fusion and spinal stability at low costs and short operative time. In addition, it avoids the necessity of harvesting bone from the iliac crest.At 1-year follow-up all patients showed better health conditions, with improvement in average scores for the ODI by 57%, for low back pain by 77% and for radicular and claudication pain by 82%. The technique of intra-articular fusion for treatment of degenerative spondylolisthesis resulted in solid bone fusion and spinal stability in all patients.",

MATeRiAL ANd MeTHOdSBetween March 2017 and January 2022, 279 consecutive shoulder arthroscopy patients' MRi images were retrospectively examined.After the exclusion criteria, 191 patients were eligible.Patients with SLAP lesions (n=37) were assembled as the study group (Group 1), and patients with intact superior labrum (n=154) were named as the control group (Group 2).Critical shoulder angle (CSA) and glenoid depth measurements were performed using the preoperative MRi images. ReSULTSA total of 191 patients, of whom 84 were male (44%) were included.The mean age was 49.9±14.96(range 18-79).There was a statistically significant difference between the SLAP group (Group 1) and the control group (Group 2) in terms of CSA (p=0.032).The mean CSA was 31.66°±3.51° in Group 1 and 33.57° ±5.01° in Group 2. The cut-off value for CSA in patients with SLAP lesions was calculated as 32.85° and the area under the curve was 0.61, therefore a satisfactory association was observed between the groups.The mean glenoid depth was 4.32 ±1.25 mm in Group 1, and 4.39 ±0.32 mm in Group 2. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of glenoid depth (p=0.136) and also no association between the glenoid depth and SLAP lesions was observed (cut-off=4.45 mm, AUC=0.32). CONCLUSiONSLow CSA is associated with SLAP lesions, just as in glenohumeral osteoarthritis.Further prospective clinical studies are needed to enlighten the predisposing effect of CSA to SLAP lesions and the success of superior labral repairs.",

    "abstract": "PurPOse Of The sTuDyThis manuscript aims to introduce our surgical technique, with an emphasis on the latest recommendations.The AMIs technique is discussed in more detail in patients with Class II and Class III obesity.We seek to prove the premise claiming that the anteversion and inclination values observed in this group of patients do not differ significantly from those observed in patients with the recommended BMI index.We will also compare the risk of neurovascular bundle injury and postoperative complication rate regarding the surgical wound. MATerIAl AND MeThODsPatients who underwent surgery using the AMIs method in the period between 1/2020 and 4/2023 were assessed retrospectively.The study included 1150 implantations.The entire study population was assessed for neurovascular bundle injury and surgical wound healing complications.for this purpose, the patients were divided into two groups based on the BMI, namely BMI < 35 kg/m 2 (n=1042) and BMI > 35 kg/m 2 (n=108).In patients with the BMI ≤ 25 kg/m 2 (n=280) and BMI ≥ 35 kg/m 2 (n=108), the inclination and anteversion values were compared.standard centered AP view X-rays of their operated joints were assessed.The liaw's method was used to calculate the anteversion and inclination. resulTsIn group one of patients with BMI ≤ 25 kg/m2 (208 women and 72 men), the arithmetic mean of acetabular anteversion was 25.4° (median 25°) and inclination was 38.3° (median 38°).In group two, which consisted of patients with BMI ≥ 35 kg/ m 2 (59 women and 49 men), the total arithmetic mean of acetabular anteversion was 25.1° (median 25) and inclination was 37.6° (median 37.5°).The anteversion and inclination were assessed using the Mann-Whitney test for equality of medians.The value of 0.05 was chosen as the level of significance.The resulting p-value was 0.5359 in anteversion and 0.3763 in inclination.since the p-value of both anteversion and inclination was greater than the chosen level of significance, their medians have not been confirmed to differ significantly.A total of 6 cases of femoral nerve injury was reported, i.e. 0.5% out of 1150.Therefore, the risk of injury was 0.4% in the group with BMI < 35 kg/m 2 (n=1042).On the contrary, in the group of patients with BMI > 35 kg/m 2 (n=108), the risk was 2%.No injury to femoral artery was reported.The surgical wound healing complications were seen in a total of 87 cases (7.6%).In the group with BMI < 35 kg/m 2 , healing complications of the surgical wound were observed in 7.4% of cases, with the need for revision surgery in 7 patients.In the group with BMI > 35 kg/m 2 , healing complications occurred in 13% of patients and wound revision was necessary in 4 cases. DIsCussIONOur results are consistent with those in the published studies that also show no significant difference in anteversion and inclination of components in the compared groups of obese patients.We also agree with the other authors that the rate of complications regarding surgical wound healing is higher in these patients.The risk of neurovascular bundle injury in this study population is not higher than the standard. CONClusIONsThe results obtained in our study population show that this method can also be used in patients with higher BMI, with no concern about the implantation of components in malposition or a higher risk of neurovascular injury.Nonetheless, potentially higher risk of surgical wound healing should be considered when this approach is opted for.With the appropriate surgical technique, AMIs is a safe method and, in our view, the first choice especially for obese patients.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE Of THE STUDYSimple bone cysts (SBCs) are the most common benign bone lesions in childhood.There are many different methods in the treatment of SBCs.There is no consensus on which method to use in the treatment.In this study, we compared the results of allogeneic bone graft or synthetic bone graft in addition to flexible intramedullary nail (fIN) for SBC located in the humerus. MATERIAl AND METHODSThis retrospective study comparing the data of 19 (group 1: 8 curettage, allograft and fIN; group 2: 11 curettage, synthetic graft and fIN) patients with a mean age of 11.4 (6 to 26; seven female, twelve male) who were surgically treated in our hospital for humeral SBC between April 2014 and January 2020.Patient data included age, sex, anatomical side, stage of the cyst, pathological fracture, previous treatments and complications. RESUlTSThe mean follow-up period was 33.7 months (12 to 61).The average last follow-up Musculoskeletal Tumor Society functional scores for groups 1 and 2 were 27.8 (20 to 30) and 28.6 (21 to 30) (P > 0.05).Complete or significant partial radiographic healing rates were achieved in group 1 (75%) compared with group 2 (81.9%).The reoperation rates for groups 1 and 2 were 62.5% (5/8; three for nails removed, two for recurrence) and 36.3%(4/11; two for nails removed, two for recurrence).One patient in group 2 had a 15° varus deformity due to recurrence.No other complications were observed. CONClUSIONSThe combination of curettage-grafonage fIN is a common treatment method in recent years, as it provides early cyst healing and limb mobilization in SBCs located in the upper extremity.for defects after curettage of the bone cysts, allogeneic or synthetic grafts (granule b-tricalcium phospate) which have similar results in terms of healing can be used as an alternative to each other.",

    "abstract": "Total joint replacements (TJR) have become the cornerstone of modern orthopedic surgery. A great majority of TJR employs ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) liners. TJR manufacturers use many different types of UHMWPE, which are modified by various combinations of crosslinking, thermal treatment, sterilization and/or addition of biocompatible stabilizers. The UHMWPE modifications are expected to improve the polymer's resistance to oxidative degradation and wear (release of microparticles from the polymer surface). This manuscript provides an objective, non-commercial comparison of current UHMWPE formulations currently employed in total knee replacements. UHMWPE liners from 21 total knee replacements (TKR) were collected which represent the most implanted liners in the Czech Republic in the period 2020-2021. The UHMWPEs were characterized using several methods: infrared microspectroscopy (IR), non-instrumented and instrumented microindentation hardness testing (MH and MHI), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and solubility measurements. The above-listed methods yielded quite complete information about the structure and properties of each UHMWPE type, including its potential long-term oxidation resistance. For each UHMWPE liner, IR yielded information about immediate oxidative degradation (in the form of oxidation index, OI), level of crosslinking (trans-vinylene index, VI) and crystallinity (CI). The MH and MHI testing gave information about the impact of structure changes on mechanical properties. The remaining methods (DSC, TGA, and solubility measurements) provided additional information regarding the structure changes and resistance to long-term oxidative degradation. Statistical evaluation showed significant differences among the samples as well as interesting correlations among the UHMWPE modifications, structural changes, and mechanical performance. Surprisingly enough, UHMWPE materials from different manufacturers showed quite different properties, including the resistance against the long-term oxidative degradation, which is regarded as one of the main reasons of TJR failures. The most promising UHMWPE types were crosslinked materials with biocompatible stabilizers. Current UHMWPE liners from different manufactures used in total knee replacements exhibit significantly different structure and properties. From the point of view of clinical practice, the traditional UHMWPE types, which contained residual radicals from irradiation and/or gamma sterilization, showed inferior resistance to oxidative degradation and should be avoided. The best properties were observed in modern UHMWPE types, which combined crosslinking, biocompatible stabilizers, and sterilization by ethylenoxide or gas plasma.

Microfracture was performed in 16 patients and retrograde subchondral drilling was performed in 12 patients that there was no loss of integrity in the cartilage layer or cartilage layer is partially preserved during ankle arthroscopy. Postoperative evaluations of the patients were done with Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) and results of both group were compared statistically. The mean activities of daily living scale was 93.4±3.2 and sportive activity scale was 90.1±5.7 in the retrograde drilling group. In the micro-fracture group, mean activities of daily living scale was 93.8±4.1 and mean sportive activity scale was 88.9±9.5.

It has been determined that the size and preservation of the integrity of talar osteochondral lesions are important factors on clinical results. Results of arthroscopic debridement, microfracture and drilization are not good in lesions larger than 1.5 cm2 and lesions with impaired integrity. In our study, depending on the general literature, osteochondral lesions in talus were less than 1.5 cm2 in patients who underwent arthroscopic micro fracture and retrograde drilling.

A total of 120 patients diagnosed and treated for PM fracture, encompassing less than 25% of the distal tibial ASR area, were selected from our hospital's records spanning from September 2021 to June 2023. These people were subsequently divided into two groups, namely the control group (group A) and the observation group (group B), based on the distinct treatment methods employed, with each group consisting of 60 patients. The people in the group A were treated with posterior malleolus non internal fixation, while the patients in the group B were treated with posterior malleolus screw internal fixation. The visual analog scores, peak plantar pressure and AOFAS scores of the two groups were subjected to comparison. The visual analog scores in the observation group at 6 months and 12 months after operation were reduced than the group A. Three months after operation, the peak plantar pressure of the affected foot (full foot, hind foot) in the group B was reduced than that of the healthy foot; There was a lack of statistically significant variation observed in the peak plantar pressure (full foot, hind foot) between the affected foot and the healthy foot 12 months after operation in the group B, and the plantar pressure tended to be balanced. Three months after operation, the peak plantar pressure of the affected foot (full foot, hind foot) in the group A was reduced than that of the healthy foot; After a period of 12 months following the surgical procedure, no notable disparity in the maximum pressure exerted on the sole of the foot was observed between the foot that underwent the operation and the unaffected foot in the group A, but the peak plantar pressure of the whole foot was reduced than that of the healthy foot, and the plantar pressure did not tend to be balanced.

RESULTSDerotational subtrochanteric osteotomy alone always resulted in improvement of clinical status and an increase in Wiberg's CE angle by 10 degrees on average.Patients with marginal or high dislocation showed best results when the hip joint was reconstructed before the age of 9 years.In three hips a recurrent dislocation occurred gradually within one year of surgery.These patients fell back to stage II of the Vojta classification found preoperatively.During the next three years, three more hips developed a recurrent dislocation and two showed lateralization (20 %). DISCUSSIONReconstructive surgery for neurogenic dislocation in patients over 10 years of age is associated with problems, as is derotation combined with varus osteotomy in abductor insufficiency.On the other hand, derotational subtrochanteric osteotomy alone is indicated particularly in children over 10 years, in whom it corrects hip joint anteversion and improves gait. CONCLUSIONSComplete reconstructive procedures should be considered in the first 10 years of life when neither the femoral head nor the acetabulum are markedly changed.Derotative osteotomy alone is preferred to procedures combined with varus osteotomy.In walking adolescent patients, derotative femoral osteotomy alone is recommended; this can exceptionally be used at earlier age if marked asymmetry is present.",

    "abstract": "The patient, a 52-year-old male foreign citizen working as a construction worker, was attacked by his coworker who had fired a drive stud, 70 mm long, with reverse hooks from a powered gun at him; the stud pierced the worker's spine at the scapular level. The patient was taken to the nearest surgical ward. On the basis of clinical presentation and X-ray of the thoracic spine, the diagnosis of penetrating injury to the spinal column at the 7th thoracic vertebra level was made. Subsequently, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit of our department. On admission the patients showed slight paresis of the right lower extremity and hypesthesia of the right thigh, but no other neurological deficit. After preoperative examination, the patient was operated on within six hours of the injury. Intraoperatively, a 3-mm-thick stud, piercing the T7 vertebral arch, was found on the left side, lateral to the T7 spinous process. After partial resection of the arch around the stud, the spinal canal was inspected. The stud passed paramedially on the right side through the dura mater and the centre of the spinal cord into the body of the 7th thoracic vertebra. The stud was gently removed. Subsequently, some sanguineous liquor appeared. The dura mater was sutured and the wound was closed layer by layer. The postoperative period was uneventful, and the patient was allowed to stand up on day 2. The drain was removed on day 4. Healing by first intention took place. At 6 weeks after surgery slight neurological deficit still remained. Key words: spinal penetrating injury, spinal gunshot injury.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYIn the period from 06/00 to 08/02, 31 patients with odontoid fractures type Anderson II and III were treated and stastically recorded.25 patients were followed up; the progess of 24, documented in detail radiographically, were evaluated independently by a traumatologist and by a radiologist.The usual time of immobilization when treating odontoid fractures type Anderson type II and III with the halo-fixator is 12 weeks.For this 12 weeks that it is worn, objective assessment of bone healing is performed radiographically and the results critically considered in terms of the length of time that the halo-fixator should be worn and whether this duration should be altered on the basis of the clinical and radiological results obtained. MATERIALS AND METHODS16 patients with an odontoid fracture type Anderson type II were treated partly with a halo-fixator and partly by additional operative stabilization.15 patients with a type III fracture were treated in a halo over 12 weeks.At the time of the accident the patients to be treated had to have conventional radiographic examination and a CT scan as well as a position check following reduction.After 4, 8 and 12 weeks radiographic and CT investigation was repeated.These findings were evaluated independently by a surgeon and a radiologist.The clinical follow-up was carried out using the VAS Score and, in addition, the general activity level before and after the accident was recorded in a similar way on the Tegner/Lysholm subjective activity score. RESULTSIn most cases, according to the CT scan, the osseous bridging decreased again between the 8th and 12th weeks, as defined by resorption zones seen during the fracture healing period.Radiological evidence of complete osseous bridging was only seen after 12 weeks in three cases. CONCLUSIONConventional radiography does not seem to us to be the most suitable technical means to evaluate osseous healing in odontoid fractures.The CT is more reliable for this.According to our radiological results, osseous healing of different types of odontoid fractures takes more than 12 weeks.Despite of its known complications, the halo fixator is still a good instrument for the treatment of odontoid fractures.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe triangular fibrocartilaginous complex (TFCC) can be injured either due to trauma or by chronic strain.Based on these findings, Palmer devised a classification system distinguishing traumatic (I) and degenerative (II) TFCC lesions.Traumatic TFCC injury may be single or involved in a combined injury of the distal radius.The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of surgical treatment in patients with traumatic TFCC injury at six-month follow-up. MATERIAL AND METHODSIn the years 2000 to 2004, 23 patients with injury to the wrist were treated.The group comprised 16 men and 7 women at an average age of 34 years (range, 17 to 54 years).Nine patients were diagnosed with a distal radial fracture and 14 had no damage to the bony structures.Of these, seven showed clinical signs of TFCC injury and were indicated to acute arthroscopy of the wrist.The remaining seven, due to persisting complaints, were examined by arthroscopy within 3 months of injury.During the arthroscopic procedure, the Palmer type of injury was identified and arthroscopic treatment, open or closed, was carried out at the same stage.All patients were followed up for 6 months for pain relief and return to full physical activity. RESULTSThe arthroscopic examination revealed the following TFCC lesions: 11 central ruptures (I.A), 6 ulnar tears (I.B), 4 palmar (I.C) and 2 radial (I.D) avulsions.During arthroscopy, partial resection of the disc was performed in 13 cases (I.A, I.D), and reattachment of the disc to the styloid process of the ulna was carried out in six cases (I.B).In four of these patients the intervention was done at the stage of acute lesion within 4 weeks of injury, and in two within a longer period.Four patients with type I.C injuries underwent open disc reattachment from the palmar approach.Subjective evaluation showed that 65 % of the patients had no complaints, 26 % reported pain after excessive activity and 9 % had pain associated with daily activities.Nome of the patients reported rest pain. DISCUSSIONIn our group, 91 % of the patients reported excellent and very good results at six months of follow-up.The two patients experiencing pain in daily activities (9 %) had type I.B. injury and were indicated for arthroscopy at a time longer than 6 weeks after injury. CONCLUSIONSTFCC lesions are wrist injuries which, if diagnosed early and treated appropriately, show good healing.If the triangular fibrocartilage complex is damaged by a central tear, disc resection gives good results.However, if the distal radioulnar ligaments are torn, their reattachment is necessary in order to prevent instability of the distal radioulnar joint.Open surgical procedures interfere with integrity of the distal radioulnar joint ligaments, which may lead to joint instability and prolonged healing.",

    "abstract": "The authors evaluate the long-term results of metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP) arthroplasty of the second to fifth digits in the rheumatoid hand in relation to the factors that have a long-term effect on implant function.In a group of 41 patients, 52 hands were treated with a total of 166 Swanson silastic MCP implants in the period from 1988 to 2005. The average follow-up was 3.2 years (range, 6 months to 17 years). Arthroplasty was carried out exclusively for the indication of rheumatoid destruction of MCP joints.The patients were assessed for the range of motion, MCP joint alignment and functional and radiographic findings. Xray images were examined for osseous lesions at the margins of resected parts, implant position and its state and joint alignment. Radiography was performed from the standard distance in anteroposterior and oblique projections. Subjective satisfaction of the patients was evaluated on the basis of a questionnaire, in which hand function, pain and cosmetic appearance were recorded.The function and mobility of the fingers improved after surgery, with an increased range of motion in MCP joints towards extension (average range, 3 degrees to 51 degrees flexion), and correction of an ulnar drift of the MCP joint of each finger (average, 5.8 degrees ). Radiographs showed destruction of silastic implants in 13.3 % of the fingers treated. The subjective evaluation by patients was satisfactory. Long-lasting pain relief was reported by 79 % and satisfaction with hand function by 90 % of the patients. Improvement in a cosmetic appearance of the hand was also significant.At long-term follow-up, a gradual decrease in the range of motion of MCP joints and a partial recurrence of ulnar drift usually occur at about 2 years. However, in most cases, they do not result in either subjective complaints or functional restriction. These findings are in agreement with the results published in the relevant literature.The silastic implant remains a standard procedure in surgical reconstruction of the MCP joints in the rheumatoid hand. Improvements in the range of motion and joint alignment and alleviation of pain result in a markedly improved hand function and patients' satisfaction. The long-term outcome of MCP joint arthroplasty is significantly influenced by the severity of rheumatoid arthritis.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to analyze a group of patients who had undergone multilevel osteotomy of long bones and medication therapy for osteogenesis imperfecta (OI).The group included 14 OI patients (nine girls and five boys) operated on in the years 1996 to 2006, who ranged in age from 3 to 17 years (average, 8.2 years). Due to residual deformation following a fracture of or because of treatment for acute trauma to long bones of the lower extremities, the patients underwent multilevel osteotomy with the use of osteosynthesis (Prevot's rod, six patients; Kirschner's wire, three patients; Küntcher's nail, three patients; Rush's nail, one patient; condylar plate, one patient). A special working and rehabilitation program played an important role in the therapeutic protocol. Four patients treated after 2003 received Pamidronate.Sufficient correction of axil deformity of the legs and equal leg length resulting in gait improvement were achieved in 11 patients. In one patient, osteosynthesis with a condylar plate failed and it was necessary to apply intramedullary elastic fixation. In one patient, tibia vara developed following Küntcher's nail osteosynthesis. In one patient, disunion of bone from osteosynthetic material, with a subsequent supracondylar fracture under the Küntcher's nail, was recorded. Pamidronate administered in pre- and post-operative periods to the four patients treated after 2003 reduced the need for their immobilization from 6 to 3 weeks, which permitted early rehabilitation and, in one patient, first standing and walking at the age of 12 years.The treatment of long bone fractures in OI patients is based on the assumptions that bone healing is not affected and that long immobilization leads to deterioration of osteopenia and to a risk of further fractures. For these reasons, surgical procedures using intramedullary fixation have recently been preferred. Pamidronate administration alleviates pain, improves muscle tonus, reduces the period of immobilization and enhances bone density.The multidisciplinary, rational approach, which involves early surgical intramedullary fixation of fractures with subsequent rehabilitation and Pamidronate administration, is considered to provide a more effective therapy with better results and therefore better quality of life in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSThe presented study compared two groups; hand scrubbing with sensory tap was enrolled as group A and classic tap with running water was enrolled as group B. Three participants were included in each group.Operation faucets with a motion-sensitive sensor and timekeeper were used in group A. Running water from a tap in 10 seconds was measured with the help of a measuring cup.The water amount after 3 minutes of washing was also measured.The difference between the two obtained data was compared.The obtained data were also multiplied to the global surgical data. RESULTSMeasurements were performed with a measuring cup and it was measured that 1,250 ml of water is running from faucets in 10 seconds.In group A, faucets were open for 23 seconds whereas in group B faucets were open for 180 seconds.In group A, water utilization was 2,875 ml per person (8,625 ml for three), in group B was the water utilization of 22,500 ml per person (67,500 ml for three).Regarding this data for a single operation, the consumption difference between the two groups was measured as 58,875 ml.The total count of major surgery worldwide per year is reported to 321,500,000.When this number is multiplied with the obtained data, it is calculated that the total amount of water to be saved between the two groups is 18,928,313 m 3 .That is equal to one year of water consumption of a city with 125,000 inhabitants. CONCLUSIONSIn conclusion, as healthcare professionals, it is possible to save enough water as a medium-sized city by changing our handwashing habits in the operation rooms.As a result, water-conserving systems and hand scrubbing education can be very effective in using the natural resources economically and protecting these resources.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSWe developed a new method of measuring the CCD angle and femoral neck version of the femur.This was done with the use of a computer program that utilised the measurement of the entire visualised area of femoral neck and shaft to calculate their long axis.Using this method, we measured the CCD angle and femoral neck version (FNV) of 100 photographed cadaveric femurs in two projections: The condylar line (CL) projection and the femoral neck (FN) projection.The same method was applied to 50 radiographs of the same femurs.The femurs were divided into three groups depending on the femoral neck version: Retro (FNV of <0°), Normal (FNV of 0-15°) and Ante (FNV of >15°) RESULTSWe found a statistically significant difference in the CCD angle measured in the FN and CL projections in the Normal and Ante groups but not in the Retro group.There is a significant correlation between the increase in FNV and the difference between the measured CCD values in the FL and CL projections.The femoral neck version of our cadaveric femurs varied from -14. 4° to 31.5° which is a range of more than 35°. CONCLUSIONSFrom the results, it is clear that with an increase in femoral neck anteversion, there is a statistically significant difference in the CCD angle measured between the two projections.This difference can be up to almost 10°.Surgeons should be aware of the limitation of the AP projection when planning for surgery on the hip.",

The patients were assessed using the subjective IKDC score and the side-to-side difference (SSD) in ventral laxity was measured by Genourob (GNRB) laximeter at the applied pressure of 134 N and 250 N.Moreover, the failure rate of RAMP lesion repair, ACL graft, necessity of secondary partial meniscectomy and return to pre-injury level of sport were analysed. RESULTSThe median IKDC score increased in Group 1 from 56 points preoperatively to 92 points postoperatively and in Group 2 from 58 points preoperatively to 90 points postoperatively (p>0.05).The median value of SSD in ventral laxity of the knee measured by the GNRB laximeter at the applied pressure of 134 N in Group 1 was 5.6 mm preoperatively and 1.9 mm postoperatively and in Group 2 it was 5.9 mm preoperatively and 2.3 mm postoperatively.At the pressure of 250 N, the median value in Group 1 was 7.9 mm preoperatively and 2.7 mm postoperatively and in Group 2 it was 8.1 mm preoperatively and 3.2 mm postoperatively.When comparing the SSD of the groups postoperatively, no statistically significant difference was found (p>0.05).Revision arthroscopy was performed in 8 patients.In 1 patient (2.4 %) in Group 1 and in 4 patients (11.1%) in Group 2 a rerupture of the RL of the meniscus occurred and partial meniscectomy was performed.In Group 2, statistically significant higher occurrence of the RL suture failure (p<0.05) was reported and there was a need to perform partial medial meniscectomy (p<0.05).The ACL graft failure was observed in 2 patients (4.7%) in Group 1 and in 3 patients (8.3%) in Group 2 (p>0.05).31 evaluated patients (73.8%) from Group 1 and 24 patients (66.7%) from Group 2 (p>0.05)returned to the pre-injury level of sports activities. DISCUSSIONWhen comparing the outcomes of individual techniques of the RL repair published in recent literature with our conclusions, we may state that the results of subjective as well as objective criteria achieved were similar to those reported by other authors worldwide.No study has so far been published which would compare the outcomes of the by us presented two surgical techniques of the RL suture in an ACL-deficient knee with a minimum follow-up of 24 months. CONCLUSIONSBoth the surgical techniques of unstable RL repair in combination with the ACLR using a tendon graft result in a statistically significant improvement of clinical outcomes postoperatively.In Group 2, with the all-inside RL repair, a statistically significant higher failure rate of RL repair was confirmed as well as the need to perform secondary partial meniscectomy compared to Group 1.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare the efficiency of different surgical approaches to thoracic disc herniation, and to show the role of segmental fusion and selection of an appropriate microsurgical decompression technique for the successful outcome of surgery.A group of 27 patients, 10 men and 17 women, between 31 and 70 years (average age, 49.33 years) were included in this prospective study. They underwent surgery for thoracic degeneration disc disease in the period from June 1994 to August 2008.In all patients, the severity of myelopathy was assessed using the grading Frankel system and JOA score, axial and radicular pain intensity was evaluated with VAS and ODI rating systems. The diagnosis was established on the basis of thoracic spine radiography, thoracic spine MRI and a CT scan of the segment. A total of 30 thoracic segments, in the range of Th4/Th5 to Th12/L1, were indicated for surgery. Localisation of the hernia was medial at 19 segments, mediolateral at three and lateral at eight segments. Soft disc herniation was found in 17 cases and hard disc protrusion at the remaining 13 segments. Surgery for significant myelopathy was carried out in 23 patients and for pain in four patients. According to the surgical procedure used, the patients were allocated to two groups: group A comprised 10 patients treated without disc replacement through a laminectomy or a costotransversectomy exposure, and group B consisted of 17 patients undergo- ing intersomatic fusion via a thoracotomy. Clinical and radiographic examinations were made at regular intervals for at least 1 year of follow-up. The results of clinical assessment, including JOA scores, JOA Recovery Rate, VAS scores at rest and after exercise and ODI, were statistically analysed for each group and compared.There was a statistically significant difference in JOA evaluation of myelopathy between the groups in group A, the mean JOA score declined from 7.9 to 7.0, i.e., -0.9 point, while in group B it increased from 6.71 to 9.12, i.e., +2.41 points. The mean JOA Recovery Rate did not reach a plus value in group A, while in group B it improved by 55 %. JOA Recovery Rate: Of the seven patients in group A evaluated for myelopathy, a fair result was in one, unchanged in two and worse in four patients. Of the 16 patients evaluated for myelopathy in group B, the results were excellent in four, good in six, fair in four and unchanged in two patients. Frankel grade function: In group A, one patient improved by one grade, two remained unchanged, two deteriorated by one grade and two by two grades. In group B, five patients improved by one grade, two patients by two grades and two patients by three grades. Eight patients remained unchanged and no patient deteriorated. The post-operative pain intensity, as assessed by the mean VAS score, was lower at rest and after exercise in both groups; the score was better in group B, but the difference was not statistically significant. The ODI was evaluated only in group B its mean value improved from 41.4% to 26.1%, i.e., by 15.3%.Between 7 to 15 % of the patients have asymptomatic thoracic disc herniation, while symptomatic herniation is very rare and accounts for only 0.25 % to 0.57 % of herniated discs in the whole spine. Severe or progressive myelopathy is a clear indication for surgical intervention in thoracic disc herniation, but the role of surgery in pain control is controversial. There are five approaches for thoracic disc herniation. Transpleural anterolateral thoracotomy has an advantage over the other methods because it permits the treatment of all types of herniation, whether localised centrally, laterally or contralaterally, i.e., soft, calcified or sequestered intradural disc herniation. The results of treatment will depend on the outcome of surgical spinal cord decompression and the degree of spinal stabilisation achieved.The surgical procedure via thoracotomy with intersomatic fusion resulted in a statistically more significant improvement of myelopathy than the posterior approach without disc replacement, and it provided greater pain relief. The authors recommend to treat thoracic disc herniation by discectomy via a thoracotomy and by intersomatic fusion.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYPatellar dislocation is a fairly frequent knee joint injury in young patients.In most cases, this injury can be treated conservatively or surgically.In many cases, patellar cartilage or lateral femoral condyle or both these parts of articular surface are injured, and in conservative treatment this chondral damage very often remains undiagnosed.The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of treatment in patients who underwent surgery for patellar dislocation and in whom extensive traumatic cartilage lesions of the patella were found. MATERIAL AND METHODSThe authors carry out a retrospective evaluation of outcomes in 34 patients from the period 2005-2014, in whom extensive chondral defect of the posterior side of the patella after its traumatic dislocation with the mean size of 4.1 cm 2 (the maximum size was 28x18 mm) was found, namely in 21 women and 13 men aged 13-28 years.The patients were indicated for arthroscopic surgery based on the clinical examination which revealed a clear traumatic patellar dislocation.In 2 radiographs only, an osteochondral fragment was found, and in these patients a CT scan of the injured knee was made.The patients were retrospectively broken down into 3 sub-groups by the method of treatment of the chondral defect.The mean size of the defect in the debridement group was 2.7 cm 2 compared to 4.6 cm 2 in the group with cartilage fixation.In group I reinsertion through MiniSynthes 2.0 screws (5 patients) was performed, in group II reinsertion of the chondral fragment was done using transosseous PDS sutures (19 patients), in group III debridement of injured cartilage was carried out (10 patients). RESULTSThe patients were assessed postoperatively using Kujala score and IKDC score.The mean age of patients at the time of injury was 19.6 years, with mean follow-up of 30.2 months.No group reported limitations of range of motion at the time of evaluation.Knee pain under load was present in 3 patients in group I, in 1 patient in group II and in 7 patients in group III.No patient suffered from another patellar dislocation.The mean Kujala score was 84.7 (group I), 89.3 (group II), and 78.5 (group III).The IKDC was 84.6 in group I, 87.2 in group II, and 74.3 in group III.At the time of evaluation, pre-injury activities were resumed by 72% of patients from group I, 82% of patients from group II, and 69% of patients from group III. DISCUSSIONTreatment of primary patellar dislocation is still subject to discussions on whether to pursue conservative or surgical treatment.The main topic of studies is the subsequent rate of patellar re-dislocation and the rate of cartilage damage in patellofemoral joint, examined is also the scope of performed surgery, while only very few papers focus on treating the injured cartilage of the patella.Despite numerous studies, the optimal method of treatment of this injury has been identified as yet. CONCLUSIONSWhere a serious, extensive fragment of patellar cartilage is found, the fixation of cartilage with the use of transosseous PDS sutures brings very good and good results, without the necessity of another surgery, while the simultaneous treatment of medial patellar retinacula considerably decreases the risk of patellar re-dislocation, thus reducing the risk of further damage to cartilage of patelofemoral joint.The use of transosseous suture fixation is considered by the authors to be more appropriate than the use of screws, mostly because no further surgery to remove fixation screws is necessary.",

The female patient healed with no complications, showing an excellent clinical outcome with no signs of instability or limited mobility of hip joints, and also with no signs of para-articular calcification or necrosis of the hip at 1 year after the injury and treatment. Bilateral asymmetric dislocation of hip joint is a rare injury with the total incidence of 150 cases as reported by the literature. Recently, its incidence is higher due to the increased traffic and the associated accident rate. A precise and prompt reduction of the injured hip joint is always necessary, if possible under general anesthesia. Also, it is always necessary to carry out a complete examination of the patient since this type of injury is always caused by a strong force and is often accompanied by injuries of other parts of the body.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A single-centre retrospective cohort study carried out from 1.1.2010 to 31.12.2014 enrolled adult patients with septic spondylitis, discitis and facet joint infections. Recorded parameters included: demographics, chronic comorbidities, time to diagnosis, radiological work-up, anatomical level of spinal infection, source of infection, etiological agent, complications, treatment and outcomes. RESULTS Fifty-four patients were enrolled, 35 men (65%) and 19 women (35%), age range 33-90, mean age 63 years. Forty patients (74.1%) had a chronic comorbidity, 20 patients (37%) were obese. Time to diagnosis ranged between 1-90 days, mean 16.3 days. The diagnosis was assessed with MRI in 41 (75.9%) and CT in 11 patients (20.4%). Lumbosacral spine was affected in 38 (70.4%), thoracic in 14 (25.5%), cervical in 8 patients (14.8%), and 6 patients (11.1%) had a multilevel disease. Epidural abscess developed in 28 (51.9%), paravertebral oedema or abscess in 41 patients (75.9%). Endocarditis was diagnosed in 8 patients (14.8%). Aetiology was identified in 45 patients (83.3%), with Staphylococcus aureus isolated in 29 patients (53.7%). Twenty-two patients (40.7%) were treated surgically in addition to antibiotics. The mean length of hospital stay, parenteral antibiotic treatment and total antibiotic treatment was 48.7, 38.2 and 71.5 days, respectively. Thirty-six patients (66.6%) recovered with no or mild sequelae, 7 (13%) with severe sequelae, and 11 patients (20.4%) died. None of the analysed variables proved to be a statistically significant predictive factor of clinical outcome. DISCUSSION In accordance with previous studies pyogenic spinal infections were diagnosed mainly in elderly with chronic internal comorbidities, mostly with magnetic resonance imaging, they were often localized in lumbar spine, with staphylococci being the leading agents. In spite of unavailable CT-navigated biopsy, the aetiology was discovered in majority of patients. In contrast, this study found a more frequent posterior segments involvement, a shorter time to treatment, no tuberculous cases, a relatively high case fatality ratio, but less sequelae and no relapse. CONCLUSIONS The study confirmed an increasing incidence of pyogenic spinal infections, known predisposing factors, importance of MRI in diagnostics, disease predilection in lumbar spine, staphylococcal predominance in causative pathogens, and a relatively high case fatality ratio. Although time to treatment was not proved to be a negative predictive factor of clinical outcome, it is an imperative to strive for an early diagnosis and treatment. Predictors of clinical outcome have to be evaluated in a more extensive cohort of patients. Key words: spinal infection, discitis, spondylitis, spondylodiscitis, epidural abscess, psoas muscle abscess.",

    "abstract": "To present the results of shortening scarf osteotomy of the fifth metatarsal as an option for the treatment of forefoot deformities with calluses and associated pain around the fifth metatarsal head.In nine patients, 12 osteotomies were performed between 2004 and 2007.The results were evaluated at the end of 2009. One patient had one-stage bilateral surgery two had two-stage bilateral surgery.Surgical treatment was indicated in patients in whom conservative treatment had failed, and after the evaluation of load radiographs of the forefoot. The operation (sec. Barouk) is standardly performed from a longitudinal incision and involves the excision of two bone blocks, 3 to 4 mm in width, from both fifth metatarsal fragments after the osteotomy. Fixation is achieved with two Poldi screws from mini-instrumentation.The procedure can be combined with surgery on the other metatarsals. The lower extremity is then immobilised in a cast for 3 weeks. Partial weight-bearing on the heel is allowed from the second post-operative day and full weight-bearing is permitted after X-ray examination at 6 weeks. The average hospital stay is four days.Nine patients (12 feet) underwent surgery. The average follow-up was 3.8 years (2 to 5). The average inter-metatarsal angle was 13 degrees before surgery and 4 degrees after it. The average valgus angle of the fifth metatarsophalangeal joint was 25 degrees pre-operatively and 5 degrees post-operatively. The average metatarsal shortening was 6.5 mm.Shortening shaft osteotomy allows for maximal medial translation of the fifth metatarsal and maximal correction of the angle between the fourth and fifth metatarsals. At one stage it permits metatarsal head medialisation, as does chevron osteotomy, as well as proximal translation of the head achieved by Weil osteotomy. The results of shortening scarf osteotomy have been better than those of an isolated Weil procedure, chevron osteotomy or bunionectomy. Percutaneous Krammer's method, BRT, shaft and proximal osteotomies are still discussed.Shortening scarf osteotomy of the fifth metatarsal is indicated when conservative treatment is unsuccessful in management of calluses and fifth metatarsal head deformities, particularly in flat-footedness. It can also be used in salvage procedures following failed surgery or in digitus quintus supraductus in adults. It requires experience with first metatarsal osteotomy and a precise operative technique.",

    "abstract": "Shoulder instability adversely affects the quality of life and restricts the functional capacity of the upper extremity involved. Today stabilisation surgery is almost always performed arthroscopically. The aim of this study was to present our experience with arthroscopic stabilisation of the shoulder and to identify risk factors responsible for its failure.The group of 110 patients with recurrent anterior dislocation of the shoulder, who were treated between January 2007 and December 2010, consisted of 19 women and 91 men with an average age of 27 years (range, 14 to 56) at the time of surgery. Patients who had a concomitant tear of the rotator cuff or of the long head tendon of the biceps were excluded from the study. The minimum follow-up period was 2 years. The patients were evaluated for signs of clinical instability. Function was evaluated using WOSI, Constant-Murley and Rowe-Zarins. Statistical methods were used to assess factors leading to failed arthroscopic stabilisation.At final follow-up, 17 patients (17 shoulders, 15.3%) had re-dislocation or subluxation of the joint treated. Age over 20 years reduced the probability of re-dislocation (odds ratio, OR=0.87; p=0.021) while the finding of an engaging Hill-Sachs lesion increased the risk of re-dislocation (OR=5.53; p=0.0028). The presence of a bony Bankart lesion had only a marginal effect on the probability of re-dislocation (p=0.0512). In stable shoulders the average pre-operative values improved to the final follow-up values as follows: WOSI index, 53.65 ± 5.6 to 94.8 ± 5.2 (p<0.0001); Constant-Murley score, 78.9 ± 6.1 to 95.6 ± 4.4 (p<0.0001); and Rowe-Zarins score, 53.3 ± 6.7 to 92.9 ± 7.8 (p<0.0001). No peri-operative complication was recorded.Our study confirmed the role of 3D CT examination before arthroscopic stabilisation of the shoulder joint. The exact identification of bone injury and its extent is of prognostic importance. At the same time special attention should be paid to surgical and post-operative tactics in patients operated on before their 20 years of age. On the other hand, no risks were found to be associated with gender, sports activities, the number of previous dislocations, types of anchors, suture material or knot tying.Arthroscopic stabilisation of the shoulder significantly relieves pain and improves shoulder function in 85% of the patients with anterior shoulder dislocation. The risk that this stabilisation surgery will fail increases with lower age of the patient and the presence of an engaging Hill-Sachs lesion.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the mid-term results in a group of selected patients undergoing corrective surgery for juvenile hallux valgus, using double osteotomy of the first metatarsal.The group included eight patients, seven girls and one boy, with a more severe form of this deformity treated by double osteotomy of the first metatarsal between 2010 and 2013. The indication for corrective surgery was serious pain when walking; all patients had previously undergone conservative treatment with no effect. All patients had pre-operative clinical examination, the affected foot was X-rayed with the patient standing and radiographic assessments of the intermetatarsal and hallux valgus angles were made. The evaluation of treatment outcomes was based on the scoring system of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) and X-ray images of the foot. The average follow-up was 37 months.Post-operatively, none of the patients reported pain while walking, only two of them experienced pain during sports activities. The average post-operative AOFAS score was 92 points. Both the intermetatarsal angle and the hallux valgus angle improved after surgery in all patients, with two reporting only mild hallux valgus deformity. One patient showed postoperative restriction of motion at the first metatarsophalangeal joint. This was the only complication recorded in association with the surgery.Almost all authors dealing with the treatment of hallux valgus deformity primarily prefer conservative therapy. However, this treatment is usually not very effective in severe forms of the disorder. Surgical management is indicated in symptomatic patients or in those with severe juvenile hallux valgus deformity. In paediatric patients it is necessary to respect the presence of an epiphyseal growth plate in the first proximal metatarsal and therefore it is often preferred to use distal first metatarsal osteotomy. At our department, Mitchell's osteotomy for hallux valgus deformity is usually used. However, post-operative outcomes are not satisfactory in severe forms of juvenile hallux valgus in which a high proportion of recurrent deformities is probably related to the growth potential of a juvenile bone. In such cases we use the Peterson and Newman procedure of double first metatarsal osteotomy, which can correct all three components of the deformity while maintaining functional first metatarsal length. This is a great advantage of the method. Although its authors have not reported any post-operative complications, the occurrence of restricted motion in the first metatarsophalangeal joint has been described in the relevant literature. The problem was also recorded in one patient of our group.Deformities of the forefoot and big toe are frequent orthopaedic disorders in children and adolescents. The results of this study confirm that the double first metatarsal osteotomy is an effective method of surgical treatment for serious hallux valgus deformities in paediatric and adolescent patients.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY A consensual classification of the periprosthetic interface membrane obtained at revision total joint arthroplasty was published by Morawietz et al. in 2006. Based on histomorphological criteria, four types of periprosthetic membrane were proposed: type I, aseptic failure; type II, septic failure; type III, combined type (carrying signs of both type I and II); and type IV, indeterminate type. The aim of this study was to find out whether and to what extent the Morawietz system would be suitable for use at an independent institution involved in the evaluation of periprosthetic membranes for a long time. Should it appear that the institution achieved an equally good or even better agreement between the clinical diagnosis and the histopathological finding, this consensus classification could be recommended for routine use. MATERIAL AND METHODS The samples of periprosthetic tissue evaluated in this study were obtained during surgery from the following groups of patients: 66 patients with aseptic loosening of total hip (THA) or knee arthroplasty, 15 patients with infection of THA, 16 patients with THA without any signs of aseptic loosening, osteolysis or infection; 8 patients with hip osteoarthritis and 8 patients with knee osteoarthritis. Sample collection and processing (for purposes of histomorphological evaluation and immunohistochemical staining) was performed according to the established protocol. The tissue samples evaluation was made by an experienced pathologist hand in hand with the method described in the original paper by Morawietz et al. For a more detailed tissue analysis, selected antibodies (CD4, CD8, CD20, IFN-γ and Hsp-60) were visualized by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS The majority of samples from aseptic reoperations were classified as membranes of the type I (79%) and III (16%). Specimens retrieved from septic cases were mostly classified as membranes of type II and III (60% together). The septic membranes showed a significantly higher expression of CD20 protein when compared with both the aseptic (p < 0.0001) and control THA samples (p = 0.003). The membranes retrieved from the surroundings of a stable THA without osteolysis and infection had lower expression levels of Hsp60 and IFN-γ, when compared with those from both aseptic and septic loosening. Finally, Hsp-60 expression was significantly higher in osteoarthritic tissue than in samples from stable THA (p = 0.041). DISCUSSION Morawietz et al. proposed a standardized classification system for evaluation of periprosthetic tissue. As any attempt at generalization of a complex issue, this proposal has certain shortcomings. One of these is poor detection of chronic and low-grade infections. A method that would improve the conventional counting of polymorphonuclear leukocytes is still being sought. In this connection, immunostaining for CD20 combined with an assessment of antimicrobial peptides may be a promising option. The supplementary specimen staining showed that pseudosynovial tissue is much more active in patients carrying infection and the least active in samples from stable THA in which certain tolerance and thus tissue homeostasis might be expected. CONCLUSIONS 1. In this study the distribution of findings classified according to the Morawietz system was similar to the results published in the original study from 2006. 2. The definition of an aseptic membrane (type I) in the Morawietz system meets the requirements of clinical practice (agreement, about 80%). 3. An increased sensitivity for infectious membrane detection can be achieved by using supplementary immunohistochemical staining effective particularly in chronic and low-grade infections. 4. Painless and stable THAs typically have very low expression levels of CD4, CD20 and Hsp-60 proteins, and interferon- -gamma (IFN-γ) as well. Key words: total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, aseptic loosening, prosthetic joint infection, tissue analysis, membranes, CD receptors, Hsp-60 protein, IFN-γ.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYA comparison of the efficacy of central anatomical single-bundle (CASB) reconstruction with that of double-bundle (DB) repair of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in relation to knee stability in anteroposterior translation (APT), internal rotation (IR) and external rotation (ER) of the joint. MATERIAL AnD METHODSA total of 40 patients were evaluated; 20 had ACL reconstruction by the CASB technique using hamstrings and 20 underwent DB repair surgery.The average age was 31.3 years, and the group included 22 men and 18 women with 19 right and 21 left knees.The KT-1000 test was used to assess the amount of APT in the knee and rotational deviations were measured by the Rolimeter.In the DB patients, measurements were performed before surgery (on joints with ACL injury), then after reconstruction of the anteromedial (AM) or the posterolateral (PL) bundle and subsequently after repair of both ACL bundles.The CASB patients were assessed before and after graft insertion. RESULTSThe average APT value was 18.5 mm for the pre-operative knees and it fell to 8.9 mm after AM bundle reconstruction.However, when the PL bundle was inserted in the first place, the average APT value was 13.1 mm only.The average values recorded after the DB and CASB reconstructions were 6.1 mm and 9.1 mm, respectively.The average IR range of motion in the pre-operative joints was 18.6 degrees.After AM bundle reconstruction it was 13.9 degrees and after PL bundle repair it was 15.3 degrees.In DB reconstruction the average IR value achieved 10.4 degrees, and in CASB repair surgery it was 13.7 degrees.The average ER range of motion in the pre-operative joints was 17.8 degrees.After AM bundle reconstruction it was 14.5 degrees and after PL bundle repair it was 14.9 degrees.In DB reconstruction the average ER value achieved 11.4 degrees, and in CASB repair surgery it was 14.5 degrees. DISCUSSIOnRotational stability of the knee after ACL reconstruction is one of the most important factors in restoring physiological kinematics of the joint after ACL injury.Since there are not many studies comparing knee rotational stability after CASB with that after DB reconstructions, the results presented here may contribute to selecting the optimal method of ACL reconstruction. COnCLUSIOnSThe results show that, in ACL reconstruction, the DB technique provides better stability to the knee, in both APT and rotation, than the CASB method.The latter has the same effect on knee stability as the presence of the AM bundle alone.When the PL bundle is added, knee stability, in both APT and internal/external rotation, is increased in comparison with central single-bundle ACL repair.",

    "abstract": "Fractures of the distal radius and distal ulna require anatomical reconstruction for good restoration of wrist and hand function. In this study we compared the results of conservative treatment with those of plate osteosynthesis management in distal ulna fractures of patients who had concomitant fractures of the distal radius indicated for plate osteosynthesis. Our objective was to specify indications for plate osteosynthesis of a distal ulna fracture in the case of an associated distal radius fracture.A total of 27 patients were evaluated. In 17 of them, distal radius fractures were treated by plate osteosynthesis and distal ulna fractures conservatively (CONS group). In 12 patients, both distal radius and distal ulna fractures were treated by plate osteosynthesis (SURG group). Osteosynthesis was carried out using an APTUS variable-angle locking system (Medartis, Basel, Switzerland). In two SURG group patients with distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability, the radius and ulna in anatomical position were secured with two Kirschner wires.Fracture union of the distal radius was achieved in all patients. Non-union of the distal ulna was recorded in one patient of each group. No secondary displacement of distal radius fragments during bone union was found in either group. Displacement of fragments during the healing of distal ulna fracture occurred in one (6.7%) patient of the CONS group. Out of the parameters evaluated, the restriction of motion below 80% of the original range in volar flexion, dorsal flection and supination was recorded in three CONS patients (20.0%) and two SURG patients (16.7%). No DRUJ instability was found. Intra-operative swelling preventing closure of surgical wounds was managed by secondary wound suture in one SURG patient (8.3%). There were no other complications.Views vary on whether the distal ulna should be treated by plate osteosynthesis when, after distal radius fixation, its fracture managed by closed reduction heals well. A distal ulna plate often causes pain and has to be removed. The acute cases of DRUJ instability caused by comminuted distal ulna fracture can be treated by osteosynthesis of the distal ulna and two Kirschner wires inserted into the fracture site in an ulnar-to-radial direction. For chronic radioulnar instability, various methods involving free tendon grafts and dynamic tenodesis are used. Other options include the Sauvé-Kapandji procedure based on inducing artificial non-union of the distal ulna diaphysis and radioulnar arthrodesis; in our modification of this technique we use a single cancellous malleolar screw. In severely comminuted fractures of the distal ulna with injury to articular cartilage, ulnar head replacement can be indicated. CONCLUSIONS Distal ulna fractures can be treated conservatively if osteosynthesis of the distal radius in the anatomical position is achieved together with anatomical reduction of bone fragments of the distal ulna. When a distal radius fracture managed by osteosynthesis is not accompanied by anatomical reduction of distal ulna fragments, or the ulna is shorter or longer than the contralateral bone, an open reduction and stabilisation using an angle-stable locking plate, set at an adequate radius-toulna length ratio, is the method of choice.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to measure the sensorimotor brain adaptation activity, shown on functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI), in relation to the degree and extent of spinal cord compression or cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) detected by cervical spine MRI.Twenty-one patients (average age, 57 years; 9 men and 12 women) with anterior cervical cord compression detected on cervical MRI scans were included. On the images, the degree of spinal canal stenosis, the spinal cord compression based on the antero-posterior diameter of the spinal canal and on transverse areas of the cervical spinal cord and cervical spinal canal, and changes in spinal cord signal intensity were identified. Clinical examination included neurological status, Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score, Neck Disability Index (NDI) and pain intensity assessment using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Electrophysiological tests involving motor evoked and sensory evoked potential (MEP and SEP) recording were conducted and, using fMRI, brain activity during movement of both arms was measured. Based on the transverse spinal cord area of above or below 70 mm2, the patients were placed into two subgroups. According to changes in spinal cord signal intensity, the patients were included into three subgroups with normal findings, incipient myelopathy and advanced myelopathy, respectively. Surgery was carried out from the anterior approach and involved cervical disc replacement. All examinations were performed again at 6 months after surgery. Pre- and post-operative results were compared within each set of subgroups and statistically evaluated.The average pre-operative values were found to increase post-operatively as follows: from 6.4 mm to 8.9 mm (by 39%) for the antero-posterior diameter of the spinal canal; from 129.3 mm2 to 162.8 mm2 (by 26%) for the transverse area of the spinal canal; from 72.6 mm2 to 87.4 mm2 (by 20%) for the transverse spinal cord area; and from 16.3 to 17.4 for the JOA score. The average NDI decreased from 37.9 to 23.7 and the average VAS fell from 6.4 to 1.5. All patients with the change of spinal cord signal that indicated advanced myelopathy also had relevant pathological findings on MEP/SEP examination and this was statistically significant. There was no significant difference in fMRI scans between the two subgroups established on the basis of transverse spinal cord area measurements. In the patients grouped by a change in spinal cord signals, the pre-operative fMRI showed a significantly higher brain activation volume in the subgroup with advanced myelopathy, as compared with the two other subgroups. Surgery resulted in a moderate reduction of the volume of active brain tissue in all three groups. In the patients with advanced myelopathy evaluated in relation to local changes in brain activation, surgery led to a significant decrease in activation volumes in the ipsilateral primary motor cortex and cerebellar hemisphere. There was also a significant increase in activation of the contralateral supplementary motor cortex.It is evident that the brain responds to spinal cord damage by increased activity, but with a certain delay. A slightly altered spinal cord signal intensity, such as in incipient myelopathy, apparently does not result in brain activation. On the other hand, significant changes in signal intensity in advanced myelopathy are related to deterioration of spinal cord function, as shown by MEP and SEP examination results, and an increase in both the volume and intensity of cortical motor activation as a compensation mechanism for myelopathy. CONCLUSIONS Hyperintense spinal cord signals on T2-weighted images correlated with the pathological spinal cord function detected by electrophysiological test in all patients. The transverse spinal cord area (around 70 mm2) showed no significant correlation with either sensory and motor brain adaptations or the results of SEP and MEP testing; therefore, as a criterion for indication to surgery it is of no value. The patients with advanced myelopathy, as detected by spinal cord MRI, had a significantly higher pre-operative cortical motor activation on fMRI than patients with normal findings or those with incipient myelopathy. In addition, the patterns of cortical motor activation altered significantly at 6 months after spinal cord decompression, which was shown by an increase or decrease in activation of the relevant motor cortex areas.",

    "abstract": "The study was designed to investigate whether anatomical variations of the anterior and posterior divisions of the internal iliac artery and their branches are associated with different risks of bleeding resulting from injury to the posterior pelvic segment.The study was carried out on 19 cadavers. The dissected area included the internal iliac artery from the common iliac artery bifurcation to the origins of the superior gluteal artery, the inferior gluteal artery and the internal pudendal artery. Using an electronic slide rule, distances between the bifurcation and the origin of each branch from either the anterior or the posterior division were measured. The diameter of each vessel was also determined. Findings of the study were compared with variations described in the literature. The degree of risk for bleeding related to different anatomical variations of the internal iliac artery and its branches was evaluated based on the proximity to the bone.There are six anatomical variations of internal iliac artery branches. Four of them were found: type A1 was recorded in 10 specimens, type A2 in six, type B1 in two and type C in one specimen. Types B2 and D were not seen.The type B2 and C anatomical variations were considered to carry higher risks of bleeding due to injury to the posterior pelvic segment. These variations are characterized by vessels larger in diameter and a longer course of the posterior division along the posterior part of the greater sciatic notch (area often involved in unstable pelvic ring fractures). On the other hand, the type C variation showed a longer internal iliac artery separated from the bone with a thick layer of soft tissue, which suggested lower risk than was attributed to the dominant type A1 variation. It was not possible to evaluate type B2 variation because it is very rare and was not found in study material. In type A2 and B1 variations, the branches were separated from bony structures similarly to the dominant type A1 variation.The cadaver study designed to assess the risk of bleeding associated with different morphological variations of the branching pattern of the internal iliac artery did not identify any anatomical arrangement that might carry a higher risk of injury to the vessels by free bone fragments of the posterior segment in unstable pelvic fractures. It can be concluded that less common branching patterns of the internal iliac artery are not associated with higher risk of bleeding than the dominant type A1 variation.",

    "abstract": "An analysis of long-term results of the all-polyethylene tibial component in Walter-Motorlet cemented condylar knee arthroplasty, with a standard tibial plateau (STP) of our own design.A total of 49 patients underwent knee replacement; of them, 35 (71.4%) with 38 Walter-Motorlet implants using the STP were evaluated. The average age at the time of evaluation was 87.3 years. The follow-up ranged from 18 to 27 years (average, 24.6 years). Mechanical properties of the STP were tested by experimental measurements and in a photoelasticimetric study. The clinical results were evaluated according to the EULAR Knee Assessment Chart (EKACH). Twenty-four patients (26 knees; 49%) had osteoarthritis (OA) and 11 (12 knees; 23%) had rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Of the 14 (28.6%) patients not included in evaluation, seven (14.3%), with seven knees, required revision arthroplasty and seven (14.3%), with 10 knees, were lost to follow-up.Of the 38 implants evaluated by the EKACH at an average of 24.6 years, subjectively, 14 (36.8%) knees were free from pain and 14 (36.8%) were mildly painful. The remaining 10 (26.4%) joints were acutely painful on walking up or down the hill. In 14 (36.8%) cases the patients experienced their knees as stable. Light domestic chores were routinely performed by 17 patients (10 OA and 7 RA; 48.6%). One (2.9%) OA patient had a full-time job, and nine (25.7%) patients were socially independent. The functional outcome was significantly related to the patient's age at the time of evaluation. Complications included STP aseptic loosening in five (13.1%) and late infection in two (5.2%) knees. Radiography showed translucent zones below an all-polyethylene component in 14 (36.8%) knees. DISCUSSION The five cases of aseptic loosening may have been due to insufficient hardness of a U-shaped polyethylene component and long-term stress at the bone-implant interface. In the majority of knees the anterior cruciate ligament was defective or missing completely. Maintenance of the posterior cruciate ligament facilitates absorption of the greater part of forces at the cement-bone interface, as also reported by other authors. The high incidence of complications associated with patellar components, as described in the literature of the late 1970s and the early 1980s, led us to avoid the primary use of a patellar implant.Our evaluation showed that, in 73% of the cases, the all-polyethylene tibial component was a suitable and inexpensive implant with very good or good long-term results on average at 24.6 years of follow-up. Since the quality of currently produced polyethylene is high, we recommend the use of all-polyethylene tibial components in all indicated cases.",

MATERIAL AnD METHODSBetween January 2010 and January 2013, 63 patients with displaced midshaft clavicle fracture were treated with superior locking plate (22 female, 41 male) with either horizontal (n = 38) or vertical incisions (n = 25).Mean interval between trauma and surgery was 3 days (1 to 8 days).Electrodiagnostic tests were performed to 15 patients who felt numbness across their shoulder or chest and ASES test was performed to each of the patient 12 weeks postoperatively.IBM SPSS Statistics 22 (IBM SPSS, Türkiye) programme was used for statistical analysis.Student t-test was used for comparison of normally distributed parameters (quantity) and continuity (yates) test was used.p < 0.05 was accepted to be statistically significant. RESULTS8 patients of the horizontal incision group and 7 patients of the vertical incision group described numbness across their shoulders.14 patients had abnormal sensorial electrodiagnostic findings.Comparison of electrodiagnostic findings did not reveal any statistical significance.The mean ASES score of the affected shoulder was 76.39 ±1.20 in the horizontal group, in the vertical group it was found to be 79.00±2.5 ( p < 0.01). COnCLUSIOnSElectrodiagnostic study revealed similar results in both groups.According to these results, significant difference in mean ASES scores of both groups was not related to sensorial injury of the supraclavicular nerve.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Infections of joint replacements represent one of the most serious problems in contemporary orthopedics. The joint infections treatment is usually multimodal and involves various combinations of drug delivery and surgical procedures. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of the most common antibiotic carriers used in orthopedic surgery: bone cements mixed with antibiotic and porous calcium sulfate mixed with antibiotic. MATERIAL AND METHODS Three commercial bone cements (Palacos®, Palacos® R+G, Vancogenx®) and commercial porous sulfate (Stimulan®) were prepared with a known concentration of vancomycin (a glycopeptide antibiotic). Specifically, for the purpose of our study, the testing specimens were prepared to release 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512 mg of vancomycin into 1 liter of solution. The specimens with increasing amount of antibiotic were placed in a separate tubes containing 5 mL of Mueller-Hinton broth inoculated with a suspension (0.1 m, McFarland 1) of the reference strain CCM 4223 Staphylococcus aureus to evaluate their bacteriostatic properties (broth dilution method). After this initial incubation and evaluation of the broth dilution method, an inoculum from each tube was transferred onto blood agar plates. After another 24-hour incubation under the same conditions, we evaluated the bactericidal properties (agar plate method). As many as 132 of independent experiments were performed (4 specimens × 11 concentrations × 3 repetitions = 132). RESULTS The bacteriostatic properties of all investigated samples were excellent, perhaps with the exception of the first bone cement (Palacos®). The sample Palacos® started to exhibit bacteriostatic properties at concentrations ≥ 8 mg/mL, while all other samples (Palacos R+G®, Vancogenx®, and Stimulan®) were bacteriostatic in the whole concentration range starting from 1 mg/mL. The bacteriocidic properties did not show such clear trends, but correlated quite well with different properties of the investigated samples during mixing - the most homogeneous samples seemed to exhibit the best and the most reproducible results. DISCUSSION The reliable and reproducible comparison of ATB carriers is a difficult task. The situation is complicated by high numbers of local antibiotic carriers on the market, numerous antibiotics used, and differences in clinical trials at different laboratories. Simple in vitro testing of bacteriostatic and bacteriocidic properties represents a simple and efficient approach to the problem. CONCLUSIONS The study confirmed that the two most common commercial systems used in the orthopedic surgery (bone cements and porous calcium sulfate) prevent bacterial growth (bacteriostatic effect), but they may not be 100% efficient in complete elimination of bacteria (bacteriocidic effect). The scattered results in the case of bacteriocidic tests seemed to be connected with the homogeneity of ATB dispersion in the systems and with the lower reproducibility of the employed agar plate method.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY This article presents the evidence and the rationale for the recommendations for surgical treatment of degenerative lumbar stenosis (DLS) and spondylolisthesis that were recently developed as a part of the Czech Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) \"The Surgical Treatment of the Degenerative Diseases of the Spine\". MATERIAL AND METHODS The Guideline was drawn up in line with the Czech National Methodology of the CPG Development, which is based on the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We used an innovative GRADE-adolopment method that combines adoption and adaptation of the existing guidelines with de novo development of recommendations. In this paper, we present three adapted recommendations on DLS and a recommendation on spondylolisthesis developed de novo by the Czech team. RESULTS Open surgical decompression in DLS patients has been evaluated in three randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A recommendation in favour of decompression was made based on a statistically significant and clinically evident improvement in the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and leg pain. Decompression may be recommended for patients with symptoms of DLS in the event of correlation of significant physical limitation and the finding obtained via imaging. The authors of a systematic review of observational studies and one RCT conclude that fusion has a negligible role in the case of a simple DLS. Thus, spondylodesis should only be chosen as an adjunct to decompression in selected DLS patients. Two RCTs compared supervised rehabilitation with home or no exercise, showing no statistically significant difference between the procedures. The guideline group considers the post-surgery physical activity beneficial and suggests supervised rehabilitation in patients who have undergone surgery for DLS for the beneficial effects of exercise in the absence of known adverse effects. Four RCTs were found comparing simple decompression and decompression with fusion in patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. None of the outcomes showed clinically significant improvement or deterioration in favour of either intervention. The guideline group concluded that for stable spondylolisthesis the results of both methods are comparable and, when other parameters are considered (balance of benefits and risks, or costs), point in favour of simple decompression. Due to the lack of scientific evidence, no recommendation has been formulated regarding unstable spondylolisthesis. The certainty of the evidence was rated as low for all recommendations. DISCUSSION Despite the unclear definition of stable/unstable slip, the inclusion of apparently unstable cases of DS in stable studies limits the conclusions of the studies. Based on the available literature, however, it can be summarized that in simple degenerative lumbar stenosis and static spondylolisthesis, fusion of the given segment is not justified. However, its use in the case of unstable (dynamic) vertebral slip is undisputable for the time being. CONCLUSIONS The guideline development group suggests decompression in patients with DLS in whom previous conservative treatment did not lead to improvement, spondylodesis only in selected patients, and post-surgical supervised rehabilitation. In patients with degenerative lumbar stenosis and spondylolisthesis with no signs of instability, the guideline development group suggests simple decompression (without fusion).

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Tranexamic acid as a haemostatic agent is commonly used in multiple medical branches. Over the last decade, there has been a steep rise in the number of studies evaluating its effect, i.e. blood loss reduction in specific surgical procedures. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of tranexamic acid on reducing intraoperative blood loss, postoperative blood loss into the drain, total blood loss, transfusion requirements, and development of symptomatic wound hematoma in conventional single-level lumbar decompression and stabilization. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included patients who had undergone a traditional open lumbar spine surgery in the form of single-level decompression and stabilisation. The patients were randomized into two groups. The study group received a 15 mg/kg dose of tranexamic acid intravenously during the induction of anaesthesia and then again 6 hours later. No tranexamic acid was administered to the control group. In all patients, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative blood loss into the drain, and therefore also total blood loss, transfusion requirements and potential development of a symptomatic postoperative wound hematoma requiring surgical evacuation were recorded. The data of the two groups were compared. RESULTS The cohort includes 162 patients, 81 in the study group and the same number in the control group. In the intraoperative blood loss assessment, no statistically significant difference between the two groups was observed; 430 (190-910) mL vs. 435 (200-900) mL. In case of post-operative drain blood loss, a statistically significantly lower volume was reported after the tranexamic acid administration; 405 (180-750) mL vs. 490 (210-820) mL. When evaluating the total blood loss, a statistically significant difference was also confirmed, namely in favour of the tranexamic acid; 860 (470-1410) mL vs. 910 (500- 1420) mL. The reduction of total blood loss did not result in a difference in the number of administered transfusions; transfusions were given to 4 patients in each group. A postoperative wound hematoma requiring surgical evacuation developed in 1 patient in the group with the tranexamic acid and in 4 patients in the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant with respect to the insufficient group size. No patient in our study experienced complications associated with tranexamic acid application. DISCUSSION The beneficial effect of tranexamic acid on reducing blood loss in lumbar spine surgeries has already been confirmed by numerous meta-analyses. The question remains in what types of procedures, at what dose and route of administration its effect is significant. To date, most of the studies have explored its effect in multi-level decompressions and stabilizations. Raksakietisak et al., for instance, report significant reduction in total blood loss from 900 (160, 4150) mL to 600 (200, 4750) mL following an intravenous injection of 2 bolus doses of 15 mg/kg tranexamic acid. In less extensive spinal surgeries, the effect of tranexamic acid may not be that distinct. In our study of single-level decompressions and stabilizations, no reduction in the actual intraoperative bleeding was confirmed at the given dosage. Its effect was seen only in the postoperative period in a significant reduction of blood loss into the drain, thus also in the total blood loss, although the difference between 910 (500, 1420) mL and 860 (470, 1410) mL was not that significant. CONCLUSIONS By intravenous application of tranexamic acid in 2 bolus doses in single-level decompression and stabilization of the lumbar spine a statistically significant reduction in postoperative blood loss into the drain and also total blood loss was confirmed. The reduction in the actual intraoperative blood loss was not statistically significant. No difference was observed in the number of administered transfusions. Following the tranexamic acid administration, a lower number of postoperative symptomatic wound hematomas was recorded, but the difference was not statistically significant.

The aim of this study is to compare the outcomes and complications of closed vs open reduction in Type 3 Gartland supracondylar humerus fractures. MATERIAL AND METHODS Electronic literature searches of Embase, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library was conducted in February 2022 using the terms \"supracondylar\", \"humerus\", \"fracture\", \"Gartland type 3\" and synonymous. The data extracted included the study details, demographic data, procedure performed, final functional and cosmetic outcome according to Flynn criteria and complications of included studies. RESULTS Pooled data analysis revealed no significant difference in mean satisfactory outcome rate according to Flynn cosmetic criteria in open group (97%, 95% CI 95.5%-98.5%), as compared to closed group (97.5%, 95% CI 96.3%-98.7%), although a statistically significant difference in mean satisfactory rate according to Flynn functional criteria in open group (93.4%, 95% CI 90.8%- 96.1%) as compared to closed group (98.5%, 95% CI 97.5%-99.4%) was noted. On separate comparison of the two-arm studies, closed reduction favoured better functional outcomes (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86-0.99). CONCLUSIONS Closed reduction and percutaneous fixation have better functional outcome than open reduction with K-wire fixation. But there was no significant difference in cosmetic outcomes, overall complication rate and nerve injury with either open or closed reduction. The threshold of converting a closed reduction to an open reduction in supracondylar humerus fractures of children should be high.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Rhizarthrosis, a degenerative condition of the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb, affects mainly women. Surgical treatment is indicated once the non-operative treatment fails. Thumb carpometacarpal joint total arthroplasty constitutes one of the surgical treatment options. This study aims to evaluate the short-term functional and radiological outcomes of Touch® prosthesis with a minimum follow-up period, namely two years after surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study presents the outcomes of a group of 56 endoprostheses implanted in 48 patients. The dual mobility Touch® prosthesis is evaluated. The group consisted of 41 women and 7 men, with the median age of the patients being 62 years. The patients were indicated for surgery after the non-operative treatment had failed. All of them suffered from stage II - IV osteoarthritis according to the Eaton-Littler classification. The range of motion - the opposition was assessed using the Kapandji score. The function and the pain were evaluated with the DASH questionnaire preoperatively and at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years postoperatively. RESULTS After 24 months, 91.1% (51 patients) were satisfied with the surgical outcome. Altogether 8.9% of patients (5 patients) experienced postoperative exercise-induced pain, limitation of movement of the CMC joint or hand weakness. No dislocation or endoprosthetic loosening occurred in the evaluated group. Primary wound healing was reported in all patients and no superficial or deep infection was observed. The mean DASH score was 65.3 points preoperatively; at the 2-year follow-up, the mean score decreased to 10.8 points. The pain assessed in question 24 of the DASH questionnaire decreased from the mean value of 4.45 points to 1.2 points. After two years, the range of motion of all patients was X/X according to Kapandji. DISCUSSION There are plenty of surgical techniques to manage rhizarthrosis. All types of surgery have their pros and cons. Most endoprostheses used nowadays show good short-term, mid-term, and some of them even long-term outcomes in terms of survival. The Touch® prosthesis, characterized by dual mobility, is the 3rd generation thumb CMC prosthesis and in our study achives comparable short-term outcomes to those reported by international literature. The use of the dual mobility design appears to be effective in reducing the dislocation rate. CONCLUSIONS The Touch® thumb CMC prosthesis achieves very good short-term functional and radiological outcomes. We can recommend the prosthesis provided the patients are followed-up for more than two years after surgery.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Different techniques have been reported to reconstruct the defi cient acetabulum during total hip arthroplasty (THA). The purpose of this study was to compare the biomechanical features of the bulk bone graft (BBG) technique (Harris acetabular plasty) and the Roof Step Cut (RSC) technique using fi nite element analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Based on a female patient's dysplastic hip CT scan, 3D models were assembled according to the two techniques. For the Harris technique, an irregular BBG was sculpted from a solid sphere, while for the RSC technique, the graft was sculpted into a step-cut shape with a similar size. Each graft was fi xed with two compression screws at two different angles (0° and 45°). Four fi nite element models were used to compare the von Mises stress distribution and total deformation of the grafts and the screws. The pressure and sliding distances of the contacts between the bone graft, metal cup and acetabular host bone were also analyzed. RESULTS For both of the bone grafts and the screws, compared to the Harris models, the maximum stress of the RSC models was signifi cantly lower (16.56 MPa, 25.50 MPa vs 97.13 MPa, 112.72 MPa) and the total deformation was signifi cantly smaller (0.0096 mm, 0.0089 mm vs 0.022 mm, 0.018 mm). 45° inserted screws generated higher stress at the end of the screws and on the outside of the bone graft. In case of 0° inserted screws, the maximum value was mainly located in the middle of the screws, inside the screw channel as well as at the contact area between the graft and the host bone. At all analyzed contacts, the RSC technique shows signifi cantly lower pressure and sliding distances, irrelevant to the screw's insertion angle. In comparison, the model of BBG with 45° screws showed a signifi cant sliding effect and higher contact pressure. CONCLUSIONS Compared with the BBG technique, the step-shaped graft of the RSC technique could signifi cantly reduce the maximum stress and deformation of the graft and the screws, and decrease the pressure and sliding distance between the bone graft, metal cup and the acetabular host bone. The angle of screw placement affects the location of stress and deformation.

Of these, 26 patients (27 hips) were included in our study on the basis of the following criteria: at least 23 months between the index surgery and scintigraphic examination and the availability of good quality bone scans. The average patients' age at the time of index and revision operations was 45.3 years (range, 32-57; SD, 6.02) and 50.2 years (36-61; SD, 6.01), respectively. The average time between the index surgery and bone scintigraphy was 50.3 months (23-84; SD, 15.9). Two experienced specialists in nuclear medicine, who were unaware of any clinical conclusions, participated in the study.Pre- and intra-operative findings showed aseptic loosening in three cups (3/27, 11 %) and one stem (1/27, 4 %). Four hips were suspected to have an infection on the basis of the positive results of intra-operative culture. In the diagnosis of aseptic loosening, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values of bone scintigraphy were 100 %, 57 %, 62 %, 23 %, and 100 %, respectively, for the ABG I cup and 100 %, 52 %, 54 %, 8 %, and 100 %, respectively, for the ABG I stem. These characteristics were 67 %, 96 %, 93 %, 67 %, and 96 %, respectively, for the ABG I cup, when plain X-ray was used for evaluation of aseptic loosening. Specificity, accuracy and negative predictive value of plain X-ray for ABG I stem aseptic loosening were 100 %, 96 %, and 96 %. Bone scintigraphy gave one false positive result of sepsis; on the other hand, none of the four hips with positive intraoperative culture was diagnosed as septic.The fact that 99Tc-MDP bone scintigraphy as a method of diagnosing periprosthetic complications has a high sensitivity and a relatively low specificity has often been discussed in the literature. Currently, there are only a few studies on bone scintigraphy investigations of hydroxyapatite-coated prostheses. Some authors report that a slight increase in peri-prosthetic radionuclide activity may persist for up to 8 years which can explain the problematic accuracy of the technique.99Tc-MDP bone scintigraphy is an intermediate useful tool for detecting complications of total hip arthroplasty with hydroxyapatite- coating. A negative bone scan almost always suggested the absence of aseptic loosening. However, the value of a positive result was regarded as controversial for the diagnosis of both aseptic and septic complications.",

    "abstract": "The authors present the clinical results of odontoid fracture treatment, using a single axial screw, with the aim to compare their results with the findings of other relevant studies, with focus on the use of either one or two axial screws.Thirty patients were included in the study, 16 men and 14 women at an average age of 56.1 years. They had findings of type II and \"shallow\" type III fractures, as evaluated on the basis of Anderson and D'Alonzo classification, and combined fractures. All were managed by the method of direct osteosynthesis of the dens with a single axial screw from the anterior approach in the years 1998 to 2005.The retrospective, cross-study analysis was based on records and clinical notes from the outpatient department and on radiographic materials from the department of radiology at follow-ups of 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. The criteria assessed included screw insertion, quality of fusion during follow-up, and intra-operative and early and late post-operative complications.Insertion of a screw was regarded as optimal in 24 (80 %) cases and suboptimal in six (20 %) cases. None of the patients required screw re-insertion. Evident fusion present at 12 months post-operatively was achieved in 18 (86 %) and questionable fusion in two patients. Non-union was recorded in one patient. Repeat operation was not indicated in any of the cases. There were no intra-operative complications. In six patients early complications occurred. Three patients died due to causes unrelated to the surgical procedure. Two patients had infectious complications not directly related to the surgery. One patient suffered from temporary dysphonia due to vocal chord edema.For direct osteosynthesis of the dens, one or two screws can be used. Both methods have been studied in terms of biomechanics and clinical outcome, but none of the studies showed any significant differences between the two methods. Also the available Czech studies have paid only marginal attention to this issue.Based on the analysis of patients' data and literature reports we can conclude that osteosynthesis employing a single axial screw gives results similar to that using two screws. The available biomechanical and clinical studies have not shown any statistically significant differences between the two methods. The results of our study are in agreement with the relevant literature data published so far. .",

    "abstract": "The reconstructions of Bankart lesions, carried out according to the procedure recommended by the Mitek company, showed a high rate of recurrent dislocation. Therefore, based on operative experience, anatomical studies and reconstructive surgery on cadaver shoulders, we developed a new surgical technique that provided good shoulder stability and better operative outcomes. The results are reported here.Between 1997 and 2005, arthroscopic Bankart repair with use of Mitek anchors was performed on 368 shoulders at the Department of Orthopedics, Faculty of Medicine, Palacky University in Olomouc. The average age of the patients was 22 years (range, 16 to 56 years). The patients were allocated to two groups according to the surgical technique used. Group 1, which comprised 100 shoulders, was treated by the Bankart repair procedure recommended by the Mitek Company. Group 2, which included 268 shoulders, underwent Bankart reconstruction by the technique developed at our department.In group 1, anchors were inserted in the anterior glenoid rim, as recommended by the Mitek company. In group 2, implants were inserted into the superior region, with surface reduced to spongious bone, of the anterior glenoid rim. This allowed for creation of a more robust capsulolabral complex preventing the humeral head from dislocation. The results were assessed by the UCLA (University of California at Los Angeles) shoulder score system and statistical evaluation was performed at the Department of Medical Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, Palacky University in Olomouc.In group 1 (Mitek procedure), the UCLA shoulder score evaluation was as follows: 22 (22 %) excellent, 28 (28 %) good, 22 (22 %) satisfactory, and 28 (28 %) poor outcomes. In group 2 (our technique), the results included 199 (74 %) excellent, 66 (24.6 %) good, two (0.8 %) satisfactory and one (0.6 %) poor outcomes. The difference between the groups was statistically significant (Chi-square, p 0.0001).The method of Bankart lesion repair has been a much discussed issue for a long time. At our department Mitek implants have been used. Although the operative procedures were faultlessly done, the results of the first 100 operations were not satisfactory. In some patients, the labrum reinserted by Mitek anchors failed to heal; it either remained loose or was attached to the scapular neck distally and thus did not provide sufficient stability that would prevent recurrent dislocation of the shoulder. In view of this, we conducted reconstructive operations on cadaver limbs, after a thorough topographic and anatomic study of the glenohumeral joint, and developed a modified method; after the labrum and capsule were freed, implants were inserted into the superior part of the anterior glenoid rim. This created a sufficient capsulolabral complex that prevented recurrent dislocation.Arthroscopic Bankart lesion repair, with the insertion of anchors by our method, markedly improved surgical outcomes and provided good shoulder stability. We believe that, in the future, this method will be more widely used in arthroscopic treatment of Bankart lesions.",

The purpose of the study was to quantify and characterize the distribution of mast and dendritic cells in the examined samples and to study the statistically significant relations between the aforementioned cell populations and selected parameters characterizing the patients, implants or tissue response. Based on the proved findings, a possible relation between mast and dendritic cells and histomorphological patterns of aseptic loosening and the benefit of the applied immunohistochemical methods was evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS Periprosthetic tissues from a total of 31 patients (17 patients after a revision surgery of hip prosthesis, 14 patients after a revision surgery of knee prosthesis) were examined. The collected samples were processed according to the standard protocol for the purposes of histological and immunochemical examination. Antibodies against tryptase and CD117 were used for immunohistochemical detection of mast cells. Dendritic cells were detected by means of S100 and CD1a antibodies. Quantification of both the cell populations was carried out by optical microscopy in 20 high power fields at 400-times magnification. From among the applied methods we picked the more sensitive one for statistical evaluation. It was tryptase in the case of mast cells and S100 in the case of dendritic cells. RESULTS Mast and dendritic cells were mostly distributed dispersively in periprosthetic tissues; however, they also occurred in groups perivasally or near necrotic parts. The examined samples showed the presence of 60 mast cells and 50 dendritic cells on average. The increased density of mast and dendritic cells was associated with polypously formed pseudosynovium and cement fixation of prostheses; this relation was statistically significant. It was impossible to prove the correlation between the quantity of the observed cell populations and the nature and the number of the observed particles because wear particles were present dispersely in all the samples. Another statistically significant relation to the type of material or implant fixation or other examined histomorphological patterns was not proved. A strong density of mast cells with a minimum presence of dendritic cells was observed in the control patient group. DISCUSSION The differences in density of S100 positive dendritic cells between the control and examined group of patients can be caused by the activation of dendritic cells by exogenous or endogenous pathways of immune processes going on after the implantation of endoprosthesis. The statistically significant interrelation of mast cells, polypously formed pseudosynovium and cement wear particles can be explained at least in part as a tissue reaction induced by cement particles. CONCLUSIONS We proved the presence of two immunologically significant cell populations in periprosthetic tissues. The said findings indicate a conclusion of significant functional participation of mast and dendritic cells in pathogenesis of aseptic loosening and periprosthetic osteolysis. Nevertheless, this will have to be proved in another way and with the use of another method.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The purpose of our retrospective study is to evaluate 5-year functional and radiological outcomes in patients following corrective osteotomy of the distal radius and ulnar osteotomy for malposition after a distal radius fracture, to identify differences in the outcomes of corrective osteotomies depending on the type of the original fracture according to the AO classification, the grade of arthritis of radiocarpal (RC) joint, surgical approach and the way of stabilisation of the osteotomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS The followed-up group of 22 patients (8 men and 14 women) underwent osteotomy for malposition of distal radius in the period 2007-2011. The age of patients in the followed-up group ranged from 21 to 72 years, with the mean age of 51 years at the time of surgery. The indications for corrective osteotomy due to distal radius deformity were the following: functional limitation, pain and radiological parameters confirming the deformity. The opening wedge osteotomy of distal radius performed through volar or dorsal approach, isolated shortening osteotomy of ulna and a combination of both the methods were used. The observations included: the original type of fracture according to AO/OTA classification, functional outcomes - Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score, Mayo Wrist Score (MWS), range of motion, grade of wrist arthritis and specific complications. The follow-up period was 5 years. RESULTS Average results were obtained in the group of patients before/after the osteotomy: DASH score- 35/14, MWS- 54/77, flexion- 44°/64°, dorsiflexion- 48°/61°, supination- 75°/79°, pronation- 72°/83°, ulnar duction- 20°/23°, radial duction- 9°/16°, grip strength in percentage- 59%/83%. After osteotomy, a statistically significant increase was observed in flexion, dorsiflexion, supination, pronation, radial duction, ulnar duction, grip strength in percentage, MWS, while in the DASH score a statistically significant decrease was reported. Based on the statistical evaluation of differences in functional outcomes after osteotomy, in patients with type A and C original distal radius fractures no difference in range of motion parameters was found after osteotomy. As to the mean values, the flexion and dorsiflexion range of motion was greater by 10° in patients after extra-articular osteotomy for malposition following the type A original fracture as compared to the type C fracture. By measuring the Joint Space High (JSH) ratio, no statistically significant changes were found regarding the progression of arthrosis of the radiolunate and radioscaphoid part of the RC joint as against the arthrosis in patients up to 5 years after corrective osteotomy of the distal radius. In patients with distal radius malposition and RC joint grade 1-2 arthritis according to the Knirk and Jupiter classification, better functional outcomes were achieved than in the limited and total wrist arthrodesis. In our patients, at 5 years after osteotomy no worsening was observed of the existing wrist arthritis and no arthritis was newly diagnosed. Specific complications were found in 4 cases (18.2 %). In 2 patients after radial osteotomy from dorsal approach (extensor tendon irritation, rupture of the long extensor tendon of the thumb), removal of osteosynthesis material was necessary in both the patients. In one patient after the isolated ulnar shortening osteotomy, an intraoperative fissure of distal ulnar fragment was detected, which healed without any further complications. In one patient an iatrogenic fracture of anterior superior iliac spine was observed after harvesting the corticospongious graft from the ala of the ilium. DISCUSSION Corrective osteotomy is a well-established method for treating distal radius deformities following a fracture. Even at present, there are various opinions regarding the indications, contraindications, timing of the surgery, osteotomy technique and the need to use a bone graft. Limited or total wrist arthrodeses in the area of wrist arthrosis and deformities bring good results with respect to the pain relief, but a limited range of motion occurs mainly in younger patients. Bearing this in mind, in grade 1-2 wrist arthritis in patients with distal radius deformities, a better functional outcome can be achieved by osteotomy. By using dorsal or volar approach, comparable outcomes can be obtained, but with the dorsal approach there is higher frequency of complications and the need to remove the osteosynthesis material. CONCLUSIONS Corrective osteotomies resulted in an improved functional outcome in the treatment of deformities after a distal radius fracture. Apart from deformity correction, the treatment has been affected also by the RC joint arthritis. The study confirmed neither statistically significant differences in the osteotomy outcomes in patients with the original type A or type C distal radius fracture according to the AO classification, nor the statistical significance of the RC joint arthritis. Our results have proven better functional outcomes of deformity correction achieved by osteotomy in case of grade 1 and 2 arthritis than by the limited wrist arthrodesis. In patients showing arthritic changes, no progression was reported within five years after the osteotomy. Key words: distal radius fracture, distal radius deformity, osteotomy, functional results.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Knee joint is the most common place where osteoarthritis may occur. A specific therapy is indicated to patients depending on the degree of disability and other signs. The available methods and their clinical value are regularly assessed in systematic reviews and meta-analysis of clinical studies. The evidence of working mechanism of the specific therapeutic intervention is another important part of evaluating its therapy effect. One of the possibilities of knee osteoarthritis conservative treatment is a functional prophylactic knee brace. This type of knee brace is designed to transfer the load away from the affected part of the knee joint in every step. The main goal of this study was to determine the effect of a prophylactic knee brace on dynamic parameters of the stance phase of gait in patients with knee osteoarthritis. MATERIAL AND METHODS The research involved twelve subjects with predominantly unilateral medial knee osteoarthritis of grade 2 and 3. Six patients did not complete the study. Therefore, the data of six persons were processed (average age 68.3 ± 4.4 years, average weight 83 ± 15.9 kg, average height 170.5 ± 11.7 cm). There were two piezoelectric Kistler 9286AA force plates used to determine the reaction forces. In total, six attempts were evaluated - three attempts with the knee brace and three attempts without it. Each subject completed three measurements. The first one took place at the beginning of the research, the second one after three months of using the brace, and the last one took place three months after the brace removal. The data processing methods were accustomed. At the beginning and at the end of the study the patients completed the WOMAC questionnaire and determined the level of their pain on the visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS The minimum value (p = 0.020) and the second maximum value (p = 0.035) of vertical reaction force significantly increased on the unaffected limb after a short-term application of a knee brace. There were significant increases found for walking without a brace in the maximum vertical force in the braking phase on the affected limb (p = 0.006) after three months of bracing, followed by similar results in the maximum vertical force in the braking (p = 0.001) as well as the propulsion (p = 0.035) phase on the unaffected side. Furthermore, we observed a significant extension in the overall duration of the stance phase of gait (p = 0.001) on the affected limb. According to the WOMAC and VAS results, three patients experienced subjective conditional improvement, two subjective deterioration and one participant remained unchanged. DISCUSSION The individualized solutions, i.e. their \"adaptation\" to a particular type of knee arthrosis in each patient, is the biggest problem in the treatment of knee arthrosis using a prophylactic brace. Our results confirm the usefulness of modern knee orthosis in terms of motion biomechanics. However, it still remains to be proved that it is possible to use the brace for a long time during the active time of the day and that this use brings about a significant relief from troubles, improving the patient's quality of life. CONCLUSIONS The effect of the orthosis application was reflected in force and time parameters of the vertical and anteroposterior component of the reaction force. The use of a prophylactic knee brace can influence the dynamics of gait. The short-term effect of prophylactic brace use is reflected in an increased load on the unaffected limb. From a long-term point of view, a prolongation of the stance phase in both extremities was observed. However, the positive effect of the knee brace use tended to persist even after the brace removal. There were no significant changes in the subjective assessment of pain, stiffness and function of the knee joint.

RESULTSWhen comparing the methods, the complication rate of the full-time single-surgeon method (12.9%) was less than that of the rotational method (21.7%) (p: 0.022).A higher rate of complications (8.5%) was observed in operations with a duration of 115 minutes or more compared to other operations (p <0.001).A higher complication rate (23.7%) was observed in cases lasting more than 345 minutes (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONSAccording to our study, full-time use of the orthopedic theater by a single surgeon was found to be safer than rotational use.In addition, the duration of surgeries lasting longer than 115 minutes or longer than 345 minutes during the day increased the rate of surgical complications.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY With the concept of the lateral compression plate (LLCP) a technique has been available designed to combine the advantages of a fixed-angle fixation with a complete sinking of the implant into the proximal bone. The objective of the present study was to investigate the results of the LLCP compared with classical screw osteosynthesis (SO). MATERIAL AND METHODS 31 patients with pes planovalgus who received calcaneal displacement osteotomy and osteosyntheses with screws (n = 17) or LLCP (n = 14) between 2010 and 2015 were investigated retrospectively.The ankle-hindfoot scale, Kaikkonen score, VAS, and the SF-36 were determined preoperatively as well as at the last clinical follow-up. In addition, a radiological control of osseous integration was performed in all patients 12 weeks after surgery. RESULTS With regard to clinical scores both methods depicted significant improvement. In the overall cohort there were no pseudarthroses. In the SO group 5 cases (29%) showed hardware irritation, in the LLCP group there were none. Results in the LLCP group were significantly superior in the area of the physical section of the SF 36. CONCLUSIONS Based on the results of our study, surgical treatment of stage II pes planovalgus by means of calcaneal displacement osteotomy using the LLCP is equivalent to SO with a lower incidence of hardware irritation.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Osteoid osteoma (OO) of the upper extremity is a rare pathology representing a major diagnostic challenge. The patients are often times incorrectly treated due to a misdiagnosis and therefore the final management of symptoms is delayed by several months. During this time the pain, which is the main symptom, increases. The surgical treatment is a fast and efficient solution. This paper aims to highlight the specificity of the OO of the upper extremity, evaluate our study group, the time to diagnosis and the benefits of individual imaging techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the period 2007-2017, a total of 8 patients with a histologically verified OO of the upper extremity were consulted and treated at the authors departments. The group of patients was retrospectively evaluated based on the medical reports, surgical protocols, imaging examinations, histology results of preoperative samples and a postoperative questionnaire. Pain was assessed on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) preoperatively, at 2 weeks, 2 months and at one year postoperatively and in January 2018. The mean follow-up period was 48 months (range 16-78). The presence of swelling, synovitis and a limited range of motion were clinically assessed. The removed tissue was tested in an accredited biopsy laboratory. RESULTS 8 patients with OO of the elbow, wrist and hand were treated in the period 2007-2017. In 5 cases the OO was located in the wrist (scaphoid, 2x trapezoid, hamate and capitate) and in 2 cases in finger phalanges (middle and distal phalanx). The mean age of the patients was 24.5 years (median 21.5, range 18-42). The male to female ratio was 7:1. The mean interval between the onset of symptoms and the final diagnosis was 16.25 months (median 15.5, range 12-25). The CT examination proved to be the most beneficial imaging techniques. A plain radiograph led to a diagnosis in 1 case only. The preoperative mean pain VAS value 9.25 dropped to VAS 1 at two weeks after the surgery. No recurrence was reported. DISCUSSION The main challenge in treating the OO of the upper extremity is the diagnosis. Despite of the availability of advanced imaging techniques, the interval from the onset of symptoms to correct diagnosis did not change over the past decades. As to the treatment, despite the development of new procedures the method of choice continues to be the surgical excochleation. CONCLUSIONS Osteoid osteoma of the upper extremity is a rare pathology which shall be considered in case of an increasing pain, especially in young men. A plain radiograph of the anatomically complex terrain of the hand and wrist is mostly not useful in diagnosis, whereas the CT examination can visualise even a small size nidus. The surgical excochleation results in pain relief and early functional recovery with swelling disappearance. To diagnose the OO is not difficult provided we take it into consideration.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYCranioplasty is currently the most common neurosurgical procedure.The purpose of this study is to describe the first experience with successful use of the Cranio-Oss (PEEK) custom implant for cranioplasty. MATERIAL AND METHODSIn the period 2012 to 2013, a total of 26 cranioplasties were performed.In fourteen patients, their own bone flap was used for reconstruction.In four cases, a synthetic Cranio-Oss bone implant made of PEEK was used.In six patients, the defect was covered by an intraoperatively-made Palacos implant and in two cases, minor defects were covered with a titanium mesh.The patients were followed up for at least five years.Cranio-Oss is a cranial implant made from polyetheretherketone (PEEK), a synthetic biocompatible material.The implant is created using the CAD/CAM method in the shape of the bone defect based on the CT scan.Creating optimal roughness of the implant surface and of the surface of the contact area attached to the bone bed is controlled and included already in the strategy for machining individual areas of the implant during its manufacturing at a 5-axis machining centre. RESULTSThe Cranio-Oss implant was used in four younger patients to cover larger and complex-shaped defects.The mean age of patients in this group was 47 years.The implant was fixed to the skull by micro-plates.In all the cases the wound healed well with good cosmetic results without the necessity of revision with respect to the used implant.The follow-up CT scans always showed the implant in situ with no signs of malposition. DISCUSSIONAutologous bone flap is the most suitable material for defect reconstruction after craniectomy.This option is affordable and represents one of the best methods of reconstruction of defects after craniectomy in terms of cosmetic results.In some cases, the original skull cannot be used for cranioplasty (e.g. if destructed by tumourous process, infected or in comminuted fractures).In such cases, the defect needs to be managed using a synthetic implant.In case of extensive defects, the most suitable option is a custom made implant from advanced biomaterials. CONCLUSIONSAuthors prefer using autologous bone flaps during cranioplasty.In cases where this method is unavailable, a synthetic bone substitute has to be used.The first medium-term experience with the use of a Cranio-Oss implant made of PEEK showed that it is a suitable alternative to the patient's own bone.No complications associated with this synthetic implant were reported and its use to manage skull defects can be strongly recommended.With respect to legal and accreditationrelated difficulties connected with bone fragments storage and thanks to the continuous cost reduction of synthetic implants will their importance grow in the future.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSIt is a retrospective, observational, monocentric study.Included in the study were all the trauma patients with the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA) score 3-6 treated in the given period, directed by the emergency medical service to the trauma centre.Two groups of patients were compared.In the first group, triage was performed in line with the Bulletin of the Ministry of Health of 2008, while in the second group it was performed in line with the updated version published in the Bulletin of the Ministry of Health in 2015.Both the groups were later compared with the Injury Severity Score (ISS) obtained after the diagnosis of injury in the Trauma Centre of the University Hospital Ostrava.In the second group, also certain selected parameters were assessed.Group A: Patients treated by the Emergency Medical Service of the Moravia-Silesia Region in the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2014 who met the NACA 3-6 criterion and were identified by paramedics as triage positive in line with the pre-hospital triage 2008.Group B: Patients treated by the Emergency Medical Service of the Moravia-Silesia Region in the period from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2017 who met the NACA 3-6 criterion and were identified by paramedics as triage positive in line with the pre-hospital triage 2015.In Group B, also monitored was the number of patients identified as triage positive only based on F4 and M7. RESULTSThe first group included 3,475 patients, of whom 435 were triage positive.In the respective period, the Trauma Centre of the University Hospital Ostrava identified 262 patients with ISS greater than 15 points.The pre-hospital triage and ISS greater than 15 points corresponded in 210 patients.19.9% were false negative (52/262).The mean ISS was 33.1±9.4,median 34, IQR 25.5--1.In Group A, the sensitivity of triage criteria reached 80.2% (95% IS: 74.7-84.7%), the specificity was 93.0% (95% IS: 92.0-93.8%).The second group included 3,816 patients, of whom 586 were triage positive.In the monitored period, the Trauma Centre of the University Hospital Ostrava identified 363 patients with ISS greater than 15 points.The pre-hospital triage and ISS greater than 15 points corresponded in 313 patients.13.8% were false negative (50/363).The mean ISS was 43.7±12.0,median 42, IQR 33-54.In Group B, the sensitivity of triage criteria reached 86.2% (95% IS: 82.1-89.5%), the specificity was 98.5% (95% IS: 97.9-98.8%).In Group B, 11 patients were identified as triage positive based on F4 and M7 items.No statistically significant difference was found (chi-squared test, p = 0.257) after adding the F4 and M7 items to the algorithm. CONCLUSIONSThe triage system for pre-hospital care in the Czech Republic in line with the applicable pre-hospital triage has high sensitivity as well as specificity and the results correspond to the latest triage algorithms used abroad.Increased sensitivity as a result of adding the new triage items was not confirmed.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSWe retrospectively reviewed all patients' records who received a Coonrad-Morrey TEA in the period from January 1 st , 2011 to December 31 st , 2018.From these records, indications, demographic information and complications were derived.Length of stay was calculated from the hospital administration.Patients were divided in three groups to evaluate the two changes in post-operative care. RESULTSIn total 125 patients receiving 126 Coonrad-Morrey TEAs were included with a mean length of stay of 5.5 days (range 2-23) for the entire group.Omitting a post-operative cast led to decline in length of stay from 6.2 to 5.4 days (p < 0.001).Introduction of functional discharge criteria in August 2017 declined mean length of stay to 3.8 days (p < 0.001).The surgical technique (triceps-on versus triceps-off) was not a confounder (p = 0.20).Range of motion after one year was not significantly different between groups. DISCUSSIONThe length of stay declined after omission of a cast, and declined further after introducing functional discharge criteria.Since no higher complication rates were observed, the shortening of length of stay appears to be safe.This is in line with other fast-track programs, i.e. for hip and knee arthroplasty.The surgical technique used were not a confounder for the shortened length of stay, which further adds to the safety of the functional discharge criteria. CONCLUSIONSOmitting a cast and splint as regular post-operative treatment reduced the length of stay significantly without leading to more complications.Introduction of functional discharge criteria lowered the length of stay further without more complications.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSWe retrospectively reviewed 17 patients with osteoid osteomas in unusual locations included cuboid, triquetrum, coronoid process, and proximal phalanx.We evaluated the duration from symptoms to diagnosis, activity related pain, clinical findings, and possible recurrence or complications.The minimum clinical follow-up was 51 ± 34.8 months. RESULTSCT-guided radiofrequency ablation was applied to 3 patients and open surgical excision procedures to 14.All the complaints of patients gone after treatment.No major complications were observed following CT-guided radiofrequency ablation or surgical excision.Transient weakness/paresthesia was determined in 1 patient in the treated shoulder after CT-guided radiofrequency ablation, which resolved spontaneously in the 6th week.There was only recurrence seen in 1 patient, who had 2nd proximal phalangeal osteoid osteoma.Proximal interphalangeal joint arthrodesis was performed after recurred lesion. DISCUSSIONThe main challenge in management of the osteoid osteomas of the unusual locations are the diagnosis.When we examined the literature, the interval from the beginning of the symptoms to accurate diagnosis did not change over the past decades.Techniques for management of these lesions should be chosen with consideration of the location of the lesion. CONCLUSIONSIf there is long-term complaint of undiagnosed limb pain, the physician should suspect osteoid osteoma.However, the selection of treatment modality should be considered according to the location of the lesion.Which management modality is superior may change depending on the location of the lesion between CT-guided radiofrequency ablation and surgical excision.",

In cerebral palsy patients they are regarded as essential intervention. MATERIAL In the years 2005-2007, surgery in the hip joint region was essential for 150 children between 3 and 18 years of age. At the time of surgery, the patients' locomotion ranged from stage 1 to stage 7 of the Vojta system. METHODS The outcome was evaluated by clinical and radiographic examination at 2 and 6 months post-operatively and hip migration percentage and Wiberg's CE angle were measured. RESULTS The best clinical and radiographic outcomes were achieved in children younger than 6 years of age. On the other hand, isolated transfer of the distal rectus femoris muscle significantly affected pelvis anteflexion in adolescent patients. The most marked decrease in migration percentage was found after adductor tenotomy combined with surgery on the iliopsoas muscle (55.6 %) or when the two procedures were combined with distal rectus femoris transfer. DISCUSSION Combined surigical procedures, i.e., adductor tenotomy, surgery on the iliopsoas muscle or rectus femoris muscle and medial hamstrings, with fixation using an abduction modified Atlanta brace, are effective in patients with marked lateral hip migration who are younger that 6 years. Isolated adductor tenotomy and distal transfer of the rectus femoris muscle markedly improve standing position in walking patients. CONCLUSION An appropriate combination of surgical procedures on muscles in the hip region and on medial hamstrings can significantly improve the patient's locomotion and, if lateral migration is present, help to avoid surgery on bones.",

    "abstract": "The reimplantation of a cemented femoral component at revision is always a challenge for the orthopaedic surgeon, particularly when the cement mantle is intact. The aim of this study was to provide evidence that the recementing of a femoral stem into the original cement mantle can be included in routine surgical procedures.A group of 104 patients with femoral stem revision, followed-up for an average of 50.2 months, were retrospectively reviewed. The outcome evaluation was focused, in the first place, on survivorship of the femoral component, acetabular migration, and dislocation and infection after revision arthroplasty. Hip function evaluation was based on the Harris hip scores before surgery and at the latest follow-up. On radiographs Gruen zones were assessed pre-operatively and at the latest follow-up. The results were statistically evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (Statistica 8.0).Of the 104 patients, only three (2.9 %) had stem re-revision due to its loosening. Further 16 patients underwent revision for other post-operative complications. The success rate of reimplantation in our group including all post-operative complications was 81.7 %. The average Harris scores were 56 before surgery and 87 at the latest follow-up. Radiolucent lines in Gruen zones were on average 0.45 mm in width before revision and 0.15 mm at the latest follow-up. Fourteen patients had second revision within 20 months of the first and only five were revised after a long period.The cement-within-cement exchange of a femoral component is a relatively frequent orthopaedic procedure. Despite this frequency, however, there have not been enough literature reports based on large patient groups to give support to its routine use. The aim of this study was to demonstrate on a large patient group that recementing a femoral stem into the original intact cement mantle can be considered an established operative technique. Our results suggest that the list of indications for this technique, as described by Lieberman and Nelson, can be extended by the following: broken stem with an intact distal cement mantle, replacement of a monoblock femoral component due to severe head damage, loosening of the femoral component without impairment of the distal cement mantle, conversion of a cervico-capital to a total hip replacement and the need of removing all bone cement. No risk is associated with reimplantation of the original component if there is no need for a different implant to correct angle or length stability. A new implant is always used when any part of the femoral component has been damaged mechanically. If only the proximal stem requires recementing, the use of the original component is preferred because of absolute cement/stem cohesion. The number of our patients in which the technique failed was generally in agreement with the results of other authors.Utilisation of the original cement mantle of a femoral component is one of the options at revision arthroplasty. It requires rational considerations based on the type of surgery, state of the cement mantle, and type of material used for the femoral stem. The method is indicated preferably in the hips with an intact cement mantle treated for loosening of the acetabular component, recurrent dislocation or unequal leg-length in monoblock femoral components. In such situations the removal of well-fixed cement would also involve a considerable loss of bone tissue. The follow-up outcomes showed that the involvement of the cement-within-cement technique in routinely used surgical procedures is fully justified.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYAn intercondylar eminence fracture is injury more common in children and adolescents than in adults.Also if it is considered a benign lesion, a displaced medial spine fracture can result in cruciate ligament laxity.We report the evaluation of long-term results of conservative and arthroscopic stabilisation in children and adolescents with different types of intercondylar eminence fracture. MATERIAL AND METHODSFlirty-eight patients with intercondylar eminence fractures, 31 boys and 17 girls, were included in our retrospective study.Of them, 33 were at the end of skeletal growth.According to the Meyers and McKeever classification, 11 fractures were type I, 20 were type II and 17 were type III.The first step in the treatment was an attempt at conservative reduction.If it failed, arthroscopic reduction with crossed K-wire fixation was used.At clinical follow-up, the patients were examined for pain, range of motion, level of activity, and the laxity tests were done. RESULTSConservative treatment was used in all type I cases (100 %), in eight type II cases (40%) and three type III cases (18%).The remaining patients were treated by arthroscopic reduction with crossed K-wires (type I, 0%; type II, 60%; type III, 82%).Six patients (12.5%) had symptoms of persistent anterior instability and five of them (10.4%) were indicated for ante rior ligament reconstruction at the end of skeletal growth.We did not see serious complications. DISCUSSIONMost of the authors recommend that type I and type II fractures should be treated conservatively; type III is better treated by arthroscopic reduction.Some of type II and type III fractures are indicated for minimally invasive surgical treatment at once.At the present time at our department, type II and some type III fractures are indicated first for conservative reduction and, when this fails, arthroscopic reduction with K-wire fixation is used. CONCLUSIONSThe aim of our report was to report the results of our study and present our relatively conservative way of treatment as the method of choice for treating intercondylar eminence fractures in children and adolescents.",

    "abstract": "A longitudinal (vertical) fracture of the sacrum passing through the central sacral canal is a very rare injury, reported in the literature mostly as case reports. Out of 24 reference found, non-union associated with this fracture has been reported only once. A longitudinal fracture of the sacrum is always associated with injury to the anterior pelvic ring. Conical instability of the pelvis, little known so far, occurs if only the anterior ring of the pelvis is stabilised and early weight-bearing is established. It is demonstrated by opening of the distal part of a sacral fracture and, in the case of symphyseolysis, also by opening of the distal part of the symphysis. Therefore, in this type of fracture, both the anterior and posterior pelvic arches should be stabilised at the same time. Iliosacral screws applied percutaneously are optimal for osteosynthesis of sacral longitudinal fractures; sacral bars could be used as well. By means of this procedure, painful instability of the posterior pelvic segment and non-union in this area can be prevented. This case report describes the successful treatment of a 46-year-old male patient injured in a motorbike accident. Despite stabilisation of the pubic symphysis using a plate and locking screws, the patient developed a pseudoarthrosis of the sacrum with implant failure within 6 months of surgery. For that reason, the sacrum was stabilised by two iliosacral screws in a combination with a sacral bar at the S1-S2 level. The implants were introduced percutaneously using CT guidance. Stabilisation of the anterior part of the pelvis was performed by using a supra-acetabular external pelvic fixator; the original implant was left in situ. Consequently, the sacral non-union healed within one year.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYRepeated measurements of the spine are absolutely necessary in children and adolescents affected by spinal deformities especially during their growing-up periods.To avoid risks of tissue damage from x-ray exposure, several methods for non-invasive measurement of the spinal curvature have been developed.One of them is the DTP-3 position system allowing for a three-dimensional measurement of anatomical landmarks (spinous processes) and the calculation of curvature angles in both the frontal and sagittal planes.We were interested to know whether the DTP-3 was precise enough to determine the true spinal curvature. MATERIAL AND METHODSTo determine the precision of the DTP-3 system, we constructed a model of the spine.The model was then repeatedly investigated by both the noninvasive and x-ray methods.The distortion of x-ray images caused by the central projection mechanism was considered and included in the calculation.In addition, a group of patients with scoliosis up to 40° was evaluated by both the DTP-3 system and x-ray (the latter according to Cobb's method). RESULTSDifferences in spatial coordinates between DTP-3 and x-ray examinations reached 20.9 mm in the frontal plane and 67.3 mm in the sagittal plane without distortion correction of x-ray images.The differences decreased below 1.5 mm after image distortion correction in each plane.Distortion correction had not the same effect for angle parameters as for coordinates.Differences between the DTP-3 angle parameters and Cobb's x-ray angles were below 4.7°, both without correction and after correction.The difference between DTP-3 angle parameters and Cobb's x-ray angles was -1.8° ± 3.0° (mean ± standard deviation) when measurement was performed on the patients with scoliosis. DISCUSSIONThe goal of any clinical examination is to obtain data applicable to decision-making analysis.In the case of scoliosis it is necessary to report results in terms of Cobb's angle, which is the problem for all surface-dependent methods, especially in patients with double curves.A solution may be to define the maximal difference between noninvasive and x-ray methods that could be acceptable for good clinical practice. CONCLUSIONSIn this study we report good concordance between noninvasive and x-ray examinations of a modeled spinal deformity in terms of both angle and linear measurements.The same results were obtained for angle measurements in a group of patients with scoliosis up to 40°.Based on this study and our previous data we believe that the DTP-3 system can be introduced into clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "A number of surgical and nonsurgical techniques have been used in the recent past for the treatment of this not uncommon traumatic condition. Thus far, no agreement has been reached regarding the method most likely to consistently render good results. Uppermost in determining the treatment has been the degree of displacement of the clavicle and the prevention of possible cosmetically unacceptable complications. Advances in the surgical care of most fractures and dislocations have lead to the current belief and practice among the majority of orthopaedic surgeons that every effort should be made to correct any deviation from the normal produced by the injury. I submit that skilful neglect and acceptance of acromio-clavicular dislocation is an option worth considering. When the dislocation is accepted, the vast majority of patients do well, functionally and aesthetically. Chronic pain is an extremely rare situation; and the resulting deformity, from the cosmetic point of view, an uncommon problem. If this is the case, what is the problem that reconstructive surgery proposes to address?",

    "abstract": "To identify some characteristics of bone repair capacity in elderly patients who undergo total hip arthroplasty, which requires good healing ability of bone for implant osteointegration and bone defect repair, particularly if revision arthroplasty is necessary.In a group of 27 patients (mean age, 70 ± 7 years; range, 60 to 81 years) a coincidence of osteoarthritis and osteopenia/ osteoporosis was assessed, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were isolated and their numbers, viability and proliferative capacity were evaluated. The MSC populations were examined for their behaviour on bone tissue scaffolds used in orthopaedic surgery for treatment of bone lesions. Each patient underwent bone densitometry examination before total hip arthroplasty. Bone marrow was harvested intra-operatively from the trochanteric region of the femur. From a portion of bone marrow, MSCs were isolated and cultured, and a mononuclear cell concentrate was obtained. Either whole bone marrow or a mononuclear cell concentrate was applied to selected matrices (allograft, demineralised bone matrix, porous beta-tricalcium phosphate (-TCP), pressed hydroxyapatite or calcium sulphate). The production of new collagen and extracellular mineralized matrix were first assessed in expansion medium and, when the production was low, differentiation medium was used.A coincidence of osteoarthritis and osteopenia/osteoporosis was found in 50% of the patients. All were women with a low body mass index and had been post-menopausal for an average of 23 years. The isolated MSCs contained a high percentage of viable cells (mean, 95%). The mesenchymal cells of patients with osteopenia, as compared with those having normal bone density, showed markedly lower numbers of fibroblastic colony forming units (CFU-F) per ml and had a lower proliferative capacity because the population doubling time during the first four passages was much longer. Of the scaffolds tested, allografts showed the most marked collagen and extracellular mineralized matrix production in expansion medium with either whole bone marrow or a monocyte concentrate; porous -TCP was the best of bone graft substitutes in collagen and extracellular mineralized matrix production by both whole bone marrow and a monocyte concentrate, but this was only in differential medium.The coincidence of ostearthritis with osteopenia/osteoporosis was found in a higher number of our patients than is reported in the literature. Also, a lower MSC proliferative capacity and a low number of CFU-F/ml in the patients with low bone density were interesting findings. Better bone regeneration would generally be achieved with higher MSC numbers and the use of growth factors for stimulation of osteoinduction and angiogenesis. Bone marrow harvesting for MSC isolation, cultivation and subsequent transplantation is currently feasible only in an experiment. A bone marrow aspirate can be applied, but it may not provide a sufficient number of MSCs. In addition to autologous bone grafts, the best collagen production was on allografts. In bone graft substitutes, the porous structure played an important role because on a non-porous material (calcium sulphate) the formation of collagen was very low. There was no difference in collagen and extracellular mineralized matrix production between whole bone marrow and monocyte concentrates.Elderly patients have reduced bone healing capacity also because of osteopenia/osteoporosis that occurs more often than it is generally diagnosed, including its coincidence with osteoarthritis. The mesenchymal stem cells isolated from osteopenic bone give a lower number of CFU-F/ml and have a lower proliferative capacity. Of the matrices for new bone formation, allografts showed the best results because collagen was produced already in expansion medium. Of the graft substitutes, porous -TCP was the best, but with collagen production in differential medium. The use of bone marrow aspirate is currently a method of choice in order to increase MSC numbers at the site of bone healing. The use of growth factors is an expensive treatment. To achieve the goal of reliable promotion of osteogenesis with cultured MSC transplantation and use of composite materials with pro-osteogenic and pro-angiogenic factors will still require many experimental and clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Current trends in minimally invasive surgery together with advances in computed tomography and fluoroscopic guidance allow us to perform close reduction and percutaneous fixation also in non-displaced or minimally displaced fractures of the pelvic ring and acetabulum. Authors report the method of percutaneous screw fixation.During the period from 1998 to 2010, a total of 568 patients were surgically treated for fractures of the pelvic ring and acetabulum. The patient series included 132 men and 46 women with an average age of 41.6 years (from 15 to 88 years). In this cohort, 225 single screws were placed at various sites of the pelvis. Of the screws, 197 were applied percutaneously and 28 in open procedures. A definition of six screw categories is proposed as well as the list of indications for their use. A detailed description of the techniques for screw placement, including the associated risks, is also presented. A novel method of minimally invasive stabilisation of the ruptured symphysis by means of two pubic screws and a two-hole plate is reported. A total of 157 patients were followed for the average period of 11.9 months (from 3 to 144 months). The navigation methods used in pelvic fracture stabilisation are described.It is difficult to provide an overall evaluation of the results in such a heterogeneous group of patients and therefore the outcome was assessed according to the placement of single screws. The types of injury with the use of appropriate screws are described in detail. Complications and the final graphical and clinical outcomes are reported. As the pelvic ring and acetabular injuries vary too much, it was not easy to assess the clinical outcome for each screw category.Percutaneous screw fixation is indicated in non-displaced fractures having a potential for displacement as well as in minimally displaced fractures that can be fixed with precisely placed screws. Dislocated fractures have to be reduced before surgery. Percutaneous screw placement can be performed as a single surgical procedure and this technique can also be part of a limited open approach. Percutaneous or open placement of cannulated screws facilitates stabilisation of individual fragments and allows for low surgical invasivity. This type of screw fixation in pelvic surgery provides all benefits of minimally invasive procedures. In this respect, some authors' view that the advantages outweigh a less successful result of fracture reduction can be accepted. A relatively high risk of iatrogenic complications is a disadvantage of this technique. The correct placement of screws has the highest priority because all percutaneous pelvic screws described here are inserted into the sites known as \"narrow safe zones\".In specific localisations, the percutaneous fixation of pelvic ring and acetabular fractures using single screws presents a new surgical technique for which the indications have not been exactly defined yet. The procedure should be performed by an experienced surgeon ready to convert surgery from a minimally invasive procedure to an open one, if the navigation technique used does not provide a reliable guidance or when the fracture reduction or stabilisation fails.",

The comparison was based on radiographic results and fusion rates.A total number of 113 consecutive patients were enrolled in this prospective study between October 2008 and July 2009. Mono- or bisegmental spondylosis was diagnosed in the patients in whom conservative treatment of cervicobrachial symptoms had had no effect. Patients with myelopathy were not included..All patients underwent standard anterior microdiscectomy (at one or two levels). The novel anchored spacer Zero-P was used in 61 patients (group 1) and, in 52 patients, stabilisation was done using the interbody spacer Cornerstone and dynamic plate Premier (group 2). Lateral radiographic views of the cervical spine were obtained before surgery and at 6 weeks, and then at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. During follow-up, the cervical spine sagittal alignment (CobbC), segmental angle of the treated levels (CobbS), amount of segmental collapse and fusion rates were measured.There was no significant difference in CobbC between the two groups during follow- up (p < 0.051). A significant difference in the first two values of CobbS was found (p < 0.001), but next changes in CobbS were without any difference in either group. The mean degree of interspace collapse was without any significant difference between the groups. The fusion rate was significantly higher in group 1 than group 2 nine months after surgery (p = 0.032), but was the same in both groups at 12 months after surgery (p = 1.0).The anchored spacer Zero-P provides biomechanical stability for the cervical spine similar to the cage and dynamic plate construct. Efforts to improve the cervical stand-alone anterior fusion device and to eliminate disadvantages of plate systems should be studied in larger patient groups with longer follow-ups.

MATERIAL AND METHODSThis retrospective study included 441 patients in the age range of 18 to 83 years who underwent parathyroidectomy between 2004 and 2007.Skeletal disorders were diagnosed by clinical, radiographic and densitometric examination; calcium levels were measured after surgery.Bone repair after parathyroidectomy was followed up by the endocrinologist for 1 year. RESULTSBefore surgery, 48 % of the patients had skeletal disorders.Adenoma was found in 87 %, double adenoma in 2 %, hyperplasia in 10 % and parathyroid carcinoma in 0.5 % of the patients.Complications involved transient paresthesia of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (1 %), transient hypocalcemia (0.5 %), transient post-operative arrhythmias (0.5 %), temporary psychological problems (0.7 %) and post-operative bleeding (0.5 %).None of the patients died.Serum calcium levels were as follows: 2.90 ± 0.01 mmol/L pre-operatively; 2.44 ± 0.01 mmol/L on the evening of surgery; 2.30 ±0.01 mmol/L on the 1st day; 2.19 ± 0.01 mmol/L on the 2nd day; and 2.18 ± 0.01 mmol/L on the 3rd post-operative day.On the 3rd post-operative day most of the patients were discharged from the hospital.Normal calcium levels were achieved in 98 % of the surgically treated patients.

The group included patients with knee joint injuries treated at our department in the 2000-2010 period. There were 413 boys (58%) and 300 girls (42%) with an average age of 14 years and 2 months.

The clinical diagnosis was fully confirmed in 62%, partially confirmed in 17% (combined injuries) and was wrong in 21% of the patients. In this group, the most frequent diagnosis made by arthroscopy was injury to the lateral meniscus. Arthroscopy revealed patellar dislocations in 18%, osteochondral and cartilage lesions in 16%, plica injuries in 15 %, medial meniscus injuries in 14%, anterior cruciate ligament lesions in 12% and lateral meniscus injury in 8% of the patients.With the number of knee injuries in children and adolescents increasing every year, the role of arthroscopy in their diagnosis and treatment is becoming increasingly important. The results of our analysis showed gradual improvement in clinical outcomes and subjective evaluation of the arthroscopic technique in children and adolescents with the history of knee injury. Some authors report difficulties with the pre-operative diagnosis at this age; our results were notably better.Knee arthroscopy is a safe and effective method of a high diagnostic and therapeutic value and its use in children and adolescents should be recommended.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the results of femoral lengthening in the patients treated from 2000 to 2009 in whom complete radiographic data were available and the lengthening procedure involved mainly the use of a Mephisto fixator.A total of 28 femoral lengthening procedures were carried out in 26 patients,16 girls and 10 boys. The external fixator Mephisto was used in 24 cases; fixators Prospon and Orthofix in one and three cases, respectively. Fifteen patients were treated for congenital short femur, the rest had secondary femoral shortening due to following pathologies: distal femoral epiphysiolysis in five children, proximal femoral osteomyelitis in one child, avascular necrosis of the femoral head in one, diaphyseal femur fracture in one, enchondromatosis of the distal femur with growth plate destruction in one, and contralateral femur overgrowth following a fracture in one child. The average age at the beginning of treatment was 11 (range, 4-16) years. Complications were classified as mild, serious and critical. The results were statistically analysed using several statistical tests.The average parameter values for the group included: total femoral lengthening, 40.2.mm (SD±11.1); osteotomy index (OI), 41 % (SD±9.8); lengthening percentage (LP), 10.9 % (SD±3.8); lengthening index (LI), 14.5 (SD±3.5) days/cm; hea- ling index (HI), 52.6 (SD±20.1) days/cm; and consolidation index (CI), 93.3 (SD±40.0) days/cm. Mild complications were recorded in 11 (39.2 %), and serious and critical in eight patients (28.6 %). Fourteen patients (53.8 %) were free of any complications. Two complications were concurrently found in five patients (17.9 %). There was a statistically significant difference in the LP values related to the number of complications (p=0.019). No significant relationship was recorded on comparison of the HI value with the patient's age at the time of surgery (p=0.836) and patient's gender (p=0.546) (Mann- Whitney test). The relationship of the OI value to the HI value was non-significant (p=0.492), as was the relationship between the osteotomy technique (oscillating or Gigli saw osteotomy) and the occurrence of complications (p=1.000) (Fisher's exact test). Correlation between the LI and HI values was significant (p<0.001).The results of healing after lengthening, as assessed by the healing and the consolidation index, were in agreement with other authors' data. The lower number of complications, particularly fractures of bone regenerate, can be explained by the facts that, in our study, the lengthening percentage was lower and that the post-operative care was strictly observed, including dynamic axial loading which stimulates bone consolidation at the lengthened section, with adherence to the proof of three developed cortices.Our results did not confirm the assumption that slower lengthening will have a favourable effect on the healing index.

    "abstract": "The authors discuss arguments concerning indications and selection of implants and operative techniques for arthroplasty in the treatment of femoral neck fractures. Their analysis is based on long-term experience with surgical treatment of patients with hip fractures and on the evaluation of a large number of publications by well-known specialists. The assessed group included 4795 patients treated at their institution between 1997 and 2010, of whom 1532 underwent hip replacement, with 1032 receiving hemiarthroplasty (HA) and 500 having total hip replacement (THR) indicated for femoral neck fractures. A painful hemiarthroplasty due to acetabular cartilage erosion and subsequent head protrusion is still a challenging clinical problem. The most important factor in prevention of this complication remains strict adherence to indication criteria. A metal monoblock hemiarthroplasty should be indicated only in very old patients with serious co-morbidities or in patients whose pre-operative mobility has been greatly restricted. For the other cases, a modular prosthesis is preferred because it allows for more exact alignment and, if necessary, its conversion to a total hip prosthesis is relatively easy. The stem to be implanted should be the one used in standard THR procedures. A ceramic modular head then enables hemiarthroplasty to function for long with a low risk of cartilage erosion and head protrusion. Even if the choice of an optimal prosthesis, in terms of its biomechanical and biological properties, has been correct, the prosthesis' long life span and good functioning still depends on the surgeon's adherence to the principles of the correct operative technique (the head centre situated 1 to 2 mm below the level of the apex of the greater trochanter, 12- to 15-degree anteversion, articular capsule suture, and re-insertion of external rotator tendons if the Koch-Langenbeck approach is used. This is the only way of minimising acetabular erosion and other complications. Indications for total replacement include, in addition to fractures at joints affected by arthritis, most often a displaced fracture of the femoral neck found in younger patients still in good general health with a good prospect for a long life. Even if dislocation and loosening occur in these patients more often than in those with a THR procedure indicated for other reasons (primary or post-dysplastic arthritis), this therapy offers fewer complications and longer functioning in comparison with other methods of treating femoral neck fractures. A cemented prosthesis can be regarded as the standard implant; however, if the proximal femur shows good quality cortical bone, an uncemented implant can be used without a greater risk of future loosening. In the absence of hip arthritis which leads to the development of subchondral sclerosis required for the correct acetabular cup fixation, a hybrid THR with an expansion cup or a screw-in cup is recommended.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the outcomes of corrective osteotomy for malunited fractures of the distal radius, to assess the degree of correction or its loss, if it happened, after bone union, and to compare the clinical and radiographic results with the relevant literature reports.In the period from September 2002 and October 2004, a total of 16 patients (six men and 10 women) underwent surgery for malunited fractures of the distal radius. The average patient age was 49.3 years, with a range of 23 to 73 years. For the sake of evaluation, records were made of patients' subjective feelings, objective measurements of motion range and muscle strength and exact measurements of relevant parameters on radiographs. Plain radiographs of the distal radius of both upper extremities in anteroposterior and lateral projections were made before and after surgery, and at final follow-up after osteotomy healing. The following parameters were measured: length of the radius, ulnar inclination angle and tilt of the distal articular surface of the radius. Because we evaluated our patients in retrospect, it was not always possible to find the exact values of motion range and muscle strength as they existed before surgery. Therefore, for comparison, we used the values obtained on the unhurt extremity. Corrective surgery included radius opening-wedge osteotomy with bone graft insertion and subsequent fixation with a 3.5-mm T plate. The final evaluation was based on the New York Orthopaedic Hospital Wrist Rating Scale. RESULTS The highest lengthening achieved by corrective osteotomy was 9 mm. The largest change in the ulnar inclination angle was 34 degrees. The best correction of a dorsal deformity was 24 degrees. The result evaluation was : 30 % excellent, 50 % good, and 20 % fair. DISCUSSION Corrective osteotomy of the distal radius with graft insertion is one of the options for the restoration of anatomical conditions following malunited fractures. The timing and technique of the surgical procedure were in agreement with the data reported in the literature, as well as the results achieved in this study.Corrective osteotomy and bone graft insertion are surgical procedures used for the treatment of malunited fractures of the distal radius. They are indicated in active younger patients with proven symptoms and correlating radiographic evidence. The surgery should be preceded by a thorough radiographic examination and pre-operative planning. Key words: distal radius fracture, bone malunion, corrective osteotomy.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSIn the 1992-2008 period, Baker's procedure, prolongation of the triceps muscle in the common part of the gastrocnemius and soleus aponeuroses, was indicated in 114 children, aged between 3 and 18 years, mostly with spastic hemiplegia (45.7 %) or diplegia (42.9 %).In both groups, the isolated Baker's procedures and the combined procedures were clinically assessment at 2 and 6 months after surgery. RESULTSClinical examination at a follow-up of 8 weeks showed that all patients achieved 5 to 10 degrees of dorsiflexion of the foot.A maximum of Achilles tendon stretch-out was achieved in seven patients (6.14%) after 6 months.In one patient (0.9%) an excessive dorsiflexion was recorded. DISCUSSIONThe choice of surgical tactics for treatment of spastic pes equinus is related to a positive or a negative result of the Silfverskiold test, because this shows the degree of contracture of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles.Prolongation at their joint aponeurosis should be indicated when the test shows partly positive results, and muscle balance at all levels of the lower extremity should be maintained. CONCLUSIONSBaker's procedure is one of the options to treat spastic pes equinus.The surgery is indicated primarily in isolated pes equinus and in children with spastic hemiplegia with low risk of Achilles tendon excessive elongation.",

    "abstract": "This study deals with the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation therapy, using a combination of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and Warfarin, administered after total arthroplasty (TA) of large joints. Patients with a high rate of complications due to bleeding comprised the first evaluated group. After the causes had been analyzed and eliminated (or reduced), the second group of patients was evaluated. The aim of the study was to ascertain whether risks and complications did not overweight the benefits of Warfarin administration in the prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and whether this combined anticoagulation therapy, which is cheaper than LMWH alone, was generally applicable.Group 1 comprised 100 consecutive patients undergoing surgery in 2001. Group 2 consisted of 122 consecutive patients operated on in 2002. Only patients with elective either total knee or hip arthroplasties were included. In all of them, Warfarin therapy was initiated at 2 days after surgery and preoperative LMWH administration was carried on until 6 to 7 days postoperatively.Both groups were examined for the frequency and extent of postoperative hematomas, INR (international normalized ratio) fluctuation at the time of Warfarin initiation and during its long-term administration, and thrombotic and bleeding complications associated with anticoagulation therapy. The results were statistically evaluated and compared between the groups, and conclusions were drawn for further treatment policy.In group 1, 20% of hospitalized patients and 21% within 10 weeks of discharge from hospital experienced bleeding or thrombotic complications. A markedly high INR at Warfarin initiation was found in 8% of the patients. After discharge, 11% were not followed up, 5% were found underdosed and 12% overdosed. In group 2, 3.2% of the patients had bleeding complications during hospitalization, but no thrombotic events occurred; at 10 weeks of follow-up, bleeding or thrombotic complications were recorded in 10.6% of the patients. Extreme values of INR at Warfarin initiation were found in 5.7% of the patients. After discharge, 5% were not followed up, 30% were found underdosed and 8.1% overdosed. The distinctly better results in group 2 were attributed to the measures taken to eliminate most of the factors increasing hazards of Warfarin anticoagulation therapy, i. e., pre-operative administration of non-steroid antirheumatic drugs (NSA), high initial Warfarin doses, strict requirement for INR values in the range of 2-2.5, failure to keep the recommended diet after discharge, poor compliance with taking the prescribed Warfarin dose and insufficient INR monitoring by general practitioners.In patients undergoing total arthroplasty of large joints, the authors compare the anticoagulation therapy based on LMWH and Warfarin with other treatments for DVT prevention in terms of efficacy, safety and economy. They prefer LMWH administration as early as 12 h before surgery. Although Warfarin administration has proved a safe therapy with regard to bleeding complications in a number of conditions, this is not the case in patients undergoing total knee or hip replacements. These procedures result in great stress for the organism, particularly after long-term preoperative NSA treatment, and this is associated with a risk of gastric ulcer development or manifestation of existing mucosal lesions. The risk of bleeding may be increased by unexplained fluctuation of INR values at Warfarin initiation.The results of this study suggests that correctly administered, preventive drug treatment of thromboembolic events is an important adjunct to other measures, such as early rehabilitation including standing and walking, compression of the lower extremities or sufficient liquid intake, taken to prevent the development of deep venous thrombosis. The combination of LMWH with Warfarin was used as an anticoagulation therapy in this study. The effective and safe Warfarin treatment should be based on the experience of an attending physician, who starts and monitors the therapy. Warfarin administration requires careful and relatively complex follow-up, with frequent INR check-ups. However, the use of appropriate dosage and thorough follow-up do not make Warfarin administration completely safe in all cases. For instance, a high INR value at Warfarin initiation, which is difficult to influence, carries a high risk of bleeding for patients with occult gastrointestinal lesions. The authors do not routinely use preventive treatment with LMWH alone, primarily for its high cost.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Use of an all-polyethylene (all-poly, AP) tibial component in primary total knee arthroplasty is still an attractive option considering the durability of replacement, the elimination of backside wear and the lower cost compared to modular metalbacked tibia. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the long-term results of the total knee replacement using the P.F.C. Sigma system with a monoblock all-polyethylene tibial component implanted at the 1st Orthopedic Department of the St. Anne's University Hospital and Masaryk University Brno in the period 1999-2010. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the monitored period, 911 total knee replacements using P.F.C. Sigma with an all-polyethylene tibial component were performed. This cohort of patients was evaluated at least 10 years after the primary replacement surgery. Altogether 323 knee replacements in 289 patients were evaluated. The clinical outcomes were assessed according to the Knee Society Clinical Rating System (KSS) and the Total Knee Arthroplasty Roentgenographic Evaluation and Scoring System. The replacement survival was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. RESULTS In the evaluated group, the average KS was 82.6 points and the average functional score was 74.7 points. Excellent results were recorded in 213 cases, good results in 78 and satisfactory in 23 replacements. Poor clinical results were reported in 9 patients. The average range of motion was 105.8°. In 5 knees (1.5%) revision surgery was performed for infection complications, 3 cases were complicated due to periprosthetic fractures, 4 replacements were revised due to anterior knee pain and 8 knees showed a limited range of motion. Only 1 replacement was revised for aseptic loosening, with no need for reimplantation of the component. The survivorship of the implant was 98.5 % at the follow-up of 12.8 years, including the reasons of reimplantation. DISCUSSION Total knee replacement with an all-polyethylene tibial component is not so popular as the metal-backed modular implants. The all-polyethylene tibial component has certain advantages: lower unit costs, no backside wear, no liner dislocation, possibility of conservative bone resection. On the other hand, this type of implant is not modular and augmentations or longer stems cannot be used. Even though this type of endoprosthesis is recommended exclusively for elderly patients with a lower level of activity, the current mid- and long-term results show that indications for all-poly implants are much broader. CONCLUSIONS The total knee replacement with an all-polyethylene tibial component shows very good long-term clinical outcomes with an excellent survival rate. The all-poly design is cost-effective and may be used not only in elderly patients. Key words: total knee replacement, all-polyethylene tibial component, long-term results.",

Pre-operative examination revealed a pulsating mass below the right inguinal ligament that raised the suspicion of a pseudoaneurysm of the external iliac artery. Because of this suspected late complication of the first revision arthroplasty, surgical exploration was indicated by the vascular surgeon prior the second reimplantation. A CT-scan showed a large mass attached to a preserved lumen of the external iliac artery, and this was diagnosed by the vascular surgeon as a pseudoaneurysm. However, no pseudoaneurysm was found by a vascular surgery procedure, and the large mass ventrally extending the external iliac artery appeared to be a large polyethylene granuloma well enveloped in a fibrous pseudocapsula. The granuloma was removed and the wound sutured. Twelve days later, revision total hip arthroplasty and acetabular reconstruction were successfully carried out.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY By 7th December 2016, 4,755 Bicon-Plus cups in total were implanted in the Czech Republic. Some of them have been continuously re-operated, while the most frequent reason of failure is polyethylene wear and aseptic loosening. The present study is focused on surface analysis of retrieved polyethylene Bicon-Plus cups and the determination of the roughness of their bearing surfaces. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, we had 13 high molecular weight polyethylene cups with the average time in situ of 8.11 years (3.6-13.7, SD 3.2) before the retrieval. The study population was composed of 3 men, 10 women, with the mean age of 53.31 years. An optical scanning method, based on the principle of active triangulation, was used to determine wear rate. The rate of wear was identified by means of an obtained scan subsequently processed with the use of the GOM Inspect software. The roughness of surfaces was analysed with the application of Contour GT-X8 profiler using the principle of phase shifting interferometry. Measurements of surface topography of the retrieved cups were performed on the entire bearing surfaces. For the individual surface changes, a typical range of surface roughness, describing the particular wear character, was determined. By means of morphology analysis of the tested implants, three areas were identified: unworn area; area representing the worn part of the cup; and the area roughened by parallel grooving. The total surface roughness was evaluated as an arithmetic mean of the measured values. Subsequently, the values were sorted based on frequency and were classified into categories defining the particular wear mechanisms. RESULTS Wear rate of the retrieved acetabular cups was evaluated based on the wear direction vector and the size of linear wear. The average linear wear was equal to 0.13 mm/year (ranging from 0.26 to 2.29 mm/year), and the mean value of total volumetric material loss was 44.37 mm3/year (the range being from 51.80 to 1,119.7 mm3/year). Using the optical profilometer, a map of roughness distribution of the individual cups was obtained. For each implant, 76 values of roughness were evaluated. With the respect to average roughness, the samples were sorted to various categories describing: surface polishing; abrasiveadhesive wear; surfaces with preserved grooving; substantial plastic deformation. DISCUSSION The results clearly showed an increase of wear depending on implant survival; however, the tendency is not linear. This fact can be attributed to a larger amount of abrasive particles, causing an increase of wear or occurrence of surface wear in terms of micro cracks and oxidation degradation of polyethylene. This study indicates that geometry, positioning, and cup alignment during the implantation have a fundamental impact on the cup durability. Further correlation, which was observed in the case of the cup with prevailing roughness in the range from 0.1 to 0.3 μm, is a relatively wide wear vector angle determined with the use of the optical method. Considering the implants with the longest survival time with no loosening of the acetabular cup, the mean angle of direction vector was 56.8° (SD 2.1°). CONCLUSIONS The present study provides the results of morphology analysis of the retrieved Bicon-Plus cups. In general, relatively high wear rate, mainly of abrasive-adhesive character was identified. The dependence between wear and implant in situ longevity was not clearly linear, which suggests the influence of other parameters on the polyethylene wear rate. An important role of implant positioning on survival was also revealed. Moreover, it seems that it can be a more important parameter than the characteristics of the patient. Key words: total hip arthroplasty, Bicon-Plus cup, retrieval analysis, surface analysis, wear measurement, roughness, deformation, survivorship.",

    "abstract": "The first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint replacement ranks among the treatment methods of patients with hallux rigidus. The paper aims to evaluate the short-term to mid-term outcomes and to present clinical experience with our Medin PH-flex implant. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the period from January 2011 to 2016 we performed total replacement of the first MTP joint in 31 patients, in 4 cases bilaterally. In total, 35 implants were evaluated. The mean age of the patient at the time of surgery was 57.7 years (39-72 years). The surgery was conducted in 29 women and 2 men. The patients were evaluated using the AOFAS score (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score), the radiographs were assessed as to the potential occurrence of radiolucent lines, with major stress put on the assessment of the mobility in MTP joint and its position. The pain was assessed based on the VAS score. RESULTS Prior to the joint replacement surgery, the mean AOFAS score in patients was 55.6 (35-65). Postoperatively, the mean AOFAS score was 80.8 (65-95). The pain suffered by patients was evaluated with the use of the Pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS score). The preoperative mean VAS score was 5 (2-8), whereas the postoperative score improved to mean VAS 2 (0-4). The range of motion was clinically assessed with a goniometer. The mean range of motion of plantar flexion and dorsiflexion was 16.00° (5-35°) and 28.60° (10-55°), respectively. The mean range of motion was 36° (15-60°). No intraoperative complications were observed. In all the patients, the surgical wound healed per primam. In 2 female - (5.7 %) of the whole group of patients who underwent surgery a deep infection occurred, namely 10 and 21 months following the implantation. In both the female patients their condition was managed by joint revision operation and by a simple removal of the implant. DISCUSSION Joint replacement related matters were repeatedly discussed in professional literature. There are many papers published in the literature on this topic. A whole range of the first MTP joint implants of different shapes have been developed, with extremely different clinical results. CONCLUSIONS An appropriately chosen type of the implant, a fitting indication and a correctly applied implantation technique can lead to the desired good outcome. The first MTP joint replacement should be indicated after careful consideration since the management of a potential joint replacement failure can often be very technically challenging and quite mutilating for the patient. The mid-term outcomes of the Medin a.s. first MTP implant seem to be promising. It will, however, be necessary to wait for long-term outcomes in order to evaluate the final benefits of this type of implant in patients with hallux rigidus. Key words: hallux rigidus, arthroplasty of the MTP joint, hemiarthroplasty, silicone implant.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSThe design of the study is a cadaveric biomechanical laboratory study.38 fresh-frozen human hamstring specimens from 19 cadaveric donors were used.The grafts were tested for their loading properties.One half of each specimen was suspended over a 3.3mm pin, the other half was cross-pinned by a 3.3mm pin to simulate the graft cross-pinning technique.Single impact testing was performed and the failure force, elongation and acceleration/deceleration of each graft was recorded and the loading force vs. elongation of the graft specimens was calculated.Results for suspended and cross-pinned grafts were analysed using ANOVA method, comparing the grafts from each donor. RESULTSThe ultimate strength of a double-strand gracilis graft was 1287 ± 134 N when suspended over a pin, the strength of a cross-pinned graft was 833 ± 111 N. For double-strand semitendinosus grafts the strengths were 1883 ± 198 and 997 ± 234 N, respectively.Thus, the failure load for the cross-pinning method is only 64.7% or 52.9% for the suspension method. DISCUSSIONStructural damage to the graft significantly reduces the graft strength.Also, extensive suturing during preparation of the graft reduces its strength. CONCLUSIONSFixation methods that do not interfere with the graft's structure should be used to reduce the risk of graft failure.",

A common related problem is chronic skin ulcers, which, while not life-threatening, can significantly decrease the quality of the patient's life. The present study aims to evaluate new materials and methods to improve and accelerate the treatment of leg ulcers. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-five patients with chronic ulcers treated using autologous growth factors applied on a nanofiber carrier were included in the cohort. The control group consisted of 15 patients treated using standard moist wound therapy. The surface area of the ulcer was measured on the 0th, 14th, 28th, 56th, 84th, 112th, 140th, 140th, and 168th day of treatment. Ulcer depth was measured on the 0th, 5th, 28th, 84th, and 168th day of treatment. Results were statistically processed and evaluated. RESULTS During the study, the defect area decreased in both the control and experimental group. Statistically significantly better results were observed in the experimental group relative to the progress of ulcer depth. The experimental group also had more healed ulcers. DISCUSSION Moistness is necessary for chronic wounds to heal; it is needed to ensure optimal cell growth, angiogenesis, and fibrinolysis. Wounds can be treated using non-active dressings with high absorption qualities; however, these do not guarantee optimal conditions for healing, or wounds can be treated with an interactive dressing that interacts with the wound surface. The third option for treatment is the use of bioactive materials that adhere to the wound and participate directly in the individual stages of healing. CONCLUSIONS The study found that autologous growth factors had statistically significant effects on the treatment of chronic ulcers. The authors believe that this method can accelerate the healing of primary post-injury or secondary postoperative wounds of lower leg soft tissues.

MATERIAL AND METHODSIn this case-control study we compared the use of statins between two groups of 210 patients: the first group (case group) included patients hospitalized for hip fractures while the second group (control group) included patients who did not suffer femur bone injuries.The two groups were matched for age, sex, year of hospitalization and possible confounding factors.Inside the group of cases, we also evaluated the differences in terms of fracture type, presence of previous fragility fracture and mortality between statin users and non-users. RESULTSThe use of statins was most common among patients without previous fractures (OR=0.54;95% CI=0.33-0.89;p=0.0138), especially in older patients (OR=0.40;95% CI=0.22-0.76).We did not find any significant difference in statin intake between men and women in the control group.In the case group, those who did not use statins were more likely to undergo a medial hip fracture (28.5% vs 16.1%).Patients from case group also presented a greater mortality (27.9% vs 19.35%) and an higher percentage of previous hip fractures (20.11% vs 9.7%).However, they didn't presented a significant higher rate of fragility fractures in other sites. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONSOur study suggests a reduced hip fracture risk, especially in cases aged 80 or more, a different fracture pattern (lower percentage of medial fractures) and a reduced mortality at 9 months in patients treated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, confirming the previous evidences reported in literature.",

Large acetabular defects cannot be treated with standard implant. Individual, customized implants based on 3D computed tomography (CT) scans are used for reconstruction. However, high complication and revision rates come along with final favorable outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS Eight patients underwent primary or revision total hip arthroplasty by an anterolateral surgical approach using patient matched implants based on 3D CT scans. Six patients with a Paprosky type IIIB acetabular defect, one patient with a nonunion acetabular and femoral neck fracture and one patient with a severe hip dysplasia were included. The clinical data and the Merle d'Aubigné score assessing the clinical outcome pre- and postoperatively were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS Patient matched implants were used for eight patients (four male and four female).

MATERIAL AND METHODSIn 20 cases (18 patients) with clinically confirmed acute musculoskeletal infections, intraoperative collected swab samples, tissue samples and fluid samples injected into standard blood culture vials were used for microbiological diagnosis.Identification of bacteria, time necessary for detection and ease of handling during surgery was evaluated. RESULTSIn 19 cases bacterial growth was demonstrated using either intraoperative swabs or blood culture technique (95% sensitivity),whereas 18 tissue biopsies were positive (90% sensitivity.27 bacterial species were isolated.In 18 instances for the swab technique, 14 instances for the tissue biopsy and 4 operations for the blood culture vials, ease of handling was rated as excellent. DISCUSSIONThe study demonstrated differences between the three tested methods with respect to ease of handling.With respect to the number of detected organisms and time for their detection there are no significant differences.These last findings are in contrast to of the results of other authors.The reason for this could be that during operative dissection an accurate and specific collection of specimens from the acute deep infected soft tissues and bones independent from the type of surgical procedure is possible.Therefore, even with the swab method a high amount of microorganisms can be recovered.Especially for intraarticular infections, fluid samples injected into standard blood vials is a practical method for the surgeon.In acute musculoskeletal infections other than joint infections, there is less benefit for the blood culture vials. CONCLUSIONIntraoperative swab technique yields valid results comparable to other techniques and is an accurate technique for detection of pathogens from acute musculoskeletal infections.",

    "abstract": "By presenting the results of treatment of secondary pyomyositis of deep hip muscles, to draw attention to the seriousness of this complication occurring in association with pelvic and lumbo-sacral infections.The course of disease was evaluated retrospectively in a group of 13 patients with an average age of 65.8 years treated in the period from April 2004 to June 2007. The imaging methods used included native radiography, ultrasonography (SONO), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Markers of inflammation, i.e., C-creative protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and WBC differential count, were used to assess the intensity of inflammation. At stage 1, patients were treated conservatively, with appropriate antibiotic therapy. At stages 2 and 3, surgical procedures were used (incision, abscess evacuation and drainage) or abscess was treated by CT-guided needle puncture and pigtail drain insertion. The evaluation took into account survival of the patients in relation to the stage of their disease, early detection of origin of infection, therapy initiation, and other factors putting patients at risk.Of the 13 patients treated, 10 had stage 3 pyomyositis with beginning or developed multiple-organ failure when they were referred to our institution from outside hospitals; three admitted at stage 2 pyomyositis were in relatively good state. Ten patients were cured, two died due to multiple-organ failure and one due to pulmonary embolism after lower-extremity phlebothrombosis. The success of treatment appeared to be related to early surgical intervention.A good outcome of therapy depends on an early diagnosis and treatment of the underlying infection and pyomyositis. To establish the diagnosis of pyomyositis, repeated clinical, laboratory and bacteriological examinations are necessary, as well as the use of imaging methods, namely SONO, CT and MRI. Treatment may be complicated when small multiple abscesses develop deep in the hip muscles where surgical intervention is difficult.Secondary pyomyositis is a serious, life-threatening complication of the underlying infection. The outcome of the disease depends on early diagnosis, therapy and the patient's overall state. Stage 1 pyomyositis (muscle oedema) is treated conservatively with antibiotics. Stage 2 pyomyositis needs surgical intervention with abscess aspiration and drainage; in some cases CT-guided needle puncture with pigtail drain insertion is sufficient. An appropriate antibiotic course is obligatory. Stage 3 pyomyositis associated with septic shock or multiple-organ failure requires a comprehensive care in an acute medicine department. In polymorbid patients prognosis is poor and treatment is expensive and often unsuccessful.",

Pseudoarthrosis developed in 25 patients and recurrent fractures were found in 11 patients (six of these suffered fractures along the original fracture line after minimal trauma and five showed a recurrent fracture at the site of screw tunnels). The average age of the patients was 37.3 years. The average period between injury and revision surgery was 16 months (range, 4 to 32 months). The follow-up included examination for early and late complications and the evaluation of X-ray findings and functional outcomes.The average follow-up was 21 months (range, 12 to 36 months). For revision surgery, an intra-medullary nail was used in 28 and a plate in 8 patients. The average operative time was 85 min (range, 30 to 180 min). Radiographic union was achieved by 6 months in 30, by 12 months in three and by 18 months in three patients. The average fusion time in the 30 patients healing by 6 months (nailing, 23x, 7x plate osteosynthesis) was 16.05 weeks. The range of motion in the wrist, forearm and elbow was evaluated by the Anderson method. The outcomes were excellent, good and satisfactory in 11, 15 and 10 patients, respectively. Poor results or wrist or elbow stiffness were not recorded. Pain was recorded at rest and in activity, taking requirements for analgesic therapy into account. After revision surgery, 22 patients were free from pain, 10 reported occasional pain during activity and four experienced pain at rest. None of the patients required permanent analgesic therapy.The results of our study show the effectiveness of plate and nailing techniques in revision forearm surgery. The corrective procedure must be chosen with regard to the type of pseudoarthrosis, and individual therapy respecting the principles of stable osteosynthesis is necessary. A differentiated operative approach, infection control and stimulation of bony union also play important roles.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The clubfoot ranks among the most frequent paediatric structural deformities of the lower extremity. Currently, the Ponseti method is considered the gold standard for the treatment. To evaluate the degree and severity of the deformity, clinical classification systems have been developed, commonly used in clinical practice. This study aims to verify whether the Pirani and Dimeglio clinical scoring systems can be used to predict the results of treatment by the Ponseti method. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 31 patients. The patients had been referred from the neonatal departments to the Department of Paediatric Surgery, Orthopaedics and Traumatology in Brno with the diagnosed clubfoot deformity, where they were treated by an erudite orthopaedist experienced in this field according to the Ponseti treatment standards. The Pirani and Dimeglio clinical scoring of the deformity were performed always before the commencement of the therapy and after the second plaster cast fixation. The number of plaster cast fixations, the necessity to carry out achillotomy and the relapse rate were set as the parameters of treatment results. In the first stage of statistical analysis, the respective clinical systems were correlated with the treatment results, in the second part of the study the patients were based on the clinical evaluation divided into 3 groups depending on the severity of the deformity, and these groups were subsequently compared. RESULTS 22 patients from the group (71%) underwent percutaneous achillotomy and in 3 patients (9.7%) a relapse occurred. To correct deformities 7.1 corrective casts were used on average. The correlation between the number of plaster cast fixations and classification systems was significant in all the cases, with the strongest dependency shown by the correlation with the Pirani score after the second corrective cast (r = 0.594, p < 0.001). Positive correlation was found also between the necessity to perform achillotomy and both the classification systems. In this case the strongest correlation was established in the case of the Pirani clinical scoring after the second plaster cast fixation (r = 0.488, p = 0.003). Conversely, significant correlation was not established between the relapse rate and the used classification systems, not even in a single case (p ≥ 0.05). In the second stage of the statistical analysis, in the case of the Pirani scoring before the therapy no difference was found between the individual groups with diverse severity of clubfoot deformity during the evaluation of the aforementioned parameters of treatment results. In the Pirani classification after the second plaster cast fixation, a statistically significant difference was established in the number of plaster cast fixations (p = 0.003) and the necessity to perform achillotomy (p = 0.012). When the Dimeglio scoring was applied before the therapy, a statistically significant difference between the groups was found in the number of plaster cast fixations (p = 0.031) and after the second plaster cast fixation in the relapse rate (p = 0.035). DISCUSSION Although the clinical scoring systems belong to key indicators of severity of the deformity and are commonly used in clinical practice, the current literature provides only an inconsistent picture of their application in predicting the course and the results of treatment. Concurrently, the authors opinions on this issue differ. The scoring in later stages of treatment shows a better predictive value than the scoring at the beginning of the treatment, which was confirmed also by the results of our study. CONCLUSIONS Even though the clinical scoring systems show a certain dependency on the parameters of the treatment results, in practice their predictive function can be used to a limited degree only. The complexity of the evaluation of the deformity itself and subsequently of the results of treatment requires also the use of other parameters than the clinical classifications only so that the prediction of the course and results of the treatment of clubfoot according to Ponseti shows a higher degree of reliability. Key words:clubfoot, Ponseti, Pirani classification, Dimeglio classification.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY When treating tears of the distal biceps brachii muscle tendon, we repeatedly noticed a difference between the preoperative ultrasound findings and the operative findings. The aim of the study was to retrospectively correlate these findings in order to determine the sensitivity of the ultrasound examination in everyday orthopaedic practice. Moreover, we compared the results and complications of surgical treatment through two operative techniques used at our department. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the 2004-2016 period 20 patients underwent a surgery at our department for total tear of the distal tendon of the biceps brachii muscle. In 18 patients an ultrasound examination was performed preoperatively. In 3 patients it was repeated. Therefore, there were a total of 21 ultrasound observations made in this group of patients. Excluded were the cases of chronic tendinoses or inveterated tears. The group was divided into two sub-groups. The first sub-group was composed of patients in whom the preoperative ultrasound examination was performed by a radiologist-specialist in the musculoskeletal system, the second sub-group was composed of patients examined by a non-specialist. The ultrasound findings were compared with the operative findings. With the use of a formula for the calculation of sensitivity of the test, the sensitivity of the ultrasound examination was determined for proper recognition of a complete tear of the tendon concerned. Also, we compared the results and complications of the two operative methods applied: the technique using bone anchor vs. the Boyd-Anderson technique of transosseous reinsertion. RESULTS The sensitivity of the ultrasound examination was 91% in examinations performed by a radiologist-specialist and 40% in examinations performed by no-specialists. Both the surgical techniques brought very good results in our group of patients. The reported complications included 2 cases of temporary radial nerve palsy, 1 case of formation of heterotopic ossifications. DISCUSSION The sensitivity of ultrasound is adequate according to the literature. In our group of patients, the same applied only to examinations performed by a radiologist-specialist in the musculoskeletal system. This is because the ultrasound examination of the distal biceps tendon is a highly specialised examination. When performed by a non-specialist, the result of examination obtained in our observations is rather misleading, thus could lead to an improper method of treatment. Partial tears of this tendon are very rare according to the literature. Indirect signs of the partial tear presence at this location detected by ultrasound resulted in most cases in an incorrect diagnosis, therefore the description of a partial tear visualised by the ultrasound should be reserved exclusively for cases when intact fibrils are clearly detected during the examination. For unclear cases, the MRI scan is indicated. The results of both the surgical techniques of reinsertion applied were very good. The method using the bone anchors is technically easier to perform. Nonetheless, it has its specifics. CONCLUSIONS To diagnose correctly the tear of the distal biceps muscle tendon it is essential to perform a thorough clinical examination and to obtain the medical history of the patient, especially the mechanism of injury. Sonography can be beneficial only provided the examination is carried out by a specialist in the musculoskeletal system, with the use of appropriate device and under standard conditions. For surgical treatment of this injury we prefer the technique using a bone anchor, namely particularly since it is technically easier to perform. The functional results are very good. Key words: distal biceps tendon, elbow, tendon tear, ultrasound, suture anchors.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Aseptic loosening of endoprosthetic components is the most frequent reason for total hip arthroplasty revision. This paper aimed to verify the influence of the type of hip-component fixation of total hip replacement in correlation with the age of patients on aseptic loosening of components during mid-term survival. MATERIAL AND METHODS The retrospective, monocentric study statistically evaluated the data of 67 cases of implanted total hip replacements in 66 patients with the loosening of at least one of the components requiring a revision of the total number of 1,488 primary total hip replacements implanted during the 1995 to 2006 period at a single department. The study compares the implants by Johnson&Johnson (Ultima threaded cups, Duraloc sector, Ultima UHMWPE cups. Mecroblock MR, AML and Ultima straight stems, Charnley and Elite plus cups and stems), Fehling Medical AG (HPQ and Müller cups, Müller Geradschaft stems) and Biomet (Mallory-Head and Müller cups, Bi-Metric cemented and uncemented stems) with respect to the age of patients. First-generation and second-generation cementing techniques were used. Primary arthroplasty of revised endoprostheses were indicated for primary and post-dysplastic coxarthrosis not requiring skeletal reconstruction. In order to determine the influence of age, three age categories were considered: under 54 years of age, 55 to 64 years of age, and elderly individuals aged 65 and over. The data was statistically evaluated by the test for two proportions and the Student's t-test. RESULTS The mean age of patients with total hip replacement loosening was lower than the mean age of the other patients (p < 0.05). The age category 55-64 reported a significantly higher failure rate only for HPQ - Müller-Geradschaft endoprosthesis compared to the uncemented and hybrid version of Mallory-Head - Bi-Metric, Duraloc - AML and Charnley group (p < 0.05). Duraloc - Charnley showed worse results than Mallory-Head - Bi-Metric porous (p = 0.0437). Except for HPQ - Müller-Geradschaft endoprosthesis, there were no statistically significant differences in the achieved revision rate of components used in endoprostheses. In the younger age category, only uncemented and hybrid versions were assessed. Hybrid endoprostheses made by Fehling and Biomet failed more often than uncemented Mallory-Head - Bi-Metric porous (p < 0.05) and Duraloc - AML (p < 0.01). For the category of 65 plus, cemented and hybrid endoprostheses were assessed. A higher revision rate was seen only in HPQ - Müller-Geradschaft endoprosthesis compared to the cemented version of Biomet (p < 0.05). No difference was reported in mid-term survival of the applied cemented and uncemented cups. DISCUSSION Despite the development of uncemented versions of total hip arthroplasty components, the current literature includes opinions supporting the cemented technique of total hip replacement. Especially for elderly patients the implant of uncemented components is questionable. The presented study did not identify a higher mid-term revision rate of uncemented implants, namely with respect to acetabular components, not even in the elderly patients. CONCLUSIONS No difference was found in the mid-term revision rate of evaluated endoprostheses for the medium age category of 55-64 years, regardless of whether cemented or uncemented components were implanted. The only exception was represented by hybrid HPQ-Müller Geradschaft endoprosthesis with a higher revision rate of the femoral and acetabular components. The younger age category showed a lower revision rate for uncemented versions than for the used hybrid versions of endoprostheses. For the group of elderly patients, there was no difference between the survival rate of hybrid and cemented joint replacement.

MATERIAL AND METHODSIn the period 1996-2014, 26 patients were treated for severe slips ( >60°).Boys prevailed (2:1) and were older on average (the mean age 13.8 vs.12 years).Chronic stable slips prevailed (16 patients) and were followed by acute-on-chronic slips (7 patients) and with acute slips (3 patients).The acute unstable slips were treated using closed reduction and transphyseal fixation.The acute-on-chronic slips were treated using closed reduction and fixation (2 patients) and subcapital osteotomy (5 patients), respectively.Chronic slips were treated as follows: with subcapital osteotomy (10 patients); with intertrochanteric femoral osteotomy (5 patients); and with transphyseal fixation without correction (1 patient).22 patients were treated concurrently on the contralateral side as a prevention or to treat the slips.The follow-up ranged from 20 months to 13 years.The clinical results were evaluated according to four scores: 1) our own score (NB score) based on the reduction of ROM, shortening of extremity and limitations in activities; 2) Merle d'Aubigne score; 3) Harris hip score (HHS); 4) non arthritic hip score (NAHS).In the radiological evaluation, correction of slip angle, alpha-angle, avascular necrosis (AVN) and grade of arthrosis according to Toennis were observed. RESULTSAccording to the NB score 10 excellent results (38%), 11 very good results (42%), one good and one satisfactory result (4%) and 3 unsatisfactory results (11%) were achieved.According to the other scores the following results were reported: a) excellent: D'Aubigne-Postel -19 (73%); HHS -20 (77%); NAHS -21(81%), b) good: D'Aubigne and HHS-3 (11%); NAHS -2 (8%), c) satisfactory: D 'Aubigne -one (4%), HHS and NAHS 0, d) unsatisfactory: D'Aubigne, HHS and NAHS -3 (11%).The evaluation of surgical methods shows that the best results were achieved by closed reduction of acute slips (with 80% excellent results).The result of transphyseal fixation without reduction was satisfactory only.The intertrochanteric osteotomy led mostly to very good results (80%) and then to the excellent results (20%).After subcapital osteotomy, mostly excellent and very good results (40% each) were reported, followed by two unsatisfactory results (13%) and one good result (7%).As concerns the slip reduction and alfa angle, the best results were achieved by closed reduction and subcapital osteotomy.The FAI was observed/ in 10 patients.Arthrosis was observed as follows: grade I in 8 patients, grade II in 3 patients.The AVN was present as segmental in 4 patients (15%) and as complete in two patients (8%), namely in one after closed reduction and in one after subcapital osteotomy.Dislocations of the hip occurred twice after subcapital osteotomy.Chondrolysis and hip ankylosis were reported in one patient after subcapital osteotomy. DISCUSSIONThe hypothesis was confirmed because the results of treatment of severe slips without hip dislocation are comparable with procedures using the surgical hip dislocation.The results correspond with large published cohorts of patients in terms of correction as well as the rate of complications. CONCLUSIONSThe best results were achieved by closed reduction of acute slips where no complications were present.Subcapital osteotomy without surgical dislocation is comparable with modified osteotomy with surgical hip dislocation.Intertrochanteric osteotomy represents an efficient method in treating grade II slips.Transphyseal fixation without slip correction cannot be recommended in treating severe slips.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY In this randomized prospective study, we monitored and compared perioperative changes in skeletal muscle enzymes blood levels in open and mini-invasive stabilization of thoracolumbar spine fractures. The established hypothesis was to confirm higher blood levels of muscle enzymes in open stabilization. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study included 38 patients with the mean age of 46.4 years. 19 injuries were managed in an open procedure and 19 procedures were mini-invasive. Venous blood was taken intermittently at short intervals to determine the levels of skeletal muscle enzymes. The catalytic concentration of creatine kinase was determined via an enzymatic UV-test, and the concentration of myoglobin via electro-chemiluminescent immunoassay. Enzyme levels were processed statistically. The Wilcoxon test was used. RESULTS The median increase in the values of both enzymes is higher in the mini-invasive method than in the open method in both the surgery phase for the injury and in the extraction phase. The median increase in the values of both enzymes is higher in both methods for the primary procedure phase compared to the extraction phase. All results are statistically significant at p of <0.05. All tests were calculated using the MATLAB Statistics Toolbox. DISCUSSION A very surprising finding, when testing the hypothesis of the levels increasing mainly in open stabilization, was confirming the opposite. Both enzymes were higher in the mini-invasive approach to stabilising the spine after the injury, but also after the extraction. This contradicts the available literature. However, this can be explained by the methodology of enzyme levels determination in the previously published studies. We believe that this phenomenon can be partially caused by an iatrogenic mini-compartment of muscles in the postoperative period, absence of wound drainage, but also by higher muscle contusion when inserting bolts through the tubes via small incisions, when the tubes penetrate to the entry points relatively violently and the muscles in this area are affected more than in the classical skeletization. CONCLUSIONS Analysis of biochemical changes in open and mini-invasive surgery did not confirm the hypothesis that levels of creatine kinase and myoglobin enzymes increase especially in open stabilization. On the contrary, they were statistically significantly higher in mini-invasive procedures. Key words: creatine kinase, myoglobin, muscle enzymes, spine fracture, spine surgery, miniinvasive surgery.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe purpose of the study was to assess two therapeutic procedures of temporary fixation of displaced ankle fractures, namely the plaster fixation or Kirschner wire (KW) transfixation via the sole of the foot. MATERIAL AND METHODS Group of patientsThe randomised prospective study conducted in the period 02/2016-02/2017 compared two methods of temporary fixation of displaced ankle fractures.In total, 38 patients were included in the study (18 patients treated with plaster fixation, 20 patients treated with KW). MethodsDuring the randomisation (by envelopes, drawing of lots by the patient), in one group of patients, temporary stabilisation by plaster fixation was performed, whereas the other group was treated by percutaneously inserted KWs.The attention was focused on the quality of achieved reduction, its retention until the final treatment, and soft tissue status.After one year, the final examination was performed, in which we focused on the assessment of the clinical condition of the ankle joint with the use of the Olerud-Molander Ankle Score (OMAS), the AOFAS (American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society) score, and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) measuring the overall satisfaction.Moreover, in both the methods potential incidence of arthritic changes was monitored on radiographs. RESULTSBoth the methods achieved 100% successful reduction rate.The group with plaster fixation reported a loss of reduction in six patients (33.3%) as against the KW group where no loss of reduction occurred.This difference was significant (p = 0.007).In plaster fixation method, after its removal local complications occurred on skin in 56%, of which skin necrosis in 16.7%, and it always occurred in association with the loss of reduction, which was statistically significant (p = 0.245).In KW method, local complications on skin were present in 25% only.In the group of patients with KW, there was not a single case of surface or deep infection reported.No KW migration was observed. DISCUSSIONPotential complications of conservative treatment of displaced fractures with plaster fixation include the migration of fragments and widening of the ankle fork during the further course which may threaten the vitality of soft tissues.A total of six patients (33.3%) treated with plaster fixation showed a failure of reduction, which is by approximately 10% more than described in literature.In seven cases after the plaster fixation removal bullae were observed (38.9%) and in three cases skin necrosis was present (16.7%), which occurred in re-displaced fractures only.The bullae were present whether the reduction was successfully maintained or not.In literature, local complications after plaster fixation removal are reported in roughly 14%.Temporary percutaneous ankle KW transfixation is applied to maintain the reduced fracture in a favourable position and to facilitate monitoring and treating the soft tissues.Prior to the final surgical solution, bullae were observed in four cases (20%), of which skin necrosis in one case (5%).Bullae formation and necrosis are most likely related to the initial damage to soft tissues due to the injury and were not caused by the KW insertion.The literature describes local complications in 7% with respect to the KW technique, however, the type of complications is not specified.In our group, at a one-year follow-up arthritic changes grade I and II according to Kellgren and Lawrence scale were reported in 70% of cases with KW technique.Whether the osteoarthritis was caused by fixation or the fracture itself and what would be the percentage of individual types of osteoarthritis after several years of follow-up is a question. CONCLUSIONSPlaster fixation or Kirschner wires for temporal fixation of displaced ankle fractures shall be applied on a case by case basis.Based on our findings, the application of plaster fixation to displaced ankle fractures does not provide adequate stability of the reduced fracture and in case of re-displacement the status of soft tissues deteriorates.The impossibility to control the status of soft tissues in plaster fixation and the lower complication rate in fixation with K wires constitute additional reasons why this fixation technique via the sole of the foot appears to reap more benefits.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Based on the experience with using the Judet plates in stabilization of rib fractures an innovated Judet plate was constructed in cooperation with the Development Department of Medin company. During the preclinical part of the project, following the construction of the new Judet plate, a surgical technique was elaborated. Subsequently, the clinical application of rib osteosynthesis with innovated plates was commenced. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the course of the last three years the innovated Judet rib plate including the instruments were constructed by the Development Department of Medin company in cooperation with the Trauma Centre and the Department of Surgery of the University Hospital Královské Vinohrady. The goal of the innovation was the changes in technical parameters of rib plates which are compared with the new plates of other companies: 1. Adequate plate stability along the rib axis. 2. Creation of fixation clips for a stable, but not traumatized fixation of the plate around the rib. 3. Decreased robustness of the plate with sufficient stiffness. 4. Working out of a new technique of plate fixation with the use of new instruments. 5. Ensuring plate fixation with cortical locking screws. In the preclinical part of the project osteosynthesis of the broken rib was performed with a plate on a chest model for the basic types of rib fractures. Subsequently, the plate was used for rib osteosynthesis in a cadaver. The goal of the new instruments was besides temporarily maintaining the rib fracture reduction also the subsequent temporary application of plates with the assistance of fixation tongs before the final fixation of plates. In 2017, the clinical part of the project on the stabilisation of flail chest with the innovative Judet plates was launched. This type of innovative Judet plates has so far been used in 3 patients. RESULTS As to the surgical technique of ribs osteosynthesis: The profile of the plate has been adapted to the rib profile and can be further adjusted to rib curvature, also the fixation shoulders of the plates have been reshaped. The innovated plate has been complemented with a new configuration of fixation clips and the possibility to fix the plate with locking screws. The used cortical locking screws enable appropriate stabilisation of plates. They were tested on a laboratory model of ribs and on a cadaver using the new set of instruments. The plates can be easily shaped with tongs. The anchorage of fixation clips is adequately provided for also by means of tongs. The plates can be fixed to the rib without any significant compression of intercostal nerves. The essential change of the innovated Judet plate is its weight, which meets the contemporary trends in construction of rib plates designed for anatomical fixation. The first experience with the innovated plates in flail chest injury confirmed the safety of the procedure for stable osteosynthesis of rib fractures. Adequate stability of the chest wall facilitated an early withdrawal of ventilatory support. Osteosynthesis of rib fractures with innovated plates performed in the first three patient was without complications, including in the postoperative period. DISCUSSION A series of prospective studies prove the correctness of the indications of early rib osteosynthesis in flail chest. Further indications for rib osteosynthesis are postinjury chest deformity, dislocation of rib fracture fragments with a lung injury, and malunion of rib fracture. According to these studies the surgical stabilisation of the chest is a safe and efficient method resulting in pain reduction, decrease of ventilatory support time, and also in reduced morbidity. For rib osteosynthesis anatomical plates, Judet plates and intramedullary plates are used. Our innovation of the Judet plate aimed to improve the technical parameters of the plate. The innovative Judet plate means a significant improvement in technical parameters and stands comparison with the plates of others companies, which are used in the Czech Republic. This is also evidenced by preliminary clinical results. CONCLUSIONS Surgical stabilisation of the flail chest segment is considered to be he method of choice in treating selected patients, leading to the improvement of respiratory function and shortening of the ventilatory support time. The new technical parameters of the plate, including its weight, new fixation clips, locking screws and instruments are the priorities of the innovated Judet plates. The innovation of Judet plates represents an important step towards the extension of indications for surgical stabilisation of the chest. Key words:innovative Judet plates, preclinical study, osteosynthesis of rib fractures.",

    "abstract": "Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a rare complication of treatment with both unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Antibodies against the complex heparin-platelet factor 4 are the main cause of pathogenesis, resulting in the activation of thrombocytes, coagulation, endothelium, monocytes, neutrophils and subsequent highly prothrombotic state. The prothrombotic state can result not only in venous but also in arterial thrombosis at different locations (which is manifested apart from venous thromboembolic disease also by acute limb ischemia, acute myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, skin necrotizing lesion exanthema). If HIT is not adequately treated, it may be fatal in up to 10% of patients. For early diagnosis, a combination of 4T scores and diagnostic lab tests for HIT is required. Immediate discontinuation of heparin therapy (UFH, LMWH) and switching to non-heparin anticoagulants (fondaparinux, bivalirudin, argatroban or in some situations DOACs) are essential in HIT treatment. The case report describes the patient after primary knee replacement, complicated by the development of HIT with no evidence of venous thromboembolic disease. Preoperatively, the patient was administrated nadroparin due to paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, after the development of HIT, anticoagulation was modified to fondaparinux and subsequently to warfarin after the platelet count normalization.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYMinimally invasive posterior lumbar interbody fusion and percutaneous instrumentation were introduced in the clinical practice with the aim to reduce the damage to musculoligamentous structures associated with open surgeries.The purpose of the study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes, radiological results and complications of the group of patients operated with the use of the minimally invasive posterior lumbar interbody fusion technique. MATERIAL AND METHODSThe group of 31 patients operated for lumbar degenerative disc disease was followed-up prospectively.The surgical technique included a unilateral microsurgical decompression of the spinal canal with the insertion of interbody cages supplemented by percutaneous transpedicular fixation.The clinical outcomes were evaluated by means of the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Macnab classification, VAS score for low back pain (VAS LBP) and lower extremity pain (VAS LE) at 2, 6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively.The success rate of interbody fusion and complications was also assessed. RESULTSThe inclusion criteria were met by 29 patients.The mean preoperative ODI score of 68.4 decreased to 25.1 at two-year follow-up (p 0.001).Based on the modified Macnab scale excellent and good outcomes were achieved at two-year-followup by 82.4% patients.The mean value of VAS LBP score decreased from 6.2 to 2.1 and in case of VAS LE from 5.38 to 1.34 (p ˂ 0.001).The mean time of operation was 157 minutes.Solid interbody fusion was achieved in 80% of patients.In one case, revision surgery for dislocation of the interbody cage was performed one year after the operation.A total of five misplaced transpedicular screws (5.2%) were recorded. DISCUSSIONDorsal minimally invasive spinal operational techniques, when compared with the open surgery, result in less iatrogenic injury to paravertebral muscles.From a short-term perspective, there is also less blood loss and lower frequency of infectious complications.Together with the reduction of postoperative pain and shorter hospital stay, they enable faster recovery and rehabilitation with comparable clinical effectiveness of the procedure.Apart from the above-mentioned benefits, also some shortcomings are discussed such as higher frequency of complications, longer time of operation, higher occurrence of implant malposition and higher exposure of the patient and the surgeon to radiation. CONCLUSIONSThe minimally invasive posterior lumbar interbody fusion technique resulted in a statistically significant clinical improvement in the ODI, Macnab scale, VAS LBP and VAS LE scores.The percutaneous instrumentation technique shows an acceptable rate of incorrectly inserted screws.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThis study investigated whether there was an optimal interval between two operations for total knee arthroplasties in patients with advanced bilateral gonarthrosis scheduled to undergo staged total knee arthroplasty (TKA). MATERIAL AND METHODSA prospective cohort of 219 patients (136 females, 83 males) undergoing staged total knee arthroplasty for the treatment of advanced bilateral gonarthrosis were followed for up to 12 months.The mean was 69.51±5.02(56-80) years.Patients were categorized into five groups based on the time between the first and second operations; Group I (21-90 days), Group II (91-180 days), Group III (181-270 days), Group IV (271-360 days), and Group V (more than 360 days).Patients were evaluated based on time from surgery and were assigned to corresponding groups.The data recorded included age, body mass index (BMI), side of operated knee, complications, and radiological and clinical findings.Visual analog scale (VAS) for non-operated knees was applied.Activities of Daily Living Score (ADLS) was applied to the patients at last follow-up. RESULTSNo statistically significant difference was noted in BMI values (p=0.634),range of joint motion (RJM) (p=0.940) and age (p=0.785)distribution between the five groups.In Group I, the mean VAS score increased by 7.83 to 7.98, 7.86 to 8.53 in Group II, by 7.85 to 8.54 in Group III, 7.85 to 8.59 in Group IV, and 7.88 to 8.64 in Group V.There was no statistically significant difference in preoperative ADLS between the groups (p=0.064),but there was a statistically significant difference in postoperative ADLS (p=0.001).Group I patients had significantly lower postoperative ADLS compared to the other groups (p=0.001).The mean increase in postoperative ADLS versus preoperative scores of all groups were statistically significantThe most significant improvements occurred in Groups II and III.Similarly, preexisting pain in the non-operated knee started to increase in Group II and continued in all groups. DISCUSSIONGiven all these findings, we believe that it is reasonable to advise patients to receive their second TKA, 3-6 months after their initial TKA, as this interval will allow for the greatest improvements in functional and daily living activities, and pain in the non-operated knee simultaneously becomes more severe.This recommended interval would minimize both the functional problems with the operated extremity due to pain, and deformity and dysfunction in the non-operated knee and the subsequent overloading. CONCLUSIONSEven though a number of factors influence the optimal interval for staged TKAs in bilateral gonarthrosis, an interval of 91-270 days appears to be the optimal interval between surgeries in terms of minimizing pain and maximizing ADL s and knee scores.",

We present a case of acute limb ischaemia due to thrombotic occlusion of the superficial femoral artery on the non-operated limb following a total hip arthroplasty in a 64-year-old male patient. Untreated peripheral artery disease, intravenous TXA administration, surgery, obesity and hypertension were identified as predisposing factors of the occlusion. Good reperfusion of the limb was obtained after mechanical thrombectomy. Other cases report that antifibrinolytic agents such as TXA could be associated with arterial thrombosis.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY We hypothesized that preoperative planning with 3D modeling of complex foot deformities would be useful for the education of orthopedics and traumatology residents. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study is prospectively designed study with a control group. Twenty eight residents (study group) who assisted the surgeons during the interventions and ten senior surgeons (control group) were included in the study. All participants assessed virtual 3D-CT images and videos of the cases before the surgery. Ten adult cases of foot bone deformities were evaluated. 3D-CT reconstruction was performed and a 3D model of each deformity was created using the hospital's picture archiving and communication system. The completed 3D models were sterilized in hydrogen peroxide and put on the surgical table in a sterile manner. After surgery, the residents (group I) and surgeons (group II) were questioned regarding their satisfaction with 3D modeling. Responses were structured by a five-point Likert scale (1, strongly disagree; 2, disagree; 3, neither agree nor disagree; 4, agree; and 5, strongly agree). RESULTS The surgeons (group II, n = 10) were satisfied with the sterilized 3D models, which they could touch and re-examine on the operating table. The residents (group I, n = 28) were significantly more satisfied than the senior surgeons (p=0.01). The 3D modeling met both the surgeons' and residents' expectations. DISCUSSION The survey results for the surgeons (group II) were satisfied with the sterilized 3D models, which they could touch and reexamine on the operating table (question 3). They gave the best scores (mean, 4.8/5) for clarity of the 3D model. On the other hand, they gave the lowest scores (mean 3.1/5) to 3D models due to its contribution in understanding deformity over virtual 3D-CT evaluations (question 2 and 5). The residents (group I) differed from those for the senior surgeons. Residents gave the highest scores for understanding of the deformity (question 2 and 5) and clarity (question 1). These outcomes may be interpreted to indicate i) that 3D modeling may be used for education, and ii) that younger surgeons are more interested in novel technological developments. Therefore, the outcomes did differ significantly between the senior surgeons and residents (Table 1). These outcomes may be explicated as; 3D modeling of the foot deformities may not be mandatory for the experienced surgeons for understanding the deformity. On the other hand 3D modeling would be useful tools for younger surgeons and for their education. CONCLUSIONS 3D modeling of foot deformities is more informative than virtual 3D videos. However, with consideration of costs and long processing times, 3D printing may be used optimally for rare deformities. When considering the role of touch sense in surgical learning, 3D modeling gives more detailed and more satisfactory planning than virtual 3D videos. 3D modeling is more useful for young surgeons, and it will be used mainly for education in the future.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe treatment of recurrent patellofemoral instability has undergone a paradigm change during the last 15 years.Instead of non-anatomical operations, the current concept favors the reconstruction of injured structures and the normalization of the biomechanical environment.Our aim was to briefly summarize the etiology, diagnostic regimen, and therapeutic decision making of this varied patient group and to review our own patients who underwent combined medial patellofemoral ligament reconstrucion and tibial tubercle transfer. MATERIAL AND METHODSBetween 2015-2017 we performed combined ligament reconstruction and tubercle transfer for recurrent patellofemoral instability on 10 patients.The patients were examined for the degree of trochlea dysplasia, height of the patella, tibial tubercle trochlear groove distance.Additional intraarticular abnormalities were noted.The patients were assessed preoperatively and at follow-up using the Tegner Activity Scale and the Kujala score.Return to sports was also examined. RESULTSThe average age of our patients was 22 years (15-40).We had 6 female patients and 4 male patient.The average followup time was 29 months (12-44).9 patients had a medializing of the tibial tubercle, whilst one patient had a pure distalization to go along with the medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction using PEEK tenodesis screws.We had no redislocations up to the last follow-up and patients were able to return to their previous activity level and/or sporting activity.The Kujala score improved from an average preoperative value of 48.9 (32-58) to an average follow-up value of 88.6 (70-97). DISCUSSIONThe essential steps in the treatment of recurrent patellofemoral instability are a thorough physical examination, appropriate imaging and the individual correction of the uncovered anatomical abnormalities.Neither isolated lateral retinacular release, nor medial capsular reefing can preictably produce satisfactory results. CONCLUSIONSMedial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction with tibial tubercle transfer (medializing and/or distalization) is a reliable surgical technique, that provides long term patellar stabilty in this selected group of young patients.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe aim of this clinical observation study was to determine the extent to which muscle relaxation induced by anesthesia must be intra-operatively reversed for a reliable identification, by intra-operative monitoring, of the lumbosacral (LS) nerve roots during extreme lateral interbody fusion (XLIF). MATERAL AND METHODSGeneral anesthesia (midazolam, propofol, sufentanil, oxygen/air/sevofluran -rocuronium) was administrated to all patients.Train-of-four (TOF) stimulation of the ulnar nerve at 10-second intervals and an electromyographic response of the adductor pollicis muscle were used, and the duration of neuromuscular block was measured by the value of the TOF-ratio.When the level of recovery from neuromuscular block was TOF-count = 2, reversion to normal function was still accelerated by sugammadex administration at a dose of 2 mg.kg-1.Subsequently, it was determined at which level of muscle relaxation subsidence the first responses to LS nerve root stimulation were evident.Intra-operative neurophysiologial monitoring (IOM) with use of the NIM -Neuro® 3.0 device allowed for assessment of a triggered electromyographic reaction (tEMG) of LS roots to stimulation during surgery.The neuromuscular reactions were evaluated in 11 patients, five men and six women.The results were analysed by descriptive statistics and presented as median and interquartile-range values. RESULTSIn all patients a reliable monitoring of the depth of muscle relaxation was established.The value of supramaximal impulse was 46 mA (38 to 64 mA).The period from rocuronium administration to a spontaneous recovery of the TOF-count = 2 took 33 min (29 to 35 min).Duration from sugammadex administration to a TOF ratio of ≥ 0.70 was 90 seconds (50 to 140) and to a TOF ratio of ≥ 0.90 was 190 seconds (100 to 220 s).A reliable tEMG response of LS nerve roots to electric stimulation at 10 mA intensity was recorded at a TOF ratio of 0.68 (0.56 to 0.77) and at a 5 mA intensity it was reliable at a TOF ratio of 0.86 (0.75 to 0.90).. None of the patients reported radicular symptoms after surgery. DISCUSSIONFrom the anatomy of the greater psoas muscle and varied patterns of its LS plexus it is obvious that none of the zones is absolutely safe.In XLIF procedures it is therefore recommended to disect the psoas muscle under both visual and IOM control.Intra-operative checking of the depth of muscle relaxation then will provide information that conditions not affected by rocuronium administration and necessary for the detection of LS roots have been provided. CONCLUSIONS1.For a reliable intra-operative identification of LS nerve roots by electric stimulation at a 10 mA intensity it is recommended to achieve the value of TOF ratio equal to at least 0.70.When stimulation at a lower intensity (5 mA) is used, a TOF ratio of ≥ 0.90 is necessary.2. Administration of sugammadex to reverse an action of the muscle relaxant rocuronium is an effective and quick method to achieve the values required.",

The indication to osteosynthesis in all 23 cases was a stable pertrochanteric fracture of the femur; all patients had grade III or grade IV coxarthrosis (assessed on the Kellgren & Lawrence scale) and their physical health was classified as ASA 3 or 4. Preventive antibiotic therapy was administered within 48 hours of surgery. The evaluated factors included operative time, blood loss, specific complications such as infection, osteosynthetic material fractiure or osteosynthesis failure, requirement of revision surgery, post-operative mobility and patient survival. The follow-up was 2 years.The operative time was 35 min to 85 min (average, 49 min); blood losses ranged from 50 ml to 450 ml (average, 189 ml). Of the 23 hips, infectious complication was found in one (4.3%) and osteosynthetic material fractiure also in one (4.3%). There was no necessity of revision surgery due to osteosynthesis failure, nor any conversion to total hip arthroplasty. Postoperative mobility (with use of walking aids or forearm crutches) was achieved in 17 (77.3%) patients. The average survival of the patients was 6.3 months, the range from 7 days to 3 years.DHS osteosynthesis is a reliable method for the treatment of proximal femoral fractures due to osteoporosis. These fractures in patients with coxarthosis are primarily indicated to total hip arthroplasty. However, this is questionable in polymorbid elderly patients in whom hip replacement carries high risk. In such patients DHS osteosynthesis is preferred as a less risky procedure.DHS osteosynthesis is indicated for stable pertrochanteric fractures of the femur in a limited number of patients with advanced coxarthrosis in whom total hip replacement would be associated with an undue risk. The majority of patients after surgery became mobile, but with short-term survival.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to assess the accuracy of axis deformity correction achieved by high-tibial valgus osteotomy either without or with a computer-assisted kinematic navigation system, on the basis of comparing the planned and the achieved frontal axis of the leg. Comparisons of mechanical axis deviation were made using both pre- and post-operative measurements with the planning software and intra-operative measurements with the navigation system before and after osteotomy. In addition, the aim was to test the hypothesis that the use of 3D navigation, as compared with 2D navigation, would help reduce changes in the tibial plateau slopeIn the period 2008-2011, high-tibial osteotomy was performed in 68 patients. Twenty-one patients (group 1) underwent osteotomy without the use of navigation and 47 patients (group 2) had osteotomy with a computer-assisted navigation system (32 with 2D navigation and 15 with 3D navigation). Using the planning software, the mechanical leg axis before and after surgery and the anatomical dorsal proximal tibial angle in the sagittal plane were assessed. Medial openingwedge high-tibial valgus osteotomy was carried out in all patients. When using 2D navigation, the mechanical leg axis was measured intra-operatively before osteotomy and then after osteosynthesis which included a simulated axial load of the heel. When using 3D navigation, the procedure was identical and furthermore involved a measurement of the tibial plateau slope obtained with an additional probe in the proximal fragment. The results were characterised using descriptive statistics and their significance was evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon's test, with the level of significance set at p < 0.05.In group 1, osteotomy resulted in good correction of the mechanical axis in nine patients (43%), inadequate correction in nine (43%) and overcorrection and three (14%) patients. In group 2 with the use of navigation, accurate correction of the mechanical leg axis was achieved in 24 patients (51%), undercorrection was recorded in 21 (45%) and overcorrection in two (4%) patients. The difference in outcomes between the two groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.73). The average correction of the mechanical axis based on comparing measurements on pre- and post-operative radiographs was 9.1 degrees (range, 5-27 degrees); the average correction of the axis visualised intra-operatively was 8.7 degrees (range, 4-27 degrees). The difference was not significant (p = 0.1615) and confirmed our hypothesis that the accuracy of measuring the mechanical axis was not influenced by the method used. The average change in the dorsal slope of the tibial plateau following osteotomy without navigation was 0.9 degrees (range, -8.9 to 9.0 degrees) and that after osteotomy with intra-operative visualisation of the proximal tibial slope was 0.3 degrees (range, -4 to 4 degrees). This difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.813).A good clinical outcome of high-tibial valgus osteotomy depends on achieving accurate correction of the mechanical leg axis with partial load transfer to the lateral compartment of the knee.Although the number of cases with good correction was slightly higher in the patients undergoing osteotomy with navigation, the difference was not significant. Intra-operative visualisation of the mechanical axis proved sufficiently accurate on comparison with the pre-operative planning based on weight-bearing radiography of the leg. A simulated axial load of the heel included in the kinematic navigation system does not sufficiently correspond to normal weight-bearing and therefore an undercorrection of the deformity might occur. Using 3D navigation had no marked effect on a change in the slope of the tibial plateau.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is a serious disease which, in its advanced form, can markedly disable the patient. The aim of the present work was a prospective evaluation of a group of CSM patients treated by open-door laminoplasty. MATERIAL AND METHODS We evaluated 89 patients (59 men and 30 women; average age, 62 years; range, 39 to 81 years) who underwent surgery in the years 2001 to 2011. The average follow-up was 76 months. The patients were examined neurologically, radiologically, by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT. All of them had quadruparetic disability and showed signs of myelopathy on MRI examination. We used a modified Hirabayashi technique of open-door laminoplasty. We evaluated the surgery time, intra-operative blood loss, neurological deficit on the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Society (mJOA) scale, intra- and postoperative complications, neck pain (NP) and extremity pain (EP) on the visual analogue scale (VAS) and a radiographic sagittal profile change after laminoplasty. RESULTS The average operative time was 117 minutes and the average intra-operative blood loss was 330 ml. The average mJOA score of 12.7 before surgery improved to 14.4. Two patients (2.25 %) showed persisting deterioration of neurological symptoms, conditions of six patients (6.75 %) were assessed as stable and the remaining 81 patients (91 %) showed varying degrees of both subjective and objective amelioration/improvement. Infection was recorded as the most frequent complication (7.8 %). C5 paresis reported in the literature did not occur in our group. One patient (1.1 %) had a moderate epidural haemorrhage. The pre-operative VAS NP score of 5.4 improved to 3.2 and the VAS EP score of 7.7 improved to 4.4. The average value for the radiographic sagittal profile changed from -18.2 pre-operatively to -16.5 post-operatively.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The aim of the study was to evaluate, on the basis of radiographic findings and AOFAS scores, the results of the Grice extra-articular subtalar arthrodesis for treatment of planovalgus foot deformity in cerebral palsy patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 38 patients (50 feet) with cerebral palsy indicated to the Grice procedure for planovalgus foot deformity between 2006 and 2010 were assessed. The group comprised 18 girls and 20 boys, of whom 10 had spastic quadriparesis (four undergoing bilateral surgery), three had triparesis, four had hemiparesis and 21 had diparesis (treated on both sides in eight). The average age at surgery was 12 years (range, 7 years and 2 months to 17 years and 8 months). All patients were evaluated based on the AOFAS scoring system and radiographic findings before and after surgery. RESULTS The average follow-up was 4.5 years. The average AOFAS score increased from 54.9 points pre-operatively to 76.6 points post-operatively. The pre- and post-operative average values for the talocalcaneal angle were 49.8° and 25°, respectively; for the calcaneal inclination angle they were 8.6° and 13.4°, respectively. DISCUSSION The Grice procedure has long been considered a primary surgical treatment for planovalgus foot deformity in patients with cerebral palsy. Recently, calcaneal osteotomy has been used more frequently, but with no evidence of provably better results. CONSLUSIONS The mid-term results of the Grice extra-articular arthrodesis in our group of cerebral palsy children were very good in terms of both radiographic and AOFAS score evaluation; the latter includes objective assessment as well as the patient's subjective evaluation.Grice procedure, extra-articular subtalar arthrodesis, cerebral palsy, planovalgus foot deformity.",

Because of displacement, surgery was indicated and open reduction with osteosynthesis was performed using a subgluteal approach on the eighth day after injury. Full weight bearing was allowed at nine weeks after injury, after the post-operative rehabilitation programme had been completed. Return to his sports activity was allowed at four months after injury. At one post-operative year the patient was free of any symptoms.

    "abstract": "Sternal fractures occur most frequently in vehicle accidents, then due to falls from a height and by other blunt chest trauma. Most of these injuries are simple, non-displaced fractures only rarely requiring surgical management. Based on a retrospective analysis, the authors present their experience with the treatment of sternal fractures, emphasizing the use of osteosynthesis.A group of 293 patients treated for fresh sternal fractures in the period from 2004 to 2013 were evaluated. Their median age was 47.5 years (range, 2 to 86 years). They were allocated to two groups according to the method of treatment, ie., conservative versus surgical. The two groups were compared in the following characteristics: mechanism and extent of trauma, methods of treating the fracture and associated injuries and troponin-T and myoglobin values.Of the 293 patients, 16 had surgery (surgical group) and the remaining patients were treated conservatively. Eleven patients (3.8%) had surgery for instability or chest wall deformity. Five patients (1.7%) underwent urgent cardiovascular surgery due to complications of sternum fracture. In the surgical group, comminuted fractures were more frequent (p=0.0003), rib fractures had a higher incidence rate (p=0.0442), concomitant abdominal injuries occurred more often (p=0.0173) and serum levels of troponin-T and myoglobin were higher (p<0.0001 and p=0.0114, respectively) than in the other group.The majority of sternal injuries (90-95%) are non-displaced, simple fractures that heal spontaneously. In complicated fractures, reduction and fragment fixation relieve pain, provide prevention from respiratory complications and make the duration of mechanical ventilation shorter. Our results show that osteosynthesis was mostly indicated in displaced and comminuted fractures or severe chest deformity. Concomitant intra-abdominal injury is caused by a flexion mechanism or an impact on the front of the body. Serious sternal fractures are associated with increased serum levels of troponin-T and myoglobin.Plate fixation is a suitable method of stable osteosynthesis in complicated sternal fractures. It shortens the duration of mechanical ventilation and repairs post-traumatic chest wall deformities.",

Anatomical prebending for each plate was done. Plates were inserted percutaneously, following plate fixation the neurovascular bundle was dissected out. The distance between the neurovascular bundle (posterior tibial nerve, posterior tibial artery) and the plate was measured at two different positions. The distance to the origin of the flexor digitorum longus muscle and the arch of the soleus muscle was measured.The mean distance between the neurovascular bundle and the plate amounted 1.4 cm (±0,2 cm; 1.0-1.7 cm) at hole number six and 1.1 cm (±0.4 cm; 0.6-2.0 cm) at hole number ten. The nerve was never directly in contact with the plate. The flexor digitorum longus muscle had its origin along the plate and was between the plate and the neurovascular bundle in all cases.Dorsal percutaneous plate insertion is a safe and easy method for osteosyntesis of tiba shaft fractures. Especially in case of poor skin and soft tissue conditions this technique offers a good alternative.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYInjury to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) frequently results in the development of knee instability.This is managed by ACL reconstruction using autogenous or allogeneic grafts.This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of the patients with ACL reconstruction using a tendon allograft harvested from the anterior tibial muscle (ATM). MATERIAL AnD METHODSThe group under study comprised 53 patients, 33 men and 20 women, with unilateral ACL reconstruction while the other knee was intact.The average age was 32.4 years (17 to 51) and the average follow-up was 33,4 months (21 to 53).Clinical evaluation included the Tegner and Lysholm scores and questionnaire-based satisfaction rating.Functional assessment included measurements of the range of motion and thigh circumference.Knee stability was determined using the pivot shift test, Lachman test and one-leg hop test.ACL laxity was measured on a GnRB ® arthrometer.Placement of the tibial and the femoral tunnel on radiographs was assessed by the method of Harner. RESULTSAll patients reported their willingness to undergo the surgery again.The average pre-operative Tegner score improved from 7.17 (4-10) to 6.45 (2-10; p = 0.0001).The average post-operative Lysholm score was 87 points (47-100).At final follow-up, the full range of motion was recorded in 39 patients (74%), while the remaining patients exhibited only insignificant restriction of knee motion in comparison with the pre-operative status.The results of the Lachman test were negative in 38 patients (71.7%) while the pivot shift test was negative in 52 patients (98.1%).In the one-leg hop test, 44 patients (83%) were able to jump on the treated leg for a distance longer than 90% of the distance done on the healthy leg.The GnRB test at a force of 134n showed an anterior shift of the proximal tibia by 2.2 mm (0.1-9.3) on the average.The tibial tunnel was placed in zone B in 48 patients (90.6%) and the femoral tunnel was most often located to zone D (n = 47; 88.7%). DISCUSSIOnThe choice of tissue for ACL reconstruction is still being discussed.In some centres an ATM tendon allograft is used only in revision surgery while, in other centres, it is also employed in primary procedures.Recent studies on ACL surgery suggest that outcomes are relatively independent of the material used for reconstruction.In view of evidence-based medicine, more well-conducted multicentre clinical trials are needed to optimise indications for allograft ACL reconstruction. COnCLUSIOnSThe ACL reconstruction using an ATM tendon allograft showed good clinical outcome at a minimum follow-up of 21 months.The method can be recommended not only for revision ACL reconstruction but also in primary reconstructions particularly in elderly patients.The present-day technology of producing allografts maintains tissue biomechanical characteristics and reduces risks for transmission of infection to a minimum.",

    "abstract": "The primary objective of the study was to find out in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing surgery for proximal femoral fracture. The secondary objective was to identify independent predictors of in-hospital mortality.A retrospective single-centre observational study PROXIMORT of patients operated on for isolated proximal femoral fracture at the University Hospital (FN) Brno in the years 2011 and 2012. The 30-day and overall one-year mortality in the study group and the impact of observed parameters on mortality were also assessed. The observed parameters were: patient age and sex, ASA score, time from injury to surgery (hr), daily (7-20 hr) or night (20-7 hr) time of surgery, type of anaesthesia (general vs spinal), initial haemoglobin and haematocrit levels, intra-operative administration of blood products and vasopressors, and erudition of the anaesthesiologist and surgeon. To evaluate the relationship of in-hospital mortality to the observed characteristics, we used univariate logistic regression modelling and odds ratio, using SPSS 22 software (IBM, USA).Data were obtained from 414 patients and 369 patients were included (male, n = 91; female, n = 278). Due to exclusion criteria, 45 patients were excluded (not an isolated injury). In-hospital mortality was 6.5% (n = 24), 30-day mortality was 8.4% (n = 31) and total mortality of the study group was 35.8% (n = 132). Statistically significant effects on in-hospital mortality included: older age of the patient (p = 0.013), ASA score of 3 or more (p = 0.002) and general anaesthesia administration (p = 0.043). For 30-day mortality, this was older age (p = 0.012), ASA score of 3 and more (p < 0.001), general anaesthesia administration (p < 0.001), lower weight (p = 0.028), lower BMI (p = 0.006) and intra-operative administration of vasopressors (p = 0.023). The influence of other observed parameters on post-operative mortality was not statistically significant.In-hospital mortality in the PROXIMORT study was 6.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.2 to 9.5%), which was significantly higher than in-hospital mortality in unselected surgically treated patients in the Czech Republic, as reported in the EuSOS study (2.3% with 95% CI 0.9 to 3.7%). Administration of general anaesthesia was determined as an independent predictor of in-hospital and 30-day mortality, which was concordant with the results of meta-analysis published by Rodgers et al. and Barbosa et al in 2013. Postponing surgery for perioperative optimisation had no effect on mortality according to the PROXIMORT study. Patorn et al. have supported this conclusion by the results of a selected group of patients with surgery delayed for more than 24 hours; the patients mortality, regardless of anaesthesia, was up to 2.5%.The PROXIMORT study identified the higher patient age, ASA score of 3 and more and general anaesthesia administration as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDyA retrospective analysis of the effect of anticoagulation and anti-aggregation treatments on the post-injury clinical status, frequency of necessary surgical interventions including re-operations, course of intracranial haemorrhage dynamics and treatment outcome in patients with acute traumatic intracranial haematoma. MATERIAL AnD METHODSThe group consisted of 328 patients with acute post-traumatic intracranial haemorrhage treated at the author´s institution from 2008 to 2012.Fifteen patients with anticoagulation therapy (warfarin; 8 females, 7 males; median age, 72.0 years) and 46 patients with anti-aggregation treatment (21 females, 25 males; median age, 75.5 years ; 37 with acetylsalicylic acid, 5 with thienopyridines, 2 with new antithrombotics and 2 taking dual anti-aggregation therapy), all older than 55 years, were included in statistical analysis.The post-injury clinical condition (Glasgow Coma Scale), incidence of haemorrhagic contusions, intracranial haematoma progression, particularly when surgery was indicated, incidence of re-operations and treatment outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale -GOS) were the study parameters.The control group included 77 patients with post-traumatic intracranial haematoma with normal coagulation who were older than 55 years (27 females, 50 males; median age, 67 years).Patients younger than 55 years and those with normal coagulation were not included in the statistical analysis.The treatment of all patients with anti-aggregation or anticoagulation therapy was consulted with the haematology specialist. RESULTSThe median age and initial status evaluated by the Glasgow Coma Scale were similar in the groups of anti-aggregated and anticoagulated patients and the control group.The number of good treatment outcomes, as evaluated by the GOS, was significantly higher in the anti-aggregated patients than in those on warfarin.A comparison of anti-aggregated, anticoagulated and normal coagulation patients did not show any statistically significant differences in the incidence of patients operated on, in the incidence of haemorrhagic contusions requiring surgery as a marker of the severity of brain parenchyma injury, intracranial haemorrhage progression with time, particularly when requiring surgery, and the rate of re-operations.However, when comparing the group of anti-aggregated patients with the control group, the higher incidence of haemorrhagic contusions and the lower number of patients requiring surgery were found to be close to the level of statistical significance. DISCUSSIOnThe positive effect of anti-aggregation and anticoagulation treatment on the morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases should be regarded in relation to a higher risk of haemorrhagic complications.If a bleeding complication occurs, the possibility of neutralising this treatment should be considered, but this is particularly difficult in new agents.The relationship between anti-aggregation or anticoagulation treatment and the treatment results in the patients with head injury is particularly important from the neurosurgical point of view, because the relevant literature data are ambiguous COnCLUSIOnSThe results did not confirm any statistically significant adverse effects of anticoagulation or anti-aggregation treatment on the severity of post-injury status and risk of intracranial bleeding progression.The incidence of poor outcomes is higher in anticoagulated patients than in anti-aggregated patients.Although not reaching the level of statistical significance, the results also indicate higher risk of significant haemorrhagic brain contusions in anti-aggregated patients.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY A saddle-shaped deformity of the femoral head has a poor prognosis due to rapid development of secondary changes. A new method of treatment by intra-articular anteromedial wedge reduction osteotomy (AWRO) of the femoral head may preserve the hip for the future. This study was designed to ascertain that this invasive technique was safe and effective and to confirm our hypothesis that AWRO significantly improved functional and radiological parameters of the hip joint. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients who underwent AWRO between 2010 and 2013 were enrolled in this study. The indication criteria for the procedure included Stulberg grade V hips on AP radiographs, hinged abduction with pain, limping and a limited range of movement. Values of the Stulberg grading, capital diaphyseal index, caput-collum-diaphyseal angle and Harris hip score were recorded before and after surgery and the results were statistically evaluated using the paired t-test. The AWRO procedure was performed from the anterolateral approach after subperiosteal protection of the vessels had been ensured. The central necrotic part of the femoral head was removed, and the medial segment was mobilised and fixed to the intact lateral segment. Either a hip spica cast or bed-rest for six weeks was indicated. Full weight bearing was allowed at 3 months after surgery. RESULTS Twelve patients with an average follow-up of 55 months were evaluated. There were eight boys and four girls with an average age of 14 years at the time of surgery. The average Harris hip score improved from 54.52 before to 73.58 after surgery. The post-operative outcomes according to the Stulberg classification included one grade II hip, seven grade III hips, three grade IV hips and one grade V hip. The average capital-diaphyseal index dropped from 1.56 (1.19-1.92) to 1.28 (0.95-1.67) and the average caput-collum-diaphyseal angle increased from 134 degrees (121-143) to 140 degrees (130-155) after surgery. Avascular necrosis developed in two patients. All the differences were statistically significant. DISCUSSION Reduction osteotomies of the femoral head reported in the literature differ from the AWRO procedure used in this study in both the approach and the performance. The results presented here are in agreement with those published in the relevant literature. They showed no significant deterioration in comparison with the outcomes of our short-term study reported earlier. The outcome of treatment is related to the disease aetiology, functional parameters and previous procedures involving the hip joint. CONCLUSIONS AWRO is a salvage procedure that prolongs the longevity of joints in incongruent hips with very high morbidity. This procedure gave significantly better results in years after surgery, which confirmed our hypothesis.

    "abstract": "The aim of the study is to present our experience with the diagnosis and therapy of penetrating abdominal injury involving the pancreas caused by a gun shot.The group included patients with gun-shot abdominal injuries involving the pancreas who were treated at the Department of Surgery and the Department of Emergency Medicine at the University Hospital Hradec Králové. The extent of pancreatic injury was assessed using the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) classification. The factors evaluated included the timing of surgery, operative strategy, operative time, blood loss, post-operative complications with pancreatic fistulas in particular, and the length of hospital stay. Pancreatic fistula was assessed according to the ISGPF (International Study Group for Pancreatic Fistula). RESULTS During the period of study lasting 10 years, three patients with gun-shot abdominal injuries involving the pancreas were treated.Pancreatic trauma due to a gun shot is a rare injury, but has also been reported in the Czech Republic. In any penetrating injury to the abdomen due to a gun shot, surgical exploration is always indicated and pancreatic trauma is usually found during the surgery. The first step in the procedure is to check all potential sources of bleeding because uncontrolled bleeding is the most frequent cause of intra-operative death. In a seriously injured patient, the technique of damage control surgery must be employed. After the major sources of bleeding have been checked, a thorough exploration of all abdominal organs should be performed to ascertain whether the main pancreatic duct has not been injured and, if so, in which part of the pancreas and to what extent. The correct classification of pancreatic injury according to the AAST is necessary to indicate appropriate therapy. Exploration for injury to other organs that often accompanies pancreatic trauma is a necessity.Penetrating pancreatic trauma is almost always associated with injury to the adjacent organs. All patients with gun-shot injuries to the abdomen are indicated for surgical exploration, thus the pancreatic injury is often found at the surgical exploration. After bleeding has been controlled, for treatment of the injured pancreas, simple drainage, or suture of the pancreatic capsule, or pancreatic resection or a patch with an excluded jejunal loop can be used. Partial duodenopancreatectomy is the last option because this procedure is associated with high morbidity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to define the principal and additional characteristics of critical burns and to evaluate the effect of an increasing Abbreviated Burn Severity Index (ABSI) on mortality in burn patients admitted to the Department of Burns and Reconstructive Surgery, University Hospital in Brno. MATERIAL AND METHODSThis retrospective monocentric study included all patients older than 18 years with critical burns involving more than 40% of the total body surface area (TBSA) who were admitted to the Department of Burns and Reconstructive Surgery, University Hospital in Brno, in the period from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2010.The epidemiological data evaluated included: age, gender, size of burn injury, mechanism of injury, required surgical intervention, mortality, length of hospital stay and the presence of inhalation injury.The results were statistically analysed. RESULTSA total of 2 479 adult patients were admitted to the Department in the period under study, and 112 (4.5%) of them had critical burns.In this patient group, the average age was 48.7 years, the average burned surface area was 62.8% TBSA, and the average length of hospital stay was 37.2 days.The male-to-female ratio was 2.39:1.Inhalation injury was diagnosed in 92 patients (82.1%).Of the 112 patients with burn injury, 59 died (52.7%).The lowest mortality rate was in the age category of 31 to 40 years (21.1%) and the highest rate in the patients aged over 71 years.No patient with the ABSI ≤ 8 died while, amongst the patients with the ABSI ≥13, the mortality rate was 87.8%. DISCUSSIONNo study dealing comprehensively with this topic in a patient group of this size has so far been published in the Czech Republic.Our results showed that the patients with critical burns accounted for about 5% of all patients with thermal trauma.The ABSI has proved to be a valuable and reliable predictor of survival in patients with critical burns.The extent of burned area and age were risk factors affecting mortality.On the other hand, the effect of inhalation injury on mortality, as a single risk factor, is disputable because this develops with an increasing burned surface area. CONCLUSIONSThe most important epidemiological data on patients with critical burns were evaluated.The study shows that although the number of patients annually admitted to hospital with severe burns is still high, it has nevertheless decreased recently.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the results of varus osteotomy of the proximal femur in adults with coxa valga after developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) and to evaluate the efficacy of this method.Thirty hips in 28 patients treated by proximal femoral varus osteotomy in the period from 1983 to 1990 were evaluated. The indication for surgery involved coxa valga (145°-168°) with grade I- III of osteoarthritis and mild acetabular dysplasia. The patient group comprised twenty six women and two men with an average age of 28 years (18 to 42) at the time of surgery. The mean follow-up was 22 years (19 to 26). The preoperative radiographic examination included an AP view of the pelvis, AP views of the hip in neutral and in frog-leg position and AP views of the hip in 30° of abduction and neutral rotation. Varus osteotomy was indicated when the best position of the hip joint was achieved in abduction. The procedure was performed according to M. Müller. Hip assessment was based on the grade of osteoarthritis, CCD angle, Wiberg angle and AHI index. The results were statistically evaluated using the life table analysis of clinical survivorship of osteotomy and the Kaplan- Meier curve. Clinical failure was defined as conversion of osteotomy to total hip replacement (THR).At the latest follow-up of 22 years on the average, 18 patients (19 hips) still had osteotomy and 10 patients (11 hips) had undergone conversion to THR. The life table analysis showed the cumulative proportion of osteotomy with a clinical survivorship of 0.97 at 5 years, 0.75 at 10 and 15 years, and 0.68 at 20 and 25 years after surgery. The cumulative rate of clinical survivorship of osteotomy, as shown by the Kaplan-Meier curve, was 0.89 at 10 years, 0.75 at 20 years and 0.67 at 25 years after surgery. Nineteen patients were satisfied with the osteotomy outcome. The median of Harris hip scores in the patients with osteotomy was 48 points before surgery and 78 points at the latest follow-up. Conversion to THR in 10 patients (11 hips) was done at an average of 12 years after osteotomy. The median values before surgery and at the latest follow-up were: CCD angle, 158° and 118°; Wiberg angle, 13° and 20°; and AHI index, 56 % and 79 %, respectively.The prerequisite for a good result of proximal femoral varus osteotomy is the correct indication, i.e., younger age (18 to 30 years), a lower grade of osteoarthritis, mild dysplasia and a spherical shape of the femoral head. A disadvantage of the procedure is a shortening of the limb. The best indication for femoral varus osteotomy is unilateral coxa valga with a longer leg.This study shows favourable long-term results after isolated proximal femoral varus osteotomy in young adults with developmental dysplasia of the hip. A good function had been preserved in 18 of 28 DDH patients for an average of 22 years.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe aim of the study was to find out whether the frequency and intensity of patellar pain can be affected by individual rotational alignment of the femoral component in total knee arthroplasty, as compared with the standard 3 degrees of external femoral rotation in conventional procedures. MATERIAL AND METHODSIn randomly selected patients treated for knee osteoarthritis by total joint replacement between January 2007 and January 2011, the occurrence of patellar pain was assessed.The evaluated knees were allocated to two groups.Group 1 included 350 knee joints with conventional femoral rotational alignment, i.e., 3 degrees of external rotation.Group 2 comprised 380 knee joints with an individual rotational alignment of the femoral component based on the condylar twist angle.Post-operative anterior knee pain was assessed on the following scale: 1, no pain; 2, occasional mild pain; 3, moderate pain; 4, severe pain. RESULTSIn group 1, 312 knee joints were free from pain, 15 occasionally experienced mild pain, 15 had moderate and eight had severe pain.A total of 23 revision operations were performed for patellar pain at the anterior knee and pain around the patella refractory to non-steroidal anti-rheumatic and rehabilitation therapy.In group 2, there were 331 pain-free knees, 48 with occasional mild pain, one with moderate pain and no knee with severe pain.No revision surgery was required.One patient with moderate patellar pain underwent surgery for spinal canal stenosis; after that knee pain was only mild.The groups were compared, as to pain assessment results, using the test of equality of relative frequencies, i.e., score categories 1+2 versus 3+4 of 350 (group 1) equalled 23 (6.57%) were compared with 1 (0.26%) of 380 (group 2); the difference was significant (p < 0.001).Using the same test for comparison of the frequency of repeat operations, i.e., 23 (0.57%) of 350 (group 1) versus 0 (0%) of 380 (group 2), also gave a significant result (p = 0.001). DISCUSSIONMild and occasional pain was recorded in both groups, suggesting that femoral component malrotation is not the only cause of patellar pain following total knee arthroplasty.A markedly lower incidence of moderate and severe pain and no need for revision surgery found in group 2 provides evidence that the use of individual rotational alignment of the femoral component is fully justified. CONCLUSIONSAn individual rotational alignment of the femoral component can significantly reduce the incidence of moderate to severe patellar pain or even need for revision surgery.",

    "abstract": "Revision total hip arthroplasty is a demanding surgical procedure. It involves a massive loss of acetabular bone stock associated with primary implant removal, and a complicated revision cup fixation in the highly damaged surrounding bone. The authors describe the use of a novel oblong acetabular cup, type TC (Trč-Cingr), for replacement of a loose acetabular component. The aim of the study is to present this novel implant with evaluation of the first clinical results and to report on the authors' experience with revision arthroplasty assessed at 24 to 62 months of follow-up.The TC cup was used in revision total hip arthroplasty in 40 patients treated between February 2004 and June 2007. Aseptic loosening of a cemented cup was an indication for surgery in the majority of patients. The first 10 treated patients were supervised, according to the strict rules of good clinical practice, by the State Institute for Drug Control. A total of 31 patients were evaluated. There were 20 women and 11 men with an average age of 68 years (range, 41 to 81 years) at the time of primary implantation.At the end of 2009, 31 patients were evaluated at a follow-up of 24 to 62 months (average, 44.8 months) after revision surgery. The patients' age, gender, body mass index, physical activity, diagnosis for indication, implant size and intra- and post-operative complications were recorded. The development of secondary implant stability was assessed on X-ray films taken at 3, 6, and 12 months and then at 1 year after surgery. Attention was paid to implant and screw positions and potential implant migration and signs of osteolysis around the cup and screws. An objective assessment of the results was obtained by comparing the pre- and post-operative values of the Harris hip score (HHS).A femoral component was replaced together with a revision cup in 20 patients. The average HHS value increased from 41.86 points pre-operatively to 82.70 points post-operatively. The results were recorded as excellent in six, very good in 17, satisfactory in six and poor in two patients. The radiographic findings showed good bone-implant integration in 26 patients and radiolucent lines . 1mm in width in DeLee zone 3 in three patients. In one overweight patient, discontinuity of two proximally inserted screws, but no detectable implant migration, was recorded. There was only one case of proximal migration of the TC cup, with osteolysis detected around all screws (Paprosky type 3B defect).The acetabular cup is the most frequently re-implanted component in our country. This is due to a high proportion of total hip arthroplasties with the previous frequent use of a cemented POLDI prosthesis whose neck in a valgus position probably played its role in increased wear of the cup. Acetabular bone defects are usually extensive and the operative tactics are based on the Paprosky classification. Type 3A and 3B defects, exceptionally also type 2C defects, are most serious and acetabular cup replacement is most difficult. The oval-shaped uncemented TC cup was developed with the objective to reconstruct defects on the bottom of the acetabulum, with stable and firm primary fixation of the implant secured in bone with implant augmentation screws and additional fixation screws. Good primary fixation with bone grafting to fill defects and spaces between implant ribs should facilitate bone remodelling in the close vicinity of the cup. A minimum of 24 months after revision cup implantation is regarded as sufficient for an objective evaluation of hip function and radiographic evidence of good bone-implant integration.The results show good applicability of the oval-shaped implant which is easy to implant, maintains good primary fixation and allows for good bone remodelling in its vicinity.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the results of intra-operative myelography as the method used to assess the reduction of bone fragments from the posterior margin of the vertebral body.Forty patients with 42 comminuted fractures of the thoracolumbar spine were included in the study. The pre-operative spinal stenosis caused by bone fragments from the posterior margin of the vertebral body, as detected by CT scanning, ranged from 25 % to 85 %. Neurological deficit was due to injury in 19 patients and in one it developed post-operatively after the patient stood and walked. After ligamentotaxis and internal fixation, intra-operative myelography was used to show decompression of the spinal canal. A spinal block or severe constriction of contrast flow was an indication for hemilaminectomy (laminectomy) and direct decompression of the spinal canal. In the patients with neurological deficit and severe spinal stenosis persisting after ligamentotaxis and detectable by skiascopy, hemilaminectomy (laminectomy) and direct spinal decompression followed by intra-operative myelography were carried out.Intra-operative myelography was used 46 -times (20-times in 20 patients free from neurological deficit and 26-times in 20 patients with neurological deficit). In 38 cases (82.6 %) dural sac compression was not present (patients with neurological deficit, 13-times after ligamentotaxis, eight-times after ligamentotaxis and hemilaminectomy with direct decompression, twi- ce at repeat surgeryúúú patients without neurological deficit, 15-times). On two occasions (4.4 %) the contrast agent injected into the dural sac did not make the interior body part visible, on three occasions (6.5 %) contrast medium was injected extradurally, and dural sac compression following ligamentotaxis requiring hemilaminectomy (laminectomy) and direct decompression occurred in three cases (6.5 %). In the patients without neurological deficit, dural sac compression was not recorded. No serious complications associated with contrast medium injection in the dural sac were present, and there was no deterioration of neurological symptoms due to a dural tap. In three cases (6.5 %) a false negative finding was recorded, showing free flow of contrast medium with no areas of constriction or obstruction and signs of post-operative nerve irritation ( radicular syndrome associated with L3 fracture with a fragment placed laterally in two patients and hyperalgesia of the thigh after T12 fracture in one patient). Repeat surgery and additional decompression (hemilaminectomy and foraminotomy, laminectomy) resulted in immediate resolution of neurological symptoms.The success rate, complications and disadvantages of intra-operative myelography have not been reported. At present, ionic water-soluble contrast agents used for intrathecal administration are associated with only a low number of serious complications. Neurological deficit due to dural tap is rare. Extradural administration is not effective. A disadvantage reported here involves a failure to visualize the area because of a low amount of contrast agent administered to avoid spinal cord injury. A possibility of false negative findings arising from only one lateral view of the contrast agent flowing round fragments is the major disadvantage. In contrast to the previous reports, we relate the false negative findings to neurological findings.Intra-operative myelography is still a currently used method. Its advantages include a simple procedure without removal of posterior column structures, and the possibility of objective recording and continuous observation of the dural sac. The free flow of contrast medium makes obstruction of the spinal canal impossible. The consequences of a false negative finding can be successfully treated at the second stage.",

We show the most frequent mechanisms of injury, diagnostic pitfalls, therapeutic options and evaluate both the short-term and long-term results of surgical treatment and interventional radiology procedures.We evaluated a group of patients with a serious vascular injury who were treated at the Traima Centre during the five-year period from January 2006 to December 2010. The group included 82 patients, 59 men and 23 women, with the average age of 34.5 years. We assessed the success rate of vascular reconstruction, primary and secondary graft patency and mortality and morbidity rates. Recovery of function in the injured extremities and return of the patient to normal daily activities were considered the most important parameters. In 28 patients (34%) vascular injury was due to polytrauma, in nine (11%) it was part of a combined injury, and 45 patients (55 %) sustained monotrauma. Most of the patients (68; 83%) were managed surgically. The most frequent procedures included direct suture of a lesion, resection and replacement of an injured artery or bypass grafting. In 13 patients we used interventional radiology procedures (in most cases it was for thoracic endovascular aortic repair). In one patient we were able to use a conservative treatment.The 30-day mortality rate was 8.5%, i.e., seven patients died of polytrauma. The morbidity rate was 35% (29 patients). The most frequent complications included respiratory failure in polytrauma (13%), transient leg/arm swelling (6%) and wound infection (4%). Primary and secondary graft patencies were 100% and 95.5%, respectively. Vascular reconstruction failed in three patients and, in two of them, we had to carry out limb amputation.From the viewpoint of vascular surgery, even very serious injuries of upper and lower extremities can be managed, if possible associated injuries of the skeletal and nerve structures allow for it. The key to success is good co-operation of the orthopaedic trauma surgeon, vascular surgeon and neurosurgeon.",

The authors present two such cases, one in a 30- and the other in a 74-year-old man. Both AS patients showed a common mechanism of injury sustained in a car accident, which involved hitting a solid barrier at 60 to 70 kilometres per hour, resulting in hyperextension of the cervical spine. In both patients the fractures were stabilised from the anterior approach: the dens fractures with one or two screws by the Magerl-Böhler method and the subaxial fractures with long-plate and screw fixation. At 2 post-operative years complete bone union of the subaxial spine was recorded in both patients; complete healing of the dens fracture was achieved in one patient while in the other partial fibrous union of the dens fracture occurred.",

    "abstract": "To review the current methods of operative management of post-traumatic chronic radial head dislocation in chronic Monteggia lesions in children. MATERIAL AND METHODSPost-traumatic chronic dislocation of the proximal radius usually occurs following missed or ineffectively treated Monteggia fractures.The radial head is usually dislocated anteriorly.We performed open reduction of the radial head, reconstruction of the annular ligament and corrective osteotomy of the ulna in eleven patients.Three of our patients underwent ulnar lengthening via gradual distraction using an Ilizarov external fixator.This procedure was used in nine boys and five girls who were treated for complications following Monteggia lesions between 2000 and 2009.The average age at the time of surgery was 8 years and 4 months, the average injury-to-surgery interval was 19 months, and a prerequisite for surgery was a normal concave articular surface of the proximal radius.The patients were followed up for an average of 28 months and, at final follow-up, all were fully active and had no pain or instability. RESULTSThe complications included: non-union of the ulnar osteotomy site in two patients, residual radiocapitellar subluxation in two patients, and one patient had revision surgery.Nine patients showed a full range of motion, two had a loss of extension, and three had a mean loss of pronation of 20 degrees and a mean loss of supination of 20 degrees. DISCUSSIONThe Monteggia lesion is a rare fracture in childhood, but its sequelae can be serious.So far a unified therapeutic approach has not been proposed.Most authors prefer reconstruction surgery.Our results are in full agreement with the published data. CONCLUSIONSThe operative treatment of consequences after Monteggia fractures in children has a relatively high rate of complications and unpredictable results.Indications for reconstruction involve a normal articular surface of the radial head and a normal alignment of the radius and ulna.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYTo present the results of a three-year study on micturition, defecation, gynecological and sexual disorders in middle-aged women who sustained pelvic fractures. MATERIAL AND METHODSA group of 33 female patients who were treated for unstable pelvic fractures (AO types B or C) in the 2004-2009 period were evaluated (treated group) and compared with 31 women who had given vaginal birth at least once and went to see a urologist because of urinary problems in the period from 2009 to 2010 (control group).The questionnaires used in the study included ICIQ, UIQ, UDI and PISQ12 instruments.Urodynamic tests included flow cystometry, urethral pressure profile at rest and under stress and uroflowmetry.For a comparison of continuous variables of normal distribution, the t-test for independent samples was used.In the questionnaire study when responses were classified as nominal-ordinal variables, the Mann-Whitney U-test was used.Differences between the two patient groups in qualitative variables were tested by Pearson s 2 test.When the expected number of answers in contingency table was lower than 5, Fisher s exact test was used; when the number of answers was 0, Haldane s correction was employed.The results in all tests were considered significant when the level of significance was lower than 5%, i.e. p-value < 0.05. RESULTSThe age of patients in the treated group ranged from 17 to 55 years (average, 32 years), the age in the control group was between 30 and 78 years (average, 58 years).The difference was significant (p<0.001).The control group patients had significantly more serious urination disorders than the treated group patients.Some micturition problems were reported by 25 patients (75%) of the treated group and by all patients of the control group (p<0.001).Intestinal disorders were more frequent in the treated group, in which 19 (61%) patients reported problems as against seven (21%) in the control group.Gynaecological problems involving feelings of genital prolapse had 13 (39%) control patients (p = 0.041).Sexual disorders were markedly worse in the treated group, with 16 (52%) of the patients having problems in comparison with only seven (21%) in the control group. DISCUSSIONA comparison of patient groups composed using the method described here is disputable.The first difficulty lay with a low compliance of the treated patients, of whom only 33 underwent examination out of 52 originally enrolled.The other problem was the necessity of having an exactly defined control group of patients willing to undergo urological and gynaecological examination including urodynamic testing.The groups composed by our method were comparable only in the micturition disorder characteristic.A significantly higher age of the control group affected the comparison of defecation, gynaecological and sexual problems. CONCLUSIONSThe results of this study showed a high occurrence of micturition, defecation and sexual disorders in middle-aged women after pelvic injury.However, the problems are usually not serious enough to make the patients seek help of a specialist.The authors recommend that these problems should be looked for by disorder-directed inquiry in the final period of pelvic fracture treatment and help of a specialist in urology, gynaecology, sexuology or proctology should be offered to the patients in whom disorders have been identified.",

    "abstract": "Injury to the spinal chord at the C5 level results in a severe handicap to the patient because of a loss of active motion of the wrist and hand. Selected surgical procedures can effectively restore active extension of the wrist and provide conditions for some vital pinching and gripping abilities. The deltoid muscle also has a potential for restoration of upper limb function, because its posterior portion can be used to restore elbow extension. The aim of this clinical retrospective study was to describe and evaluate the techniques used to improve the quality of life in patients with spinal chord lesions at the C5 level.The group studied consisted of 15 patients (3 women and 12 men; average age, 34 years) with a spinal chord lesion at the C5 segment who had zero wrist extension or in whom wrist extensor muscle force was equal to the third degree of muscle strength or less. The procedures to restore active extension of the wrist involved the radiobrachialis muscle, the reconstruction of elbow extension was activated by the posterior portion of the deltoid muscle, and a fixed supination posture of the forearm was corrected by elongating the distal tendon of the biceps muscle which was derotated and attached to the proximal radius. The interval between injury and reconstructive surgery was 36 months on the average.The reconstructive surgery described resulted in restoration of hand and wrist function with sufficient muscle strength in all patients, which had a favourable effect on many aspects of their daily lives. The average values of muscle strength were 4.1° (3° to 5°). for wrist extension and 3.3° (2° to 4°) for elbow extension. Key-pinch force was on average 1.2 kg (0.2 to 2.1). A failure of thumb carpometacarpal arthrodesis was the most frequent complication and occurred in two patients. On clinical evaluation, all patients reported satisfaction with the restored function of their upper extremities and expressed their willingness to undergo the same procedure again.Reconstructive surgery of the upper extremity in tetraplegic patients has been performed with success in several countries, namely USA and Sweden, for many years. Since 2003 the results in the Czech Republic have also shown positive effects of reconstructive procedures on better quality of life in patients with cervical spinal chord injury at the lower levels, in whom the goal is to restore vital pinching and gripping abilities. A good outcome of surgical treatment requires good quality post-operative care provided by a team of physical therapists fully informed of the reconstructive procedures involved.A restored function of the upper extremity in the patients with spinal chord injury at the C level plays a decisive role in the whole spectrum of the patient's daily activities, such as dressing, communication, etc., and thus improves their self- care. The restoration of active elbow extension has a positive effect on the patient's mobility.",

In the clinical trial, they evaluated the outcomes in 50 patients, out of the 249 implanted prostheses, at five-year follow-up.The experiment showed that a slightly steeper inclination the cup provided physical conditions for increased longevity of the ceramic liner. In the clinical study, no post-operative complications, such as fracture of the acetabulum or femur, and dislocation or break of any ceramic part, were recorded. No infection or loosening of the prosthesis occurred. The patients did not complained of any pain in the hip joint, which is typical of non-cemented THA.Ceramic-on-ceramic bearing surfaces show the least wear due to high biocompatibility. Computer-assisted surgery can markedly reduce the risk of incorrect positioning of the acetabular component. In this prospective study, the five-year survival of ceramic-on-ceramic THA in 50 patients free from any complications, whose Harris hip score was 97.4 points, suggests that objections to these prostheses, as raised by some authors, are not justified.In our experience the Plasmacup Bicontact ceramic-on-ceramic prosthesis is one of a few options that has a prospect of remaining the only total hip replacement in one's lifetime.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe objective of the present study is to compare the efficacy of two different concentrations of diclofenac sodium phonophoresis (DSPH) (1.16% vs 2.32%) in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). MATERIAL AND METHODSA randomized, double-blind, controlled design was applied.Ninety patients (mean age± SD, 59.98 ± 8.89 years) who had Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) grades II to III knee OA were randomly allocated into three groups; 1.16% DSPH, 2.32% DSPH, TUS (30 in each group).Each patient was treated five sessions per week for two weeks.A 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) for usual pain and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) were evaluated before and after treatment in all groups. RESULTSThe VAS pain and WOMAC scores were significantly improved after treatment in all groups (p < 0.05).The 2.32% DSPH showed more significant effects than the 1.16% DSPH, both in improving WOMAC-pain and physical function scores (p = 0.020, p = 0.008) and reducing the VAS pain measure, although it did not reach the level of significance (p = 0.077).The 2.32% DSPH was superior to the TUS, both in reducing the VAS pain measure (p < 0.001) and in improving WOMAC-pain, stiffness, physical function and total scores (p = 0.022, p = 0.016, p < 0.001, p < 0.001 respectively).1.16% DSPH significantly reduced stiffness and physical function scores compared with TUS (p = 0.042, p = 0.047). CONCLUSIONSDSPH and TUS are effective treatments for knee OA.Our results indicated that 2.32% DSPH produces additional benefits to functional improvement and pain reduction compared with 1.16% DSPH in K-L grades II to III knee OA.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSPolytrauma patients who suffered from acetabular fractures treated in our hospital during 2008-2018, operated by using only modified Stoppa or in combination with iliac wing approach, were included in the study.The patients were evaluated using Majeed score.Cases with hip replacement due to post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) were summarized.The study group was compared with control group, which was operated through ilioinguinal approach. RESULTSWe examined 42 patients (12 women and 30 men; mean age 44 years).Anatomical or satisfactory fracture healing was achieved in 92% of the acetabular fractures.In the study group Majeed score was significantly better (p<0.05).Seven patients from the study group had hip replacement due to PTOA with following results -5 patients (13%) with anatomical or satisfactory reduction and 2 patients (50%) with displacement more than 3 mm of all reductions of acetabular fractures. DISCUSSIONIn polytrauma patients, the risk of the development of severe PTOA is increased because of high-energy trauma impact and a satisfactory reduction of acetabulum does not always protect against severe PTOA with following necessity for total hip replacement. CONCLUSIONSOur experience with using the modified Stoppa approach and its combination with iliac wing approach shows that these techniques provide better fracture reduction, gain mostly good radiological and functional results, may decrease the risk of development of severe symptomatic hip PTOA and hip replacement in polytrauma patients with both column acetabular fractures.Our results suggest that unsatisfactory reduction of an acetabular fracture is a strong predictor of symptomatic severe PTOA, which is treated by using total hip arthroplasty.",

Suture anchor placement for labral repair may give rise to osteolysis and/or create stress risers in the glenoid rim, which may be the underlying reasons for glenoid rim fracture with a fracture line passing through previous anchor placement sites, the so-called \"postage stamp fracture\". Intraarticular fractures of the glenoid have been treated via open reduction and internal fixation through an arthrotomy, which may lead to potential postoperative complications like infection, neurovascular injuries, joint stiffness, and a long recovery period. Thus, arthroscopic techniques for the reduction and fixation of glenoid fractures have been developed. We present a case of anterior glenoid rim postage stamp fracture 9 years after glenohumeral instability surgery in a 29- year-old male. The fracture and recurrent instability were treated via arthroscopic Bankart revision repair and arthroscopic assisted percutaneous screw fixation, where the arthroscopic fracture reduction and definitive fixation were performed separately and before Bankart repair, which is different from the techniques defined in the literature previously.

MATERIAL AND METHODS From the beginning of 2003 to the end of 2020, a total of 36,342 surgeries were performed at our department. We retrospectively reviewed and analysed all surgeries for native joint septic arthritis (a total of 538 surgical interventions). The study included all adult patients who were operated for native joint septic arthritis in our department in 2003-2020. We included all revision surgeries for ongoing infection (excluding the management of post-infectious findings) as well as all operations performed in patients with multiple joint involvement. Based on the analysis of our data and review of published guidelines for antibiotic treatment of septic arthritis, we have outlined our own antibiotic therapy guidelines for the treatment of native joint septic arthritis. RESULTS From 2003 to 2020 we performed a total of 36,342 surgeries, of which 538 (1.5%) in 461 patients was indicated for native joint septic arthritis. The cohort consisted of 292 men (63%), who underwent 344 surgeries, and 169 women, in whom 194 surgeries were performed. The mean age of patients irrespective of the arthritis location was 62.4 years. Altogether, 19 patients (4.1%) suffered from multi-joint arthritis. The most frequently operated joint was the knee with 252 (54%) patients and 300 surgeries (56%), followed by the shoulder with 68 (14.7%) patients and 78 (14.5%) surgeries, the hip with 38 (8.2%) patients and 42 surgeries (8%), the carpal with 30 (6.5%) patients and 35 (6.5%) surgeries, the ankle with 25 patients (5.4%) - 31 (6%) surgeries, the small finger joints with 22 (4.75%) patients and 23 (4%) surgeries, the elbow with 14 (3%) patients and 14 (2.6%) surgeries, the sternoclavicular joint with 9 (1.9%) patients and 12 (2.2%) surgeries and the acromioclavicular joint with 3 patients and 3 (0.5 %) surgeries, respectively. DISCUSSION The management of septic arthritis relies heavily on early diagnosis, early surgical intervention and adequate antibiotic therapy. The diagnostic process and surgical treatment have their specifics related to the affected location, therefore, respective guidelines will be published separately for each location including the results. On the other side, antibiotic management is not dependent on the location and therefore the guidelines are included in this first analysis septic arthritis in the whole cohort. CONCLUSIONS Septic arthritis in adults in an ongoing issue with rising incidence. Early diagnosis, urgent and adequate surgical treatment, and optimal antibiotic therapy are preconditions for successful outcome.

RESULTSThe 125 study patients comprised 83 females and 42 males with a mean age of 54 years (range, 42-71 years).No significant difference was determined between the three groups in respect of age, gender and side distribution (p > 0.05).In all three groups, the fKSS, KSS, OKS and VAS values at the final follow-up examination were statistically significantly improved compared to the preoperative values.No periprosthetic infection was determined in any patient throughout the follow-up period.Revision surgery was applied for various reasons to 5 patients; 2 in the non-obese group, 2 in the obese group, and 1 in the morbidly obese group. DISCUSSIONIn the last 20 years, a general increase has been seen in the number of obese patients with knee osteoarthritis requiring surgery.The increase in obesity represents an important worldwide public health problem.

MATERIAL AND METHODSThe author evaluates a group of 48 total hip replacements carried out in the years 1990-1999, in which solid bone graft was used for reconstruction of an insufficient acetabulum.In 25 hips, the patient's own femoral head was used in primary surgery and, in 23 hips, a frozen femoral head from a tissue bank was used in revision arthroplasty.Most of the acetabular components used in this study were cemented.The patients were evaluated at 5-to 15-year follow-up.Each group was assessed separately and the results were divided into three categories according to X-ray and intra-operative findings, as follows: I.No radiographic evidence of cup loosening and incorporated graft II.Loosened cup and incorporated graft suitable for use in reimplantation III.Loosened cup and graft non-union or resorption RESULTSIn the autograft group, 80 % of the patients fell in category I and 12 % in category II; in the allograft group, 82 % of the patients were in category I and 9 % in category II.Complete failure, i.e., graft resorption and acetabular loosening, was recorded in 8 % and 9 % of group I and group II patients, respectively.Biopsy samples obtained during revision hip surgery showed good incorporation of both autografts and allografts. DISCUSSIONOther authors' views on the function of solid bone grafts after implantation and on methods of treating a defective acetabulum are discussed.The author puts the good outcomes shown in this study down to a careful implantation technique and thorough preoperative planning. CONCLUSIONSBy using a solid graft, the surgeon will achieve good primary fixation of a standard hip socket in a defective acetabulum and will make conditions for repair of defective bone tissue.The results imply that incorporation of both graft and acetabular component can be expected regardless of whether the graft is fresh or frozen.Although this method has its drawbacks and contraindications, it should be considered one of the options when planning total hip arthroplasty for an insufficient acetabulum.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The conservative treatment of an odontoid fracture with immobilization in a halo-vest or collar often results in pseudoarthrosis. Therefore, surgical treatment is preferred, and the Magerl-Böhler anterior osteosynthesis of the C2 dens is one of the options for achieving good bony union. The aim of this study was to show that the success of reducing an odontoid fracture is related to the direction of fracture lines and that of displacement, and that anterior osteosynthesis of the C2 dens provides sufficient stability when fixed either with one or two screws. MATERIAL Patients treated for odontoid fracture at the Department of Neurosurgery, Teaching Hospital of the Faculty of Medicine, Palacky University in Olomouc, were followed up and prospectively evaluated. From February 1994 to October 2006, 50 patients between 17 and 98 years of age (average age, 51.16 years) underwent surgery by the Magerl-Böhler method. Of them, 40 were men (average age, 46.0 years) and 10 were women (average age, 71.8 years). The minimum follow-up period was 1 year. METHODS In each patient, X-ray examination of the upper cervical spine in antero-posterior and lateral projections was done and a CT scan of the C2 vertebra was obtained. The radiographs were evaluated for location of the fracture, direction of the fracture line and direction of dens displacement. The fracture was then categorized according to the conventional classifications of Anderson- D'Alonzo (1974), Roy-Camille (1973) and White-Panjabi (1978). The patients with type II and some with type III fractures (shallow type) were indicated for surgery, regardless of fracture line direction and the direction and extent of displacement. Patients suspected of spinal cord injury were immobilized and the fracture was reduced by skull traction as soon as possible after injury. In patients without neurological deficit the fracture was reduced under general anaesthesia before surgery carried out by the Magerl-Böhler method from the anterior approach. The extent of antero-posterior displacement of the odontoid fracture was measured on lateral X-ray images at the first week after surgery and then at complete bony union. The results were statistically evaluated. RESULTS An anatomical position of the dens after reduction was achieved in 18 patients (38 %). In the remaining 32 patients, reduction was not complete but sufficient to permit screw insertion. Fractures with an anterior oblique fracture line were more difficult to reduce than fractures with a posterior oblique or a transverse fracture line. The average displacement values following reduction of the fractures were as follows: anterior displacement of 3.88 mm; posterior displacement of 1.86 mm; and anterior or posterior displacement of 1.08 mm. The differences were statistically significant. A recurrent displacement during bone healing occurred in 13 patients (26 %). It affected type A fracture in five of 17 patients (29.4 %), type B fracture in seven of 21 patients (33.3 %) and type C fracture in one patient out of 12 (8.3 %). The average extent of displacement was 1.53 mm in type A, 1.20 mm in type B, and 0.08 mm in type C fractures. The average displacement for the whole group was 1.04 mm. This implies that recurrent displacement of the dens was more frequent in fractures with an anterior oblique fracture line than in those with either posterior oblique or transverse fracture line, and this was statistically significant. Of the 43 patients with single-screw fixation, 12 (28 %) experienced recurrent displacement during healing, and of the seven patients with two screws one patient had displacement (14 %). Although the extent of displacement was higher in one-screw than in two-screw fixation (average, 1.17 mm and 0.29 mm, respectively), the difference was not statistically significant. In patients under 70 years of age, 21.6 % and, in patients over 70 years of age, 41.7 % of the fractures had recurrent displacement (average, 0.78 mm and 1.83 mm, respectively). This was not statistically significant. Bony union was achieved in all treated patients. DISCUSSION The success of reduction in displaced odontoid fractures depends on time between injury and treatment and, as reported in the literature, is more difficult after two weeks of injury. Anatomical reduction has been achieved in 65 % of displaced fractures regardless of the extent of displacement (5 mm or more). Fracture displacement after osteosynthesis of the dens with a single screw has been described in one of 17 patients (6 %), and union has been achieved in all cases. In our group recurrent displacement was found in 13 out of 50 patients (26 %). Exact data on the extent of recurrent odontoid displacement after anterior osteosynthesis is not available. It has been shown by biomechanical studies that one- or two- screw fixation provides comparable stability that, however, reaches only 50 % strength of an undamaged dens. CONCLUSION The anterior osteosynthesis of odontoid fractures was successful even in the patients in whom the fracture could not be sufficiently reduced. Union was achieved in all cases even though some fractures became displaced during bone healing and osteosynthesis therefore was not stable.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The surgical treatment of osteoporotic vertebral body fractures is associated with many complications. Vertebroplasty (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP) are minimally invasive procedures allowing us to strengthen the vertebral body and thus stabilize it. The aim of this non-randomized study is to evaluate a group of patients treated by VP and KP procedures and to discuss related risks. MATERIAL Between September 2005 and October 2007, a total of 32 patients (37 vertebrae) were treated by the VP and KP techniques. Vertebroplasty was used in 21 and kyphoplasty in 11 patients. In this initial group, four patients were excluded from evaluation because of a tumour aetiology of the fracture. The remaining 28 patients who had an osteoporotic vertebral body fracture verified by CT scan findings were followed up and evaluated. METHODS The evaluation was based on modified Oswestry disability index (ODI) and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores recorded at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months and 1 year postoperatively. Cement leakage detected by X-ray was assessed by means of the classification used by Yeom et al. and, at the same time, the occurrence of adjacent vertebral fracture, if any, was detected by 1 year after surgery. RESULTS Radiographic cement leakage was found in eight patients (21.6%), with clinical manifestation in two (5.4%). One had an incomplete motor lesion due to cement leakage into the spinal column, and the other had pulmonary embolism due to cement leakage into the mediastinum. The whole group showed marked improvement in clinical condition, as assessed by the ODI. When expressed as per cent, the average ODI was 57% pre- and 15.7 % post-operatively. All patients reported pain relief in the affected spine. The average VAS score of 8.1 pre-operatively decreased to an average of 2.6 post-operatively. There were no radiographic findings of adjacent vertebral body fracture. DISCUSSION Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are currently used to treat osteoporotic vertebral fracture. Their advantages include an immediate stabilization of the vertebra by cement solidification, possibility of percutaneous application under local anaesthesia, and early patient mobilization without any external fixation. However, when evaluating these techniques, safety of the surgical procedure should be taken into consideration. The most frequent risk is cement leakage. CONCLUSIONS Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty can, under strict adherence to the operative protocol, be an effective approach to the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral body fracture. It permits early mobilization of the patient without the necessity of external fixation. Key words: vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, osteoporotic spine fracture, osteoporosis.",

We present diagnostic and surgical management options relevant to the localisation of chordoma in the spine, and evaluate the results in terms of post-operative complications, tumour recurrence and patient survival.Between 1989 and 2002 a total of 20 patients diagnosed with chordoma were treated. There were 15 men and five women with an average age of 53 years. The cervical spine was affected in 20 %, thoracic in 15%, lumbar in 25 % and sacral in 40 % of the patients. All of them suffered from back pain, and nine patients (45 %) had neurological symptoms. The average time from the onset of complaints till disease diagnosis was 7.2 months.The average survival time was 63 months, with eight patients (40 %) surviving for more than five years. Of the patients with chordoma of the mobile spine, 66 % were treated by a combined antero-posterior procedure involving somatectomy, vertebral body replacement and posterior stabilisation; for sacral spine chordoma, a dorsal approach was always used. Of 11 patients (55 %) who required repeat surgery, eight had recurrent tumour and three had wound infection.Chordomas are rare, slow-growing tumours usually diagnosed with a delay, particularly when localised in the sacral spi- ne. At present magnetic resonance imaging is the essential diagnostic method allowing us to plan the appropriate surgical management.When the mobile spine is affected, a combined antero-posterior procedure including somatectomy, vertebral body replacement with a graft or implant and posterior stabilisation is used.When the sacral spine is involved, some authors prefer en bloc resection from the posterior approach, others use a combined antero-posterior procedure. Chordomas are known to have a high risk of local recurrence. Post-operative radiotherapy, which makes the disease-free interval longer, is recommendedúúú chemotherapy has no effect.Chordomas are associated with serious diagnostic and therapeutic problems, with frequent local recurrence. Prognosis is good if early diagnosis is made, and en bloc resection is performed.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY A retrospective evaluation of the success rate of revision ACL reconstruction performed using BTB allograft in terms of the life expectancy of the procedure up to and over five years from surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS Over a ten-year period, from 2003 to 2013, we performed 47 revision ACL reconstruction surgeries. The majority of the primary ACL reconstructions using BTB autografts were not performed at our site. The group observed included 16 women (34%) and 31 men (66%). The women were aged between 25 and 48 years, the median age being 32.5, and the men were aged between 25 and 46 years with the median age of 35. We were able to make a full pre- and post-operative evaluation of 22 out of 47 patients who underwent secondary ACL reconstruction surgery using a cadaverous BTB graft. This evaluation included an objective clinical testing and a subjective evaluation of the function and stability of the knee joint using the Tegner activity score, Lysholm score, and a modified Cincinatti score. The set of 22 patients was split into two groups: up to five years from revision surgery and over five years from the procedure. RESULTS In the group of patients who were fully evaluated within five years of revision reconstruction there was an average improvement of 16.4 points on the Cincinatti score, 19.9 points on the Lysholm score, and an upward movement averaging 1.5 levels on the Tegner activity score. In the over five years from surgery category the average improvement was 15.5, 15.9, and 1.2 levels upward movement, respectively. We were unable to prove a significantly increased level of failure in BTB allografts after five and more years from revision ACL reconstruction. DISCUSSION The two strongest factors affecting the life expectancy of ACL replacements are the age of the patient and the type of the graft used, allograft or autograft. The most at risk, in terms of how long the graft will last, is the age group of 10 - 19 years old. With each ten-year increase in age the risk of rupture is reduced more-or-less by half. Patients with ACL allograft replacement show a fourfold increased risk of the graft rupturing. The younger and more active the patient requiring revision ACL reconstruction is, the greater the need for an autograft. If an allograft has been used in revision reconstruction on an athlete, a great emphasis must be placed on the necessity of delaying the return to previous sporting activities for at least nine months. CONCLUSIONS The mid-term results of revision ACL reconstruction show that, subject to reasonable levels of stress, a correctly performed procedure using cadaverous BTB grafts is a good option to restore the stability of the knee joint over a period of five years and more from surgery. An increased incidence of reruptures or greater insufficiency of the cadaverous graft were not evident in our group after five and more years. The risk of cadaverous grafts failure is just like in the autologous replacement directly linked to the return to sport interval, frequency and intensity of stress to which the graft is subjected over a long period of time. The risk of rerupture is always higher in allograft reconstructions that have already stood in need of restructuring for a longer period of time. For this reason, a delay in returning to sports activity must be emphasized. As a rule, we recommend a return to full athletic training only after nine months to a year after surgery.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY In the management of dens axis fractures in patients older than 65 years of age the posterior approach is preferred due to osteoporosis and the risk of a failure of anterior osteosynthesis. The posterior approach, however, is associated with a higher incidence of complications. A combination of anterior transarticular fixation of C1/2 (ATS) with compression osteosynthesis of dens axis significantly increases the stability of osteosynthesis. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the period from 2009 to 2015 our hospital admitted 13 patients older than 65 years of age with a diagnosed type III dens axis fracture based on AO classification. 8 patients sustained a dens axis fracture combined with a stable atlas fracture. The cohort consisted of 13 women aged 67 to 90 years, with the mean age of 82.3 years. None of the female patients were affected neurologically. The dens axis fracture was treated by anterior approach. Once the screw was inserted in the dens axis, two more screws were added, the entrance points of those screws were medial and lateral to the odontoid screw and direction was divergently via C1/2 joints in order to reinforce stability. The patients were monitored at 6-week, 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Bone healing was confirmed by CT scan. RESULTS No complications were recorded during the surgery in any of the 13 patients. In one female patient the stabilization failed in the early postoperative period. A reoperation from anterior approach with the use of the same method was necessary. In eleven patients bone healing occurred after 6 to 12 months. In two patients pseudoarthrosis was formed with no clinical symptoms. No neurological deterioration or a patient s death was reported in the monitored period within 12 months after the treatment. DISCUSSION Where dens axis fractures in elderly patients are managed operatively, the posterior approach and transarticular fixation of C1/2 with sublaminar loop are preferred. This procedure is considered more reliable, owing to the fears of a failure of osteosynthesis by anterior approach. The most frequent cause of a failure is the pulling out of the screw through the anterior wall of dens axis base in patients with osteoporosis. Concurrently, the anterior approach is regarded as more considerate. The ATS fixation increases stability compared to isolated compression osteosynthesis, which makes it possible to manage the dens axis fractures by a more considerate anterior approach. CONCLUSIONS The ATS is a method that increases stability of compression osteosynthesis in managing dens axis in elderly patients. Key words: dens axis, upper cervical spine fracture, elderly, triple screw technique, anterior transarticular C1/2 stabilization.",

CONCLUSIONSWe proved that women definitely show a lower risk of early TKA revision surgeries in comparison with men.A higher frequency of reoperations was related to modifiable factors such as smoking, longer waiting times for the primary operation, and a higher preoperative level of physical activity.A significant finding is that stopping smoking could decrease the probability of early TKA revision.Nonetheless, we do not recommend decreasing preoperative physical activity at this point; it will require further studies and verification of this finding.Also, the potential mechanism of the influence of greater preoperative load on the particular reason for revision is yet to be explained.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The paper aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of the treatment of diaphyseal femur fractures in children treated with Bryant's vertical traction. Moreover, we also assessed the size of overgrowth in the injured femur. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 23 patients with 23 femoral shaft fractures treated with Bryant's vertical traction at our department in 2009-2014. The following parameters were assessed: sex, ïnjured side, weight, age, mechanism of injury, potential abuse, type of fracture, duration of traction, and total length of hospital stay. The healing time of the fracture was the same as the duration of traction. Also assessed was the size of femoral shortening after the removal of traction, the presence of skin complications in the course of treatment and potential development of compartment syndrome. At the mean follow-up of 47.8 months (range 22-85 months) from the date of injury the patients were evaluated clinically and radiologically for: length of limbs, presence of rotational deformity, range of motion of knee and hip joints, potential pain or limping, potential scoliosis of the spine and presence of scars after traction. Finally, through a questionnaire we learned about the opinions of parents as to the treatment method and about the possibility of home traction. RESULTS All the fractures healed. There was a total of 17 injured boys and 6 injured girls. Whereas 12 patients sustained a fracture of the left femur, 11 patients sustained a fracture of the right femur. The mean weight of patients at the time of injury was 13.9 kg (range 5-20 kg). The mean age at the time of traction was 30.8 months (range 1-70 months). The injury most frequently occurred from various falls, altogether in 15 cases (65.2%). Traffic accidents were registered as the cause of injury in 3 cases (13%). No abuse was confirmed. The average duration of traction was 19.8 days (range 8-26 days). The total length of hospital stay took on average 23.6 days (range 9-33 days). Skin excoriation and bullae due to irritation by the traction occurred in 21 children (91.3% cases). All the bullae healed, in 4 (17.4%) patients minor scars of 1x1 cm in size were formed around ankles. Not a single patient developed the compartment syndrome. The average femoral shortening after the removal of traction was 0.8 cm (range 0-2.3 cm). The follow-up examination, performed on average 47.8 months (range 22-85 months) from the date of injury revealed the average discrepancy of spinomalleolar distances in both the lower limps of 0 cm (range -1 to 1 cm). Radiographically measured lengths of both the femurs showed the average difference of 0 cm (range -1.4 to 0.9 cm). The resulting average overgrowth of injured femur was 0.9 cm (range 0.1 to 3.2 cm). Scoliosis of the spine was not reported in any of the patients. In 3 patients femur alignment demonstrated rotation, namely an external rotation of 10° in all the cases. All the children demonstrated full hip and knee joint mobility, identical to the uninjured side. After a heavy load one patient reported pain in the thigh and one walked with limp. The other patients showed no problems whatsoever. Treatment with the use of Bryant's traction was well tolerated by parents. Altogether 15 parents (65.2%) would opt for the same treatment method in case of a recurrent injury. The home traction option would be welcomed by 17 parents (73.9%). DISCUSSION The treatment by Bryant's vertical traction is condemned in Anglo-Saxon countries due to the risk for developing compartment syndrome, described in earlier studies. Neither our cohort, nor more recent studies reported the occurrence of compartment syndrome. The most frequent complication faced in our study was the skin complications underneath the traction, namely in a total of 91.3% of patients. In the literature, the other authors only make references to bullae occurrence, but do not provide any further specifications. Overgrowth after femoral shaft fractures is a very well described phenomenon. The size of femoral overgrowth described in our study was similar to that referred to in the available literature. A method frequently used abroad is the so-called home traction. This method, however, has so far failed to take root in our country, even though this therapeutic technique would be appreciated by parents. CONCLUSIONS The treatment of femoral shaft fractures by Bryant's vertical traction, in children up to the weight of 15 kg, is a simple and safe method with excellent functional outcomes and minimum serious complications. When treating the children with the body weight more than 15 kg, the risk of bullae formation increases, therefore in this weight category treatment shall be decided upon on a case by case basis. The resulting average overgrowth of injured femur was 0.9 cm which corresponds with the findings of other authors. The treatment method using the Bryant's traction is well tolerated by parents, even though most of them would welcome the option of home traction.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY An optimal technique to surgically treat high-grade high-dysplastic (HG HD)spondylolistheses remains disputable. There are multiple surgical procedures described, ranging from a simple posterior fusion in situ without fixation through a standalone anterior lumbar interbody fusion with the oblique insertion of a structural bonegraft to instrumented full reduction and 360-degree fusion. At our department, preference is given to the instrumented monosegmental reduction and fixation by a fixator with Schanz screws. The aim of this paper is a prospective clinical and radiological evaluation of the group of operated patients below 30 years of age with HG HD spondylolisthesis with a slip greater than 50%. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the period from 11/2007 to 2/2017, a total of 29 patients with HG HD spondylolisthesis always of the L5-S1 segment were treated at the Department of Spinal Surgery of the First Faculty of Medicine of the Charles University and the Teaching Hospital Motol. They were 10 men and 19 women aged 10 to 28 years, with the mean age of 18.4 years. In 27 patients reduction and single-segment fixation of L5-S1 were performed as primary treatment, in one case decompression and noninstrumented-fusion only was carried out and in one case in situ fixation of L4-L5-S1 for distinctive osteoporosis. RESULTS The average duration of posterior surgery without the reconstruction of the anterior column was 88.9 min, in case of anterior fusion it was 46.6 min and in case of only posterior approach and fusion with the reconstruction of the anterior column it was 141.5 min. The average blood loss in the posterior fusion without the reconstruction of the anterior column reached 384.3 ml, in the stand-alone anterior fusion it was 21.6 ml. and in the posterior fusion with the reconstruction of the anterior column 430.0 ml. In 27 patients in whom the reduction was carried out, a shift of the L5 vertebral body observed on the CT scan prior to the surgery was 64.3% on average, while postoperatively and also at 6 months after the surgery during the follow-up examination it was 8.1%. A clear bone posterolateral fusion was found by the CT examination after 4-6 months in all 29 patients (100%, N = 29), while bone intersomatic fusion was reported in 25 cases (96.2%, N = 26). Altogether 6.9% of residual neurological deficits were observed. The statistical processing of VAS values for lumbar back pain and ODI values before the surgery and after two years confirmed a significant improvement of the clinical condition (p < 0.001). When asked whether they would undergo the same surgery with their current experience with the treatment, all the 29 patients answered \"yes\" and stressed the functional as well as the aesthetic results of the surgery. DISCUSSION In agreement with the other authors, the PT, SS and PI values are measured and we consider the SA, SDSG LSA and Dubousset s LSA assessments to be essential. All the measured values showed statistically significant changes postoperatively, only the pelvic incidence(PI) value remained unchanged. In patients with HG HD spondylolisthesis, we prefer reduction and the 360-degree monosegmental fusion, in the case of sacral osteotomy always using the posterior approach, in the cases where osteotomy is not performed using the next anterior approach. Even in the cases of the most severe deformities, we prefer to maintain the body of L5 and, where necessary, rather shorten the sacrum, which in our opinion leads to a better aesthetic result. CONCLUSIONS The reduction by single-segment instrumentation is a suitable alternative to the surgical therapy of HG HD spondylolistheses in young patients. It provides a high success rate of bone fusion and good clinical results including the aesthetic aspects. The complications associated with full reduction are not markedly higher than in other surgical techniques.

We also wanted to verify the hypothesis as to whether the use of conventional dorsal plate without the application of bone grafts leads to comparable results as the use of dorsal locking plates and routine application of bone grafts. MATERIAL AND METHODS Throughout the years 2005 to 2014 the four-corner arthrodesis of the wrist was performed in our department in a total of 62 patients, in two cases bilaterally. The indication was the diagnosis of SLAC/SNAC grade III. Normed RondoFix implant was used in all the cases. Following the surgery, the wrist was immobilized by a volar plaster splint for the period of 2 weeks and subsequently orthosis was applied for additional 4 weeks. The wrist mobilisation started in week seven when the orthosis was removed, the patients were allowed full load on the wrist 3 months after the surgery. Our group of patients was evaluated retrospectively, a total of 53 operated wrists in 51 patients were assessed. The assessment was carried out based on a radiograph of the wrist, range of motion, Mayo Modified Wrist Score, DASH Score and grip strength test. RESULTS The mean range of motion in sagittal plane was 63.7°, in frontal plane the mean value was 32.1°. According to the Mayo Modified Wrist Score 37 patients were rated \"excellent\" or \"good\". Due to the presence of moderate pain, the result in other 10 patients was assessed as \"satisfactory\". In a total of 4 patients the result was assessed as \"weak\", in two of them for a presence of non-union and in other two for severe pain under load. One of these patients underwent bilateral surgery and reported severe pain in both the wrists. Regarding DASH score, the best result equalled 0, the worst 65.83, with the mean of 20.5. The grip strength ranged from 8 to 54 kg, with the mean value of 27.5 kg. In two patients, a non-union occurred. In the first case the extraction of implant and re-arthrodesis was performed due to severe pain and screw migration. The patient is now 22 months after the surgery and the radiographs show that the arthrodesis has healed and the patient has no clinical difficulties. The second patient did not report any difficulties, therefore he is only subject to follow-up. No cases of screw or plate breakage were reported. In one case, the patient reported pain in the region of radial styloid process. A revision was indicated with radial styloidectomy and decompression of tendons of m. extensor pollicis brevis and m. abductor pollicis longus. As a result the patient had no clinical difficulty. One case of wrist radial deviation was recorded. It was managed by corrective wedge osteotomy and reosteosynthesis using a circular dorsal plate. In one patient dorsal impingement occurred, accompanied by limited range of motion and pain. Extraction of OS material was indicated and the patient was relieved of any difficulties. We have recorded aseptic necrosis of lunate bone in one case. DISCUSSION When comparing the functional results such as the range of motion and grip strength, our results are fully comparable to previously published papers. In papers where DASH was referred to, its value ranges from 13 to 29.82, which is fully consistent with our observations with the final value of 20.5. The incidence of non-union and the degree of complications is not deviating from the values included in other publications either. In all the mentioned publications the authors refer to routine use of bone grafts. The publications evaluating the use of locking plates do not report different results either. CONCLUSIONS In case of correct indication, the four-corner arthrodesis of the wrist represents a very good solution. In our group of patients, we confirmed the hypothesis that equally good results as with the use of locking plates can be achieved when using a non-locking plate system. Essential is the proper correction of DISI and primary good congruence between fused carpal bones instead of the use of bone grafts. Key words: SLAC wrist, SNAC wrist, four-corner arthrodesis, partial wrist fusion.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The purpose of this study is to retrospectively evaluate the treatment and the complications in patients with extracapsular proximal femoral fractures. MATERIAL AND METHODS The evaluation focused on a group of patients who underwent a surgery at the authors department in the period from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2013. The inclusion criteria were a simple fall and a monotrauma. The injury-to-surgery interval, course of the surgery and hospital stay, occurrence of early and late complications were assessed. RESULTS In the respective period 286 patients underwent surgery, with the mean age of 79 years (36-101). A basicervical fracture was suffered by 20 patients, a pertrochanteric fracture by 228 patients and 38 patients sustained a subtrochanteric fracture. Osteosynthesis using the DHS was applied in 113 patients, in 110 patients PFNA osteosynthesis was performed and in 51 patients osteosynthesis using an Ender nail was conducted. Yet another type of plate osteosynthesis was opted for in 12 patients. The most frequent postoperative complication was delirium, which was reported in a total of 38 patients. Non-infectious early seroma and hematoma type collection was observed in 6 patients. An infection occurred in one patient. Apart from 8 patients who died during the primary hospital stay, the fracture healing was followed up in 252 patients (91% of 278). The length of healing was 15 weeks on average, delayed healing was reported in five patients. Primary malposition was seen in 9 patients (3%) and secondary malposition occurred in five patients (2%). There were five cases of non-union (2% of 278) in our group of patients. In the followed-up period, a total of 86 patients (30 % of 286) died within one year after the injury. In cases of death, the follow-up was 100% thanks to the data obtained from the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic (UZIS). Death as a direct consequence of proximal femur fracture occurred in 66 patients (23% of 286). DISCUSSION The results of complications in our group (infection, delayed healing, malposition and non-union) are comparable to those identified by other authors, with the exception of one-year lethality, which is lower in the presented group. CONCLUSIONS The occurrence of complications after proximal femur surgeries is affected by multiple factors. The most important are the choice of a suitable implant, technically correct execution of osteosynthesis and intensive postoperative treatment, including the continuity of care after hospital discharge.

    "abstract": "Hip disarticulation is a major ablative procedure with serious risks as well as consequences for the patient, performed rarely for a lower extremity infection. According to literature, the mortality rate in these procedures reaches up to 60%. Unfavourable prognostic factors are emergency surgeries without adequate preparation of the patient and surgeries indicated for an ischemic terrain infection. The authors present four cases of hip disarticulation for severe lower extremity infection. In one patient, the procedure was performed urgently for necrotising fasciitis in the lower extremity extending up to the groin area, in the other three patients for non-healing femoral stump infection following the lower extremity amputation for vascular causes, of which two cases got complicated by the presence of TKA. Two of the patients treated surgically for stump infection died two months after the surgery due to respiratory complications. The two surviving patients underwent the last check one year following the surgery, they are both capable of independent locomotion with two underarm crutches and use the prosthesis only rarely. In the discussion, the factors influencing the mortality rate of the procedure, the principles of surgical and antimicrobial therapy, and the use of the negative-pressure wound therapy are analysed. The underlying principles of the care for patients with severe infections of the musculoskeletal system are infection focus debridement with the removal of foreign material, antibiotic (anti-infective) therapy targeted based on the cultivation results, wound management aimed to prevent contamination with nosocomial strains, and multidisciplinary cooperation - orthopaedist/surgeon, infectious disease physician, intensive care specialist, nutrition and rehabilitation specialist, nursing and prosthetic care providers.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Olecranon fractures in skeletally immature patients are rather rare and represent up to 7% of elbow skeletal injuries. Although the majority of olecranon fractures is constituted by undisplaced fractures treated conservatively with good outcomes, a few of them require surgery. The aim of the study was to compare two different approaches of surgical treatment - the open reduction with tension band wiring - cerclage (ORCe) and the closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (CRPP). MATERIAL AND METHODS 37 patients (28 boys, 9 girls) were included in the retrospective multicentric study. The patients were treated at two different institutions (the Clinic of Paediatric Surgery, Orthopaedics and Traumatology, the University Hospital Brno and the Department of Paediatric Surgery and Traumatology, the University Hospital Hradec Králové, Czech Republic). 17 patients underwent the ORCe procedure, while 20 patients were treated using the CRPP method. Different parameters were statistically compared in the groups (demographic data, data concerning the course of the therapy, outcome of the therapy in terms of movements' restrictions and complications such as osteosynthesis failure and infection). RESULTS Both the groups were comparable in terms of demographic data because no statistically significant difference was observed in terms of the age (p = 0.082), the affected site (p = 1.000) and the gender (p = 0.462). Statistically significant difference between these two groups was found in the interval between the implementation and the removal of the osteosynthetic material (p < 0.001) and in the length of cast immobilisation (p = 0.047). The number of patients with movement restriction up to 10° was statistically significantly higher in patients who underwent the CRPP procedure (p = 0.040), but no statistically significant difference was seen between these two groups in terms of movement restriction more than 10° (p = 0.609). One revision surgery was performed in the CRPP group, however with no statistical significance (p = 0.350). DISCUSSION The multicentric study included 37 children, who underwent surgical treatment of a displaced olecranon fracture. Compared to the studies dealing with this topic the number of patients included in this study is relatively high. It advocates the possibility of using the CRPP method as a good alternative to the gold-standard ORCe technique because no difference in terms of the number of revision surgeries and the clinically important movement restriction of more than 10° were seen. It also brings along advantages such as a simple surgical technique, good functional and cosmetic effects, reducing the risk of ischemic insult of growth plate and the possibility of osteosynthetic material removal at an outpatient department with no need for general anaesthesia. The risk of a higher radiation exposure of both the patient and the surgical team should be considered as a disadvantage of the closed method. CONCLUSIONS The mini-invasive CRPP appears to be a good alternative option to the ORCe method for the treatment of isolated olecranon fractures in children offering the advantages such as avoiding extensive open procedure and simple implants removal.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe purpose of the study is a retrospective comparison of results of the two-stage revision total hip arthroplasty using a non-articulating and an articulating spacer to treat periprosthetic joint infection (PJI).Two basic hypotheses are evaluated:(1) the clinical outcomes of the patients treated with \"hand made\" articulating cement spacer are better than in non-articulating patient's group in two-stage revision for PJI of the total hip arthroplasty and (2) PJI recurrence is higher in the group of patients treated with an articulating spacer group. MATERIAL AND METHODSThe evaluated group consists of a total of 57 patients (23 women, 34 men) with the mean age of 61.2 years.Group A of 39 patients were treated by two-stage revision using the \"hand-made\" articulating cement spacer and Group B of 18 patients were treated using the non-articulating spacer.Both the groups were evaluated retrospectively in the reference period: preoperatively and two years after the surgery using the Harris Hip Score (HHS) clinical assessment.The revision surgery for acute and chronic complications of treatment, length of hospitalization, and the PJI recurrence were evaluated for both the groups. RESULTSThe resulting HHS clinical reviews were pre-operatively 43.59 points in both the groups with postoperative improvement up to 81.74 points.The mean preoperative HHS scores were 41.67 points (Group A) and 47.77 points (Group B) and two years after the surgery they were 83.43 points (Group A) and 78.08 points (Group B) (two-tailed t-test, p-value = 0.042).In Group A a total of seven revisions were performed in the interval between the two-stage revision (4x recurrent dislocation, 2x persistent infection, 1x spacer fracture).In Group B one patient was revised for persistent infection.In the two-year period after the operation, a relapse of PJI was recorded in 5 patients in Group A (12.8%) and in 1 patient in Group B (5.6%) (Chi-square test, p-value = 0.41).The average time of hospitalization was 51.58 days, whereby 49.72 days and 55.61 days on average for Group A and B respectively (p-value = 0.53). DISCUSSIONAccording to recent studies, the advantage of motion preservation in articulating cement spacers can be complicated by recurrent dislocations, implant migration, periprosthetic fractures or recurrent joint replacement infections, which can further prolong the treatment and worsen the final clinical results.An alternative treatment option is the application of a nonarticulating spacer maintaining the advantage of local administration of antibiotics and reducing the dead space formed by the infected implant removal.Discussed is mainly the choice of the method in case of muscle disorder or presence of segmental bone defects. CONCLUSIONSThe results demonstrate the better clinical outcomes and the higher revision rate of patients with an articulating cement spacer in two stage revision.We didn't find any differences between the risk of PJI recurrence in both groups.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Our study compared early outcomes of total knee arthroplasty performed in conventional and enhanced perioperative care regimes, i.e. without the use of Redon drain, with intensified perioperative analgesia and more frequent and intensive rehabilitation regime in the latter. MATERIAL AND METHODS The prospective study included 194 patients (76 men and 118 women) implanted with primary knee endoprosthesis. The mean age was 68.8 (44.7 - 88.0 years). The patients were divided into two groups - the \"enhanced\" and \"conventional\" procedures. In the first group, Redon suction drain was not inserted at the end of the surgery, and the patients commenced passive knee mobility exercise of the operated knee immediately after being brought back from the operating theatre. The general anaesthesia was supplemented by a combined femoral nerve block and wound infiltration with local anaesthetics. The second group comprised the patients who underwent conventional surgery, i.e. with the use of drain, without femoral nerve block, with no wound infiltration with local anaesthetics, and without immediate post-operative mobilization of the joint. The evaluation was carried out using regular clinical tools (subjective evaluation, objective examination, questionnaire and Knee Society Score (KSS)). Standard statistical methods were applied to data processing. RESULTS The patients under the \"conventional regime\" showed a significantly sharper drop in haemoglobin and haematocrit levels, higher consumption of blood transfusion and analgesics during the first three days after the surgery. The patients under the \"enhanced regime\" showed a better range of joint motion at hospital discharge, flexion in particular (p = 0.001). During the hospital stay no frequent swelling, secretion or wound reddening was reported in any of the monitored groups. In the \"conventional\" group, however, haematomas were more frequently present. The postoperative checks did not reveal any differences in satisfaction of the patients with the surgery. At the first follow-up examination at the outpatient department the \"conventional\" group patients more often reported knee pain and a feeling of a swollen knee. Nonetheless, their statements did not correspond with the VAS score. In the period between the 6th and 12th months following the surgery, the differences in the range of motion disappeared. The KSS showed a noticeable improvement in both the groups as against the preoperative values. In the \"enhanced\" group patients, the score increased dramatically at the beginning, whereas in the \"conventional\" group, the score was growing slowly and gradually until the last follow-up check after the surgery. The \"conventional\" group patients more frequently reported infectious complications (surface and deep wound infections: 4 vs. 2 patients) requiring a revision surgery (p = 0.024). DISCUSSION Recently, attention has been drawn to the rapid recovery approach, which eliminated postoperative immobilization and enabled the patient to start exercising already on the day of the surgery, with some patients even walking independently. The individual enhanced recovery regimes differ in details but mostly result in achieving the aim much sooner when compared to the conventional approaches. The patients under the enhanced recovery regimes can accomplish better functional outcomes in the first few months after the surgery than the patients undergoing the surgery under the conventional regime. The routine use of Redon drains in TKA is obviously unnecessary; it tends to be associated with a higher blood loss and a higher risk of prosthetic joint infection. CONCLUSIONS The TKA implant without suction drains combined with intensified perioperative analgesia and intensive postoperative rehabilitation is a safe way to earlier recovery of the function of the operated knee, or, by extension, the lower limb. The described approach is not associated with a higher risk of perioperative complications (bleeding, healing disorders or early infections). Patients also benefit from lower blood losses. Based on the results of our study, we recommend performing the TKA surgeries routinely without drains, with perioperative analgesia and immediate postoperative joint mobilization.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYVarious spine disorders are regularly treated by orthoses, and success of treatment depends on wearing these devices.In this study we examined the compliance, wear comfort, subjective stabilization and side effects associated with spinal orthoses using an individualized questionnaire and the Compact Short Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12). MATERIAL AND METHODSIn this prospective pilot study of randomized cross-over design, twelve healthy volunteers with a mean age of 31.2 years wore three different types of orthoses, each for one week: A hyperextension brace (HB), a custom-made semirigid orthosis (SO) and a custom-made rigid orthosis (RO).The daily duration of wearing the orthosis was defined as primary endpoint; contentment was measured using an individualized questionnaire and the standardized SF-12. RESULTSIn the study population calculated probability of wearing the HB and RO was between 0.2 und 38.5% (95% confidence interval).No volunteer wore the SO orthosis for the predefined time.The SO and RO each displayed high subjective stabilization, while the RO was more often associated with side effects like skin pressure marks than the SO.The need for rework due to discomfort was mainly necessary with the RO.We observed no substantial differences in feeling compression and sweating.Noteworthy, eight of 12 subjects complained of uncomfortable sternal pressure due to the upper pad of the HB.The SF-12: scores ranged from 52.1 to 48.6 on the physical (PCS), and from 53.7 to 50.8 on the mental component score (MCS), demonstrating an influence on QoL. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONSThe design as well as the orthosis itself influence the compliance of wearing and exert a moderate negative, but acceptable impact on QoL.The SO appeared to correlate with the best overall compromise between comfort and subjective stabilization.Further investigations are necessary in patients with spinal diseases, for whom the effect of orthosis wearing may surpass the potential discomfort.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe study aimed to find out whether the higher rate of complications described in literature in the case of plate and intramedullary osteosynthesis of clavicle fractures is high enough to discredit one of these methods. MATERIAL AND METHODSIn the period from July 2007 to March 2016, a total of 151 osteosyntheses of diaphyseal clavicle fractures were performed in 149 patients (106 men, 43 women).The plate as well as intramedullary techniques were used in this group of patients.The follow-up of 12 months was completed in 125 patients (91 men, 34 women).The age of patients ranged from 15 to 74 years.The postoperative rehabilitation with no load applied started immediately by elevating the arm up to 90 ° abduction for 3 weeks, which was followed by full range of motion exercises.The load was set based on the radiological finding.The number of complications, including the failure of osteosynthesis, was assessed. RESULTSSome kind of a whole range of complications (postoperative discomfort, infection, failure of osteosynthesis, non-union) occurred in 37 patients (29.6%), with osteosynthesis failing in six of them (4.8%), always within 6 months after the surgery.No later failure was reported.A statistically significant difference was observed only when comparing the patients discomfort for individual surgical techniques, with poorer results in case of intramedullary osteosynthesis.(p<0.001). DISCUSSIONThe dominance of \"discomfort\" in intramedullary fixation was caused by soft tissue irritation by the edge of material projecting thereto.Once it was removed, the results of both the methods in terms of the number of complications were comparable.In all the cases, either an incorrect indication of respective osteosynthesis techniques, or a technically poor surgical performance were identified as the likely causes of failure of the osteosynthesis. CONCLUSIONSThe osteosynthesis always failed due to a wrong indication or technical errors in the execution of osteosynthesis.The intramedullary osteosynthesis is indicated in simple two-part fractures.The plate osteosynthesis can be applied to multiple fragment fractures.In preoperative planning, a suitable method shall be opted for based on the type of the fracture and the basic principles shall be adhered to during the surgery.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY No study has so far been published in the Czech Republic that would try to at least estimate the costs associated with revision total knee arthroplasties (TKA). The purpose of our study was to determine the total costs of primary and revision TKA for aseptic and septic failure and to determine the structure of costs, all with respect to a single workplace in the Czech Republic. MATERIAL AND METHODS The group included a total of 43 patients aged 55 to 82 years, of whom 23 (53.5%) with primary TKA implantation, 10 (23.3%) patients with revision surgery for aseptic failure, and 10 patients for septic failure of TKA. The costs of TKA were calculated retrospectively, factoring in all the items of reported care sent to the health insurance company system. The resulting costs reflected the appropriate payments in CZK based on the point value in the year concerned. RESULTS The average costs of uncomplicated primary TKA implantation amounted to CZK 136,279; the surgical treatment of aseptic failure of TKA was CZK 189,634; and the surgical treatment of septic failure of TKA was CZK 296,189. In all the evaluated cases, the highest cost item was the material of the implant (43.5 to 54.2% of the total costs), followed by the bed costs (19.8 to 21.6%), and the third highest cost item being the performance of surgery (13.6 to 16.5%). The costs of the physician's services represented 12.8 to 14.7% of the total costs and 23.6 to 33.8% of the costs of the implants. The costs associated with the treatment of infection by multiple-stage reimplantation were 5.4 times higher than when DAIR (revision surgery with debridement, irrigation, original implant retention) was used. The average costs of inpatient rehabilitation accounted for CZK 23,046 and the insurance company reimbursed on average CZK 33,544 for a 4-week therapeutic spa treatment. DISCUSSION The finding that the revision TKA is several times more expensive than the primary TKA and that the multiple-stage total knee reimplantation is the most expensive corresponds with the literature. In the Czech Republic, the dominant cost item is the cost of the implant, namely in the total costs of both the primary and revision TKA, with the revision implants in our study being on average 2.1 times more expensive than the implants used for primary implantation. Besides, the costs of implants also considerably differ across countries. The costs of the physician's services ranked 4th in the list of cost items, which does not correspond with the data reported in Western Europe or the US. Conversely, the least difference was observed in the costs of preoperative preparation and auxiliary examinations. CONCLUSIONS We have concluded in our study that the average costs of the total knee replacement for aseptic failure were 1.9 times higher than the costs of primary surgery. The average costs of treatment for septic failure (two-stage procedure) were 2.7 times higher compared to primary surgery. In case of aseptic failure, the costs of total knee reimplantation were 2.7 times higher compared to the replacement of only polyethylene liner in case of instability and osteosynthesis in case of periprosthetic fracture, with components retention. The costs of septic failure therapy were 5.4 times higher in multiple-stage reimplantation compared to revision surgery with debridement, irrigation and original implant retention. Key words: total knee arthroplasty; total knee replacement; revision total knee arthroplasty; aseptic failure; septic failure; cost analysis.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral palsy is a serious world-wide problem; its incidence ranges from one to five per thousand of live-born children and is much influenced by gestation age and birth weight. In orthopaedic treatment of lower extremity motor disorders, one of the options for contracture or deformity elimination and for stiff leg gait improvement is rectus femoris tendon transfer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of this surgical technique.In the period from 1993 to 2003, 15 patients of both sexes, aged 5 to 13 years, were treated by the Gage method (22 operations) in our department. The indication for surgery was excessive spasticity of the femoral quadriceps muscle at the beginning of the swing phase of the gait cycle. The spastic syndromes included quadruparesis in seven patients, diparesis in seven patients and hemiparesis in one patient. After surgery, a circular plaster cast was applied for 4 weeks. Following immobilization, all patients received a short-term inpatient and long-term outpatient physical therapy. They were followed- up for 1 to 10 years and gait improvement was analyzed on the basis of three criteria in the swing phase: quality of the initial swing, frequency of tripping over the toe and the degree of knee flexion. The results were evaluated on a 1-to-4 scale (best to worst), categorizing the patients into four groups.The first, second and third categories included eight, five and two patients, respectively. None of the patients was placed in the fourth category. Surgery did not increase the initial range of inner hip rotation. Patients with milder forms of cerebral palsy (diparesis and hemiparesis) achieved better results.Our results showed that distal rectus femoris tendon transfer significantly improved knee flexion during the swing phase of the gait cycle. The prerequisite for a good outcome of surgery is a pre-operative potential for passive knee extension and stable function of the other lower extremity joints. Key words: cerebral palsy, surgical treatment, quadriceps tendon transfer.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Ankle fractures are characterised by a high variability of damage to bone and ligament structures which leads to diverse clinical conditions. This study aims to analyse a group of patients with surgically treated ankle fractures, with a focus on evaluating the outcomes of treatment of ankle joint medial structure injuries (medial malleolar fracture, ligament lesions). MATERIAL AND METHODS The analysed group included 186 patients (102 men and 84 women), in whom an ankle fracture surgery was performed in 2015 and 2016. The outcomes of the treatment were evaluated in 111 patients with type B and type C fractures, who underwent a follow-up examination at one year after the surgery consisting in subjective and objective assessment of the condition and an ankle radiograph. The obtained outcomes were processed using the techniques of descriptive statistics and subsequently evaluated through the Pearson´s chi-square test at 5% significance level, or the Fisher´s exact test for low frequencies. RESULTS The mean age of patients in the group was 48.6 years, while it was lower in men than in women (42.8 years compared to 53.9 years). According to Weber classification, 1 % of fractures were classified as a type A fracture, 68 % as a type B, 27 % as a type C. The group of isolated medial malleolar fractures represented 4 % of cases. The medial side of the ankle joint more frequently suffered a ligament lesion (56 %) than a medial malleolar fracture (44 %). The mean age of the patients with a medial malleolar fracture was 51.9 years, whereas the mean age of the patients with a ligament lesion on the medial side of the ankle was 44.2 years. When evaluating the outcomes using the OMA score at one year postoperatively, a statistically significant difference was found (p = 0.002) between the patients with a medial malleolar fracture (OMA 79.9) and the patients with a ligament lesion at the medial side of the ankle joint (OMA 91.2). DISCUSSION The aim of the study was to add more information on medial structures of ankle joint that are of major importance for ensuring stability of ankle fractures. In agreement with the literature, when managing the ankle fractures with an injury suffered on the medial side there is obviously a more uniform approach in cases with medial malleolar fractures. The situation is different in case of the deltoid ligament lesion, when historically there is a certain level of non-uniformity in indications for revision surgeries and treatment of the injured ligament structures. In our group, in the case of ligament lesion on the medial side of the ankle joint an emphasis is put on the fluoroscopy control of the symmetry of tibiotalar joint space before the beginning of the surgery and also after the fibular fracture stabilisation. The revision surgery was indicated in cases where asymmetry of ankle fork was found. The patients considered the treatment outcome better in cases with a ligament lesion than in cases with a medial malleolar fracture. CONCLUSIONS Proper treatment of medial structures of the ankle joint is important for ensuring the stability of ankle fractures. The patients with type B fractures reported better results at one year postoperatively compared to the patients with type C fracture according to the Weber classification. A statistically significantly better results after the ankle fracture surgery were achieved in patients with the presence of a medial ligament lesion compared to the patients with a medial malleolar fracture.

Our study aims to evaluate the outcomes of the treatment of sequelae of septic arthritis of interphalangeal joints by arthrodesis with external fixation. This topic is hardly covered in literature. Moreover, it compares the outcomes of application of this method in diabetic patients and non-diabetic population. MATERIAL AND METHODS Arthrodesis by means of Stellbrink external fixator was performed in 17 patients who had suffered septic arthritis of interphalangeal joints of the hand. The following parameters were followed in patients in our group: age, sex, etiology of disease, smoking, diabetes, affected fingers and joints of the hand, side, microbial culture finding, wound healing, postoperative ATB therapy and its duration, radiographic signs of the union of arthrodesis and potential complications. RESULTS The group included 8 men and 9 women. The mean age was 66.2 years. 5 patients in the group were diabetic. In 16 patients the wound healed per primam, in 1 case per secundam. The average duration of postoperative ATB therapy was 4.3 weeks. The X-ray showed the union of fused articular surfaces at 6.9 weeks on average. Complications occurred in 3 patients, namely 1 case of secondary wound healing, 1 case of nail bed damage and 1 case of flexor tenosynovitis of the operated finger. The arthrodesis was successfully healed in all the patients and a no difference was detected between diabetic and nondiabetic patients. DISCUSSION When arthrodesis of interphalangeal joints of the hand is performed using an external fixator, the metal material is introduced outside the area of inflammation, or the field potentially at risk of infection, therefore this method is predetermined for surgeries in the terrain changed by inflammation or potentially at risk of inflammation. Compared to the other methods such as arthrodesis by inserting K-wires intramedullary, there is no risk of migration of the metal material and the associated soft tissue irritation. CONCLUSIONS Our study confirms the safety and efficiency of arthrodesis of interphalangeal joints of the hand by means of an external fixator in treating the sequelae of septic arthritis. The union of arthrodesis with no complications was observed even in all the diabetic patients. Ranking among the main advantages of this method are the easy care for the surgical wound, achievement of easy and firm fixation with the possibility to apply an external fixator outside the area of the original infection. Key words:arthrodesis, external fixator, septic arthritis, interphalangeal joint.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSThis retrospective non-randomized level 3 evidence study included 58 patients.All of them have sustained a Tossy III AC dislocation.Of the 58 patients, 31 were treated with pinning and tension banding.Modified orthocord (absorbable knitted strand) sling technique (One 2.0-2.5 mm Kirchner wire, orthocord tension banding and coraco-clavicular ligament suture) was used in 27 patients.The same regime was used in postoperative follow up.For the clinical assessment the ASES and Constant score were used.The presence of calcification, degenerative changes, clavicular dislocation were assessed during the X-ray follow-ups. RESULTSThe mean treatment time was 18.7 ± 4.9 weeks in the pinning and tension band group (Group A), whereas 15.8 ± 2.8 weeks in the modified orthocord sling technique (Group B).There was a significantly shorter period of healing in Group B. There were no statistically significant differences in the K wire removal time (Group A: 12.6 ± 3.7, Group B: 11.9 ± 3.2).No significant difference was observed between Group A and Group B on the ASES score (Group A: 95 ± 5.8, Group B: 98 ± 3.1) and on the Constant score (Group A: 97.7 ± 3.2, Group B: 97.9 ± 2.9).There were significant differences in both groups between the injured and non-injured shoulder on the Constant score.The mean secondary clavicular dislocation in Group A was 7.2 ± 1.8 mm in the operated shoulder and 4.8 ± 2.0 mm in the non-operated shoulder.The secondary dislocation in Group B was 7.5 ± 2.0 mm in the injured shoulder and 4.2 ± 1.2 mm in the non-injured shoulder.There was a significant difference between the injured and the non-injured shoulder in both groups.Calcification in coraco-clavicular ligament was observed in 15 (48.4%)Group A cases and in 13 (48.1%)Group B cases.Secondary AC joint arthrosis was observed in 8 (25.8%)Group A cases and in 1 (3.7%)Group B case. DISCUSSIONNo significant difference in clinical outcomes between both the surgical techniques was found.These results are comparable with other, recently published studies.On the other hand, we observed a significantly decreased treatment time with the modified orthocord sling technique.One, centrically inserted Kirschner wire, might better tolerate small rotation movements in the AC joint.Secondary clavicular dislocation, Kirschner wire dislocations and wound complications were similar in both groups and comparable to other, recently published studies. CONCLUSIONSEven though the tension banding and orthocord modified sling rank among the oldest and the cheapest techniques available for AC dislocation treatment, their results are comparable with modern and costly techniques.The orthocord modified sling technique has an advantage of fast and cheap material extraction in outpatient conditions.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Transposition of tibialis posterior muscle ranks among the methods of dorsiflexion restoration in patients with peroneal nerve palsy. Even though this method is commonly used, anatomical variations are still encountered which make us modify the established procedures. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the functional outcomes of operated patients and based on the clinical experience to define by cadaver preparation the anatomical causes preventing the use of the standard transposition technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS The clinical group includes 21 patients (15 men, 6 women) with the mean age of 34.2 years and with common peroneal nerve palsy confirmed by EMG. In 20 patients, transposition of the tendon of the tibialis posterior muscle (MTP) through the interosseous membrane of the leg was performed. In one patient the tendon was transposed ventrally to the distal end of the tibia and fixed in the lateral cuneiform bone due to an extremely narrow space of the interosseous membrane of the leg distally between the lower limb bones. In 18 patients the tendon was fixed by osteosuture to the base of 3rd metatarsal bone, in three patients to the lateral cuneiform bone. The outcomes were evaluated at 6 months after the surgery, when active ankle dorsiflexion (DF) range of motion greater than 5° was considered an excellent outcome, active position at 90° up to DF less than 5° a satisfactory outcome, and any plantigrade position as a poor outcome. The anatomical study included 20 extremities fixed by formalin (10 cadavers, 5 men and 5 women with the mean age of 71.3 years). The length of the individual parts of tibialis posterior muscle was measured and the variations of the muscle attachment were evaluated. The measurement was concluded by a simulation of surgical procedure. RESULTS When evaluating the clinical group, an excellent outcome was reported in 12 patients (57%), a satisfactory outcome in 8 patients (38%) and a poor outcome in one patient (5%). When evaluating the anatomical group, a division of the attaching part of the tendon into three main strips was observed. The thickest middle strip attached to the tuberosity of navicular bone and medial cuneiform bone was reported in all the specimens. The thinner lateral strip (originating from the tendon in 90% of specimens) was attached to the intermediate and lateral cuneiform bone, the cuboid bone, metatarsal bones II-V, and moreover it grows into the origin of the flexor hallucis brevis muscle. The third strip of the tendon attached to the sustentaculum tali, plantar calcaneonavicular ligament and fibrocartilago navicularis was missing in one specimen (5%). When the passing the tendon through the interosseous space between the lower limb bones was simulated in order for the tendon to go in the direction of the planned traction, in two specimens (10%) the pulling through was impossible due to the tendon being thicker than the interosseous space. In two specimens (10%) it was not the tendon, but already the muscular belly which passed through the given space. DISCUSSION In our group, 95% of the functional outcomes were excellent or satisfactory. A poor result was reported in one patient, in whom the EMG examination was not performed as a standard procedure and in whom the muscular strength was insufficient to achieve full dorsiflexion of the ankle. The anatomical study indicates that the narrow space between the lower limb bones can prevent the pulling through of the tendon, which can be addressed intraoperatively by the transposition of the tendon ventrally to tibia. The study reveals that the tendon necessary for transposition can be elongated by the strips of the tendon attached to the sole of the foot. CONCLUSIONS The knowledge of the anatomical conditions may help us better manage potential complications intraoperatively. Key words: tibialis posterior muscle, peroneal nerve palsy, transposition of tibialis posterior muscle, anatomy of tibialis posterior muscle, common fibular nerve palsy.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYNano-structuring and nano-silver have been extensively studied for improving the antibacterial ability of implants due to their powerful antibacterial activity; however, there is no clinical application as yet.The aim of the study was to determine the antibacterial, antiadhesive and cytotoxic features of Ti6Al4V modified with nano-texturing and silver nano-particles. MATERIAL AND METHODSThe nanoparticles were applied on polished and nano-textured Ti6Al4V using sonoreduction.The surface topography, roughness, friction coefficients, hardness and elastic modulus values for prepared top layers were established.The materials were tested for antibacterial and antiadhesion activity using reference bacterial strains (Staphylococcus epidermidis CCM 7221, Staphylococcus aureus MRSA 4591, Enterococcus faecalis CCM 4224, Escherichia coli CCM 3954) and their cytocompatibility. RESULTSA strong antibacterial activity of samples treated with nano-texture and/or silver nanoparticles compared to all the tested bacterial strains at 24 hours was proven.This antibacterial activity was diminishing in relation to Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis at 48 and 72 hours but remained very effective against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli.We also demonstrated antibiofilm activity for samples treated with silver nanoparticles and nano-tubes in experiments lasting 24 and 72 hours. DISCUSSIONOur main findings are in agreement with those reported in recent literature.The implant surfaces treated with nano-texture in combination with silver nanoparticles exhibit strong antibacterial and antibiofilm characteristics.Despite there is conclusive evidence of strong antibacterial functioning, why these implant modifications have not been widely applied in clinical practice remains a question.While many obstacles including legislative procedures required for clinical implementation are more or less known, it should be clearly demonstrated that this surface modification does neither harm the patient nor interfere with the long-term survivorship of the implants before their wide-range clinical application. CONCLUSIONSSurface modification of Ti6Al4V with nano-texturing and silver nanoparticles resulted in strong antibacterial and modest antibiofilm effects.Thus, our results confirmed the technological potential of nano-texturing and silver nanoparticles for the improvement of antibacterial properties of implants.",

    "abstract": "The submitted case study concerns a 36-year-old patient with a ladder fall injury, who suffered a comminuted right pilon fracture type C3 according to the AO classification. The primary treatment consisted in fixing the fracture with an ankle spanning external fixation and subsequent internal osteosynthesis after the recovery of soft tissues. At four weeks, an infection with fistula developed on the anterior face of the distal tibia. The patient was repeatedly treated with excochleation of suspected focus of osteomyelitis, soft tissue drainage by VAC system, application of antibiotics based on the microbial agent susceptibility. Despite the aforementioned care, recurrent infection outbreaks occurred. Neither the CT scan, nor the scintigraphy revealed the focus of infection. Due to our concerns about the severe destruction also of the vital spongy osseous tissue caused by repeated non-targeted interventions in the medullar cavity, the cavity in the metaphysis of the distal tibia was subsequently treated by a less invasive endoscopic technique. The rigid arthroscope was inserted through a drilled hole in the cortical bone on the anterior face of pilon into the osteomyelitic cavity, from where purulent collection was drained. The cavity was filled with saline solution and the entire surface of the cavity was systematically treated with arthroscopic bone cutter into the depth when capillary bleeding appeared. Throughout the procedure the cavity was being rinsed with a large quantity of saline solution. The patient healed with a very good functional outcome.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYIn patients older than 40 years of age, treatment of chondral lesions of the knee employing microfractures does not provide satisfactory outcomes.One of the contributing factors may be the age-related lack of sufficient mesenchymal stromal cells able to efficiently migrate into the desired site of the lesion.Concomitant application of mononuclear cells (MNCs) or cultured mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from bone marrow and seeded on a 3D scaffold could provide an alternative enhancing therapeutic efficacy in these patients.The aim of our study was to assess two different sources of bone marrow for isolation of progenitor cells.To be specific, material obtained from proximal tibia and iliac crest (the commonly used bone marrow source) was compared in terms of quantity and quality of cells and their suitability for cellbased treatment of chondral lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODSBone marrow was collected during a total knee replacement surgery from the iliac crest and the proximal metaphysis of the tibia from ten volunteers older than 40 years of age, using aspiration biopsy needles.The MNCs from the obtained material were isolated, cultured and analyzed for their phenotypic features.Both sources were compared as to the yield and viability of MNCs and MSCs as well as the ability of MSCs of chondrogenic differentiation. RESULTSThe MNCs concentration/yield was significantly higher in samples from the iliac crests.Similar results were obtained with cultured MSCs after the first passage when the MSCs/MNCs ratio was compared.Nevertheless, the qualitative analysis that included MSCs immuno-phenotyping, viability and population doubling time showed no difference between the two tested bone marrow sources. DISCUSSIONParticularly in older patients, therapies of chondral defects employing bone marrow-stimulating techniques result in unsatisfactory outcomes.Therefore, orthopedic surgeons have turned their attention to cell-based treatments.Bone marrow located in pelvic bone and metaphysis of long bones (distal femur, proximal tibia) contains mononuclear cells that possess features of MSCs.In accordance with other authors, quantitative differences between the cells from two anatomical locations were found in our cohort of patients.Qualitatively, however, there was no significant variability observed.We also confirmed that the metaphysis of proximal tibia is a suitable source for cultured MSCs.Moreover, in contrast to several reports, the quality of these cells does not appear to decrease with the patients age. CONCLUSIONSThe iliac crest represents a superior bone marrow source for the MNCs and MSCs yield when compared with tibia.However, there was no qualitative difference between the isolated and cultured cells.The population doubling time analysis showed that the tibia is a good alternative source of MSCs which can be obtained at therapeutically relevant numbers for example for the treatment of chondral lesions of the knee.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The purpose of the study was to evaluate the injury-treatment time interval in a group of patients with limb bone fractures over the period of one year; and to compare this interval in the most frequent fractures of the upper and lower limb. MATERIAL AND METHODS The followed-up group of the prospective one-year monocentric study included 3,148 patients treated consecutively for 3,909 fractures. For the purpose of sub-analysis of the injury-treatment time interval in limb bone fractures, excluded from the group were the patients with multiple fractures (520 pts), patients with spinal fractures (356 pts) and pelvic fractures (210 pts). The statistical significance of the achieved results was tested with the use of contingency tables (chi-square test of independence). The significance level for the quantified tests was set at 5%. RESULTS The sub-analysis covered 1,727 patients whose medical records mentioned the exact time of injury and first examination. Within the first 6 hours after the injury, 536 (56.0%) patients with an upper limb bone fracture and 429 (55.7%) patients with a lower limb bone fracture were treated. Within 24 hours after the injury, 683 (71.4%) patients with an upper limb bone fracture and 572 (74.3%) patients with a lower limb bone fracture were treated. Within the first 24 hours after the injury, 104 (76.4%) patients with a proximal humerus fracture, 240 (84.5%) patients with a distal radius fracture and only 174 (55.5%) patients with metacarpal and phalanx fractures were treated. In the first hours after the injury, most frequently treated were the patients who sustained a distal radius fracture, and the longest injurytreatment time interval was seen in patients with hand bone fractures. The difference in the 24hour injury-treatment interval was significant when comparing distal radius fractures and proximal humerus fractures (p = 0.047) and when comparing distal radius fractures and hand bone fractures (p < 0.001). Within 24 hours after the injury, 166 (83.3%) patients with a proximal humerus fracture, 128 (79.1%) patients with an ankle fracture and 142 (63.4%) patients with metatarsal and phalanx fractures were treated. The shortest injury-treatment interval was reported in patients with a proximal femoral fracture and an ankle fracture, and relatively the lowest number of treated patients in the first hours after the injury was reported among patients with metatarsal and toe fractures. When evaluating the 24hour injury-treatment time interval, this difference was significant only when comparing proximal femoral fractures and metatarsal and phalanx fractures (p < 0.001), while when comparing proximal femoral fractures and ankle fractures the difference was not significant (p = 0.283). DISCUSSION There are not many studies of other authors focused on monitoring the injury-treatment time interval in the most frequent limb bone fractures. They also confirm that the treatment is sought out most quickly by patients with fractures that make walking or self-care impossible. CONCLUSIONS The results of the study confirmed that the fastest treatment was requested in patients with fractures which made the selfcare (distal radius) or walking (proximal femur, ankle) impossible; less painful fractures (metacarpal, phalanx fractures) and fractures that do not compromise walking (metatarsal fractures) were treated in the first 24 hours after the injury significantly less frequently. The patients with ankle fractures sought out treatment the most quickly compared to the patients with other fractures; it concerned largely occupational or sports injuries sustained by young men who were brought for treatment immediately after the injury, directly from their workplace or sports ground. The treatment of osteoporotic fractures (proximal humerus, distal radius, proximal femur) was spread over the first 6 hours due to the lack of independence of elderly patients after sustaining a fall at home; in majority of them transport to treatment was arranged for by relatives or neighbours only with a certain delay, once they became aware of their injury.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The number of patients with total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been growing. In addition to traumatic indication, the patients manifest abnormalities in kinematics and kinetics of gait preoperatively. The aim of the study was to assess kinematics of the pelvis and lower limbs during walking in patients with unilateral primary and revision THA. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 18 patients (10 females, 8 males) with primary THA (pTHA) as well as 18 patients (9 males, 9 females) with revision THA (rTHA) participated in the study. The control group (CON) comprised 19 healthy subjects (11 females, 8 males). Kinematic data were collected using the optoelectronic motion system Vicon MX. Kinematic parameters were obtained by means of 16 reflective markers placed on the patient's body in correspondence with the Plug-in Gait model. All the patients also underwent a clinical examination (evaluation of the surgery result, patient's satisfaction assessment, Harris score evaluation) and a specific X-ray evaluation of both hips. RESULTS The analysis brought the following results: - non-operated limb (NL) in pTHA vs. rTHA: significantly smaller total range of motion (ROM) in the hip joint (36.4° vs 41.7°) in the sagittal plane, - operated limb (OL) in pTHA vs. rTHA: significantly greater values of maximum knee flexion (14.2° vs. 9.8°) and extension (7.9° vs. 4.0°), - NL in pTHA vs. CON: significantly smaller ROM in the knee (51.0° vs. 57.9°) and hip (36.4° vs. 43.6°) joints in the sagittal plane, - OL in pTHA vs. CON: significantly smaller knee flexion (52.9° vs. 57.6°), hip extension (-0.6° vs. -10.4°), and the total ROM in the knee (51.5° vs. 57.9°) and hip (34.5° vs. 43.6°) joints in the sagittal plane, - NL in rTHA vs. CON: significantly greater pelvis ROM in both the sagittal (5.6° vs. 3.1°) and transverse (12.1° vs. 9.9°) planes, - OL in rTHA vs. CON: significantly smaller total ROM in the knee (48.9° vs. 57.9°) and hip (31.4° vs. 43.6°) joints in the sagittal plane. DISCUSSION After THA surgery, various gait pathologies as well as compensatory mechanisms can develop and chain; therefore, a complex approach to physical therapy in THA patients is needed. The number of significant differences found in kinematic parameters between pTHA and rTHA was low a year after the surgery. Compared to CON, both the THA groups exhibited similar mechanisms causing worsening their gait dynamics. CONCLUSIONS Gait in both the THA groups was characterized by a decreased ROM in the knee and hip joints in the sagittal plane, compensated by increased pelvic anteversion. Approximately one year after THA surgery, the NL is still noticeably dominant in gait. The changes in lower limb mechanics after revision THA persist even after a considerable time since the surgery.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Subacromial impingement is one of the most common reasons for shoulder pain. The surgical management of this condition has recently become the focus of criticism because of the rising number of surgical procedures and the lack of superiority of surgical over conservative treatment. In this prospective comparative study, we compared standardised conservative care with surgical treatment and placed special emphasis on the patients' ability to work. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 106 patients (25 women, 81 men; mean age: 45.4 12.3 years) were included in this prospective comparative clinical study. Patients in the non-operative arm (n = 42) received standardised physiotherapy. Patients in the surgical arm (n = 38) underwent arthroscopic subacromial decompression. All patients were followed up at 3, 6 and 12 months. Shoulder function (Constant score), pain (Numerical Rating Scale), and the duration of inability to work were assessed. RESULTS Shoulder function and pain improved significantly with both kinds of treatment. At no time of follow up we detected significant differences between the two treatment options. An analysis of the patients' ability to work showed that conservative treatment was superior to surgical treatment at 3-month follow-up (0.3 versus 5.0 weeks; p < 0.001) and between 4 and 6-month after intervention (0.2 versus 1.6 weeks; p = 0.032). DISCUSSION In the study presented here, significant improvements in function (Constant score) and pain (NRS) were achieved in both the non-operative and the surgical arm. There were no significant differences between the two groups at any time point. These results are similar to those reported by other authors in recent studies. Unlike other research work, however, our study demonstrated a major difference in the development and duration of inability to work. CONCLUSIONS Conservative and surgical treatment of subacromial impingement syndrome led to similar outcomes for shoulder pain and function at 3, 6 and 12 months after intervention. However, patients who were managed conservatively returned to work significantly earlier than patients who underwent surgery. Key words: subacromial impingement, shoulder, constant score, pain, ability to work.",

Their general data, surgical indices and incidence of postoperative adverse reactions were compared. Knee function indices were compared before and after treatment, and evaluated by random walk model. RESULTS No significant differences were found in the general data, intraoperative blood loss, preoperative Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Tegner score, knee range of motion and difference of bilateral tibial forward displacement distance, and total incidence rate of postoperative adverse reactions between the two groups (P>0.05). Group B had significantly longer operation time, and significantly shorter hospital stay, time of first ambulation after operation and bone healing time than group A (P<0.05). Both groups had improved Lysholm score, IKDC score, Tegner score and knee range of motion after treatment, especially in group B (P<0.05). The difference of bilateral tibial forward displacement distance significantly reduced in both groups after treatment, particularly in group B (P<0.05). The random walk model revealed that group B had better improvement of knee function than group A.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The intertrochanteric femur fractures seen in the elderly population are usually treated surgically. Mechanical failure of this treatment is a serious complication and to prevent this, many assessment factors have been described such as tip-apex distance, reduction quality etc. The aim of this study is to evaluate the intra- and inter-observer reliability of modifiable factors evaluated after the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures. MATERIAL AND METHODS The early post-operative radiographs of sixty-two patients treated with PFN-A were evaluated. Six observers with 8 to 27 years of experience in hip trauma surgery were asked to measure tip apex distance (TAD), calcar referenced TAD (calTAD), collo-diaphyseal angle (CDA) and evaluate the position of helical blade and also fracture reductions according to Baumgaertner and Chang criteria on these radiographs. Fleiss kappa and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) values were calculated for inter-observer and intra-observer reliability assessment, respectively. RESULTS Inter-observer reliability values for both evaluations were moderate (fleiss κ: 0.417-0.455) for TAD measurements, moderate (fleiss κ: 0.418-0.458) for calTAD measurements, fair (fleiss κ: 0.302-0.288) for CDA measurements, substantial (fleiss κ: 0.606-0.631) for antero-posterior zone evaluation, moderate (fleiss κ: 0.550-0.546) for lateral zone assessment, fair-moderate (fleiss κ: 0.353-0.453) for Baumgaertner reduction quality assessment, and fair-moderate (fleiss κ: 0.365- 0.456) for Chang reduction quality assessment. Intra-observer reliabilities were found to be moderate to good for TAD and calTAD measurements, moderate for CDA measurements, good to excellent for AP and lateral zone and Baumgaertner reduction quality criteria assessments and good for Chang reduction quality criteria assessment. DISCUSSION There is no large data on the subject of the present study in the literature. There is a single article evaluating the reliability of more than one evaluation criteria in which only two observers' findings were evaluated in the literature. As in our study, more accurate inferences can be made with the increase in the number of observers. Unlike the literature, the inter-observer reliabilities of TAD and calTAD which have a very important place in the postoperative evaluation of these fractures were found as \"moderate'' instead of \"excellent'' in our study, CONCLUSIONS It was determined that only the inter-observer reliability of antero-posterior zone evaluation was substantial. The inter-observer reliability of all other measurements and evaluations were fair to moderate. Key words: Intertrochanteric fractures, reliability, measurements, reduction quality; TAD, calTAD.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The study analyses a cohort of patients with surgically treated ankle fractures who developed complete distal tibiofibular synostoses. It focuses on their occurrence and association with the extent of tibiotalar dislocation of the ankle joint on the trauma X-ray and its relation to the choice of surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS The cohort of a total of 824 patients with type B and C fractures according to Weber classification was followed up for 9 years. The cohort consisted of 403 (48.9%) men and 421 (51.1%) women. The exclusion criteria included associated talus fractures, calcaneus fractures and fractures of the other bones of the foot. The studied data were obtained retrospectively from medical documentation and by evaluation of trauma X-rays and X-rays obtained during the postoperative checks. The ankle fractures were classified based on the Weber classification and the basic epidemiologic data (age and gender), type of fracture and extent of tibiotalar dislocation of ankle fractures on the trauma X-ray were evaluated. Posttraumatic ankle dislocation was divided into tibiotalar dislocation > 10 mm, tibiotalar dislocation < 10 mm and the group with regular ankle joint. When evaluating the treatment method, the cohort was divided into three groups: Group 1 with one-stage osteosynthesis, Group 2 with temporary K-wire transfixation or external fixation and subsequent secondary conversion to internal osteosynthesis, and Group 3 with definitive transfixation or external fixation of the ankle. The results were statistically evaluated using the Pearson s chi-square test, or the Fisher s exact test for low frequencies. A multivariant logistic regression model was created to identify statistically significant factors contributing to the development of synostosis. The results with the p-value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS In the whole cohort, the synostosis of distal tibiofibular joint was observed in a total of 131 (15.9%) patients. In men it was in 85 (21.1%) cases and in women in 46 (10.9%) cases, which was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). There was a statistically significant difference (p = 0.0020) between the mean age in the group of patients with synostosis (54.4 years) and the mean age in the group of patients without synostosis (49.1 years). Complete distal tibiofibular synostoses were found in 78 (12.7%) fractures classified as type B according to the Weber classification and in 53 (25.5%) type C fractures. When taking into account the gender, synostoses occurred more frequently in men in both types of fractures classified based on the Weber classification, only in type C fractures no statistical significance was established (p = 0.3026). Various size of posttraumatic tibiotalar dislocation was present in both types of fractures. The group with less severe type B ankle fractures showed a statistically significant dominance of synostosis development in cases with large tibiotalar dislocation of more than 10 mm (p<0.0001). In the group with type C fractures different results were obtained. The highest frequency of cases with synostosis was reported in the group with dislocation smaller than 10 mm (p = 0.0698). In the entire cohort, 615 (74.6%) one-stage osteosyntheses were performed and synostoses developed in 77 (12.5%) cases. In 165 (20.0%) patients, transfixation with K-wires or external fixation with subsequent conversion to secondary osteosynthesis were used and synostoses were identified in 50 (30.3%) cases (p < 0.0001). The open fractures showed an insignificantly smaller number of synostoses than the closed fractures (p = 0.5902). DISCUSSION Posttraumatic distal tibiofibular synostoses have varied morphology. A number of studies confirmed that they do not affect much the functional status of the ankle, even despite their extensive finding in the area of syndesmosis is evident on the Xray. Etiologically, a certain role in their development is reported to be played by posttraumatic hematoma in case of damage to deep soft and bony structures of the ankle. CONCLUSIONS A higher occurrence of synostoses was observed in male population, older age patients and also in type C fractures according to the Weber classification. Larger tibiotalar dislocation showed statistical significance in the development of synostoses in type B fractures according to the Weber classification, whereas in type C fractures it was not the main factor contributing to the development of synostosis. In cases where one-staged osteosynthesis was performed, the occurrence of synostoses was statistically significantly lower than in secondary osteosynthesis after temporary stabilisation.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Laboratory methods are central to prosthetic joint infection (PJI) diagnosis. Most research teams focus on detection of specific inflammatory markers, causative pathogens, or on assessment of the tissue response. This study sought to determine the optimal cut-off values and diagnostic performance of selected synovial markers in relation to the diagnosis of hip or knee PJI. The studied markers were synovial level of glucose, lactate, coefficient of energy balance (CEB) and NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin). MATERIAL AND METHODS This prospective study includes 89 patients who underwent revision total knee or hip arthroplasty for septic or aseptic reasons in the period from 2014 to 2017. Among these 89 patients, there are 2 cases of prosthetic hip infection, 22 cases of prosthetic knee infection, 31 aseptic revision total hip arthroplasties and 34 aseptic revision total knee arthroplasties. The diagnostic characteristics of the studied methods were set in relation to the reference standard, the 2013 MSIS (Musculoskeletal Infection Society) criteria. The cut-off values were calculated using the ROC (receiver operating characteristic curve) analysis. RESULTS The synovial glucose test is considered positive if the glucose level drops below 2.65 mmol/L. The area under the curve is 0.813, sensitivity 75.0%, specificity 83.1%. The synovial lactate test is considered positive if lactate level rises above 8.87 mmol/L. The area under the curve is 0.882, sensitivity 70.8%, specificity 95.4%. Synovial NGAL is considered positive if its level exceeds 998 μg/L. The area under the curve is 1.000, sensitivity 100.0%, specificity 100.0%. CEB is considered positive if its value is lower than +4.665. The area under the curve is 0.883, sensitivity 91.7% and specificity 69.8%. Combining of these tests with other synovial markers does not improve the diagnostic performance of the studied tests. CONCLUSIONS The glucose and lactate levels and CEB undoubtedly reflect the presence of an inflammatory process in a prosthetic joint. However, the diagnostic characteristics of these tests are not better than those of other modern diagnostic techniques. As opposed to these tests, synovial NGAL shows excellent diagnostic performance. Nonetheless, the potential of this method shall be verified on larger cohorts of patients.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Radiographs are preferred for understanding the deformity and containment in Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease (LCPD), as well as for treatment planning, but plain radiographs provide only static information and are inadequate for dynamic assessment of the joint. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to be superior to other diagnostic modalities. The aim of this study was to determine the importance of hip MRI in LCPD treatment decision-making processes between pediatric orthopedic surgeons and orthopedic surgery residents. MATERIAL AND METHODS Eight orthopedic surgery residents and eight pediatric orthopedic surgeons were invited to retrospectively evaluate hip radiography images and MRI sections of 34 patients with LCPD. The treatment choices were divided into two groups as conservative and surgical. Gwet's AC1 analysis was used to establish the relative level of intra-observer agreements. The correlation between the professional experience and the agreement parameters was also evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient. ANOVA was used to compare multiple groups. p ≤ 0.05 was statistically significant. RESULTS For both groups most preferred treatment method was conservative approaches based on plain radiography and MRI. The resident group showed a significant shift from conservative treatment to surgical treatment choices after MRI evaluation. The difference between the frequencies of each treatment choice for pediatric orthopedic surgeons was not statistically significant among different imaging modalities, but a comparison of the changes in surgical treatment revealed a significant difference between the imaging modalities, with a trend towards more complicated treatment choices. DISCUSSION Conservative methods were the most preferred treatment choice in the study, as it is common. It was observed that treatment choices changed when patients were evaluated together with MRI. Compared to plain radiographs, MRI provides sufficient and particular information for evaluating the structures of the hip joint components. CONCLUSIONS We found that consideration of MRI data in LCPD patients changed treatment recommendations substantially towards more complicated surgical procedures. We consider this to be an 'MRI effect' where using a more complex imaging modality leads surgeons to more complicated treatment modalities in LCPD.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY It was a prospective, randomised, unblinded study. Effects of the application of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) on the anatomic anterior ligament reconstruction were examined. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 40 patients who underwent a surgery between 2012 and 2014 were enrolled in the study. The patients were randomised into two groups: the group with PRF application (n=20) and the group without PRF application (n=20, control group). The study included 11 women and 29 men, with the mean age at the time of inclusion into the study 29.1 years. Vivostat ® PRF was obtained perioperatively from the patient s blood and applied intraoperatively to the hamstring tendon graft. The ACL graft healing was assessed through magnetic resonance (MRI) at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. The clinical outcomes (the Lysholm score and the IKDC Subjective score, return to pre-injury sport levels, Pivot-shift test, graft failure) as well as standardised laxity measurements using GenouRob arthrometer were performed preoperatively and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS The study was completed by thirty-three (33) patients (17 in the PRF group and 16 in the control group). In two cases, postoperative graft failure was reported (both cases in the control group). No significant differences were found in the process of graft ligamentization evaluated through MRI (p=0.07). No significant difference between the groups was identified with respect to return to pre-injury sport levels (p=0.232), or the Lysholm score and IKDC Subjective score (p=0.259, and p=0.364 respectively). The postoperative knee laxity measurement using Genourob arthrometer did not reveal any significant differences between the PRF group and the control group. DISCUSSION Results similar to those arrived at by our study have recently been published also by other authors worldwide. We can therefore assume that the application of PRF can be of benefit, especially at the early stage of healing. The results still need to be verified on a larger study group, the study design should focus on the development in the early postoperative period. CONCLUSIONS In our study group, no significant difference was observed in the evaluated subjective and objective clinical parameters. Only the parameter regarding the ACL graft failure fell just short of statistical significance, namely to the disadvantage of the group without the PRF application.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Minimal and limited access techniques are gaining increasing interest for the treatment of displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures. The ideal treatment method is however still debated and largely based on individual case factors and surgeon experience. Aim of this study was thus to compare the treatment characteristics and radiographic correction potential of a locking nail system with a sinus tarsi approach to plate fixation via an extended lateral approach. MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 39 cases of patients with calcaneal fractures that received primary fracture treatment for displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures between July 2017 and March 2020. Patient characteristics, time to surgery, time to discharge, OR time and the correction achieved were analyzed and comparative statistics performed. RESULTS In total 19 patients treated with the locking nail and 20 patients treated with plate fixation were analyzed. Patient age and fracture severity according to the Sanders classification were comparable between the groups. Overall surgical time, as well as the achieved reduction was equal between both groups. Time to surgery, as well as time from surgery to discharge was significantly shorter in the locking nail group. 2 additional soft tissue procedures were necessary in the extended lateral approach group. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The results with the locking calcaneus nail and sinus tarsi approach suggest, that similar treatment results can be achieved as with plate osteosynthesis and an extended lateral approach. Soft tissue management, as well as pre- and postoperative timing and discharge management can be improved with the nail. Further controlled trials comparing the longterm outcome between the treatment options are needed. Key words: calcaneus fracture, sinus tarsi approach, calcaneal nail, C-Nail.",

MATERIAL AnD METHODSThe study comprised 564 children, 321 (57%) boys and 243 (43%) girls, who were allocated to two groups according to the method of primary treatment.The average age at the time of injury was 6.8 years (range, 1 to 16).In group 1, all 499 patients were indicated for primary closed reduction and percutaneous osteosynthesis with crossed K-wires under general anaesthesia.In group 2, all 65 patients underwent closed reduction under general anaesthesia and immobilisation in a high plaster cast.The per cent failure of primary treatment requiring either repeat surgery or a change in treatment strategy was evaluated.The duration of follow-up ranged from 14 to 150 months. RESULTSOpen fractures were recorded in eight (1.4%) patients.Twenty-five (4.4%) children had further injury to the ipsilateral limb.Three (0.5%) patients underwent open reduction because it was not possible to achieve adequate reduction by the closed method.In group 1, percutaneous osteosynthesis was performed using two crossed K-wires in 484, three K-wires in 13 and four K-wires in two patients.Re-displacement of fracture fragments requiring repeat reduction and percutaneous osteosynthesis occurred in 10 (2%) patients.One patient had two re-operations.In group 2, the primary treatment failed in 13 (20%) children who needed repeat reduction and conversion to percutaneous osteosynthesis.The difference in the occurrence of failure between the two groups was significant (p<0.001).nerve injury was recorded in 92 patients (16.3% of all children and 18% of those treated with percutaneous osteosynthesis).neurosurgical intervention was necessary for injury to the ulnar nerve in five patients and to the radial nerve in one patient.Three children had vascular injury requiring vascular surgery.Two patients underwent corrective osteotomy of the distal humerus for cubitus varus deformity.volkmann's contracture as a complication was not recorded. DISCUSSIOnMinimally displaced fractures can be treated by closed reduction and plaster cast immobilisation but this method fails in up to 20% of cases.A poor result is related to the extent of dorsal displacement before reduction; on the other hand, degrees of flexion in a plaster cast have no effect.The most frequent technical errors resulting in re-displacement after primary osteosynthesis include incomplete reduction and primary fixation in displacement, or failure of both K-wires to pass through the opposite cortex or to fix both fragments firmly.A K-wire diameter smaller than 1.6 mm may also be a reason for failure.The main problem of the method of two crossed K-wires is a frequent injury to the ulnar nerve. COnCLUSIOnSSupracondylar humerus fracture is, regardless of advancements in therapy, an injury with an uncertain treatment outcome and a high percentage of complications.Since primary osteosynthesis failed in 20% of the patients treated by simple reduction under general anaesthesia and plaster cast immobilisation, for the patients requiring fracture reduction under general anaesthesia, the authors recommend one-stage primary treatment including K-wire transfixation.Re-displacement after primary osteosynthesis was always due to a technical error during the surgical procedure and can, therefore, be avoided by a precise operative technique.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS This study was a cross-sectional study. The study sample consisted of 71 elderly patients aged more than 65 years undergoing hip fracture surgery. A questionnaire, the Tinetti balance test and the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) were used. RESULTS The analyses included 71 elderly patients with a mean age of 78.45 years. All patients had been hospitalized for hip fracture due to falling, and 29.6% had a history of falling in the one year prior to hospitalization. The mean MMSE score was 18.37 ± 6.54 and the mean Tinetti score was 11.10 ± 6.66. CONCLUSION We found that as the mean age of the elderly patients increased, the risk of falling also increased and the MMSE scores deteriorate and that the elderly patients living alone were at a greater risk of falling and had worse cognitive function, that those with a history of falling before hospitalization were at a greater risk of falling again and that the risk of falling increased as cognitive function declined.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The aim of the experiment was to compare the bending stiffness of an intact odontoid process with bending stiffness after its simulated type II fracture was fixed with a single lag screw. The experiment was done with a desire to answer the question of whether a single osteosynthetic screw is sufficient for good fixation of a type II odontoid fracture. MATERIAL AND METHODS The C2 vertebrae of six cadavers were used. With simultaneous measurement of odontoid bending stiffness, the occurrence of a fracture (type IIA, Grauer's modification of the Anderson- D'Alonzo classification) was simulated using action exerted by a tearing machine in the direction perpendicular to the odontoid axis. Each odontoid fracture was subsequently treated by direct osteosynthesis with a single lag screw inserted in the axial direction by a standard surgical procedure in order to provide conditions similar to those achieved by routine surgical management. The treated odontoid process was subsequently subjected to the same tearing machine loading as applied to it at the start of the experiment. The bending stiffness measured was then compared with that found before the fracture occurred. The results were statistically evaluated by the t-test for paired samples at the level of significance α = 0.05. RESULTS The average value of bending stiffness for odontoid processes of intact vertebrae at the moment of fracture occurrence was 318.3 N/mm. After single axial lag screw fixation of the fracture, the average bending stiffness for the odontoid processes treated was 331.3 N/mm. DISCUSSION Higher values of bending stiffness after screw fixation were found in all specimens and, in comparison with the values recorded before simulated fractures, the increase was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS The results of our measurements suggest that the single lag screw fixation of a type IIA odontoid fracture will provide better stability for the fracture fragment-C2 body complex on antero-posterior perpendicular loading than can be found in intact C2 vertebrae.

MATERIAL AND METHODSIn the study, 768 standardised radiographs of feet of the Caucasian population, taken between 2006 and 2012 in the Vamed Mediterra hospital (Mostiště, Czech Republic), were investigated.The median age of the patients was 42 years, the range 18-75 years.The presence of an os peroneum was assessed and metatarsal length was measured by a modified method of Maestro. RESULTSThe os peroneum was identified in 106 subjects (13.8%).Among the groups established according to the presence of os peroneum and its relation to the length of a metatarsal bone, the relationship with the first metatarsal (1+) was most frequent; it was seven-fold higher compared to the other variants.On the contrary, the variant 3+ was least frequent in the presence of the os peroneum. CONCLUSIONSThe study presents a statistically significant relationship between the presence of the os peroneum and the length of the first metatarsal bone.Potentially, this is one of the causes of forefoot pain in relation to the os peroneum development and anatomical connections in this area.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYIn a long-term perspective, it is better to remove implants after fracture healing.However, subsequent full or excessive loading of an extremity may result in refracture, and the bone with holes after screw removal may present a site with predilection for this.The aim of the study was to find ways of how to decrease risk factors for refracture in such a case.This involved support to the mechanical properties of a bone during its remodelling until defects following implant removal are repaired, using a material tolerated by bone tissue and easy to apply.It also included an assessment of the mechanical properties of a bone after filling the holes in it with a newly developed biodegradable polymer-composite gel (\"bone paste\").The composite also has a prospect of being used to repair bony defects produced by pathological processes. MATERIAL AND METHODSExperiments were carried out on intact weight-bearing small bones in dogs.A total of 27 specimens of metacarpal/metatarsal bones were used for ex vivo testing.They were divided into three groups: K1 (n = 9) control undamaged bones; K2 (n = 9) control bones with iatrogenic damage simulating holes left after cortical screw removal; EXP (n = 9) experimental specimens in which simulated holes in bone were filled with the biodegradable self-hardening composite.The bone specimens were subjected to three-point bending in the caudocranial direction by a force acting parallel to the direction of drilling in their middiaphyses.The value of maximum load achieved (N) and the corresponding value of a vertical displacement (mm) were recorded in each specimen, then compared and statistically evaluated. RESULTSOn application of a maximum load (N), all bone specimens broke in the mid-part of their diaphyses.In group K1 the average maximum force of 595.6 ± 79.5 N was needed to break the bone; in group K2 it was 347.6 ± 58.6 N; and in group EXP it was 458.3 ± 102.7 N. The groups with damaged bones, K2 and EXP, were compared and the difference was found to be statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05). CONCLUSIONSThe recently developed biodegradable polymer-composite gel is easy and quick to apply to any defect, regardless of its shape, in bone tissue.The ex vivo mechanical tests on canine short bones showed that the composite applied to defects, which simulated holes left after screw removal, provided sufficient mechanical support to the bone architecture.The results of measuring maximum loading forces were statistically significant.However, before the composite could be recommended for use in veterinary or human medical practice, thorough pre-clinical studies will be required.",

    "abstract": "Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAI) represents a mechanical conflict between acetabulum and proximal part of the femur. This disorder may gradually result in the development of the hip osteoarthritis. FAI may be caused by an acetabular retroversion, rarely by coxa profunda or by asphericity of the femoral head and missing femoral head-neck offset respectively. However, a combination of both conditions is the most frequent. Before FAI treatment was adopted as a standard technique for hip preservation at our department, detailed cadaver studies of the vascular anatomy of the hip were performed and the relevant literature was reviewed. The aim of this study was to assess the efficiency of hip preserving surgery in relation to the technique used. We hypothesized that surgical intervention helped to alleviate pain and improve hip function.In the period from October 11, 2005 to June 30, 2012, a total of 168 patients (190 hips) had surgery for FAI. After we met exclusion criteria, 83 hips were treated by surgical hip dislocation (SHD) and 17 undergoing anterior minimally invasive surgery (AMIS). The minimum follow-up was 12 months, with an average of 3 years and 4 months, and a range of 12 months to 7 years and 8 months. The subjective evaluation by the patients and the functional hip assessment were based on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and the non-Arthritic Hip Score (nAHS) questionnaires. To assess the efficiency of the techniques, the pre- and post-operative scores were compared in each group (SHD group, n=83; AMIS group, n=17). A comparison of pre- and post-operative data was also made for the groups joined together to evaluate the benefit of surgery as such in FAI treatment. The results were statistically analysed using the Wilcoxon test for paired samples; the level of significance was set at 0.05.There was a statistically significant increase in the scores obtained after surgery, as compared with the pre-operative data, in the SHD and AMIS groups and in all patients evaluated together. Hip survival without the necessity of conversion to total hip replacement was 96.4% (80/83 hips) in the SHD group and 94.1% (16/17 hips) in the AMIS group. no serious complications were recorded. DISCUSSIOn The rate of failure in the surgical treatment of FAI syndrome in our patients was in accordance with the literature data, as was the number of the patients requiring conversion to total hip replacement. Also the other results were comparable with those of relevant studies.Hip preservation surgery is an issue which has slowly been gaining consensus although opinions on it, including FAI surgical treatment, still vary. As FAI syndrome is a condition leading to degenerative changes in the hip, it is important to pay attention to a thorough diagnostic evaluation and a correct, though often long-term, therapy.",

The average age at the time of surgery was 9 years and 2 months. The diagnosis was based on the patient's history of complaints, physical examination, X-rays of the knee joint taken in two planes, and ultrasonographic and magnetic resonance imaging of the knee. Arthroscopic verification of the diagnosis was done in all patients. They all had fibular discoid meniscus classified as type 1 in six and type 2 in nine patients according to the Watanabe classification system. Type 3 (Wrisberg variant) discoid meniscus was not recorded in this group. In six (40%) patients, the discoid meniscus had a tear in it. The patients were followed up on average for 8 years and 4 months. In addition to subjective evaluation by patients, the treatment outcome was assessed using the Ikeuchi and Lysholm scoring systems.Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy was performed in 10 patients. In five patients conversion to open surgery was necessary and partial or subtotal fibular meniscectomy was carried out by minimally invasive arthrotomy from the lateral approach. Total meniscectomy was not required in any of our patients. The average value for treatment evaluation by the patients was 2.25 on a 1-to-5 scale. The average Lysholm pre-operative score of 80.8 points increased to 95.4 points after surgery. The long-term results assessed by the Ikeuchi system were excellent in nine, good in four and satisfactory in two patients. None of the patients showed poor results and no intraoperative or post-operative complications were recorded.Discoid meniscus is a painful condition affecting the knee, particularly when a tear is also present. Meniscal lesions are found intra-operatively in many symptomatic patients. The majority of international authors prefer arthroscopic management of discoid meniscus. The team of our department also support this procedure unanimously. Arthroscopy is used as the primary method with the aim of preserving the largest possible margin of the meniscus. Some literature data suggest that there are no statistically significant differences between an open and an arthroscopic procedure. Accordingly, in our patients no differences in the evaluation of treatment results were recorded. However, the advantages of minimally invasive arthroscopy for the management for discoid meniscus are beyond any doubt.The long-term results of discoid meniscus management reported in the international literature are very good. The results of long-term follow-up in our group give support to active surgical treatment. We take care to avoid total meniscectomy which often results in early development of secondary gonarthrosis.",

METHODSIn this study, we investigated mRnA expression of TLR-1,-2,-4 and cytokines/receptors (IL-2,-2R,-10,-10R, TGFb1) in pseudosynovial tissue obtained from 55 patients with aseptically failed THAs/TKAs and 37 control patients with hip/knee primary osteoarthritis (OA) using quantitative RT-PCR.Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the corresponding proteins.non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were used to determine differences between the patient groups. RESULTSWhen comparing expression profiles between patients with aseptically failed THA and TKA, higher amounts of TLR-1,-2,-4 and IL-2R mRnA transcripts were detected in THA patients.The mRnA expression of studied molecules (TLR-1,-2,-4, IL-2, IL-10, IL-2R, IL-10R, TGFb1) did not differ between THA and OA hip tissues.Lower mRnA expression of TLR-1,-2,-4, IL-10, and IL-10R was detected in TKA when compared to control knee OA.Similar mRnA profiles of IL-2, IL-2R, and TGFb1 were observed in TKA and knee OA.Using immunohistochemistry, we detected low expression of TLR-1 protein in failed THA/TKA, whereas TLR-2 protein levels were higher in TKA/THA patients than in OA controls.High individual variability in TLR-4 protein levels was detected among patients with aseptically loosened THA and TKA.IL-10 protein levels were similar in THA and TKA patient subgroups and control subjects, whereas IL-10R protein level was higher in failed TKAs and OA controls than in THAs.no difference in IL-2 protein levels was detected between patients with THA/TKA and those with OA. DISCUSSIOnOur data indicate close similarity between the expression patterns in aseptically failed THA and TKA.However, certain differences were observed which also suggest unique pathways associated with the end-stage of aseptic loosening in THA and TKA.For instance, differences in the size, shape and load of polyethylene particles between THA and TKA could play some role.The composition of THA and TKA and differences in terms of mechanical forces might also be involved. COnCLUSIOnSThis is the first study comparing the gene expression profile of a particular set of innate immunity regulatory molecules between tissues from aseptically failed THA and TKA.Low expression of TLR-1,-2,-4 and cytokines/receptors (IL-2, IL-2R, IL-10, IL-10R, and TGFb1) was observed in pseudosynovial tissues obtained from aseptically failed THAs and TKAs.Higher amount of TLR transcripts was detected in THA as compared to TKA.These findings indicate certain differences in the mechanism of aseptic loosening occurring at the site of THA and TKA.Further research is warranted.",

We used a two-stage surgical technique, with lengthening of the dorsiflexor muscles of the leg and the tibialis anterior muscle at the first stage. This was followed by cast fixation with the ankle in plantar flexion for 6 weeks. At the second stage, through a Cincinnati approach, the talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints were reduced and the Achilles tendon and peroneal tendons were elongated. Two patients underwent the Grice extra-articular subtalar arthrodesis at the third stage. The post-operative outcomes were assessed based on radiographic findings of dorsoplantar views of the talocalcaneal angle (TC AP) and talar axis-first metatarsal base angle (TAMBA AP), lateral views of the weight-bearing talocalcaneal angle (TC LAT), talar axis-first metatarsal base angle (TAMBA LAT) and talotibial angle (TT). In all patients but one who was lost to follow-up, the radiographic and objective findings were evaluated with the 10-point scale described by Adelaar et al.The average follow-up was 8 years and 9 months. All radiographic findings showed improvement in all angles measured. The pre-operative values decreased in TC AP from 64.2° to 27.6°; in TC LAT from 48.8° to 30.4°; in TT from 158° to 109.3°; in TAMBA AP from 54.7° to 17.4°; in TAMBA LAT from 57.3° to 5.7°. The Adelaar scoring system was employed in seven patients of whom three had excellent, three good and one fair results. Two patients required additional surgery due to recurrence of the deformityStudies in recent years have shown a gradual diversion from extensive surgical procedures and a trend toward techniques like manipulation, serial casting application and minimal surgical intervention with talonavicular reduction and fixation. The Dobbs technique has so far shown good results but no long-term results have yet been available and therefore the number of recurrent cases is not known.The two-stage surgical technique used in our department proved to be very successful in a long-term follow-up, but the group of patients was too small to provide conclusive evidence. However, benefits of this technique are clearly apparent from the post-operative radiographic and objective findings assessed as very good.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSOf the patients with knee arthritis who were eligible for joint replacement, 23 were randomly selected and included in this study.There were 11 men and 12 women, with 11 right and 12 left knee joints.On the basis of pre-operative CT scans, PSI custom-made pin guides, which conformed to the individual patient's anatomy, were produced and then used in the THA surgery involving a NexGen (CR) system.All patients were examined before surgery and at 1 year after THA.The evaluation at a follow-up visit included standing full-length radiographs (antero-posterior and lateral), Knee Score results, range of motion (ROM), patient's satisfaction report, and post-operative complications.The X-ray views were examined for mechanical leg axis alignment, TKA alignment in antero-posterior and lateral projection and signs of potential loosening. RESULTSAt 1 post-operative year, the average Knee Society Score (KSS) was 85.5 points and the average functional score was 82.6 point.The satisfaction rate was 94% and, on a school rating system, the average mark was 1.3.The average postoperative ROM value was 116°.All patients were willing to undergo the surgery again.The only complication was thrombosis in one patient.Radiographic findings of knee alignment were optimal in 18, correct (up to 3° deviation) in three and incorrect (above 3° deviation) in two patients.Radiographic signs of loosening were not recorded. DISCUSSIONCorrect knee alignment is one of the requirements for achieving a good TKA outcome.Various techniques are used to improve the total knee process (computer-aided surgery, customised guides).Zimmer Patient Specific Instruments provide advanced pre-operative planning and more accurate implant sizing and alignment.An experienced surgeon can achieve the same good results with conventional planning under standard conditions but the use of PSIs is clearly more beneficial in patients with extra-articular deformities and in patients in whom femoral intramedullary guides cannot be employed.To produce a custom-made pin guide requires a CT scan of the whole leg and is also associated with additional paperwork.The PSIs simplify the total knee process from start to finish and surgeons have complete flexibility to make fine-tuning adjustments during the procedure. CONCLUSIONSZimmer Patient Specific Instruments allow for exact alignment of both the femoral and the tibial component in a TKA process.Under standard circumstances, clinical and radiographic outcomes are comparable with those of conventional planning.However, the use of PSIs is clearly more beneficial in patients with extra-articular deformities and in patients in whom femoral intramedullary guides cannot be employed.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Scapholunate interosseous ligament (SLIOL) tears with accompanying extrinsic ligament rupture have been associated with scapholunate (SL) instability. SLIOL partial tears were examined in terms of tear localization, grade and accompanying extrinsic ligament injury. Conservative treatment responses were scrutinized according to injury types. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients with SLIOL tear without dissociation were evaluated retrospectively. Magnetic resonance (MR) images were reexamined in terms of tear localization (volar, dorsal or combined volar and dorsal tears), grade of injury (partial or complete) and extrinsic ligament injury accompaniment (RSC, LRL, STT, DRC, DIC). Injury associations were examined with MR imaging. All patients treated conservatively were recalled at their first year for re-evaluation. Conservative treatment responses were analyzed according to pre- and post-treatment first year visual analog scale for pain (VAS), disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand questionnaire (DASH) and Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) scores. RESULTS In our cohort, 79% (n: 82/104) of patients had SLIOL tear and 44% (n: 36) of them had accompanying extrinsic ligament injury. The majority of SLIOL tears and all extrinsic ligament injuries were partial tears. In SLIOL injuries, volar SLIOL was most commonly damaged portion (45%, n: 37). DIC (n: 17) and LRL (n: 13) were most frequently torn ligaments, radiolunotriquetral (LRL) injury generally co-existed with volar tears and dorsal intercarpal ligament (DIC) with dorsal tears regardless of injury time. Extrinsic ligament injury accompaniment was associated with higher pre-treatment VAS, DASH and PRWE scores than isolated SLIOL tears. Injury grade, location and extrinsic ligament accompaniment had no significant effect on treatment responses. Test scores reversal was better in acute injuries. CONCLUSIONS On imaging SLIOL injuries, attention should be paid to the integrity of secondary stabilizers. In partial SLIOL injuries, pain reduction and functional recovery can be achieved with conservative treatment. Conservative approach can be the initial treatment option in partial injuries especially in acute cases regardless of tear localization and injury grade if secondary stabilizers are intact.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY To compare the treatment outcome of scaphoid facture fixation with one versus two Herbert screws (HBS). MATERIAL AND METHODS 72 patients underwent open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) following acute scaphoid fracture, and were followed prospectively by one surgeon. All fractures were Herbert & Fisher classification type B, the most common fracture lines being oblique (n=38) and transverse (n=34). Fractures with similar fracture lines were randomly assigned into two groups; fractures stabilized with one HBS (n=42) and fractures stabilized with two HBS (n=30). A specific methodology was developed for placement of two HBS; in the case of transverse fractures, screws were introduced perpendicular to the fracture line, for oblique fractures the first screw was placed perpendicular to the fracture line and the second screw was placed along the longitudinal axis of the scaphoid. RESULTS Patients were followed for a total 24 months, no patients were lost to follow-up. Outcome measures included bone healing, duration to bone healing, carpal geometry, range of motion (ROM), grip strength, and the Mayo Wrist Score. Patient rated outcomes were measured using DASH. Bone healing was radiographically and clinically confirmed in 70 patients. There were two non-unions after fixation with one HBS. Radiographic angles in both groups did not differ significantly from the physiological values. The mean duration to bone union was 1.8 months for one HBS and 1.5 months for two HBS. Mean grip strength was 47 kg in the group with one HBS (16-70 kg), 94 % of the unaffected hand, and 49 kg in the group with two HBS, 97% unaffected hand. The average Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score for the group with one HBS was 2.5, while for the group with two HBS was 2.0. Both groups had excellent and good results. For the group with two HBS, they are more. (100% for those fixed with two HBS and for those fixed with one HBS = 95% excellent and good and 5% bad results). DISCUSSION A review of the literature confirms that the addition of the second screw increases the stability in the scaphoid fractures by offering added resistance to torque forces. Most authors propose the parallel placing of both screws in all cases. In our study we offer an algorithm for the placement of screws depending of the type of fracture line. For transverse fractures screws are placed parallel and perpendicular to the fracture line, for oblique fractures the first screw is placed perpendicular to the fracture line, and the second screw is placed along the longitudinal axis of the scaphoid. This algorithm covers the main laboratory requirements for maximal fracture compression depending of the fracture line. CONCLUSIONS This study of 72 patients in whom patients with similar fracture geometry were separated into two groups fixed by one HBS and fixed by two HBS. Analysis of the results demonstrate that osteosynthesis with two HBS creates greater fracture stability. The proposed algorithm for fixation of acute scaphoid fractures using two HBS is achieved by simultaneously placing the screw along the axial axis and perpendicular to the fracture line. The stability is improved by the equal distribution of the compression force on the entire fracture surface. Key words: scaphoid fractures, Herbert screw, two screws fixation.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Increased tibial slope facilitates anterior translation of tibia relative to the femur, thereby increasing the load on both the native and replaced anterior cruciate ligament. This study aims to retrospectively review the posterior tibial slope in a cohort of our patients after the ACL reconstruction and revision ACL reconstruction. Based on the results obtained by measurements, we aimed to confirm or disprove the claim that the increased posterior tibial slope is one of the risk factors of the ACL reconstruction failure. Another aim of the study was to assess whether there are any correlations between the posterior tibial slope and basic somatic parameters (height, weight, BMI) or the patient s age. MATERIAL AND METHODS The posterior tibial slope was measured retrospectively on lateral X-rays of 375 patients. There were 83 revision reconstructions and 292 primary reconstructions performed. The patient s age at the time of injury, height and weight were recorded and the BMI was calculated. The findings were then statistically analysed. RESULTS The mean posterior tibial slope in 292 primary reconstructions was 8.6 degrees, whereas the mean posterior tibial slope in 83 revision reconstructions was 12.3 degrees. The difference between the studied groups was statistically (p<0.0001) and substantively significant (d=1.35). In the breakdown into men and women, the mean tibial slope was 8.6 degrees in the group of men with primary reconstruction and 12.4 degrees in the group of men with revision reconstruction (p < 0.0001, d = 1.38). A similar result was achieved in women where in the group with primary reconstruction the mean tibial slope was 8.4 degrees, while in the group with revision reconstruction it was 12.3 degrees (p < 0.0001, d = 1.41). Furthermore, a higher age in men at the time of revision surgery (p = 0.009; d = 0.46) and a lower BMI in women at the time of revision surgery (p = 0.0342; d = 0.12) were observed. Conversely, neither height nor weight were different, both when comparing the whole groups and the groups in a breakdown by sex. DISCUSSION As regards the main aim, our results are in line with the results reported by majority of other authors, and they are substantively significant. The posterior tibial slope is a significant risk factor in anterior cruciate ligament replacements, with tibial slope above 12 degrees increasing the risk of ligament failure, namely both in men and women. On the other hand, this is obviously not the sole cause of the ACL reconstruction failure since there are also other risk parameters. It is not yet clear whether it makes sense to indicate correction osteotomy before the ACL replacement in all patients with an increased posterior tibial slope. CONCLUSIONS Our study confirmed a greater posterior tibial slope in the revision reconstruction group compared to the primary reconstruction group. Thus, we confirmed that greater posterior tibial slope may be a factor leading to the ACL reconstruction failure. Since the posterior tibial slope is easily measured on the baseline X-rays, we recommend to perform this measurement routinely before each ACL reconstruction. In the case of a high posterior tibial slope, slope correction should be considered to prevent potential ACL reconstruction failure.

    "abstract": "The presented review aims to summarize the current knowledge of hypersensitivity to titanium - a material widely used in medical applications thanks to its exceptional chemical stability, resistance to corrosion, low specific weight and high strength. The hypersensitivity to metals is usually caused by the Type IV immunopathological reaction. Case reports on allergic reactions to titanium are rare but the actual occurrence can be expected to be much higher, especially due to its problematic detection. Although cutaneous patch tests are widely accepted and used for the diagnosis of hypersensitivity of numerous metals (e.g. Ni), it is notoriously unreliable in case of allergies to titanium, which may be associated with the low percutaneous transport of titanium and its salts. The Lymphocyte Transformation Test has superior sensitivity but it remains mostly unknown among clinicians and there are not many laboratories capable of performing it. This review presents numerous case reports indicating, in combination with the above-mentioned facts, that hypersensitivity to titanium should be considered as a possible cause also in non-specific problems associated with titanium implant failure.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Osteotomies around the knee are an established technique for treating knee osteoarthritis and other knee conditions by redistributing the body's weight and force within and around the knee joint. The aim of this study was to determine if the Tibia Plafond Horizontal Orientation Angle (TPHA) is a reliable measure for describing ankle alignment of the distal tibia in the coronal plane. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study included patients who underwent supracondylar rotational osteotomies for correction of femoral torsion. All patients had standing radiographs taken preoperatively and postoperatively with both knees pointed forward. Five variables, including Mechanical Lateral Distal Tibia Angle (mLDTA), Mechanical Malleolar Angle (mMA), Malleolar Horizontal Orientation Angle (MHA), Tibia Plafond Horizontal Orientation Angle (TPHA), and Tibio Talar Tilt Angle (TTTA), were collected. The preoperative and postoperative measurements were compared to each other using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS A total of 146 patients were included in the study, with a mean age of 51.47 ± 11.87 years. There were 92 (63.0%) males and 54 (37.0%) females. MHA decreased from 14.0° ± 5.32° preoperatively to 10.59° ± 3.93° (p < 0.001) postoperatively, and TPHA decreased from 4.88° ± 4.07° preoperatively to 3.82 ± 3.10° (p = 0.013) postoperatively. The change in TPHA was significantly correlated with the change in MHA (r = 0.185, CI 0.023 - 0.337; p = 0.025). No differences were found between the measurements of mLDTA, mMA, and mMA pre- and postoperatively.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 2015 and 2017, pediatric patients with a thoracolumbar injury aged 0-12 years were followed up in the University Hospital in Motol and the Thomayer University Hospital. The age and gender of the patient, injury etiology, fracture morphology, number of injured vertebrae, functional outcome (VAS and ODI modified for children), and complications were assessed. An X-ray was performed in all patients, in indicated cases also an MRI scan was done, and in more severe cases a CT scan was obtained as well. RESULTS The average vertebral body kyphosis in patients with one injured vertebra was 7.3° (range 1.1°-12.5°). The average vertebral body kyphosis in patients with two injured vertebrae was 5.5° (range 2.1°-12.2°). The average vertebral body kyphosis in patients with more than two injured vertebrae was 3.8° (range 0.2°-11.5°). All patients were treated conservatively in line with the proposed protocol. No complications were observed, no deterioration of the kyphotic shape of the vertebral body was reported, no instability occurred, and no surgical intervention had to be considered. DISCUSSION Pediatric spine injuries are in most cases treated conservatively. Surgical treatment is opted for in 7.5-18% of cases, in dependence on the evaluated group of patients, age of the patients and philosophy of the department concerned. In our group, all patients were treated conservatively. CONCLUSIONS 1. To diagnose F0 fractures, two unenhanced orthogonal view X-rays are indicated, whereas MRI examination is not routinely performed. In F1 fractures, an X-ray is indicated, and an MRI scan is considered based on the age and extent of injury. In F2 and F3 fractures, an X-ray is indicated and subsequently the diagnosis is confirmed by MRI, in F3 fractures also a CT scan is performed. 2. In young children (under 6 years of age), in whom an MRI procedure would require general anaesthesia, MRI is not routinely performed. 3. In F0 fractures, crutches or a brace are not indicated. In F1 fractures, verticalization using crutches or a brace is considered in dependence on the patient's age and extent of injury. In F2 fractures, verticalization using crutches or a brace is indicated. 4. In F3 fractures, surgical treatment is considered, followed by verticalization using crutches or a brace. In case of conservative treatment, the same procedures as in F2 fractures are applied. 5. Long-term bed rest is contraindicated. 6. Duration of spinal load reduction (restriction of sports activities, or verticalization using crutches or a brace) in F1 injuries is 3-6 weeks based on the age of the patient, it increases with the age, with the minimum being 3 weeks. 7. Duration of spinal load reduction (verticalization using crutches or a brace) in F2 and F3 injuries is 6-12 weeks based on the age of the patient, it increases with the age, with the minimum being 6 weeks.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The study aims to determine the incidence of fracture-related infection (hereinafter referred to as the FRI) at a Level I trauma centre over a three-year period. It also aimed to determine the risk factors, to observe confirmatory and suggestive criteria in line with the applicable recommendations, and to evaluate the bacterial spectrum in a diagnosed FRI. MATERIAL AND METHODS It is a retrospective-prospective study carried out through studying the documentation. The study included all patients diagnosed with FRI and treated between 2019 and 2021, except for the patients with hand fractures since minor phalangeal fractures of the fingers were largely treated by the outpatient department, no osteosynthesis was performed in the operating room, and these patients were not followed up at our department. RESULTS The FRI incidence was 2.33% of all osteosyntheses performed at the Level 1 trauma centre in the period 2019-2021. The FRI was most often caused by pyogenic cocci agents and the FRI developed most frequently within 6 months after osteosynthesis. The site at risk was the lower limb region. The FRI incidence was most often indicated by suggestive clinical criteria (redness, secretion, pain) and radiological criteria (delayed healing, non-union). Overall, 42.19% of treated nonunions were later diagnosed as FRI. At the time of FRI diagnosis, the CRP values were normal in 21.7% of patients. DISCUSSION The FRI incidence rate in 2019-2021 was 2.33%, which corresponds with the values reported in other papers focusing on the incidence of infectious complications after osteosynthesis. Fang and Depypere reported 1-2% of infectious complications. The most common risk factors are open fractures, which account for 20.16% in our cohort. Ktistakis and Depypere describe the incidence of osteomyelitis in 30% of treated open fractures. In our cohort, the incidence of FRI was significantly higher in lower limb fractures. Bezstarosti, Wang and Pesch published similar results, with some deviations. The time from osteosynthesis to final FRI diagnosis varied from a few weeks to several years. In more than half of the patients the FRI developed within 6 months after performed osteosynthesis. Metsemakers and Fang refer to the very same trend. The CRP levels in the study population varied a lot. Xing-qi Zhao describes CRP as a less sensitive (sensitivity 65.6%) but more specific marker (specificity 75.4%). According to the available literature, the most common agents causing infectious complications of osteosynthesis are gram-positive cocci, S. aureus in particular. In our study, G+ pyogenic cocci were clearly the most commonly detected, which is consistent with the results of studies by Fang and Depypere, focused on the incidence of infectious complications. The most common FRI clinical manifestations included wound secretion, redness, swelling and pain. Furthermore, suggestive radiological criteria, especially delayed healing and non-union also indicated the FRI occurrence. According to Fang, the most common clinical manifestations of infectious complications include pain, swelling, redness and wound dehiscence. Fang reports that the most common radiologic findings are the periosteal reaction, loosening of the implant and delayed healing or non-union, which is consistent with our cohort. In the cohort of non-unions surgically treated at our department, FRI was subsequently confirmed in 42.19% of cases. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of FRI at Level 1 trauma centre was 2.33% of operated fractures in 2019-2021, with pyogenic cocci being the most common infectious agents. The FRI usually developed within 6 months after osteosynthesis. The typical site for the FRI development was the lower limb region, the ongoing FRI was indicated by suggestive clinical criteria (redness, secretion, pain) and radiological criteria (delayed healing and a non-union). Overall, 42.19% of treated non-unions were later diagnosed as FRI.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Patellofemoral stability and congruency are influenced by different parameters. Their contribution to anterior knee pain and instability is not fully understood. We investigated, if isolated femoral antetorsion of more than 25° leads to patellofemoral instability. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analyzed 90 knees in patients with patellofemoral complaints and correlated clinical and radiological characteristics. Patients presenting at our center between January 2018 and December 2020 because of patellofemoral pain or instability were included, provided that there was no previous surgical intervention done. RESULTS The severity of trochlea dysplasia classified using the Oswestry-Bristol classification significantly correlated with events of patellofemoral dislocations. (χ=8.152, p=0.043, φ=0.288). All males with a history of patella dislocation had at least a mild trochlea dysplasia. The majority of females complaining about patellofemoral symptoms in general had a dysplastic trochlea. Patella alta is more frequently found in patients with trochlea dysplasia than in patients with a normal femoral trochlea anatomy. DISCUSSION The majority of unstable patellofemoral joints showed a dysplastic trochlea. A high femoral antetorsion was found to be an additional minor factor contributing to instability. Isolated high femoral antetorsion without trochlea dysplasia rather leads to anterior knee pain without patella dislocation. Furthermore, no direct significant correlation between patella alta and patellofemoral instability was found. Patella alta can therefore rather be seen as a result of a dysplastic trochlea than a primary major risk factor for patellofemoral instability. CONCLUSIONS Trochlea dysplasia is the major risk factor for patellofemoral instability. Patella alta can rather be seen as a result of a dysplastic trochlea than as a primary risk factor for patella instability or pain. Isolated high femoral antetorsion often leads to patellofemoral pain syndrome but not to patella dislocations. Key words: MPFL, patella instability, patellofemoral instability.",

    "abstract": "Acute traumatic intervertebral disc herniation of the thoracic spine is a rather rare injury with only a few reported cases to date.In this manuscript, we present a case of a 58-year-old male patient who sustained a car accident-related high-energy trauma, resulting in a disc herniation of the thoracic spine.Furthermore, we also discuss the possible implications of late diagnosis of such condition.The patient was initially referred from the Emergency Department as a case of head contusion with a left upper limb paresis.Due to only minimal bony trauma visible on the initial spine CT scan, the neurological deficit was attributed to the cranial trauma.The diagnosis of a traumatic disc herniation was therefore established only after the rapid onset of paraparesis, which gradually progressed into paraplegia, and a following spine MRI scan.Despite the subsequent urgent spinal decompression, the neurological functions of the lower limbs were not restored.This manuscript addresses the indications for performing MRI scans in polytrauma patients with a CT-verified spine trauma.Although it may be complicated to perform routine MRI scans in all such patients in daily practice, it can certainly help diagnose such injuries earlier and thus prevent potential permanent neurological damage to the patients.",

In addition, the different degrees of publication activity in the countries and institutes performing this research were investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS Publications from 1945-2020 listed in the Web of Science Core Collection were included in the study. Using the web application Science Performance Evaluation (SciPE), quantitative and qualitative aspects were evaluated. Subsequently, the date of publication, author information, and other metadata were analysed. RESULTS Since 1945, 3,924 studies have been published on K-ASC and 2,163 on H-ASC. The majority of the publications which have appeared since 2016 dealt with the topic of H-ASC (H-ASC: 241.2 publications/year; K-ASC: 217.4 publications/year). The USA published the most on both topics (H-ASC: 1,123 publications; K-ASC: 1,078 publications). More countries and institutes participated in K-ASC (3,008 institutes, 82 countries) than in H-ASC (103 institutes, 57 countries). The ten institutes with the most publications accounted for 36.71% and 12.34% of all publications on H-ASC and K-ASC, respectively. H-ASC received 78.12% of its funding from private sponsors while K-ASC was supported mainly by governmental/nonprofit sponsors (70.92%). CONCLUSIONS This study provides the first scientific comparison between H-ASC and K-ASC. Measured by qualitative and quantitative aspects, K-ASC was the most flourishing research area overall. In the last ten to five years, interest has shifted towards HASC with an increasing number of publications and a higher rate of citations.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Total arthroplasty of the first metatarsophalangeal joint is one of the surgical treatment options for patients with advanced hallux rigidus. This study evaluates the pressure changes in the propulsion phase of the gait cycle using dynamic pedobarography after the total arthroplasty of the first metatarsophalangeal joint by Medin PH-Flex and their comparison with the control groups of patients with hallux rigidus and with asymptomatic patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS Dynamic pedobarograph was used to evaluate 15 first MTP joint replacements by Medin PH-Flex implants in 12 female patients, the average time since joint replacement was 3.5 years (1.5 to 5.5 years). The control group consisted of 13 forefeet in 12 patients with hallux rigidus of Grade 3 and Grade 4 according to the Coughlin classification and 17 healthy patients with no clear foot deformity, i.e. of a total of 34 forefeet. A zone for each metatarsal (M1-M5) and the big toe area (T1) were defined with the use of an integrated software. The difference between the pressure under the big toe area and the first metatarsal bone - hallux stiffness (T1-M1) and the forefoot balance parameter, i.e. the difference between the pressures under the medial and lateral half of the forefoot ((M1+M2)-(M3+M4+M5)), was obtained. The parameters were evaluated for each group during the propulsion phase of the gait, i.e. from 55% to 100% of the stance phase and from 75% to 100% of the stance phase, i.e. that part of propulsion when the greatest pressure is exerted on the big toe. RESULTS For the HS parameter (T1-M1) in 55% to 100% of the stance phase, the median value was -0.66 ± 1.22 (-1.90 to 1.45) in the control group, -0.85 ± 1.94 (-1.40 to 3.80) in patients with hallux rigidus, and -0.10 ± 1.48 (-1.30 to 2.40) in patients after the first MTP joint replacement. The median forefoot balance parameter from 55% of the stance phase was -3.48 ± 2.45 (-6.90 to 0.68) in healthy patients and -4.43 ± 2.72 (-6.98 to 0.23) in hallux rigidus patients. In patients after the joint replacement, the value was -3.00 ± 2.46 (-6.20 to 0.40). The data were statistically analysed by the Dunnett's and Tukey's multiple comparison tests. The hallux stiffness parameter showed a significant improvement after the joint replacement compared to patients with hallux rigidus (p<0.0001). No statistical significance was confirmed when comparing the joint replacement cases and the healthy patients from the control group (p=0.0007 and p=0.0010, respectively). As concerns the forefoot balance parameter, a significant difference was reported in patients with joint replacement compared to healthy patients from the control group and patients with hallux rigidus (p <0.0001). DISCUSSION The published pedobarographic studies differ in terms of the methodology used, the patient population and the parameters examined. The pedobarographic studies after the replacement of the first MTP joint or after its arthrodesis present inconclusive outcomes. According to the available literature, the joint replacement has the potential to improve mediolateral forefoot loading and to partially restore the weight-bearing function of the first ray. Our analysis of the HS parameter suggests that the MTP joint replacement can improve the big toe function compared to patients with hallux rigidus but fails to achieve the functional outcomes of healthy patients. When evaluating the forefoot balance (FB) parameter, we can observe less loading on the lateral half of the forefoot in the propulsion phase compared to hallux rigidus. Nonetheless, the joint replacement is unable to restore the physiological loading of the foot. CONCLUSIONS The first MTP joint replacement has the potential to improve forefoot function and to bring it closer to that of a healthy person, even though achieving physiological loading of the forefoot is unrealistic. Additional studies will be needed to confirm that the indication for the first MTP joint replacement is justified in hallux rigidus in terms of the effect on forefoot biomechanics.

    "abstract": "The aim of arthroscopic Bankart repair is restoration of the anterior block mechanism and regaining stability. There are few studies that have tested the adequacy of the angle made with the glenoid and the height from the glenoid level of the repaired labral tissue, but the correlation with the clinical results is not clear. The aim of this study was to defi ne the correlation of the height and slope of the repaired labral tissue in the glenoid anterior with the clinical results. MATERIAL AND METHODS This prospective study included 20 patients who underwent an arthroscopic Bankart repair. To evaluate the labrum anatomy of the affected shoulder, 4 measurement parameters were defi ned as axial height (Ah), axial slope (As), oblique coronal height (Ch), and oblique coronal slope (Cs) on non-contrast T2 MRI. The measurements were taken preoperatively of the affected shoulder and at 1 year postoperatively of both the affected shoulder and the contralateral asymptomatic shoulder. The measured values were compared with each other and with the contralateral shoulder. Correlations of the anatomic values with the Constant-Murley scores recorded at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively were examined with the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS The mean preoperative Constant score of the patients was 57.7 (32-77) and postoperative scores at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months were 63.6 (44-79), 77.8 (61-90), 89.6 (77-100), and 95.2 (79-100), respectively (p=0.001). There was a statistically signifi cant difference in the preoperative MRI measurements of the axial and oblique coronal plane labral height and slope values compared to the postoperative values and those of the asymptomatic contralateral shoulder (p< 0.05 for all). There was no statistically signifi cant difference between the labral height and slope values of both planes postoperatively compared to the asymptomatic contralateral shoulder (p= 0.776, p= 0.910, p= 0.132, p= 0.589, respectively). These increases in the radiological data were not found to be statistically signifi cant in the correlation analysis with the increases in the Constant-Murley scores (Ah p=0.935, As p=0.587, Ch p=0.078, Cs p=0.105). CONCLUSIONS This prospective study was conducted using conventional T2 magnetic resonance imaging, which was suffi cient for the measurement of labral height and slope.

    "abstract": "The authors present the outcomes of more than ten-year clinical follow-up of patients who underwent surgical treatment of deep chondral defect of the knee (medial or lateral condyle). The method of treatment was the implantation of autologous cultured chondrocytes in the form of a solid chondral graft. The aim was also to compare the mid-term and long-term outcomes and to evaluate how the knee condition affects the everyday life and sports activities more than 10 years after surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty patients of the total of 56 patients (26 patients dropped out of the long-term follow-up) operated in the period between 2001 and 2012 were available for retrospective evaluation of the clinical condition before surgery, at 1, 2, 5 years after surgery and at 10+ years after surgery. The mean follow-up period of patients was 14.5 years (10 - 20.5 years) after surgery. The clinical evaluation was performed using the Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale and the Tegner Activity Scale. RESULTS The mean preoperative Lysholm score of the followed-up study population was 37.5. During the fi rst two years, improvement was achieved to the maximum value of 83.1. At 5 years and subsequently also at more than 10 years after surgery, a slight decline was reported to the mean value of 78.6. When comparing the outcomes at 5 years and at more than 10 years after surgery, the decline in the value was statistically non-signifi cant. The mean value of the Tegner Activity Scale at more than 10 years after surgery was 4.5 points out of 10 points. DISCUSSION Management of a chondral defect especially in younger patients constitutes a common challenge in everyday orthopaedic practice. There are multiple methods at hand, all of which have their pros and cons. The size of the chondral lesion appears to be the limiting and decisive factor. The greatest pitfall are large chondral lesions (>4cm2 ), where many methods fail to yield satisfactory outcomes. One of the suitable options is the autologous chondrocyte implantation method. CONCLUSIONS The clinical outcomes of patients followed-up for more than 10 years after surgery do not show a statistically signifi cant decline compared to the mid-term outcomes. Based on the data obtained, we continue to consider the autologous chondrocyte implantation as an effective method to manage deep chondral defects in the knee. The patients were mostly able to get back to normal life, including their sports activities, with a signifi cant improvement of its quality compared to that before surgery.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is severe because of bone and soft tissue trauma during the surgery and is diffi cult to control with oral analgesics. The primary aim of the study was to investigate the effects of the local infi ltration anesthesia (LIA) method on postoperative analgesia quality and opioid consumption in patients undergoing TKA. The secondary aims were to evaluate knee fl exion angle, side effects, and patient satisfaction. MATERIAL AND METHODS Total 40 patients, who underwent unilateral TKA surgery under spinal anesthesia were included in the prospective randomized study. Patients who underwent patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCA) (Group A) or LIA + PCA (Group B), were divided into two groups, randomly. For LIA application, 0.25% bupivacaine solution 150 mg in 60 ml volume was used. The postoperative pain was evaluated in 48th hour after the recovery of motor block, and during exercise at 24, 36, and 48 hours by using the visual analogue scale (VAS). An additional morphine was administered with the PCA device when VAS ≥ 4. The total amount of morphine consumption and the side effects were recorded. The knee fl exion joint angles at the 48th hour and the patients' satisfaction was recorded. RESULTS Resting VAS values were lower in Group B in the fi rst 24 hours (p<0.05). However, the 36 th and 48th hour measurements were not different in groups. The exercises VAS values and the total morphine consumption were signifi cantly higher in Group A at 24, 36 and 48 hours. The knee fl exion joint angles in Group B were higher than Group A in terms of 48th hour. The incidence of side effects was not different in the two groups. Patients' satisfaction was higher in the PCA+ILA group (p<0.05). DISCUSSION In many studies the periarticular injection with multimodal drugs has been shown to reduce the requirements for analgesia, with no apparent risks, following TKA, similar to our results. LIA reduced postoperative opioid use and increased exercise tolerance. CONCLUSIONS In our study, we found that LIA reduced pain scores and opioid consumption during rest and exercise after TKA operation. For TKA patients where post-operative exercise is particularly important, we recommend the easy-to-use LIA method for a pain-free and unrestricted postoperative period.",

The right foot was affected in 44, the left foot in 23, and the bilateral form was treated in 48 patients. In order to obtain results for at least 3 years of follow-up, we included the patients treated by the Ponseti method between 2006 and 2008, in whom 83 affected feet were analysed (23 isolated right feet, 14 left feet, 23 bilateral forms). According to the Dimeglio scoring system used to assess the severity of clubfoot deformity, there were four feet in group II, 37 feet in group III and 42 feet in group IV.Subtalar release was performed in 29 feet (34.9%), in two feet being only posterior. Moreover, foot deviations, e.g. adduction of the forefoot less than 10° (5 feet, 6%), varus deformity of the heel less than 5° (6 feet, 7.2%), and failure to complete the Ponseti treatment (3 feet, 3.6%) were recorded. For assessment of the effect of age at start of casting on the outcome, two patient subgroup were distinguished: group 1, the treatment stared and continued in the first 8 postnatal weeks; group 2, the treatment was initiated and carried out between 9 and 20 weeks postnatally. Subsequently, subtalar release was performed in 18 of 61 feet (29.5%) in group 1, and in 11 of 21 feet (52.4 %) in group 2. Using Fischer's exact test, the difference was found statistically significant. (p<0.05). Of the three patients with an unfinished course of initial treatment, two underwent subtalar release later and one was lost to follow-up.Contrary to many recent reports, the frequency of Ponseti treatment failure in this study is substantially higher. Nevertheless, we adhered strictly to the Ponseti protocol of treatment, tenotomy was performed under general anaesthesia and Ponseti splinting was maintained properly in all but seven patients (8.4%).Irrespective of rather frequent failure of the initial Ponseti treatment, its contribution for the patient is beneficial as it can reduce the extent of subtalar release required. However, a modern family will hardly accept several years of applying splints every night, irrespective of maximally sophisticated bracing. This becomes critical usually at the age when the child starts walking. Nowadays, families cooperate quite well due to the fact that a new method with high mass-media coverage has been offered to them.",

    "abstract": "When a larger opening of high-tibial osteotomy is necessary to achieve good correction of the lower extremity axis, partial release of the attachments of the medial stabilisers of the knee may be required. The aim of the study was to ascertain, in cadaver specimens, the effect of loosening the medial knee stabilisers on the magnitude of correction in medial opening-wedge high-tibial valgus osteotomy.Thirty-eight knees obtained from cadavers of Caucasian race were dissected. Medial opening-wedge high-tibial valgus osteotomy was performed using a dynamic distractor, constructed by us, with a dynamometer to ensure constant force action. Using a kinematic navigation system, the lower leg axis was studied at opening-wedge osteotomy under constant forces of 100 N and 150 N. The change in its angulation was recorded after each step in releasing the medial stabilisers whose structures were gradually made loose, under constant action of the given force, in the following order: superficial portion of the medial collateral ligament, tendons of the gracilis, semitendinosus and sartorius muscles.The results were statistically analysed using descriptive statistical methods and the two-sample paired t-test with the level of statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Loosening of the medial stabilisers one by one under a constant load led to a statistically significant change in alignment. The most significant change in angulation, both in clinical and statistical terms, was that of 3.4° occurring after the superficial portion of the medial collateral ligament was made loose under a constant force of 100 N applied to osteotomy. Thus, this loosening contributed by 62% to an overall change of 5.5° in the lower extremity mechanical axis, as compared with the condition not allowing for loosening of the stabilisers. Under a load of 150 N applied to osteotomy, loosening of the medial collateral ligament resulted in a change by 4.1°, which accounted for 56% of an overall change of 7.3° that occurred after all stabilisers were released. On distraction of the osteotomy using a higher force, an increase in a stabilising effect of the pes anserinus was apparent.The evolution of angle-stable implants has advanced options for reliable fixation of high-tibial corrective osteotomy which involves cutting out a wedge and forcing it open on the medial side. These implants provide stable fixation even when a large correction of the limb mechanical axis is required, and allow for rehabilitation with early weight-bearing. As with a large correction the force needed to make the wedge open is increasing, it is necessary to consider loosening of the medial stabilisers of the knee. According to our knowledge, no study on the effect of individual medial stabilising structures of the knee on the force required to open high-tibial osteotomy with the wedge opened medially has been published.The process of correcting lower extremity alignment by high-tibial opening-wedge valgus osteotomy brings about an increase in tension of the stabilisers on the concave side of the deformity. Our results show an important role of releasing the superficial portion of the medial collateral ligament in the reduction of forces necessary to correct a deformity.",

Due to the advances in prehospital care and timely transport to the hospital, orthopaedic surgeons deal with severe and challenging injuries of the limbs. In contrast to civilian extremity trauma, the most combat-related injuries are open wounds that often have infection-related complications. Data from two recent large armed conflicts (Iraq, Afghanistan) show that extremity injuries are associated with a high complication rate, morbidity and healthcare utilization. A systematic approach that consists of sequential surgical care and good transport capabilities can reduce the complication rate of these injuries. New medical technologies have been implemented in the treatment strategy during the last decade.

    "abstract": "To evaluate the mid-term results of using the Allofit cementless acetabular cup for primary hip replacement.The Allofit cup is a cementless hemispherical acetabular component. The macrostructure on the external surface, including 1200 concentrically arranged teeth, and the rough-blasted surface of the biocompatible pure titanium provide good conditions for press-fit fixation. From 1998 to 2005 we used it in 182 cases of primary total hip replacement (THR) in 164 patients. (18 patients had bilateral THRs) The average age at the time of surgery was 58.3 years in men (range, 39-74 years) and 64.1 years in women (range, 33-80 years). We used the Bauer anterolateral approach as our standard procedure. The cup was combined with one of six types of cemented or cementless stems and a 28-mm ceramic head. At a minimum follow-up of five years, we evaluated clinical and radiological findings, i.e., the Harris hip score, radiological signs of loosening, migration and polyethylene wear. The average follow-up was 7.4 years (range, 5-11 years). For more accurate reading of X-ray films, the photographs were zoomed to 115%.The final evaluation included 147 primary THRs in 129 patients. We recorded no intra-operative complications. The average Harris hip score increased from pre-operative 44 to post-operative 87 points (range, 31-100). The loosening of a cup occurred in three patients (2.1%), of which two were infected (1.4%) and one was aseptic (0.7%). We had to replace the polyethylene insert in three patients, in one for abnormally high polyethylene wear and, in two, because of a ceramic head fracture due to a fall. Cup migration was not recorded. Eight cups (5.4%) had a thin (less than 1 mm) radiolucent line without signs of loosening. Polyethylene wear indicated by an asymmetric position of the head was detected by the Dorr method in 32 cups (21.8%). A shift of the head centre towards the proximal pole of the titanium shell ranged from 0.4 to 6.0 mm. The average polyethylene wear of all cups was 0.29 mm in 5 years, which is 0.06 mm per year.The Allofit acetabular cup is suitable for younger patients with good bone quality. In elderly patients or in those with severe osteoporosis, we preferably indicate cemented components. Press-fit cups can also be used in patients with postdysplastic osteoarthritis of the hip on condition that enough bone is left around the cup margin for press-fit fixation.Cementless press-fit cups have very good outcomes, even in a long-term follow-up. Our experience gives support to these results because of a low number of hips with loosening, both septic and aseptic, or polyethylene wear of the primary implanted acetabular cup, and no cup migration in our patients. The five-year survival rate of the Allofit acetabular cup was 95.8%.",

    "abstract": "Systematic lymph node dissection is performed as standard curative resection for non-small cell lung cancer. Its role in lung metastasectomy is unknown. The aim of our study was to find out the frequency of lymph node metastases, the survival of patients with and without lymph node involvement, and to consider if routine lymph node dissection should be recommended.The study was undertaken at three departments of surgery and included 14 patients undergoing lung metastasectomy between July 2008 and December 2011. In all patients systematic lymph node dissection was also performed. When wedge resection was done, N1 nodes were removed only as part of a local procedure at that anatomical site. Patients with mediastinal lymph node involvement detected by pre-operative CT or PET scans were not included in the study.Lung metastasectomy for metastatic sarcoma was performed in 14 patients. Nine patients had bilateral lung metastases. Solitary lung metastasis was found in only one case. The mean number of removed mediastinal lymph nodes was 14.8 (7-32). Mediastinal lymph node metastases were found in two patients (14.3%). The average disease free interval (DFI) was 79.6 months (median, 25.5 months). Using the Kaplan-Meier method, the 3-year survival rate was 46% (0.46±0.15). The Cox-Mantel test for comparing the survival curves showed, at a 0.05 level of significance, better survival rates for the patients with no metastatic lymph node involvement (p=0.01).The frequency of mediastinal lymph node involvement in our study was 14.3% and this was in agreement with the data reported in the literature. The 3-year survival rate was 46% in our patients; the published 5-year survival is 15-50%. A systematic mediastinal lymphadenectomy during lung metastasectomy for metastatic sarcoma has been recommended, but also argued against because of a low incidence of mediastinal lymph node involvement in sarcomatous metastases reported by some authors. We showed that mediastinal lymph node involvement was a negative prognostic factor. Systematic mediastinal lymphadenectomy as a routine procedure provides for a better staging. This is important in association with the development of adjuvant modalities, such as monoclonal antibodies, at present or a gene therapy in the future.Even in a carefully selected group of patients, incidence of mediastinal lymph node metastases is high. Since no relevant data based on large patient groups are available, we recommend routine nodal dissection for all patients indicated for lung metastasectomy. Drawing a definite conclusion will require analyses of large numbers of data from multi-institutional studies and cooperation with the international database, if possible.",

    "abstract": "Chronic synovitis is a common finding in people with haemophilia. It regularly appears after recurrent episodes of intra-articular bleeding. The bleeding originates from the subsynovial venous plexus underlying the capsule where a lack of thromboplastic activity has been demonstrated. Therefore, the changed synovium appears to be a treatment target. There are several methods which can be used to remove the synovial layer from the joint. The aim of our study was to asses the efficacy of different treatment approaches used in a group of haemophiliacs between 1985 and 2005 in our hospital.A group of 30 patients with bleeding disorders was evaluated in the study. There were 29 men with haemophilia and one woman with von Wilebrandt factor deficiency. Their age ranged from 6 to 18 (median 13) years. They underwent a total of 68 interventions including surgical synovectomy (n=28), radionuclide synovectomy (n=33) and corticosteroid instillation (n=7). The necessity of a repeat intervention was used as a criterion of successful treatment.In the group of surgical synovectomies, 22% of the patients required repeat operations, in the group of radiation synovectomy, this was 9% and, in the group treated with corticosteroids, this was 43%. The average hospitalisation time was 50 days for surgical procedures (19-133 days) and 7 days for radiation synovectomy procedures (4-13 days).In 1994 Merchan presented seven excellent or good results in a group of 10 knees evaluated 1 year after treatment with methylprednisolone. Six years later he reported that \"five years after completion of treatment, all results of the observed patients were poor\". Generally, corticosteroids will reduce synovitis in the majority of patients but the effect is temporary. A complete remission is a very rare situation under corticosteroid treatment. The experience with surgical synovectomies is not recent and this method is described as carrying a high risk of complications and requiring a high amount of coagulating factor consumption. There are several recent reports on the application of Yttrium-90: in Madrid they evaluated treated joints (knees, ankles and elbows, n = 66) in 44 patients aged from 9 to 39 years. The results were good in less than half of the knees and ankles. The treatment of elbows was more successful. It was recommended to perform synoviorthesis at the early stages of synovitis. In Israel, they reported that a decrease in the number of bleeding episodes was achieved in 80% of 115 patients treated with Yttrium-90; in 15% of them, bleeding in the treated joints stopped completely. In Izmir, Yttrium was used in the treatment of knees, elbows, ankles and also shoulders in children and young adults (3-25 years). The method was found to be safe and effective. Brazilian authors have experience with the treatment of knees, ankles, elbows and shoulders too; they have concluded that this method represents an important resource for the treatment of chronic haemophilic synovitis and markedly reduces joint bleeding frequency and pain, irrespective of the radiographic stage and inhibitor status. While the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) recommend using 186Re-sulfide for treatment in medium-sized joints, Chinese authors have published a study comparing the effect of using three different doses of 186Re-sulfide in the treatment of chronic synovitis in knees. Their patients have received an amount of radionuclide according to the thickness of their synovial layer measured on MRI, with the result that 22 patients exhibited significant reduction in synovial thickness. A reduction in the number of bleeding episodes was reached in 71% of the patients within an 18-month period. No significant differences were found among the groups receiving different radioactivity doses. In Turkey, 35 elbows, 26 ankles and two shoulders in 49 patients aged between 3 and 30 years were treated with 186Re. The patients were followed up from 6 months to 3 years. At 6 months after the procedure, 81% of the elbows and 86% of the ankles with grade II synovitis were free from bleeding, as well as 53% and 44% of the elbows and ankles with grade III synovitis, respectively.Radiation synovectomy appears to be the method of choice in the treatment of recurrent bleeding in the joint cavity in people with haemophilia. The efficacy of surgical synovectomy is lower in comparison with radiation synovectomy. Risks associated with surgery and anaesthesia, the need of hospitalisation and a prolonged period of rehabilitation are bothering. On the contrary, the application of corticosteroids cannot be recommended as a good method to treat recurrent haemarthroses.",

The patients having spinal anesthesia were divided into two groups. Group 1 received warm bupivacaine and group 2 was given bupivacaine at room temperature. The onset time and the level of sensory block were evaluated by a blind observer. Side effects (nausea, vomiting, shivering, headache, low back pain) were evaluated during surgery and in the post-operative period.One patient was excluded from the study because of incomplete block; therefore 59 patients in two groups (29 patients in group 1 and 30 patients in group 2) were compared. The groups were matched on gender, age, weight and BMI. The onset time of sensory block at the levels of T12, L3 and L4 in group 1 was significantly shorter than in group 2 (p < 0.001). The difference in the onset time of sensory block at the upper levels of the spine between the two groups was not significant (p = 0.21). The incidence of side effects did not differ significantly (p = 0.18) between the two groups.Warming bupivacaine can decrease the onset time of sensory block in epidural anaesthesia without any side effects in patients undergoing lower limb orthopaedic surgery.",

RESULTSOf the 84 patients, 22 (26.2%) had a scapular fracture.Of 61 patients with upper plexus palsy only 10 (16.4%) suffered a scapular fracture while of 23 patients with more severe plexus lesions 12 (52.2%,p < 0.001) had fractured scapula.The ISS score in the patients with fractured scapula was significantly higher (51.8,SD = 11, range = 18-75, p < 0.001).The patients with scapular fractures also had a significantly higher number of rib, clavicle, upper and lower limb fractures, and injuries to the thoracic organs and the head. COnCLUSIOnSBoth scapular fracture and serious brachial plexus injury are usually associated with other severe injuries.They occur due to high-energy trauma.Generally, patients who sustain scapular fractures and upper limb impairment in motorcycle and car crashes are at high risk of other associated injuries and more severe polytrauma.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY To evaluate the long-term results of intramedullary nailing of extra-articular proximal humerus fractures. MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty-six patients with 36 extra-articular fractures, types 11-A2 and 11-A3, treated by intramedullary nailing were reassessed after an average follow-up of 54 (30-86) months. The group included five type 11-A2 and 31 type 11-A3 fractures according to the AO/OTA classification. Radiographic and clinical outcomes - the absolute Constant score (CSabs) and the relative Constant score (compared to the contralateral side, CSrel) were evaluated. The rate of complications was assessed. RESULTS All fractures healed. The mean long-term CSabs was 73 pts, the mean CSrel was 89% of the unaffected side. Thirty (83%) patients achieved excellent or good results (CSrel higher than 80%), four (11%) had satisfactory and two patients (5.5%) had poor results (CSrel less than 60%). No significant difference was observed in functional results between different age groups. No non-union, loss of reduction or deep infection was encountered. Two cases of prolonged healing were observed, one implant-related complication happened due to locking screw breakage. Conclusion Nailing can be recommended for the safe treatment of extra-articular fractures of the proximal humerus. If the procedure is performed properly, the possibility of excellent functional results is high and the rate of complications is minimal. Age does not influence the final functional result.

    "abstract": "The high number of patients with femoropatellar complaints following ACL reconstruction with bone-tendon-bone (B-T-B) autograft led us to use and subsequently evaluate hamstring tendon grafts fixed with the Rigidfix system. In this study we present the evaluation of short-term results.We evaluated 85 patients (51 male and 34 female) at an average follow-up of 14 months. The average age of the group was 29.7 years (range, 16 to 59 years). In 46 patients we treated the right knee and in 39 patients the left knee. Fifty-five patients in this group also had an associated injury to the soft knee tissues. For reconstruction, a semitendinosus tendon graft was used in 56 knees and a semitendinosus-gracilis tendon graft in 29 patients.The operation was carried out with tourniquet application to the extremity in a flexed position. The tendon of the semitendinosus muscle was harvested through an oblique incision and, in some cases, when its width and length was not sufficient for graft construction, the gracilis muscle tendon was harvested too. The graft, at least 75 mm by 8 mm in size, was prepared on a graft board. After having drilled the both tunnels, the femoral Rigidfix reamer was inserted in a routine manner and protective sleeves for Rigidfix cross pins were introduced. With the extremity in semiflexion, the inserted graft was fixed to the cortical bone by absorbable cross pins on the femur and absorbable interference screws on the tibia. The postoperative treatment involved procedures as in the B-T-B technique.The group was evaluated by the Lysholm score system, with an average of 84.3 scores achieved. The men showed better outcomes than women, i. e., 85.7 and 81.4, respectively. The scores in the patients with a single tendon did not differ significantly from the patients with a combined tendon (semitendinosus, 83.2 vs. semitendinosus-gracilis, 84.2), nor did they greatly differ between the patients with injury to ACL alone and those with ACL and associated soft tissue injuries (ACL, 83.9 vs. ACL+ associated injury, 85.5). Most of the patients (94 %) were satisfied with the outcome of treatment. The complications involved thrombosis of the operated lower extremity in three patients and repeat surgery for hematoma in two patients. Knee instability was found in five patients. One graft failed to restructure and incorporate, in two knee tunnels were incorrectly centered and two grafts ruptured due to trauma. Three of these patients underwent repeat surgery.Our results, as evaluated by the Lysholm score system, were in agreement with those of other authors. We did not find any difference in knee stability between the patients treated by the hamstring tendon technique and those undergoing reconstruction with a patellar B-T-B autograft. However, the patients with hamstring tendon reconstruction reported a considerably lower number of femoropatellar problems.ACL reconstruction with a hamstring tendon autograft fixed with the Rigidfix system is a suitable alternative technique to ACL reconstruction carried out with a patellar B-T-B graft. It provides equal knee stability but has significantly lower donor site morbidity. It is suitable for patients who have contraindications for the B-T-B technique and in persons practicing little or no sports.",

    "abstract": "The authors report on a pre-school child with a typical presentation of the trauma caused by a car safety belt and termed the seat-belt syndrome. The deceleration mechanism which throws the upper body forward in the presence of a rigid belt over the abdominal region results in large contusions of the abdominal wall and trauma to the spine, retroperitoneum, and intra-abdominal organs, or even the chest. In making the diagnosis a thorough examination of the spine is necessary as well as a repeated surgical examination of the abdomen, because seat-belt syndrome is often associated with small intestine rupture, a symptom which can remain unrecognised at the early stage. In the case of a four-year-old boy described here, two loops of the small intestine were resected for perforation; stabilization of the vertebral column was indicated on the 5th post-injury day because of decompensated diabetes and deteriorated health state following intra-abdominal surgery. In this boy, poor compensation of juvenile diabetes resulted in infectious complications requiring repeated drainage of an abscess of the abdominal wall injured by the seat belt.The abdominal wall healed within 2 months, diabetes was managed with insulin therapy and good spondylodesis was achieved at 9 months after the injury.",

    "abstract": "We present a group of patients with spinal metastatic disease surgically treated at our department, with an evaluation of their neurological outcomes in relation to the initial disease and the surgical technique used.Between 1989 and 2007 we operated on 748 patients with spinal tumour. Of these, 380 had metastatic disease. The Frankel classification system was used to assess neurological status.Based on the Tomita prognostic score, the metastatic disease was evaluated and appropriate surgical procedure was selected (biopsy, posterolateral decompression, posterolateral decompression with stabilisation, somatectomy, or vertebrectomy/spondylectomy). The neurological findings before and after surgery and at follow-up were assessed.Of the 368 patients evaluated, four were pre-operatively classified as Frankel grade A, 29 as grade B, 99 as grade C, 82 as grade D and 159 patients as grade E. Post-operative outcomes were: Frankel grade A, 6 patients B, 27 C, 78 D, 79 and E, 178 patients. Surgery resulted in neurological deterioration by 3 degrees of the Frankel scale in two patients (0.5%), 2 degrees in three patients (0.8%), and by 1 degree in 17 patients (4.6%). Improvement was recorded: by 1 degree in 57 patients (15.5%), 2 degrees in 10 (2,7%) and 3 degrees in two patients (0.5%). Of 23 patients who underwent biopsy, neurological status improved in one (4.3%) and deteriorated also in one patient (4.3%). Of the 85 patients treated by posterolateral decompression, improvement was recorded in 25 (29.4%) and deterioration in two (2.4%). Of the 73 patients undergoing posterolateral decompression with stabilisation, neurological findings improved in 15 (17.9%) and deteriorated in five (6.0%). In the group of 103 patients treated by vertebrectomy, neurological findings improved in 13 (12.6%) and deteriorated in eight (7.8%). At an average follow-up of 15 months, 208 (55.7%) patients presented themselves of these, improvement in neurological status was recorded in 16 (7.8%) and deterioration in eight (3.9%), as compared with the pre-operative values.Any comparison with the literature data is difficult, because both the criteria of indication for surgery and the method of treatment differ considerably. Improvement in neurological status was achieved in 69 patients (18.8%).Metastatic tumours of the spine present a serious diagnosis, with pain often being the first sign of a malignant disease. The degree of neurological deficit, primary tumour site and the extent of metastatic spinal disease (objectively evaluated on the basis of the Tomita score) should determine whether the patient will be operated on or not and, if so, whether a radical or mere palliative procedure will be used. An important factor is multidisciplinary cooperation of attending physicians both preoperatively and during the post-operative care of cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The study aims to evaluate and compare the results of conservative and operative treatment of individual types of distal ulna fractures associated with distal radius fracture treated by plate osteosynthesis and to verify the conclusions of the other authors regarding the recommended therapeutic procedures in these fractures. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the period from 08/2013 to 09/2015, a total of 81 patients participated in the prospective randomised study, with the mean follow-up period of 24 months (6-36). All the fractures of distal two thirds of ulnar styloid process were treated conservatively. The patients with the other types of ulnar fractures (fractures of the proximal third of ulnar styloid process, ulnar head fractures, subcapital fractures) were systematically divided into two cohorts, based on which the subsequent (conservative vs. operative) treatment of distal ulna fractures was indicated. The operative treatment of all the types of distal ulna fractures was performed by plate osteosynthesis using LCP Distal Ulna Plate implant so that a uniform method is applied. RESULTS In the post-operative follow-up not a single patient with tip fracture of ulnar styloid process in the cohort showed a posttraumatic instability or disorder of distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) biomechanics (ROM 96.6% (91-100), MWS 61.3 points (75-100), QDASH 2.9 points (0-6.8)). The patients with a fracture of the proximal third of ulnar styloid process, a fracture of ulnar head and a subcapital fracture, treated operatively, achieved better early radiographic and functional outcome (ROM 95.7% (60-100), MWS 91.2 points (75-100), QDASH 3.5 points (0-11.4)) than patients treated conservatively (ROM 89.6% (64-100), MWS 70.4 points (35-85), QDASH 18.4 points (0-52.3)). DISCUSSION The study confirms the conclusions drawn by the other authors that tip fractures of ulna do not cause posttraumatic DRUJ instability and do not require operative treatment. Conservative treatment of ulnar base fractures led to non-union in 60% of cases and to malunion in 25% of cases, altogether in 15 patients (75%) the clinical examination revealed a conclusive posttraumatic DRUJ instability of various severity and these patients showed healing in malunion ad latus greater than 2 mm and non-union of the fracture. By performing anatomical reduction and osteosynthesis of ulnar \"base fractures\", the stability and DRUJ function were restored in all the patients, thus also a better functional outcome was attained. Conservative treatment of ulnar head fractures brought worse outcomes due to malunion of fractures resulting in a noncongruent articular surface of DRUJ or a change in axial position of the distal end of the bone. The change in DRUJ biomechanics resulted in a limited rotation of radius and a limited range of forearm mobility. The operative treatment of subcapital ulna fracture had a very good early outcome as compared to conservative treatment of the fracture which healed in malunion, the change of axial position of the distal end of the bone resulted in a limited range of forearm mobility. CONCLUSIONS Based on the early functional and radiographic outcomes of RCT study it can be stated, in agreement with the other authors, that the operative treatment of distal ulna fractures associated with the distal radius fracture treated by ORIF should be indicated for base fractures of ulnar styloid process associated with DRUJ instability following the osteosynthesis of distal radius fracture and peripheral fragment dislocation ad axim or ad latus in radial direction by 2 mm and more, and also in case of displaced ulnar head fractures and instable and displaced subcapital fractures of the ulna.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Hallux rigidus is common and degenerative arthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. The aim of this study was to assess the results of cheilectomy and total joint replacement (TJR) in patients with hallux rigidus. Minimum duration of followup was 18 months. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included fifty-nine patients who underwent surgery at our Department due to hallux rigidus between January 2013 and December 2014. Thirty-seven patients underwent cheilectomy and twenty-two patients had total joint arthroplasty using METIS®. The outcomes were assessed by comparing preoperative and postoperative ranges of motion, VAS (Visual Analogue Scale), AOFAS-HMI (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Hallux Metatarsophalangeal Interphalangeal) and patients' satisfaction with operative treatment. Preoperative and postoperative outcomes were compared for the individual types of surgery using the repeated measures ANOVA. The level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.01. RESULTS The mean age was 47.9 ± 7.0 years in patients who underwent cheilectomy and 62.5 ± 5.5 years in patients after TJR METIS®. There was a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in the VAS pain score and a significant improvement in dorsiflexion, range of movements, AOFAS-HMI scores in both the treatment groups. In both the groups more than 75% of patients reported good or excellent subjective results. DISCUSSION Our results are in agreement with findings of other studies assessing the results of cheilectomy and TJR surgery in patients with hallux rigidus. Direct comparison of the VAS pain score, AOFAS-HMI and ranges of motion across studies is difficult because of variability in the evaluation systems. Cheilectomy is mostly recommended for young active patients with mild osteoarthritis. Moreover, it is also possible to use minimally invasive surgery with early and reliable outcomes. At our Department, we perform cheilectomy also in younger patients with moderate osteoarthritis in order to extend the period of clinically acceptable results and thereby to postpone the TJR indication. TJR (similarly to arthrodesis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint) is a procedure performed in elderly patients with low physical activity and more advanced deformities. CONCLUSIONS Both the reported methods offer reliable and valuable short-term clinical outcomes with relatively low complication rate. Cheilectomy is undoubtedly more appropriate for younger patients with mild or moderate arthritic changes. Although it does not appear to alter the natural progression of the disease process, it provides satisfactory pain relief, motion improvement and overall patient gait comfort for patients in a short-term period. TJR seems to be a better solution for less active older patients to whom it provides a loadable, painless, and moving joint.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The purpose of the study is to compare the repeatability and reproducibility of quantitative and subjective evaluation of elbow humeroulnar incongruity (HUI) using computed tomography (CT) on an in vivo canine model. MATERIAL AND METHODS HUI was evaluated on canine (n = 50) elbow joints (n = 100). The computed tomography of elbow joints was performed under intravenous sedation. Multiplanar reconstructions (MPR) were produced. HUI was evaluated on sagittal MPR images subjectively and by measuring the subluxation index (SI). The SI was defined by measuring the distance between the centres of two circles, the shape of which corresponded the most with the shape of the trochlear notch of the ulna at sagittal crest and the shape of humeral trochlea. This distance was divided by the radius of the circle (r) defining the humeral trochlea. HUI was subjectively evaluated based on the width of the joint space at the greatest caudal convexity of the trochlear notch of the ulna. Three categories of HUI were established: 0 (congruent), 1 (moderately incongruent), 2 (strongly incongruent). Measurement and evaluation of HUI was conducted by two evaluators twice at a one-month interval between the first and second measurement. The statistical analysis was carried out using the repeated measures ANOVA and the Cohen s kappa coefficient. RESULTS The mean SI was 11.14 (SD 8.703). The SI values measured by two evaluators were statistically significantly different (p < 0.05). Contrarily, there was no statistically significant difference between the two measurements of the same evaluator (p > 0.05). The subjective evaluation of HUI done by two evaluators showed a mean to substantial agreement (Kappa = 0.53-0.79). There was a substantial to almost perfect agreement between the results of two evaluations carried out by a single evaluator (Kappa = 0.79-0.83). DISCUSSION The radiographic detection of moderate incongruity is unreliable, especially on account of wrongly positioned elbow joint, superposition of bone structures and due to the evaluation of three-dimensional bone structure through a two-dimensional image. Evaluation of humeroulnar congruity by computed tomography (CT) enables to assess the congruity of joints without the superposition of neighbouring bone structures. The quantification of humeroulnar incongruity using the SI does not show a higher degree of agreement between two evaluators as against the subjective evaluation of HUI. On the contrary, the agreement between two measurements of a single evaluator was high in both the cases. CONCLUSIONS Dog is a suitable model animal for evaluation of HUI of elbow joints due to frequent incidence of elbow dysplasia associated with HUI. The quantification of HUI at the expense of subjective evaluation of HUI is often overrated in radiological studies. Key words: dog, elbow, humeroulnar incongruity.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY In developing new or modifying the existing surgical treatment methods of spine conditions an integral part of ex vivo experiments is the assessment of mechanical, kinematic and dynamic properties of created constructions. The aim of the study is to create an appropriately validated numerical model of canine cervical spine in order to obtain a tool for basic research to be applied in cervical spine surgeries. For this purpose, canine is a suitable model due to the occurrence of similar cervical spine conditions in some breeds of dogs and in humans. The obtained model can also be used in research and in clinical veterinary practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS In order to create a 3D spine model, the LightSpeed 16 (GE, Milwaukee, USA) multidetector computed tomography was used to scan the cervical spine of Doberman Pinscher. The data were transmitted to Mimics 12 software (Materialise HQ, Belgium), in which the individual vertebrae were segmented on CT scans by thresholding. The vertebral geometry was exported to Rhinoceros software (McNeel North America, USA) for modelling, and subsequently the specialised software Abaqus (Dassault Systemes, France) was used to analyse the response of the physiological spine model to external load by the finite element method (FEM). All the FEM based numerical simulations were considered as nonlinear contact statistic tasks. In FEM analyses, angles between individual spinal segments were monitored in dependence on ventroflexion/ /dorziflexion. The data were validated using the latero-lateral radiographs of cervical spine of large breed dogs with no evident clinical signs of cervical spine conditions. The radiographs within the cervical spine range of motion were taken at three different positions: in neutral position, in maximal ventroflexion and in maximal dorziflexion. On X-rays, vertebral inclination angles in monitored spine positions were measured and compared with the results obtain0ed from FEM analyses of the numerical model. RESULTS It is obvious from the results that the physiological spine model tested by the finite element method shows a very similar mechanical behaviour as the physiological canine spine. The biggest difference identified between the resulting values was reported in C6-C7 segment in dorsiflexion (Δφ = 5.95%), or in C4-C5 segment in ventroflexion (Δφ = -3.09%). CONCLUSIONS The comparisons between the mobility of cervical spine in ventroflexion/dorsiflexion on radiographs of the real models and the simulated numerical model by finite element method showed a high degree of results conformity with a minimal difference. Therefore, for future experiments the validated numerical model can be used as a tool of basic research on condition that the results of analyses carried out by finite element method will be affected only by an insignificant error. The computer model, on the other hand, is merely a simplified system and in comparison with the real situation cannot fully evaluate the dynamics of the action of forces in time, their variability, and also the individual effects of supportive skeletal tissues. Based on what has been said above, it is obvious that there is a need to exercise restraint in interpreting the obtained results.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Radiolucent (RL) lines may appear around the total knee arthroplasty (TKA); they occur much more frequently under the tibial component than under the femoral one. The RL lines are gaps between the TKA and the cement, or between the cement and the bone bed. They are clearly visible immediately after the surgery or may appear later. They constitute pathology of the interface and are subject to research mainly due to their potential association with aseptic loosening. The aim of this study was to assess how often they are clearly visible on the first postoperative radiograph in everyday clinical practice, how they develop during the following two years, and to compare the results with the available professional literature. Another aim was to assess the relation between RL lines and the alignment of components, the patient's habitus and clinical outcomes of the surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS The group included 62 patients with a total number of 69 TKA implants, of which 28 were men (45.2%) and 34 women (54.8%) aged 46 to 79 years of age. The occurrence of RL lines was monitored on the first postoperative radiograph and subsequently at a one-year interval during the following 2 years. The location of RL lines and the placement of components were assessed radiographically in terms of the concept by Meneghini et al. The evaluation of surgical outcomes was done using the Knee Society Score (KSS), and the habitus was assessed with the BMI index. Subjective evaluation of the surgical outcome was done using the 4-point satisfaction scale. RESULTS The first postoperative radiographs showed a RL line at 9 (0.8%) locations in 9 (13.0%) TKAs. The control radiographs made 1 year after the surgery showed a RL line at 42 (3.8%) locations in 29 (42.0%) TKAs. During the last check conducted 2 years after the surgery, a RL line was detected at 60 (5.4%) locations in 33 (47.8%) TKAs. Throughout the follow-up period, progression of the existing RL line occurred at 6 locations in 6 (8.7%) TKAs. On the very contrary, the RL line disappeared at 8 locations in 6 (8.7%) TKAs. An association was found between the RL line occurrence and postoperative limb axis (a higher risk was posed by the varus deformity). Moreover, the frequency of RL lines increased with the growing BMI value. No relation was found between the KSS and satisfaction with the surgery and the occurrence of RL lines. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The occurrence of RL lines corresponds roughly with the frequency stated in literature. Some lines show progression, other disappear. So far, we have been unable to distinguish the predictively significant RL lines from the insignificant ones. Important will undoubtedly also be the size of surface of RL lines and their cause. More frequent RL lines were observed in the postoperative varus deformity of TKA and with the growing BMI value. The RL lines under the anterior part of the femoral component showed a tendency to progress. In order to avoid them we recommend modifying the cementing technique. Clinically significant is the fact that the RL lines occurrence correlates neither with subjective nor with clinical outcomes of the surgery.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Seven patients underwent anterior cervical spine surgery for trauma (two) or tumor infiltration (five) between 2008 and 2015. The tumor cases underwent corpectomy and anterior plating, with the trauma cases undergoing anterior cervical decompression and fusion using iliac crest bone graft. All surgeries were performed through the standard anterior approach. 0.2-0.25 ml of Kyphon cement were introduced into the screw holes before the screws were locked into the plate of the anterior construct. Karnofsky Index, Spinal Instability Neoplastic score (SINS) were calculated and radiographic follow-up performed. RESULTS Median follow-up was 7 months (range 7 weeks-39 months). There were no complications from cement leakage or construct failure during the follow-up period. There were no wound infections or approach-related complications. We did not have to re-operate on any patient, cervical spine remained stable until the end of follow up. DISCUSSION Until now a limited number of papers on cement augmentation of cervical spine mainly dealt with revision surgeries, when cement was used as rescue technique to re-establish stability of previous fixation or cement augmentation was performed in form of vertebroplasty following plate fixation. Our technique intends to prevent revision surgeries and to anchor all screws in holes which are evenly filled with bone cement. CONCLUSIONS This technique of cement augmentation is a useful adjunct in those few patients where a secondary posterior surgery would be high-risk due to the general health of the patient, or when life expectancy is limited. We have shown that anterior alone reconstruction of the cervical spine with cement augmentation of screws did provide sufficient and sufficiently long stability of the cervical spine which prevented catastrophic collapse and quadriplegia in patients in poor general condition.

The purpose of the present study is (i) to provide survival rates and prognostic factors for patients with ES which received treatment in a single center and (ii) to compare data with results of multicenter studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients (n = 38) were treated by the same surgeon whereas surgery was combined with radiotherapy in 55.3% of the patients (n = 21). Median age at diagnosis was 17.5 years (4.7-60) and the median follow-up time for all patients was 8.2 years (9.8 years for survivors, 3.2 years for non-survivors). RESULTS The survival rate for metastasis free sarcoma decreases from 90.5% to 50% for patients diagnosed with disseminated disease stage. Patients with a good response to chemotherapy survived in 83.3% of the cases. In addition, a higher OS was found for patients younger than 15 years (82.4%) when compared to patients older than 15 years (73.3%). In contrast, multicenter studies reported lower survival rates for metastasis free (~60%) and metastasis stages (< 40%). DISCUSSION The survival rates in the present single center study are higher than the rates reported from multi-center studies although same chemotherapy protocols were used and no substantially difference are apparent for patient population. CONCLUSIONS Based on the present data we re-emphasize that patients with Ewing sarcoma receive appropriate treatment in a large and qualified center particularly considering the survival rates. In addition, our data underline that a close collaboration between the oncological team and the experienced surgeon is crucial for patient's care.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The aim of our prospective study was to establish correlation between the arthro-MRI and arthroscopic findings in patients active in sports clinically suspected of having a hip labral tear. We sought to identify the benefits of arthro-MRI for clinical practice prior to the considered hip arthroscopy. MATERIAL AND METHODS The prospective study included 34 patients with hip pain and clinically suspected of having a labral tear. The group consisted of 19 men (55.9%) and 15 women (44.1%) of the mean age of 32.2 years (18 to 50 years). All our patients were active athletes, either professional (12; 35.3%) or recreational (22; 64.7%). Included in the study were exclusively patients aged 18-50 with hip pain lasting longer than 3 months, not responding to conservative therapy, with normal X-ray findings, or FAI syndrome. The patients underwent arthro-MRI and subsequently also hip arthroscopy, namely within no more than 3 months. The description of findings was translated into simple numerical scales, assessed using Spearman s rank correlation coefficient. We also examined the specificity, sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values and the odds ratio at various cut-off values of the scale for arthro-MRI. The statistical significance was set at the alpha level = 5%. The quality of tests was also evaluated using the ROC curve. RESULTS In hips assessed by the radiologist as reliably with no pathological finding (MRI type 1) the negative predictive value achieves 83.3% and the positive predictive value of 85.7%, with 96.0% sensitivity and 55.6% specificity. When evaluating the reliably negative finding together with the likely negative finding (MRI type 2) as against the pathological and certainly pathological findings (MRI type 3 and 4), the negative predictive value is 57.1%, the positive predictive value 95.0%, the specificity 88.9% and the sensitivity 76.0%. DISCUSSION In our study, the values achieved were comparable to or better than those reported by foreign authors in their studies establishing correlations between the arthro-MRI and intraoperative findings. Significantly higher was primarily the negative predictive value. CONCLUSIONS The results of our study indicate that the arthro-MRI performed as a part of preoperative examination prior to hip arthroscopy has adequate specificity and sensitivity in patients with suspected labral tear. Based on this examination a decision can be made as to whether to perform arthroscopy. Our study also shows that it is essential to have a highly competent radiologist to evaluate the arthro-MRI results.

The case described here concerns a very active 76-year-old patient with primary myelofibrosis. This is a rare hematological disease. It develops from clonal hematopoiesis with impaired blood formation and progressive bone marrow fibrosis. An MRI scan of the patients pelvis showed a marked spotted change over all of the imaged bone. Ultimately, in preoperative planning we decided in favor of a proven cementless implant (Allofit Alloclassic cup and the CLS Spotorno stem from Zimmer). Complication-free osseous integration of the cementless implants was observed. Histologic analysis of the bone showed a focally sclerotically altered bone structure. Neither osteoporosis nor osteopenia were found.

MATERIAL AND METHODSIt was a prospective, double-blind and randomized clinical trial.It included a total of 25 cases of ERH in 23 patients aged 18 to 60 years.They were divided into two arms: L-PRP arm with 10 cases and corticosteroid arm with 15 cases.The therapy of L-PRP group: first application: 3 ml of native L-PRP without activation, second application: after 6 weeks, 3 ml of thawed L-PRP.Therapy of the corticosteroid arm patients: first and second application (both after 6 weeks) of 3.5 mg of Betamethasonum.The follow-up period was 12 months.The safety evaluation was carried out based on the number of adverse events.The efficacy was evaluated using the DASH score and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).The time series outcomes were analysed statistically by percentile graphs and repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTSThe ascertained values of blood elements in the received L-PRP as against the original blood were the following: platelets around 400%, white blood cells around 200%, red blood cells around 30%.The differences in individual subpopulations of white blood cells: neutrophils 74%, lymphocytes 424%, monocytes 385%, eosinophils 43%, basophils 337%.The product was classified as L-PRP group based on the POSEIDO classification.Safety evaluation: both the groups reported no adverse and also no serious adverse events.One patient withdrew from the corticosteroid group on the grounds of a subjective feeling of treatment failure.Efficacy evaluation: for both the general DASH score and Work Module a statistically better effect of L-PRP was proven in the first 6 months at p < 0.05.For the general DASH score, the L-PRP group reported a decrease of difficulties from approximately 50% to 20% on DASH score and in the corticosteroid group the difficulties returned to more or less the initial value.In the Work Module, the L-PRP group showed a decline in difficulties from approximately 46% to 18% and the corticosteroid group from approximately 43% only to 38%.The Sports and Music Module was evaluated by percentile graphs only.The VAS assessment proved that an effect was achieved only after the administration of the first dose of L-PRP and corticosteroid, with a more significant effect reported in L-PRP.The overall statistical evaluation using the VAS showed no difference between these two therapies at the level of significance of p<0.05 (p = 0.08). DISCUSSIONThe product used by us was classified as a L-PRP subcategory.The application of the native and subsequently frozen L-PRP is rare as compared to the corticosteroid therapy. CONCLUSIONSAccording to our results, the application of L-PRP is suitable to treat lateral humeral epicondyle.The benefits can be foreseen in the form of a better functional score, whereas the analgesic effect equals the effect of corticosteroid.A slightly additive effect was seen in the thawed second dose.",

    "abstract": "Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is the most severe form of chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis. In children and adolescents, the metaphyses of long bones are affected most frequently, but the lesions can be found at any site on the skeleton, as well as in other organs such as the skin, eyes, gastrointestinal tract or lungs. Since the clinical signs of CRMO and its course are not invariable and clear, it is often very difficult to make a clinical diagnosis. The authors present their experience with the CRMO diagnosis in three cases. In the first patient, CRMO was localised in the left proximal tibia, left proximal femur, left sacrum and left clavicle bone. In the second patient, it was found in the left distal tibia, tarsometatarsal joints of the left foot and left distal femur. The third patient showed lesions in the inferior pubic ramus and ischial bone on the left side.With interdisciplinary co-operation it was possible to make the exact diagnosis of CRMO in all three female patients, and the disease was successfully managed. A precise therapeutic procedure could be derived from the results of randomised controlled studies which, however, cannot be made because of an infrequent occurrence of this disease. A meta-analysis of the cases so far published in the literature would be a more likely option.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe study aimed to evaluate the intraoperative and early postoperative response to simultaneous bilateral femoral osteotomy usually accompanied by soft tissue release of hip joints, or open reduction, capsuloplasty, pelvic osteotomy or extraarticular shelf procedure. MATERIAL AND METHODSA bilateral surgery was performed in 16 children.Twelve children suffered from (spastic) cerebral palsy and there was one case of paralytic dislocation in a patient with myelomeningocele, while the remaining patients suffered from chromosome I aberrations, Dandy-Walker syndrome and merosin-deficient muscular dystrophy.GMFCS Level IV and V prevailed.The patients with femoral head deformity or severe adduction contracture were removed from the study group.In all cases the LCP Pediatric Hip Plate 3.5 or 5.0 (Synthes) was used for osteosynthesis.The postoperative fixation by a hip spica cast was applied for 6 weeks, after which in most cases SWASH orthosis was used at night.The age of the patient, the hip joint finding, the GMFCS level and the type of procedure were recorded. RESULTSThe evaluation took into account the use of general anaesthesia only or a combination of general and epidural anaesthesia, most often through caudal block, duration of surgery, time when blood transfusion was necessary and the volumes of blood needed, duration of stay in the Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation Unit, or Intensive Care Unit.As a response to surgery, the changes in haemoglobin levels in g/l and VAS pain score were studied.In four patients only the operative time exceeded 3 hours.Blood transfusion was necessary in 13 patients, with one blood unit being always sufficient.Two patients were admitted to the Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation Unit, the remaining patients spent 1-3 days after surgery in the ICU.The average length of hospital stay did not exceed a week.The postoperative decrease in haemoglobin levels quickly improved.The pain intensity was regularly recorded postoperatively and on day 3-4 it was evaluated as moderate, with patients responding well to common analgesics (VAS 4-7). DISCUSSIONThe evaluation of duration of simultaneous bilateral procedure, postoperative recovery based on the need for blood transfusion, changes in blood count and VAS scores indicated that the procedure performed on both hip joints simultaneously does not significantly exceed the reasonable limits in terms of the patient s burden.In literature, we found only a single article on a topic of this sort, the conclusions of which are very similar. CONCLUSIONSThe simultaneous bilateral femoral osteotomy can be considered a fairly safe procedure.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Persistent catabolism is one of the main causes of delayed healing in polytrauma patients. The purpose of this study is to verify the effect of early administration of an anabolic steroid in combination with vitamin D on the process of bone healing in polytrauma patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this prospective study, the patients with a serious trauma were divided into two groups (a control group and a treatment group), with the treatment group being treated with nandrolone decanoate, an anabolic steroid in combination with vitamin D. In all the patients, bone metabolism markers and sex hormone levels (men only) were monitored through lab testing for the period of 70 days and the results of both the groups were subsequently compared. RESULTS The study included a total of 64 patients, 32 in the control group and 32 in the treatment group. The differences between the groups in gender (p = 0.387) as well as in the age of patients (p = 0.436) were statistically non-significant. There was a significant difference in the Injury Severity Score (48 in the treatment group as against 41 in the control group, p = 0.022). Even though this difference was statistically significant, it cannot be considered clinically significant since all the patients met the major trauma criteria. No positive effect of this treatment on bone metabolism parameters was established; on the very contrary, the only statistically significant changes were observed in the control group. To be specific, in levels of one of the bone formation markers, bone alkaline phosphatase on Day 7 after the injury (an increased level in the control group; p = 0.002) and in one of the bone resorption markers (bone acid phosphatase) on Day 70 after the injury (an increased level in the treatment group; p = 0.042). In the treatment group, 70 days after the injury a higher 25(OH)vitamin D level (p < 0.001) was reported and starting from Day 7 in men in the treatment group a significantly lower testosterone level and free testosterone level were observed. The level of androgenic hormones dramatically dropped in both the groups during the first days after the trauma, the dynamics of its normalization was faster in patients in the control group than in the treatment group. DISCUSSION The administration of nandrolone decanoate, an anabolic steroid, in combination with vitamin D did not produce the expected effect, i.e. an improvement in bone healing markers in polytrauma patients. One would expect that in polytrauma patients with a bone fracture or fractures during bone healing higher levels of all the markers of bone resorption as well as bone formation will persist. Similar increases in bone metabolism levels, however, were observed also in patients with injuries in other somatic regions. This indicates the importance of bone tissue involvement in the overall response of the organism to polytrauma. A faster normalization of the levels of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone and free testosterone in the control group compared to the treatment group corresponds with the supplemental effect of anabolic steroids and reduced production of these hormones as a feedback to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. CONCLUSIONS In the follow-up period, the positive effect of anabolic steroid and vitamin D administration on bone metabolism in polytrauma patients was not confirmed. Key words: polytrauma, anabolic steroids, vitamin D, bone metabolism.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The authors present an overview of polytrauma patients with urinary tract injuries managed in the Level I trauma centre. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency of injuries to the urinary system, the mechanism of their injury and the method of treatment in the cohort of polytrauma patients treated in the trauma centre. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 2012 and 2016, a total of 231 polytrauma patients were treated, of whom 47 (20.3%) also suffered a urotrauma. The renal trauma, ureteral trauma, bladder trauma and urethral trauma were classified according to the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) scoring scale. RESULTS The non-operative treatment was opted for in 24 patients (86%) with Grade I and II kidney injury, whereas a surgical revision was indicated in line with the European Association of Urology (EAU) Guidelines in 9 patients (100%) with Grade III renal trauma or higher. The bladder trauma was treated non-operatively in two patients (22.2%) with Grade I and II bladder injury and operatively in 7 patients (77.7%) with Grade III injury or higher. After the operative management of urogenital injuries in 18 patients (38%), complications occurred in 7 patients (39%). A total of 7 patients (14.9%) died as a consequence of polytrauma with urinary tract injuries and in 5 of them the death occurred within 30 days of polytrauma, but no urinary tract injury led directly to death of the patient. DISCUSSION Kidneys are the most frequently injured uropoietic organ. A civilian kidney trauma is present in up to 5% of trauma patients and accounts for 24% of abdominal injuries. The computed tomography scanning with intravenous contrast (CT IVU) remains the Gold Standard. In recent decades there was a shift in treating the prevailing majority of patients with a kidney trauma, namely from surgical revision to non-operative treatment. This trend was also observed by the authors in their own cohort. CONCLUSIONS Based on the evaluation of their own cohort of patients, the authors state that the diagnostic algorithm including CT IVU and also UCG in indicated patients are adequate to timely diagnose the urinary tract injuries, including polytraumas. The study confirmed that the most frequent injury to the urinary tract in polytrauma patients is the kidney trauma and that the urinary tract injury is not usually the cause of death in polytraumatized patients.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The aim of the present study was to determine the potential effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TGFB1 and IL-6 on the development and severity of the disease in patients with DDH and investigate the relationship of these two gene polymorphisms. MATERIAL AND METHODS This case control study was conducted on 105 patients diagnosed with DDH and 119 healthy control subjects of any age. The DDH patients were classified according to the Hartofilakidis and IHDI classifications for adult and pediatric patients, respectively. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples using the Salting-out method. TGFB1 gene p.Pro10Leu (c.29C>T) (rs1800470) and IL-6 572G>C (rs1800796) polymorphisms were analyzed using Sanger DNA sequencing. RESULTS There was no statistically significant relationship of TGFB1 and IL-6 SNPs for DDH. When the rs1800470 and rs1800796 polymorphisms were compared according to family history, the homozygous mutation rate of TGFB1 gene was found to be significantly higher in patients with a positive family history than in patients with a negative family history. No significant relationship was found between rs1800796 polymorphisms and family history. TGFB1 homozygous mutation rate was determined to be statistically higher in the positive family history group than control group. No similar relationship was found between the negative family history group and the control group. No statistically significant relationship was determined between rs1800470 and rs1800796 and the severity of DDH. CONCLUSIONS rs1800796 and rs1800470 polymorphisms do not appear to be major responsible genetic factors for DDH. However, the determination of a correlation between a positive family history and homozygous mutation rate of the TGFB1 gene indicates that this gene may have a greater effect on DDH development.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The purpose of the retrospective study is to analyse a group of patients surgically treated for cervical spondylodiscitis. The first hypothesis states that the removal of infected intervertebral disc without its anterior column reconstruction in the acute phase of infection results in worse clinical and radiological evaluation of the patient. The second hypothesis defines that the use of titanium implant in anterior column reconstruction in the chronic phase of infection increases the risk of recurrent infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS The evaluated group of patients who underwent surgery includes a total of 21 patients (8 females, 13 males) with the mean age of 57.6 years. 12 patients in the acute phase of infection were treated by anterior debridement without disc space reconstruction, of whom four patients were completed by posterior instrumented fusion in the second stage. In 9 patients in the chronic phase of infection radical anterior debridement was completed by anterior titanium implant reconstruction, of whom in five patients posterior instrumented fusion was performed in the second stage. All patients were clinically evaluated by mJOA, VAS and Frankel score preoperatively, at 6 months and at 1 year postoperatively. The radiologic evaluation assessed the instrumentation failure, spinal fusion and kyphosis progression measured by sagittal Cobb angle. RESULTS The mJOA values improved from the mean preoperative value of 1.6 to 13.15 (6M) and 13.3 (1Y) postoperatively (p = 0.055). The VAS score increased from the mean value of 8.5 preoperatively to 2.15 (6M) and 1.35 (1Y) postoperatively (p < 0.001). No patient reported worse neurological finding postoperatively. The kyphosis progression measured by sagittal Cobb angle from the preoperative +6.7 decreased to +3.2 degrees at 1 year after surgery. The group of 12 patients treated in the acute phase of infection by anterior debridement without anterior column reconstruction showed worsening of kyphosis from +1.1 before surgery to +1.6 degrees at 1 year after surgery. The group of eight patients treated in the chronic phase by anterior debridement and reconstruction of the anterior column by implant changed from +15.9 before surgery to +6.1 degrees at 1 year after surgery. In two out of 12 patients with neurological deficit, the T2-weighted MRI finding of signal hyperintensity showed no improvement of the neurological deficit. DISCUSSION In the group of all operated patients, neither the worsening in the clinical evaluation using the mJOA or VAS score, nor kyphosis progression measured by Cobb angle in the sagittal plane, or failure of instrumentation in the anteroposterior procedure were reported postoperatively. In a total of nine patients operated on during the chronic phase of infection, in whom titanium implant was used to reconstruct the anterior column defect, no recurrent deep infection was observed. CONCLUSIONS In the acute phase we prefer anterior debridement with epidural abscess evacuation without anterior column reconstruction and posterior instrumented fusion in case of kyphosis progression in the second stage. In the chronic phase, radical anterior debridement with titanium implant reconstruction, eventually with posterior instrumented fusion is preferred.

MATERIAL AND METHODSPatients were recruited in Hamad General Hospital, Doha, Qatar (HGH) and BG Trauma Center Ludwigshafen, Germany (BG).All patients that were treated with a pelvic fracture between 2013 and 2016 were included in this retrospective analysis.Demographic parameters were collected as well as type of injury and the frequency of complication parameters as pneumonia, acute kidney failure, ARDS, sepsis and amount of blood transfusion.1436 patients with pelvic fracture (645 from BG and 791 from HGH) were recruited.The mean age was 57.4 years in the BG and 33.6 years in the HGH group (p<0.000).The mean ISS was 17.81 in the BG and 15.88 in the HGH group (p=0.009).The mean pelvic AIS was 2.65 in the BG and 2.25 in the HGH group (p<0.000). RESULTSThe mean frequency of complications was 9.3% in the BG and 9.9% in the HGH group (p=0.128).The mean frequency of ARDS was significantly higher in the BG group than in the HGH group (5.6% vs. 1.8%, p<0.000).The mean frequency of blood transfusion was significantly lower in the BG group than in the HGH group (28.8% vs. 39.2%, p<0.000). CONCLUSIONSDespite significant differences in the two collectives, this analysis shows comparable results regarding early outcome parameters in patients with pelvic injuries.In total, pelvic injuries are accompanied by a relatively high complication risk and need to be evaluated and treated according to priority-based algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement rings are widely used for treatment of large acetabular defects but significant migration due to a lack of implant integration into the bone is a common problem. Although insufficient congruence between implant and acetabular bone has been identified main factor in early implant loosening, there are no reconstruction ring design parameters based upon anatomical data of the pelvis available.In this study such parameters were calculated on the basis of standardized computer tomograms of the hip region of 10 male and 10 female patients (40 data sets).The center of rotation, the acetabular entrance plane and the geometry of a simulated cranial and caudal flange of a reconstruction ring were determined. The flanges geometry was defined by the angles between the flanges and the entrance plane, the angle between the flange projections onto the entrance plane, the torsion and the width of each flange depending on the distance to the center of rotation, and the flanges torsion and width at their origin at the acetabular circumference.An optimal alignment between reconstruction ring and the periacetabular bone could be achieved with a medial angulation of 19.9 degrees +/- 19.4 degrees of the cranial and 14.7 degrees +/- 7.1 degrees of the caudal flange against the entrance plane. The angle between the flanges projections onto the entrance plane was calculated to be 162.2 degrees +/- 6.4 degrees . At its origin from the acetabular circumference the cranial flange is twisted 28.5 degrees , the caudal flange -0.8 degrees against the entrance plane. The maximal flanges widths were calculated to 21-54 mm for the cranial and 22-25 mm for the caudal flange depending on the distance from the acetabular circumference.The given design parameters may result in optimized implants respecting the pelvic anatomy and possibly providing improved fixation.",

In the case of vascular injury only, it was necessary to resect a 1-cm segment of the brachial artery which was thrombosed due to intimal disruption. In the other case, surgery was not indicated immediately; however, liberation of the nervus ulnaris and nervus medianus was later required because of nerve compression by the scar and bone. The author considers the exact diagnosis, precise reduction and stable fixation of a fracture to be most important for a good outcome of treatment. Any associated vascular injury is indicated for surgery only after a thorough diagnostic consideration, and may not be needed in every case. The most decisive factor is the clinical presentation.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe authors describe an arthroscopic procedure for multidirectional shoulder instability and its results in a group of their patients.They present a new argument to the widely accepted view that multidirectional instability of the shoulder is not an indication to surgical treatment. MATERIALA total of nine shoulders in seven patients were indicated to surgical intervention because of multidirectional shoulder instability.The average age of the patients was 19 years.Two patients underwent a bilateral procedure.Based on the preoperative clinical findings, two groups were distinguished: the patients with loose shoulders who, with overhead use of the arm, suffered from recurrent subluxations dorsally or caudally, and those who were able to voluntarily dislocate the glenohumeral joint as well as to reduce it spontaneously (habitual posterior dislocation).The patients were evaluated at oneyear follow-up using the Rowe and Zarins criteria.Patients with unidirectional instability of the shoulder were not included in the study. METHODSAll patients diagnosed with multiple recurrent posterior dislocations of the shoulder were indicated for surgery.After clinical examination, arthroscopy was carried out in a lateral recumbent position and, according to the findings, first capsulorrhaphy of the posterior capsule of the joint and reattachment of the labrum were performed, and then a similar intervention was carried out on the anterior part of the joint.For the operation, only two incisions were made, one for insertion of the arthroscope, the other for the instruments, and they were used interchangeably.Both absorbable and non-absorbable anchors were used and the capsule was fixed with a sliding knot.Subsequently, the shoulder was immobilized in a Desault bandage for 6 weeks, then rehabilitation was carried out.Full activity including sports was allowed beginning with the third month after surgery. RESULTSShoulder stability was achieved in all patients.After the procedure, no voluntary dislocation of the joint in the posterior direction or subluxations of the shoulder with overhead use of the arm were recorded.All patients, who had had serious problems pre-operatively, were satisfied with the results and would undergo the arthroscopic procedure again.Therefore, the therapy can be regarded as very effective. DISCUSSIONOur results of operative treatment contradict the generally accepted view that multidirectional shoulder instability is not indicated for surgical treatment, and the only therapy recommended to the patients is shoulder muscle strengthening, with avoidance of excessive motion range.This approach has persisted since the time when open surgery permitted either an anterior or a posterior intervention, but not both at the same stage.Today, arthroscopic reconstruction of the whole capsule is possible, with only a minimal interference with the shoulder muscles.Therefore, its benefits for the patients are undisputable. CONCLUSIONSArthroscopic stabilization of the shoulder for the treatment of multidirectional instability is a demanding procedure; however, if performed technically well, it is very efficient and provides good outcomes for patients with this diagnosis.",

To calculate the hip-joint reaction force a three-dimensional mathematical model of the hip in one-legged stance was used. In order to prepare the data as input to the mathematical model of the hip a nonhomogeneous scaling method based on a reference model of the hip musculature by Dostal and Andrews was applied. Our results show that the magnitude of the hip-joint reaction force and its inclination angle are significantly greater for females than for males. Since females have in addition significantly smaller femoral head radius than males, it may be concluded that the stress in the hip-joint articular surface is higher in the female population relative to the male population. Because the increased stress in the hip-joint articular surface is unfavourable regarding the arthrosis development, the presented results could partially explain the fact that females have greater incidence of arthrosis in the hip-joint than males.This is related not only to femoral, but also to pelvic geometry.",

Favourably priced hip prostheses with polyethylene cups and metal balls are available for very old patients with a moderate range of activity. Polyethylene wear of 100-300 microm per year is to be expected with these models. Ceramic balls (aluminium oxide for diameters 32 and 28 mm and zirconium oxide for 22 mm) paired with polyethylene cups are recommended for patients with a life expectancy of 10 to 20 years, because the expected polyethylene wear rate with this material combination is only 50-150 microm per annum. In other words, the life cycle of the polyethylene cup is doubled, when it is paired with a ceramic ball. A similar polyethylene wear rate is also to be expected with oxygen-deephardened TiAlNb metal balls, which are currently the subject of a clinical field study. Last but not least, CoCrMoC metal/metal and AI2O3 ceramic/ceramic pairings, which have the lowest wear rate of 2 to 20 microm/year. are available for highly active patients with a life expectancy of more than 20 years. As far as the cup/ball pairing is concerned and under the current pressure of costs, the surgeon should be able to select the optimum hip prosthesis model for every patient from these three categories.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Periprosthetic distal femoral fractures (PDFF) constitute an unpleasant complication in patients with a total knee replacement (TKR). The incidence reported in literature is 0.3-2.5 %. The number of periprosthetic knee fractures has been increasing due to the ageing of population, a growing number of implants, a longer life expectancy of patients, a more intensive physical activity of patients, and osteoporosis. Most of these fractures are treated surgically, non-surgical treatment is reserved solely for patients unable to undergo a surgery for general health conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS Our retrospective study evaluated the group of patients with PDFF who were treated at out department in the period 2007- 2016 and 2,975 primary TKR were performed. The total number of patients with PDFF was 56. The mean age of patients with PDFF was 77 years (56-94 years) and at the time of fracture the mean age was 71 years in men and 78 years in women. The average time from the TKR to periprosthetic fracture was 8.2 years (0-20 years). The fractures were assessed using the Su classification modified by Krbec. RESULTS A primary TKR was performed in 46 cases for gonarthrosis, in 6 cases for rheumatoid arthritis and in 4 cases for secondary, post-traumatic gonarthrosis. The average incidence of periprosthetic distal femoral fractures was 5-6 cases per year. Women represented 86 %, men 14 %. Su Type I fracture was diagnosed in 25 % of cases, Su Type II fractures in 71 %, and Su Type III fractures 4 %. 52 patients with PDFF were treated surgically, in 4 cases conservative treatment was opted for. The average treatment time of PDFF to healing by callus formation was 6.6 months (3-12 months). Mortality during the first 3 months after osteosynthesis of PDFF was 9 %. A failure of osteosynthesis of PDFF was reported in 4 cases. DISCUSSION Multiple classification systems were developed to assess these fractures. The most appropriate we consider the classification of Su et al. classifying the PDFF into 3 groups, namely based on the height of the fracture line relative to the femoral component. Osteosynthesis by retrograde femoral nail is indicated for periprosthetic fractures, with sufficient bone mass in distal femur, which allows stable distal fixation. The new generation of anatomically shaped angular stable implants gives us yet another option for osteosynthesis of PDFF. Many studies point at the advantages of these implants in osteoporotic bone as against the conventional plates. CONCLUSIONS The number of PDFF has been increasing. The main methods of internal osteosynthesis continue to be the angular stable plates and the retrograde femoral nail. Preoperative planning is important to determine the type and dimensions of the existing femoral component and to distinguish whether or not it has come loose. The choice of the implant may depend on the bone mass available for distal fixation. The retrograde femoral nail is usually the most suitable method of treatment for proximal PDFF (Su Type I). The angular stable plates can be used for PDFF originating at the femoral component (Su Type II and Type III). Very distal fractures classified as Su Type III with a loose femoral component require a revision surgery with a TKR with stems. The surgeon should be prepared for a revision surgery if the intraoperative finding is more complicated than anticipated based on the preoperative radiograph. Key words:total knee arthroplasty, periprosthetic fracture, osteosynthesis.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS Since 2015 we have performed the interposition arthroplasty combined with suspension arthroplasty using the TIE-IN implant in 12 patients, mostly indicated for stage IV rhizarthrosis. In two cases stage III rhizarthrosis with concomitant trapezium destruction was present. In two other cases the patients suffered from secondary osteoarthrosis associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Pain under loads was present in all the patients, of whom in 10 patients also the pain at rest occurred. Preoperatively, a total of 10 patients showed subluxation of the first carpometacarpal joint of 50% of the articular surface width. The ratio between the dominant and non-dominant extremity was 1:1. As a part of the evaluation, correlation was established between the preoperative findings and the postoperative results at 3 months follow-up. The examination included the assessment of pain intensity by VAS scale, the range of motion measurement - by Kapandji thumb opposition test, handgrip strength test and functional evaluation using the scoring systems - DASH score, modified DASH score for thumb, and modified Wrightington score. RESULTS No intraoperative or postoperative complications such as infection, complex regional pain syndrome, implant failure or failed surgical procedure were reported in the given group of patients. The pain at rest ceased in all 12 patients. The VAS pain intensity score improved from the preoperative average of 5.8 to 0.8 postoperatively. The range of motion in all the patients with stage IV rhizarthrosis substantially improved. The average Kapandji thumb opposition score increased from 6.9 preoperatively to 9.5 postoperatively. DISCUSSION There are multiple surgical treatment options for advanced rhizarthrosis. Apart from the combination of interposition and suspension arthroplasty referred to above, it is trapeziometacarpal (TMC) arthrodesis on the one hand and carpometacarpal joint total arthroplasty on the other hand. The arthrodesis continues to be a fairly frequently used procedure, despite the final limitation of thumb movement. It is because of this loss of fine motor function why it is not the preferred technique for treating advanced rhizarthrosis at our department. On the very contrary, the total replacement of the TMC joint is at our department as well as at many other departments the treatment of choice for advanced symptomatic rhizarthrosis since in conservative resection of the articular surfaces the biomechanics of the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb is preserved. As an outcome, this technique combines the advantages of other surgical methods by ensuring full painless range of motion and strength of the joint as opposed to other techniques, which mostly result either in a limited movement, or in a loss of grip strength. There is a whole range of resection arthroplasty techniques available. From simple trapeziectomy, which leads to the radial column collapse and ultimately to a major functional deficit, up to various interposition or suspension arthroplasty techniques with the resulting range of motion, stability and thus grip strength depending on the technique applied. CONCLUSIONS By applying the combination of the interposition and suspension arthroplasty of the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb using the TIE-IN implant we preserve the length of the thumb, its stability, and thus achieve the recovery of adequate thumb range of motion and grip strength. Our conclusions are in correlation with the results obtained at reference centres. Key words:rhizarthrosis, trapeziometacarpal prosthesis, arthroplasty, trapezium implant.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The purpose of the study was to evaluate tibio-femoral rotation during a simulated squat and to investigate the relationship between the rotational position of the femur in full extension and the amount of external rotation of the femur on the tibia during flexion. MATERIAL AND METHODS Part 1: MRIs of volunteers Data on healthy knees of 10 volunteers were obtained using 2D MRI measurements. The foot and the ankle were fixed to prevent rotation and adduction/abduction movements. Sagittal MRIs of the knees have been performed in 4 positions of flexion. The amount of longitudinal rotation in each position of flexion was calculated. Part 2: Mathematical model experiment a) The model of the femur has been positioned in the 3D coordinate system in full extension and at 12.8° of internal rotation and then flexed to 90° without longitudinal rotation. The distance between the centre of the femoral head and the sagittal plane passing through the centre of the knee was then measured. b) Subsequently, the femur was flexed and rotation allowed to retain femoral head within the sagittal plane. The amount of femoral rotation was then calculated. RESULTS Part 1: In full extension the femur was on average in 12.8° of IR relative to the tibia. By 90° flexion femur rotated on average 12.2° externally. Part 2: a)From full extension to 90° flexion the femoral head moved 93.1 mm laterally from the sagittal plane. b)Between full extension and 90° flexion the femur rotated 12.8° externally, a degree which corresponds to the amount of initial internal rotation of the femur in full extension. DISCUSSION The most important finding of the presented in vivo study lies in the fact that in normal knees with tibia rotationally fixed flexion is always coupled with femoral external rotation in order to keep the femoral head in the acetabulum. This rotation is obligatory. CONCLUSIONS We have demonstrated that if the tibia is rotationally fixed, the knee flexion is possible only when accompanied by femoral external rotation to keep the femoral head in the acetabulum. A mathematical description of the experiment has been proposed, the results of which confirm the stated premise. This finding can be explained by initial internal rotation of the femur in full extension of the knee and is allowed by the shape of articulating bones and tension of soft tissues Key words: knee, terminal extension, knee rotation, knee movement, MRI, hip joint.",

We here describe a 65-year-old male, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class 3 - patient, with a severely destructed right elbow due to septic arthritis with Staphylococcus aureus. His treatment consisted of multiple irrigation and debridement procedures including resection of the distal humerus, soft tissue coverage by local rotational flap and the use of a gentamicin-vancomycin loaded PMMA spacer, i.v. and oral antibiotics. After eradication of infection, a constraint cemented TEA could then successfully be performed eight months after the initial surgery and twenty-five weeks after the last debridement procedure. Twenty-one months after the TEA, the patient remained infect free and shows excellent functional results: Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score: 38.3, Broberg and Morrey score: 91/100, Mayo elbow score: 95/100. To the best of our knowledge this is the first case in the literature that demonstrates TEA after septic elbow arthritis with Staphylococcus aureus. Although TEA is known as a typical surgical procedure with a low volume in numbers and higher complication rates, such as elevated infection rates compared to other types of arthroplasty, septic arthritis with Staphylococcus aureuscan successfully be performed after eradication of the infection and targeted antibiotic therapy.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 25 patients were treated by proximal row carpectomy for degenerative changes of the wrist as a consequence of the previous trauma or avascular necrosis of the lunate bone, of whom 21 patients underwent a follow-up examination at least 5 years postoperatively. Proximal row carpectomy was indicated in 15 patients for SLAC wrist, in 4 patients for avascular necrosis of the lunate bone, in 1 patient for SNAC wrist, and in 1 patient for inveterate dislocation of the wrist. The follow-up clinical and radiological examinations were performed at least 5 years after the surgery. The range of wrist motion, grip strength, presence of pain at rest or pain under loads, total clinical score according to the Green and O'Brien scoring system, patient satisfaction with the outcome of surgery were assessed. By fluoroscopy the range of wrist motion, degenerative changes of the radiocapitate joint, and translation of the capitate bone with respect to the distal radius were evaluated. RESULTS Postoperative improvements in the range of motion and grip strength were confirmed. Also, the pain relief at rest and under loads was achieved. Five years after the surgery, most of the patients (85.6%) reported an overall improvement. The total clinical score according to the Green and O'Brien scoring system improved from 35.8 preoperatively to 63.1 postoperatively. DISCUSSION The advantage of this procedure is a low percentage of complications, relative technical simplicity, maintenance of functional motion of the wrist, satisfactory grip strength, and pain relief. There are no complications related to the implant, no risk of a non-union. CONCLUSIONS As shown by our results obtained 5 years after the surgery as well as the published data, in the indicated cases the proximal row carpectomy is an appropriate surgical technique to treat the degenerative changes of the wrist. In most of the patients, favourable functional results and pain relief can be expected.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective evaluation was performed in 5 patients who had undergone surgery in the period from July 2015 to the end of 2016 using a new anatomical symphysial plate for pelvic ring injury. In four cases a stabilisation of symphyseolysis was carried out and in one case osteosynthesis of bilateral rami fracture near the symphysis was performed. The posterior pelvic segment was fixed 3 times by iliosacral screws and 2 times by a transsacral bar. All the surgeries in symphysis region were performed via a modified anterior suprapubic approach. A total of 3 men and 2 women with the mean age of 54.6 years (range 19-77 years) were operated. The mean follow-up period of five patients was 12.6 months. Also, preliminary evaluation of postoperative clinical and radiological outcomes was conducted on a very heterogenous group of patients. RESULTS The postoperative radiological outcome assessed by Pohlemann score was excellent in all the cases. After 3-6 months, screw loosening was reported in 3 cases, with no impact on the overall result of the surgery, in one case the symphysis widened 2 mm with simultaneous loosening of two screws, with no impact on the clinical result either. Clinical evaluation of the results was conducted in 4 patients using the Majeed score with the mean follow-up of 12.6 months, the score achieved was 98, 86, 72 and 49 points. In one patient the results could not be evaluated due to concurrent spinal cord injury with quadriplegia. Nonetheless, even this patient has no difficulty in sitting in a rehabilitation wheelchair. No serious intraoperative or early postoperative complications were reported. As regards late complications, one female colostomy patient developed deep infection three months after the primary surgery. DISCUSSION The first clinical as well as radiological outcomes in our small group of patients are comparable to the outcomes of larger groups using multi-hole plates to stabilise the anterior segment, or the application of 2 plates. In agreement with other authors, the new plates can be applied through a less invasive operative approach avoiding the necessity to transect rectus abdominis muscles. The results of earlier biomechanical studies suggest that their strength will equal 2 inserted plates, or will be comparable to multi-hole plates. CONCLUSIONS The first experience with the use of new anatomical symphysial plates are promising. The new types of plates intended for anterior pelvic segment facilitate fixation by screws inserted at two levels. They significantly improve the stability of fixation and can replace the commonly used 2 plates. The only limiting factor of our group of patients is its small size. Comparative weight-bearing tests shall be performed in the future. Key words:symphysis pubic disruption, pelvic ring fractures, pelvic instability, new symphyseal plates.",

Objective measurement data of the gait were obtained by using a three-dimensional motion analysis system with six infrared cameras and three force plates before and after training with the 3D pedal system. RESULTS The mean age was 36.7 ± 8.7 years and the subjects had a BMI of 21.8 ± 2.4 kg/m 2 . The training time per year was an average of 36.0 ± 11.2 days, with a training workload of 511.4 ± 36.7 km. For time-distance parameters, improvements for the left and right side were obtained for cadence and cycle time after training. In total, there was a reduction in hip abduction angle, and an increase in hip inward rotation, knee outward rotation, and range of the frontal knee angle.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Our study included 34 patients with refractory plantar fasciitis, in whom endoscopic treatment of inferior calcar calcanei with partial plantar fasciotomy was performed in the period from 01. 01. 2009 to 31. 07. 2015. The assessed parameters were the following: level of function, pain relief and patient satisfaction on the FAAM (Foot and Ankle Ability Measure) score and VAS (Visual Analog Scale) score with the minimum follow-up of 1 year. RESULTS A marked increase in the FAAM score from 39.2 preoperatively to 94.0 one year after the surgery and also a major pain relief on the VAS score from the initial 8 to the median 0 were observed. In total, 79.4% of patients were symptom-free one year after the surgery. The recurrence of calcar calcanei or ossification was seen on the radiograph taken one year after the surgery in 8 patients (23.5 %). DISCUSSION In our opinion, the most important outcome of our study is the considerable reduction in pain postoperatively (the median VAS score declined from 8 to 0 one year after the surgery) and concurrently a notable increase in the FAAM score (from 39.2 preoperatively to 94.0 one year after the surgery). Similar results of endoscopic partial fasciotomy were achieved also by some other authors. Therefore, this method can be considered validated. It has also been proven that the correlation between the calcar calcanei recurrence, or a higher BMI and recurrence of symptoms postoperatively is insignificant. CONCLUSIONS The endoscopic treatment of inferior calcar calcanei and plantar fasciotomy with denervation of fascial attachment is a fast, minimally invasive and safe method which brings very satisfactory results in the treatment of refractory plantar fasciitis. It is evidenced by subjective patient satisfaction, great function improvement, considerable pain relief after the surgery together with a minimum incidence of complications.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Back pain and pathologies of the spine are among the main reasons why people consult a doctor, both general practitioners and paediatricians, as well as, specifically, orthopaedists, surgeons, and neurosurgeons. This involvement of different faculties calls for a high degree of interdisciplinary co-operation. In order to mediate these aspects of spine-specific diagnostics, therapy, and research to students during their studies and to promote up-and-coming specialists, the compulsory elective subject 'Spine' was established. MATERIAL AND METHODS From the winter semester of 2013 to the winter semester of 2014, the compulsory elective subject 'Spine' was offered to interested students in the 7th semester of their studies of human medicine. The maximum number of participants per course was 16. Each course lasted four weeks. The subjects taught covered the fields of degeneration, deformities, and destruction in the specialist disciplines of orthopaedics, traumatology, neurosurgery, and rehabilitation medicine. In addition, orthopaedic technology and the local musculoskeletal and biomechanical research institute were integrated into the course. Various teaching methods were applied, including problem oriented learning, seminars, observation or consultation, and internship. At the end, the course was evaluated with regard to subjective learning success, knowledge gain, satisfaction, and interdisciplinarity. Participants were compared with all students of the semester employing an objectively structured clinical examination (OSCE). RESULTS Forty-eight students took part in the compulsory elective subject 'Spine'. The compulsory elective subject was given a positive rating in all fields. In the learning success control, all of the students had good to very good results. Students attending the elective subject performed significantly better in the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) (p ≤ 0.001). The compulsory elective course continues to be offered in the curriculum with a slightly altered schedule. CONCLUSIONS In view of the high prevalence of patients with back pain and its associated importance in terms of healthcare policy and social relevance, our experience leads us to recommend the general integration of such a compulsory elective subject in the study of human medicine.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYAtlantoaxial Rotatory Dislocation (AARD) mostly occurs in children and prevailing majority of cases are successfully managed by non-operative treatment.Surgical intervention is necessary in patients in whom non-operative treatment failed, in case of repeated dislocations and in patients with anatomical defects of the atlantoaxial complex.The purpose of the presented study is the radiological and clinical evaluation of patients with AARD surgically treated at our department. MATERIAL AND METHODSIn the period from 2001 to 2017, altogether 15 patients with AARD were surgically treated at our department, namely 6 men and 9 women aged 5-72 years, with the mean age of 27.3 years.8 patients were younger than 18 years of age.Apart from regular checks, all the patients were examined also at the end of the study, which means at a follow-up of 12-214 months, i.e. 112.1 months postoperatively on average.In the study, the anatomy of the atlantoaxial complex and craniocervical junction, course of the surgical procedure, correction of deformity, bone fusion, clinical condition of the patient and complications were monitored and evaluated.The clinical evaluation was performed using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for neck pain and the Neck Disability Index (NDI).All the parameters were statistically evaluated at the p-level below 0.05. RESULTSIn all 15 patients the surgery was preceded by unsuccessful non-operative treatment.The period between the rotation and the surgery was 4 days to 48 months, with the mean value of 11.3 months.All the patients included in the study showed an intact dens axis, the other patients were excluded from the study.In 10 patients their head was rotated to the left, in 5 patients to the right.The anterior atlantodental interval (ADI) was 2-7 mm with the mean value of 3.5 mm.In 13 cases the ADI was less than 5 mm, in 2 cases it was greater.According to the Fielding and Hawkins classification there were 9 cases of type I, 4 cases of type II and two cases of type III.According to the Ishii et al. classification, 2 cases of type I, 12 cases of type II and one case of type III were identified.In 9 patients predisposing factors were found in the history, namely 7 cases of trauma, 2 cases of infection.Mutual rotation of C1-C2 from 7.0° to 60.0° with the mean value of 27.3° was observed preoperatively, while after the correction it was from 1.0° to 7.0° with the mean value of 3.9° (p < 0.05).Lateral inclination was 3.4°-23.6°preoperatively with the mean value of 9.9°, and 0.7°-4.0°after the correction with the mean value of 2.2°( p < 0.05).The postoperative ADI ranged from 1 to 3 mm, with the mean value of 1.9 mm (p < 0.05).The bone fusion of C1-C2 or C1-C2-C3 was achieved in all the relevant cases (N = 13, 100%), in two patients a temporary fixation was used.The mean value of VAS for neck pain was 6.3 preoperatively, 1.0 (p < 0.05) at one year and 1.0 (p < 0.05) again at the final examination.The mean value of NDI was 50.4 % preoperatively, 9.3% (p < 0.05) at one year and 9.5% (p < 0.05) at the final examination.All patients that we operated on stated that they would undergo surgery again. DISCUSSIONCompared to the other authors, our group of patients included surprisingly many adult patients (46.7%) with a high percentage of neurological defects (33.3%).In agreement with the literature, the cause of rotation was revealed in 60% of cases.At our department, correction is preferred in all the patients, while especially in paediatric patients in situ fixation causes the developmental deformities of the face and cervical spine.High success rate of bone fusion was confirmed (13/15, 13 = 100%) and also the transient atlantoaxial fixation was successfully used in two patients, both with traumatic etiology. CONCLUSIONSIf non-operative treatment fails, surgical correction of AARD is a suitable treatment method which ensures favourable position of the atlantoaxial complex, improves the clinical condition of the patient and prevents the asymmetric development of the face in children.The Goel-Harm's fixation technique and C1-C2 fusion are considered by us the method of choice in older paediatric and adult patients.",

The indication criteria, however, are not yet fully supported by long term results of large patient groups in recent literature. The purpose of our study is to present the 2-year outcomes after hip arthroscopy. MATERIAL AND METHODS In our study 203 patients (110 women, 93 men) with the mean age of 34 years (17-67 years) were evaluated. The mean NAHS score was 87/100 at 24 months after the surgery, which represents a statistically significant improvement compared to the preoperative values (p < 0.02). RESULTS The patients were divided into four groups based on their clinical results. Group 1 with NAHS score of 90-100 included 84 patients, Group 2 with NAHS 80-90 had 86 patients, Group 3 with NAHS 70-80 had 17 patients, and Group 4 with NAHS below 70 consisted of 10 patients. The rate of serious complications was 6% (12/197 patients). CONCLUSIONS Hip arthroscopy is an effective and safe method of treatment of hip pathology. It is a technically demanding procedure that requires exact indication criteria in order to reach excellent clinical results.

The case report describes a case of a 48-year-old woman with no treatment for epileptic seizures in her medical history. During the first seizure she sustained a bilateral dorsal fracture-dislocation caused by a muscle spasm, without any other mechanical impact. The fractures were classified as a 3-fragment fracture on the right side and a 4-fragment fracture on the left side. After the patient's admission to the inpatient emergency department, reduction under anaesthesia was attempted. Subsequently, after preparation, open reduction and osteosynthesis using an angularly stable plate were performed as a two-stage surgery.

Patients who were operated for 5th metacarpal neck fractures between 2019 and 2022 were evaluated retrospectively. Regarding the surgical treatment methods, patients were assessed by dividing them into two groups. The first group comprised patients who underwent treatment with an intramedullary K-wire. The second group comprises patients who underwent transverse K-wire fixation. The average quick DASH score of all patients was 5.6±4.7 in the intramedullary K-wire fixation group and 5.9±5.1 in the transverse K-wire fixation group. An average 5th finger metacarpophalangeal joint extension limitation was 6.2±5.7° in the intramedullary fixation group and 6.1±5.8° in the transverse K-wire group. The mean radiological union time was 4.9±0.7 weeks in the intramedullary fixation group and 5.1±0.7 weeks in the transverse K-wire group. No statistically significant difference was found between the quick DASH scores and degrees of the MCP joint extension limitation ( p=0.785). Intramedullary fixation and transverse K-wire fixations are effective surgical treatment methods for metacarpal neck fractures. It has been reported that the intramedullary fixation method in metacarpal bone fractures is more effective than the fixation methods with cross and transverse K-wire.

Retrospective data of cases admitted to emergency department following punch injury between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2022. was collected. Patient's demographic data, the dominant and injured upper extremity side, punched object, a time of patient admission were recorded. Smoking habit and blood ethanol level were documented. Trauma mechanism, diagnosis (1: dermabrasions: skin, 2: lacerations: neurovascular structures or tendons and 3: osseous pathologies), treatment modalities were analyzed. Outcomes were assessed using the DASH questionnaire (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand) at the last follow-up. A total of 1052 patients (male=968 (92%), female=84 (8%)) with mean age 24.6 ± 7.2 included this study. Six hundred and twenty-one (59%) patients punched a solid object and 675 (64%) had osseous pathology. The most commonly fractured bone, injured tendon, injured nerve, and injured artery were 5th metacarpal, extensor digitorum communis (EDC), ulnar nerve, and ulnar artery, respectively. The majority of the patients, (73%) were smokers while 15% of the patients had high level of blood ethanol concentration on admission (82±12.3 mg/100 ml). A comparison between smokers and non-smokers did not reveal any significant differences (p=0.425) in terms of diagnosis whereas 74% of alcoholic patients admitted with lacerations which was statistically significant (p=0.023). Injuries of 321 (30.5%) patients required surgery in the operating room, while 711(67.5 %) patients received interventions in the emergency room setting. The average DASH score differed between subgroups, with significantly higher scores in patients with laceration type injuries (7.2 SD), indicating more disability (p=0.001) DISCUSSION. The study reveales a high prevalence of hand injuries among individuals aged 18 to 40, with the dominant hand being most affected, primarily due to physical violence and self-harming behaviors. Primary contributing factors to this pattern are the escalated incidents of physical violence and self-harming behaviors arising from an inability to manage anger impulses. Punching solid objects, especially during late afternoon and evening periods often associated with alcohol use, was a common cause, resulting in metacarpal fractures being the most reported injury. Multiple tendon and nerve injuries were frequent, highlighting the severity and complexity of these traumas, often necessitating surgical intervention. These findings highlight the several key aspects, including demographic characteristics of the patient population, common causes and types of injuries observed, and the association between alcohol use as well as the specific injury profiles. Satisfactory results can be achieved with both conservative and surgical treatment for punch injuries. punching, fisting, boxing injuries, laceration, blood ethanol level.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to evaluate the results of closed reduction and epiphyseodesis of unstable slips of the proximal femoral epiphysis. The hypothesis was that the clinical and radiological results of this method and incidence of avascular necrosis are comparable to the results of closed reduction and open reduction using surgical hip dislocation reported by literature. In the period 2013-2023, 20 patients were treated for unstable slips in one institution. Whereas the boys were older (mean age of 13.4 years) than girls (mean age of 11.6 years), the gender distribution was equal. Acute on chronic slips prevailed over the acute slips (ratio 3:1). The slips were treated using the closed reduction, transphyseal fixation and capsular decompression at 6 to 240 hours after slip (81 hours on average). All patients were treated concurrently on the contralateral side as the prevention of the slip or to treat the grade I slips (two patients). The follow-up ranged from 7 months to 7 years. Clinical results were evaluated according to two scores: 1) own score (Bulovka University Hopspital score) based on the reduction of ROM, shortening of extremity and limitations of activities; 2) D'Aubigne-Postel score. In the radiological evaluation, correction of slip angle, alpha-angle, avascular necrosis (AVN) and the prominence of the anterior margin of the femoral neck on axial radiographs were evaluated. According to the Bulovka University Hospital score, there were 10 excellent results (50%) with no limitation of activity, including sport, in tree cases the results were very good (15%) and in five cases good (25%), respectively, with some limitation of activity, and two results were unsatisfactory (10%) with severe limitation of activity due to the AVN. According to the D'Aubigne-Postel score, there were 14 excellent results (70%), four good results (20%), and two unsatisfactory results (10%). The slip reduction was as follows: under 20 deg. in five patients; under 30 deg. in 10 patients, and over 30 deg. in five patients, respectively. Alfa-angle was greater than 63 degrees (range 45-88 deg.) on average. Prominence of the off-set epiphysis-femoral neck and femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) were observed in six patients. Remodelling of this prominence was seen in one patient four years after surgery. Shortening of the femoral neck over 1 cm was reported in two patients. Complete AVN with severe deformity of the hip was noted in two patients. Our hypothesis was confirmed because the results of treatment of the unstable slips by closed reduction are comparable with the published results of the same method and with surgical hip dislocation. The results correspond with those of large published cohorts of patients concerning the correction as well as rate of complications. According to our results, urgent gentle closed reduction, transphyseal fixation and capsular decompression represent efficient and relatively safe methods of treatment of unstable slips with low incidence of complication. Residual deformity of the off-set epiphysis-femoral neck and FAI represent limitations of this method. slipped proximal femoral epiphysis, unstable slips, closed reduction, transphyseal fixation.",

This review outlines the practical approach to surgical management of PFF that relies on increasing evidence of safety of early surgery in patients with PFF receiving antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy. We have also used information from the existing evidence-based guidelines for elective/planned surgery in patients with antithrombotic therapy. The practical approach can be summarised as follows: • Antiplatelet therapy - discontinuation of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and clopidogrel in monotherapy or in combination is not necessary prior to surgery. In case of bleeding, antifibrinolytic therapy is recommended as well as administration of platelet concentrate which is rarely needed. • In patients taking warfarin, reversal of its effects is recommended by early administration of vitamin K to allow surgery to be performed within 24 hours. Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) as a second-line drug is reserved for extreme cases only. Warfarin therapy is resumed 24 hours after surgery. • Direct oral anticoagulants must be discontinued 24-48 hours prior to surgery, possibly longer depending on the type of drug, time of administration of the last dose, and renal function. In extreme cases, an antidote (idarucizumab, off-label andexanet) can be administered prior to surgery, or PCC in case they are unavailable. Anticoagulation therapy is resumed in 24-48 hours. • Neuraxial anaesthesia is possible when ASA is taken by the patient and in case of effective warfarin reversal. • In early surgery and rapid restart of anticoagulant therapy, bridging therapy with LMWH is not indicated except for in cases with extreme risk of thrombosis.

Therefore, it is necessary to be familiar with intraoperative techniques to control the correct rotation, mostly clinical and radiological, which give us the possibility to minimize rotational errors. In the postoperative period, with even a slight suspicion of malrotation, it is necessary to proceed to its exact verification and, in indicated cases, to perform necessary correction. We recommend one of the CT techniques as a very reliable method, however in younger patients we prefer to use MRI. Early diagnosis of the rotational error and especially its size is essential from the point of view of potential reconstructive surgery, which is then chosen also with regard to the location of the original lesion.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY This retrospective study investigated the significance of a combination of peak latency of waveform amplitude and waveform amplitude in association with spinal deformities. The correlation with postoperative neurologic deficit was evaluated too. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between January 2007 and January 2018, a group of 113 patients was evaluated in the study who underwent spine surgery using intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) focusing on transcranial motor evoked potential (tc-MEP) monitoring. The average age of the patients was 30 years. Tc-MEPs were recorded bilaterally from tibialis anterior muscle and the abductor hallucis muscle in 88 patients without neurological deficit and in 25 patients with neurological deficit. The peak latency of waveform amplitude was defined as the period from stimulation until the waveform amplitude reached its peak. The correlation with postoperative neurological deficit was examined separately for latency delays of 5% and 10% or more and in combination with a decrease in amplitude of 70% or more. We used the presence-absence paradigm to evaluate the disappearance of previously present tc-MEPs and amplitude latency delays. The correlation with the deterioration of amplitudes from baseline or the elevation of thresholds was not used. Statistical tests were used to investigate the changes. The cases in our study with significant tc-MEP alerts were reviewed against the evidence-based response checklist. RESULTS Of 113 patients, the decrease in amplitude of 70% or more was identified in the neurological deficit group in 64% vs. 36% in the normal neurological group (p < 0.001). The neurological deficit was observed in 7.96% of patients postoperatively. A decrease in intraoperative amplitude of 70% or more from previously present tc-MEP occurred in 40 cases, with 89% sensitivity, 64% specificity, 36% false positive rate (FPR), and 20% positive predictive value (PPV) for prediction of postoperative neurological deficit. The amplitude latency peak delay of 10% or more was observed in 41 cases from the group of patients with postoperative neurological deficit, with 100% sensitivity, 64% specificity, 36% FPR and 22% PPV. A combination of a decrease in amplitude of 70% or more from the previously present tc-MEP and a delay in amplitude latency peak of 10% or more resulted in 100% sensitivity, 49% specificity, 51% FPR and 10% PPV in the group of postoperative neurological deficit patients. DISCUSSION Intraoperative tc-MEP alarm points have previously focused mainly on waveform amplitude. In our series, a criterion of an amplitude decrease of 70% or more from previously present tc-MEP was set as the alarm point. No alarm criterion for delay of peak latency of waveform amplitude was set before. We set a latency peak delay of 5% or more and 10% or more of waveform amplitude compared with the previously present tc-MEP as alarm criteria. This is the first study exploring the issue. We demonstrated the efficacy of latency peak of waveform amplitude together with the decrease of waveform amplitude. Another study found similarities in the decrease of amplitude of 70 % or more from baseline and the delay in amplitude latency of 10% or more from baseline; with 86% sensitivity, 98% specificity, 2% FPR and 86% PPV (1). CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, we investigated the efficacy of a change of peak latency delay of waveform amplitude in tc-MEP monitoring. The utilizing of the peak latency delay of waveform amplitude value resulted in high sensitivity up to 100 % and allows reduction of the FPR and an increase of the PPV. Further studies should set the alarm criteria more precisely for the waveform amplitude latency peak delay to achieve more effective spinal cord tc-MEP monitoring. Our concept of findings supports the neurophysiological monitoring findings in other studies.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is a tried and tested method in treating knee joint instability which brings valuable results in an acceptable time frame. In the long-term follow-up, however, a higher risk of knee osteoarthritis development is described. One of the possible reasons is considered to be the abnormal kinematics of the operated knee. The purpose of our study was to determine the degree to which the ACL reconstruction helps restore the correct gait cycle compared to the healthy limb. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included patients after the ACL reconstruction performed in the period from 1 January 2016 to 31 March 2018. With the use of strict criteria, 11 patients were selected for kinematic analysis, who underwent examinations in a gait laboratory and were also evaluated using the Tegner and Lysholm rating systems and the IKDC (International Knee Documentation Committee) knee score, namely preoperatively and at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. The kinematic assessment of gait was carried out using the Vicon MX system with the placement of reflexive markers in line with the Plug-In Gait model. RESULTS The clinical outcomes (namely the score according to Tegner, Lysholm as well as the IKDC) during the first year postoperatively showed a major improvement in knee function and the achievement of the pre-injury activity level. The kinematic analysis revealed lower knee extension at the stance phase and lower overall range of motion of the limb with the injured ACL compared to the healthy limb. The follow-up evaluation at 6 and 12 months postoperatively showed a persisting between-limbs difference in knee extension, whereas the range of motion gradually improved during the year. CONCLUSIONS Although our study confirmed that the ACL reconstruction is an efficient method to treat knee joint instability, it also indicated that even at one year after the ACL reconstruction, the kinematics of the operated knee was not fully restored to the level of the heathy knee. The persisting limb-difference in gait kinematics could contribute to the gradual development of degenerative changes in the operated knee joint.

MATERIAL AND METHODSThe study evaluated 78 MRI examinations from 25 patients (one patient had two defects treated), each of whom underwent 3 MRI examinations at 6, 12 and 18 months after surgery.The MRI examinations were performed on Philips Ingenia 3T scanner with 8-channel knee coil, in line with the routine protocol (coronal, sagittal and transversal PD SPAIR, coronal T1, sagittal PD HR, sagittal bFFE).The MRI examinations were evaluated independently by two radiologists using the 2D MOCART (Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue) score. RESULTSThe raters agreed in a total of 592 of 702 evaluations, therefore the inter-rater reliability is high, namely 84.3%.The highest inter-rater agreement was in assessing subchondral lamina and subchondral bone.Whereas the lowest inter-rater agreement was achieved in assessing effusion.The total score showed a very strong and statistically significant correlation (r = 0.893).In eight out of nine questions there was no statistically significant difference between the raters.A significant difference was seen only in the assessment of repair tissue structure.Excellent reliability of the total score was also confirmed by the intraclass correlation coefficient. DISCUSSIONThe high degree of agreement in assessing the signal intensity of repair tissue was considered very positive as it is generally viewed as the major pitfall in evaluations.On the contrary, subjective perception was confirmed in the evaluation of tissue homogeneity, especially when comparing homogeneity with the adjacent tissue in close vicinity that could have changed already.Surprisingly, the lowest inter-rater concordance was reported in the evaluation of effusion, where in some cases, its volume was underestimated, when traced back retrospectively. CONCLUSIONSThe results of this study confirm that despite certain doubts regarding subjective perception of some of the evaluation criteria the 2D MOCART scoring system is a very good and objective tool to evaluate the effects of surgery.",

The purpose of this study was to provide a comparative evaluation of complications in the treatment of trochanteric fractures using 2-screw proximal femoral nail versus proximal femoral anti-rotational blade nail. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective review was conducted between March 2013 and March 2019. The study included 519 patients (358 females and 161 males) treated surgically for trochanteric fractures. The mean age was 79.8±12.0 (24-100) years. A1.2 type of fracture occurred in 153 (29.5%) cases, A1.3 type in 155 (29.9%), A 2.2 type in 90 (17.4%), A2.3 type in 95 (18.3%), A3.1 type in 11 (2.1%), A3.2 type in 7 (1.3%) and A3.3 type in 8 (1.5%) cases. Patients were treated either by 2-screw nail PFN (393 patients (75.7%) or by anti-rotational blade nail PFNA (126 patients (24.3%). RESULTS Our primary objective was to evaluate the implant related complications (e.g. cut-out, back-out, irritation, peri-implant fractures). Other complications (infection) and revision surgeries were also recorded. Complications were observed in 38 (9.7%) patients with PFN nail and 7 (5.6 %) patients with PFNA blade nail (p = 0.15). Screw back-out (n = 11) and cut-out (n = 11) were the most frequent complications in patients treated by 2-screw PFN nail and occurred in 5.6%. In the PFNA group, cutout occurred in 1.6% (n = 2) of cases while no cases of back-out were reported. Infection (n=3) was the most common complication in the latter group and represented 2.4%. In the PFN group the infection rate was 2.3% (n = 9). There were no statistically significant differences between both the groups considering implant-related complications (p = 0.14) and infections (p = 1.0). Revision surgery was performed in 33 patients (66.7%). DISCUSSION Biomechanical studies of intramedullary nails suggest good results with minimal complications if a two-screw implant is used. When antirotational blade is used, compression of spongiosis around blade is observed, which increases stability, especially in an osteoporotic bone. In our study, complications in these two types of nails were retrospectively compared. Considered as the limitation of our study is the retrospective nature of evaluation, which made it impossible the create two study groups with equal or similar number of patients, to follow up the patients postoperatively for a long period of time and to evaluate fracture union and limb function. CONCLUSIONS In our study no statistically significant difference in postoperative mechanical and infectious complications was confirmed between the 2-screw proximal femoral nail and the proximal femoral nail with antirotational blade. We have arrived at the conclusion that both types of nails are equivalent in treating trochanteric fractures. Key words: intramedullary nail, screw, blade, trochanteric fracture, complication.",

The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of patients treated with a second generation semi-constrained CDR with a ceramicceramic articulation. MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective cohort study of all patients undergoing a cervical disc replacement for cervical disc pathology, during the period from April 2007 to April 2011 using a ceramic-ceramic disc replacement comprised the study group. 52 patients were available for final clinical and radiological follow-up. Both, clinical and radiological evaluation were performed at each clinical visit at 6 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, 2 years, 5 years and 7 years. RESULTS There were a total of 52 patients, with 44 single level cases and 8 two level cases. The NDI improved significantly (p < 0.05) from a mean preoperative score of 56 % to a score of 20% at final follow-up. The mean preoperative mobility at the index level unit was 12.2 ± 4.5°, this decreased to 7.9 ± 3.2° at six weeks, but slightly increased to 12.9 ± 2.9° at final follow-up (gain not significant). Heterotrophic ossification (HO) was noted in 13 (25%) patients. CONCLUSIONS Cervical disc replacement with a ceramic-ceramic bearing surface is a viable option in the treatment of variety of cervical pathologies. This ceramic-ceramic interface may eliminate the potential problems of metallosis and poly-wear but further longer-term results should be studied. Key words: Cervical spine; disc replacement; ceramic articulation; neck disability; heterotrophic ossification.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYAlthough the congenital short femur is morphologically well characterized, changes at the molecular level have not been described in the literature so far.The absence of such information, along with the unknown aetiology of the defect, was the motivation for analysing angiogenesis and osteogenesis in the pseudoarthrosis (false joint) tissue in PFFD patients compared to physiological bone.The authors expected differences in gene expression, particularly in the quantity of expressed genes. MATERIAL AND METHODSA piece of bone was removed during an elective surgery procedure, placed in an RNA stabilization reagent, which prevents RNA degradation, and deep frozen.Thereafter, RNA was isolated and the profile of transcription was analysed by biochip analysis (SuperArray Bioscience Corporation).In total, it is possible to detect 113 genes of osteogenesis and angiogenesis.From the end of 2005 until the end of 2008, samples of 7 patients with PFFD and 3 physiological bone samples were examined.Several analyses were repeated to confirm the results; in total 13 chips for osteogenesis and 11 chips for angiogenesis expression were used. RESULTSDifferences in the quantity and representation of the genes were noted.Some genes were considered over-expressed in PFFD tissue compared with the control sample (e.g. the gene for calcitonin receptor, collagen XII, I alpha 2, collagen II, IX, FGFR2, fibronectin, integrin) and other genes under-expressed (e.g. the gene for annexin A5, collagen XVIII alpha1, collagen I alpha1, cathepsin K, FGFR1, FGFR3, IGF2, VEGFB). CONCLUSIONSThe differences in gene expression confirmed the authors' hypothesis.So far, the results cannot be generalized; this is the first step for follow-up experiments to confirm the suggested information and to integrate it with clinical findings, such as the alternative blood supply of affected extremity in some patients.",

RESULTSOf 113 open incisional biopsies of bone, 91.1% was fully representative and 6.2% non-representative with an indication for re-biopsy.In 53 cases another surgical procedure followed, which fully confirmed the diagnosis made based on the biopsy in 79.2%.In 7.5% the diagnosis slightly changed, with no therapeutic impact, in 5.7% the histological grade was changed, and in 7.5% the diagnosis was substantially modified.Complications appeared in 9.8% of cases.The procedure was associated with pain expressed by an increase in VAS score by 2.7 points.Of 63 soft tissue open incisional biopsies, 100% was fully representative.In 30 cases another surgical procedure followed, which fully confirmed the diagnosis made based on the biopsy in 96.7%, in one case the diagnosis was changed from aggressive benign lesion to a low-grade sarcoma.Complications appeared in 6.4% of cases.The procedure was associated with pain expressed by an increase in VAS score by 1.4 points.Of 23 ultrasound-guided core needle biopsies from soft tissues in limited indications, 100% was representative.In 11 cases another surgical procedure followed, which fully confirmed the diagnosis made based on the biopsy in 81.8%, in 2 cases the diagnosis was slightly changed, with no therapeutic impact or a change of histological grade.No complications were reported.The procedure was associated with minimal pain expressed by an increase in VAS score by 0.1 points.When comparing the group of soft tissue open incisional biopsies and ultrasound-guided core needle biopsies, a statistically significant less pain associated with the procedure was found in the group of core needle biopsies. CONCLUSIONSThe biopsy of musculoskeletal tumors should be performed at specialty centers for treatment of these rare conditions.In that case it produces good results and is associated with a low rate of complications.Indications for open biopsy or core needle biopsy must be assessed individually.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Hemoglobin (Hb) levels tend to decrease in patients after hip fractures. There are several factors that is responsible for this decrease in Hb levels. The primary aim in this study was to evaluate the risk factors of blood loss in patients with IFF and to determine the limits that may require allogeneic blood transfusion (ABT), and the secondary aim was to prevent unnecessary blood crossing outside these limits. MATERIAL AND METHODS 119 patients with intertrochanteric femur fracture (IFF) were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups according to the use of ABT in the postoperative period. Age, gender, fracture side, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) score, preoperative hemoglobin (Hb) level, platelet (Plt) number, International Normalized Ratio (INR), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) values, comorbid diseases, history of drug use, whether ABT was applied in the preoperative period or not, and the postoperative 1st day Hb levels were evaluated from the medical records. A p value below than 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. RESULTS Advanced age [odds ratio (OR) 1.069, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.372-3.202], unstable fracture type [OR 0.258, 95% CI 0.496-6.632], and hemoglobin level <11 g / dL [OR 5.574, 95% GA 0.312-65.278 was found to be an independent predictive risk factor for allogeneic blood transfusion requirement in the postoperative period. DISCUSSION There are several factors that is responsible for decrease in Hb levels in patients after hip fractures. The most important and most likely cause of these is the fracture itself. Other reasons are stated as type of fracture, time elapsed until the surgical treatment, preferred implants for treatment, advanced age, mean preoperative Hb value and anticoagulant drug usage in literature. Although the preoperative blood loss due to trauma is inevitable, unnecessary aggressive and/or inadequate treatments can be avoided if patients with higher bleeding risk and complication rate can be detected. CONCLUSIONS Advanced age, unstable fracture pattern and low preoperative Hb values should be considered as risk factors for the postoperative ABT requirements for patients with IFF.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Between February and May 2021, 24 patients underwent arthroscopic transosseous rotator cuff repair. During the study, the time spent preparing the tunnels was recorded along with the occurrence of complications during the operation. Price calculation of the delivered transosseous cuff repair and an alternative procedure with suture anchors was made. During the postoperative period, the patients rated their pain (on the VAS scale) twice a day, in the morning and in the evening, for 4 weeks, based on which the average values per each week were calculated. RESULTS The average time it took to prepare the tunnels and pull through the sutures was 6.2 minutes. In one case it was impossible to pull the shuttle loop through and that is why during the surgery arthroscopic transosseous-equivalent repair using suture anchors was performed instead. Apart from this, no other complications occurred. The patients reported rapid reduction of postoperative pain during the second and third week after surgery. The cost price analysis proved an average saving of CZK 9.463 per procedure. DISCUSSION There is a growing body of evidence that arthroscopic transosseous rotator cuff repairs achieve equivalent clinical outcomes as suture anchor repairs or even better clinical outcomes. These techniques are safe and effective; there is an earlier reduction of postoperative pain. Healing is more biological due to better vascularity, larger footprint coverage and clinically optimal biomechanical strength. Moreover, these techniques significantly save costs and meet requirements of the upcoming era of value-based surgery. CONCLUSIONS In our cohort, a favourable learning curve and minimum occurrence of complications were established. The study confirmed the data published so far on early relief of postoperative pain. We also proved that significant saving of costs of the materials used was achieved.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Most humeral nonunions can be successfully treated with a single procedure, but some are more difficult to heal. Humeral nonunions which have two or more surgical procedures were defined as refractory humeral nonunions, and this condition is a very challenging condition. The aim of the study is to show the results of atrophic refractory humeral nonunion treated with open reduction and internal fixation and autogenous block iliac crest graft and spongioplasty. MATERIAL AND METHODS Refractory humeral nonunions treated with open reduction and internal fixation and autogenous block iliac crest graft and spongioplasty from January 2010 to March 2019 were included this study retrospectively. Patient baseline information, number of previous surgeries, comorbidities, follow-up time, fracture union time, and complications were recorded. The functional outcome was evaluated with the Constant scores and Mayo scores at the end of the first year. The primary outcome variable was mentioned as bony union. RESULTS A total of 13 refractory humeral nonunions included this study. The average age of the patients was 50.92±15.55 years (range, 26-78 years), and 8 of them were female. Preoperative and postoperative mean Mayo scores were; 56.54±17.84, and 85.38±7.49 respectively (p<0.001). Preoperative and postoperative mean Constant scores were; 45±11.71, and 80.62±5.38 respectively (p<0.001). DISCUSSION The strict application of basic nonunion principles can result in successful salvage of refractory humeral nonunions. But this concept may not provide sufficient solution for each situation. On the other hand, we also applied the basic nonunion principles. Compression plating and autogenous bone grafting and spongioplasty have been considered as the gold standard in the management of humeral shaft nonunion. CONCLUSIONS Open reduction and internal fixation and autogenous block iliac crest graft and spongioplasty should be considered as an alternative for the treatment of refractory atrophic humeral nonunions, whose treatment is a very challenging condition for surgeons.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The preferred treatment of giant cell tumor of bone is curettage with the use of local adjuvant. If the tumor spreads beyond the bone into soft tissues, en bloc excision should be performed. Intralesional curettage allows joint preservation, but it is associated with a high recurrence rate. The purpose of the study was to identify the risk factors for local recurrence and to compare the functional outcomes after both types of surgical procedures. MATERIAL AND METHODS The group included 16 patients (5 women, 11 men) with giant cell tumor of bone in distal forearm treated at the First Department of Orthopedic Surgery, St. Anne s University Hospital Brno in 2005-2019. The mean age of patients was 38 years (22-53). The follow-up period was 6.75 years (2-15) on average. The most common location of the tumor was distal radius (14). In 6 patients denosumab treatment was indicated. Based on the obtained data, we compared the effects of gender, Campanacci grade, type of surgery and administration of denosumab on the risk of local recurrence. The functional outcomes were evaluated retrospectively based on the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society scoring system for upper limb salvage surgeries. RESULTS Resection and reconstruction using an osteocartilaginous allograft was performed in 9 patients. Seven patients were treated with tumor curettage with bone cement used to fill the cavity. The group of patients who underwent curettage showed a significantly higher mean MSTS score 89% compared to the group of patients with resection with the mean MSTS score 66% (P < 0.05). Local tumor recurrence was reported in 3 patients (18.75%). No statistically significant difference was found in gender, tumor grade, radicality of surgery or administration of targeted therapy with respect to the incidence of local recurrence. Altogether 6 complications (37.5%) were observed in the group. DISCUSSION The treatment of a giant cell tumor of bone aims to completely remove the tumor and to preserve the best possible function of the limb. The complications in distal forearm involve particularly an increase incidence of local recurrence and painful or limited range of motion of the wrist. Whereas curettage with the use of local adjuvant is burdened with a higher recurrence rate, resection with allograft reconstruction of bone defect is usually associated with poorer functional outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Tumor curettage using local adjuvant is preferred in a well-circumscribed tumor and offers an excellent functional outcome. En bloc tumor resection and reconstruction using an osteocartilaginous allograft is a suitable treatment option for a locally advanced tumor with a low risk of local recurrence.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Radial head fractures in paediatric patients account for 5-19% of all elbow injuries and approximately 1% of all fractures in children. Non-displaced fractures are treated with plaster cast fixation. If the fracture is displaced, we proceed to closed reduction, or to osteosynthesis in case of unstable fragments. If closed reduction fails, we opt for open reduction and osteosynthesis. The prospective randomised clinical study aims to compare the two methods of minimally invasive osteosynthesis using the pre-bent Kirschner wire or Prévot nail and to identify differences between them. MATERIAL AND METHODS The prospective randomised clinical study was conducted in 2015-2019. The final cohort included 32 patients who met the inclusion criteria. The patients in whom other osteosynthesis implants had been used or in whom open reduction had to be performed were excluded from the study. Also excluded were the patients with serious concomitant injuries of elbow. For patients included in the cohort, demographic data, precise evaluation of the displacement and location of the fracture as well as the duration of plaster cast fixation and osteosynthesis implants used were recorded. In the clinical part, the methods were compared based on the achievement of full range of motion in dependence on the degree of original displacement, use of osteosynthesis implant, and occurrence of early and delayed complications. Clinical and radiological outcomes were compared. In both types of minimally invasive osteosynthesis, Métaizeau surgical technique was used. RESULTS Based on the clinical trial criteria, 26 (81%) excellent, 4 (13%) good and 2 (6%) acceptable outcomes were achieved. In 3 cases the loss of rotation was up to 20°, in 1 case the loss of flexion was up to 10°. In one patient the loss of flexion was 15° and rotation up to 30°. In another patient the loss of rotation was up to 40°. The radiological assessment showed 14 (44%) excellent outcomes, 15 good (47%) and 3 (9%) acceptable outcomes. The statistical analysis of both the groups of the cohort using non-parametric tests revealed no statistically significant differences in individual demographic parameters. The comparisons of both types of osteosynthesis in dependence on the degree of displacement by non-parametric Fisher's exact test showed no statistically significant difference in the radiologic or clinical results. The only statistically significant difference was observed in the duration of metal implant placement. DISCUSSION Comparable studies report excellent or good clinical outcomes in 80-95% of cases (1,13,16). In our cohort, excellent or good clinical outcomes were achieved in 30 patients (94%). In two patients, in whom Prévot nail was used, the outcomes were acceptable. Nonetheless, this fact did not result in any statistical significance when comparing the two methods separately or in comparisons based on the degree of displacement. CONCLUSIONS The comparison of the two methods of minimally invasive osteosynthesis revealed no statistically significant difference, namely not even when both the methods were compared based on the degree of displacement. When Kirschner wire is used, the possibility to remove the metal implant in the outpatient setting is considered to be an advantage. The drawback consists in potential penetration of the sharp Kirschner wire in the radiocapitellar joint, which we did not encounter when the second technique of osteosynthesis was used. The advantage of Prévot nail includes a lower risk of pin-tract infection. Key words: minimally invasive osteosynthesis, radial head, fracture, child.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Cementless stems in highly dysplastic hips are considered to increase the risk of femoral fracture and associated morbidity. Several authors speculated to use prophylactic cabling in this patient group to prevent intraoperative fractures. This study aims to reveal objective results regarding the perioperative complications in a large and consecutive patient group with respect to use of prophylactic cabling. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective comparative study was planned. A total of 122 consecutive patients with dysplastic hips of Crowe type 3 or 4, operated on with total hip arthroplasty (THA) and shortening osteotomy using a rectangular femoral stem were included. Patients were stratified according to use of a diaphyseal prophylactic cerclage cable. Perioperative complications were recorded. Clinical outcome was measured in terms of Harris Hip Score and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain. All results were compared between the groups. RESULTS The mean follow-up time was 27 months. Two (2%) versus five (14%) patients had a fracture at the diaphyseal level in cabled versus non-cabled groups. Difference between groups was statistically significant (p=0.01). Relative risk of fracture in case of a non-cabling was 5.8 (p=0.03). Eleven (9%) patients had a non-displaced fracture at the metaphyseal level. No significant differences were detected with respect to preoperative clinical outcome scores or change in these scores between groups. CONCLUSIONS Femoral diaphyseal fracture rates are low when cementless, rectangular stems are used in dysplastic high riding hips. Prophylactic cerclage cabling further decreases the fracture risk and eases treatment in case of a fracture without causing additional complications and therefore is recommended.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYWe aimed to evaluate the biomechanical properties of quadriceps tendon graft with a bone plug ending (QTBP) and a quadriceps graft with a tendinous ending(QTT) fixed on the femoral side with different fixation devices. MATERIAL AND METHODSTwenty-five paired 2-year-old calf QTs and 25 paired 2-year-old sheep femurs were used for this study.90x8 mm central part of the quadriceps tendons with or without a bone plug was harvested.8×25 mm tunnel was placed in lateral condyles.The QTT was fixed with four different fixation devices, including the adjustable suspensory system (QTT-ASS, group 1), biodegradable interference screws (QTT-BIS, group 2), titanium interference screws (QTT-TIS, group 3), and an adjustable suspensory system + biodegradable interference screws (QTT-(ASS+BIS), group 4); QTBP was fixed with titanium interference screws (QTBP-TIS, group 5).All groups were tested in a servohydraulic materials testing machine.Stiffness(N/mm), slippage of the tendon(mm), and the ultimate tensile load-bearing ability(N) of the groups were tested.The Kruskal-Wallis H test was used with the Monte Carlo simulation technique to compare the nonparametric variables of stiffness, slippage, and ultimate tensile load.Dunn's test was used for the post hoc analyses. RESULTSGroup 3 had the stiffest fixation (median 45.09 N/mm).The amount of slippage was highest in group 1(median 6.41mm).Group 1 was the most resistant group against a tensile load during the load-to-failure test(464 N).Fixing the QTT with the ASS and BIS in group 4 increased both stiffness and ultimate tensile load strength.There was no significant difference between the QTBP and QTT fixed with titanium screws.Fixing QTT with titanium screws was significantly superior to fixation with BIS(p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONSThis study demonstrates that QTBP fixation with TIS have no advantage over QTT fixation with TIS on the femoral side.Although the QTT group fixed with ASS was the most resistant group against tensile forces during load-to-failure test, amount of slippage was highest for this group as well.Thus, if an ASS is to be used, a strong tension force must be applied prior to tibial side fixation to prevent further slippage of the graft in the tunnel.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY To characterize constitutional frontal alignment of the ankle in genua vara, valga, and norma. MATERIAL AND METHODS Long-leg standing radiographs of 589 patients presenting between 2011 and 2020 for knee-complaints because of any reason were chosen from our database. Cases with fractures or history of bony-realignment-surgeries were excluded. The Hip-Knee-Ankle angle (HKA), the mechanical Lateral Distal Tibia Angle (mLDTA), and the Tibia-Plafond-Horizontal-Orientation angle (TPHA) were measured in 354 patients. For this study, neutral frontal alignment of the leg was defined as HKA between -3.0° and +4.0°. HKA-values <-3.0° were defined as genua valga and values >4.0° were defined as genua vara. According to these cutoffs, data was categorized into the following three patient groups: genua vara (n=157), genua norma (n=106), genua valga (n=91). For each group, the ankle alignment in the frontal plane was compared to the HKA. Finally, the three groups were compared to each other. RESULTS In the varus-group, the HKA-value was 6.9°±2.4°, the TPHA-value was 4.7°±3.5°, and the mLDTA-value was 87.4°±4.8°. In the neutral-group, the HKA-value was 1.8°±2.0°, the TPHA-value was 2.5°±2.9°, and the mLDTA-value was 87.2°±4.6°. In the valgus-group, the HKA-value was -6.0°±2.7°, the TPHA-value was -0.2°±4.7°, and the mLDTA-value was 85.0°±4.7°. DISCUSSION The frontal alignment of the ankle joint line depends on the overall frontal alignment of the leg. The TPHA correlates with varus or valgus alignment of the knee, but the mLDTA does not. In patients with valgus-aligned long-leg axis, the TPHA demonstrated less valgus alignment than in patients with varus-aligned long-leg axis. This knowledge is especially useful when planning osteotomies for correction of lower extremity malalignment. CONCLUSIONS During the planning process of osteotomies around the knee, the TPHA should be appreciated because it correlates with the constitutional knee alignment. Key words: valgus, varus, frontal alignment, coronal alignment, osteotomy.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The authors focused on the topic of tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis. It is a surgical procedure used to manage severe comprehensive ankle and hindfoot pathology. The scope of surgery and the negative impact on the walking stereotype are offset by preserving a weight-bearing and pain-free limb. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the group of patients who had undergone surgery at the First Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, St. Anne s University Hospital Brno and to identify the most suitable fixation for arthrodesis. It also aimed to compare the outcomes achieved by the authors with those reported by other departments. MATERIAL AND METHODS The group included patients operated on at the authors department between 2011 and 2021. The surgery was indicated in patients with severe concomitant arthritis of the upper and lower ankle, complex hindfoot instability, Charcot arthropathy. Contraindications included acute infection, decompensated diabetes and heavy smoking. The study compares fixation using a lateral plate, a retrograde nail and a retrograde nail with fibula acting as biological plate. The patients were scored preoperatively and postoperatively using the AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Score. Statistical analysis of the results was also carried out. RESULTS The group included 23 patients, of whom a lateral plate was opted for in 7 patients, a retrograde nail in 8 patients and a retrograde nail with fibula used as a biological plate in 8 patients. The patients of the group were followed up for the period ranging from 0.5 to 9 years after surgery. Serious complications were observed by the authors in 6 patients of the group. The failure of osteosynthesis material was reported in 2 cases with lateral plating fixation. A stress fracture above the apex of the nail developed in 2 cases. A serious infection was observed by the authors in 1 patient. The method associated with the lowest incidence of complications was the fixation with a retrograde nail and fibula used as a biological plate. DISCUSSION The forms of fixation for tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis have recently advanced considerably, the methods of fixation for arthrodesis in particular. The modern implants enable to compress the individual structures, to provide stable fixation and potentially to avoid long-term plaster cast fixation. Nonetheless, these surgical procedures are associated with a high complication rate. Currently, there is no consensus in international studies on the optimal fixation for arthrodesis. Numerous papers describe complications including postoperative infections, failure of osteosynthesis material and fractures close to osteosynthesis material. The number and the type of complications observed by the authors in their group of patients were similar to those reported by other authors. CONCLUSIONS Tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis is a surgical procedure reserved exclusively for patients indicated based on strict criteria and should be performed by an experienced team able to cope with potential complications. In the followed-up group of patients, the optimal method of fixation for arthrodesis appeared to be the fixation with a retrograde nail and fibula used as a biological plate.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Our study aimed to assess the mid-term outcomes and complications with the ICON hip resurfacing system and to carry out a detailed analysis of pitfalls and risks associated with pairing the bearing surfaces of metal-on-metal hip implants. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 52 hip joints were assessed in 43 patients who received the ICON hip resurfacing system at our department between 2009 and 2013. The cohort included 34 men and 9 women. Their age at the time of primary surgery ranged from 34 to 67 years, with the mean age of 51.8 years. The mean follow-up was 7.6 years. The evaluation focused on the position and osseointegration of both components, bone remodelling around the implant, and signs of potential aseptic loosening. The functional status of the hip was assessed by Harris Hip Score. RESULTS The primary stability of both components was always good, there were no femoral neck fractures reported in our cohort. All the acetabular components were stable, showing appropriate osseointegration, with no radiolucent zones or signs of osteolysis around them. There was not a single case of the femoral component stem being in a biomechanically disadvantageous varus position. In zone I and III according to Beaulé, cancellous bone osteolysis developed in two patients. The narrowing of the femoral neck below the end of the femoral component, compared to postoperative X-rays, achieved the mean value of 1.3% according to Grammatopolouse. The HHS increased from 64 to 95.5 points. An excellent outcome was observed in 48 joints, whereas the outcome of the remaining 4 joints was very good. The mean survival rate of the resurfacing hip implant calculated using the Kaplan-Meier analysis achieved 100%. The cobalt and chromium levels in the blood of patients did not exceed the reference physiological value. DISCUSSION The resurfacing system enables to preserve the bone tissue of the metaphysis and a part of the femoral head. The reduced mechanical endurance of the peripheral part of femoral components smaller in size caused by implant malposition resulted in fatal consequences in the ASR system. Greater range of motion conditioned by the design of the resurfacing system led to a mechanical wear, with a significant increase in the concentration of metal particles in the effective joint space. The elevated levels of cobalt and chromium ions in some patients induced delayed-type hypersensitivity with subsequent development of aseptic lymphocyte-dominated vasculitis associated lesions presented as peri-acetabular changes (pseudotumors to osteolysis) with subsequent failure of implant fixation. We have not observed this complication in the ICON system as yet. In patients suffering from hip pain after the resurfacing hip arthroplasty and simultaneous high chromium and cobalt blood levels, pelvic CT/MRI is indicated with reduction of artefacts around the metal material. Surgical treatment of soft tissue affections, bone defects and reimplantation using conventional or revisioncementless components is a possible treatment option. CONCLUSIONS The ideal patient indicated for hip resurfacing is a physically active man under 60 years of age (with a femoral head size of 54-60 mm), with primary or secondary osteoarthritis, no joint deformity, with a good quality bone tissue in the femoral neck and head region. As for the functional performance, the resurfacing system allows the patients a large range of motion with very good joint stability immediately after surgery. Despite that, the metal-on-metal tribological pairing must be approached with caution. The risk of developing lesions associated with ALVAL is unpredictable. In our cohort of patients with ICON hip resurfacing system, mostly excellent outcomes with minimum complications were reported provided the indication criteria and the correct surgical procedure had been complied with. Key words: hip resurfacing system, metal articulating surfaces, adverse reaction to metal particles, aseptic lymphocytedominated vasculitis associated lesions, pseudotumor.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The paper aims to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on a change in the number of major trauma cases, their mechanism and length of hospital stay as seen by a Level I Trauma Centre. MATERIAL AND METHODS The retrospective study included a total of 755 major trauma patients (ISS ≥ 16) treated at our Level I Trauma Centre in the period 2018-2019 (\"pre-COVID-19 time\") and 2020-2021 (\"COVID-19 time\"). The effect of COVID-19 infection on the change in the number and nature of major trauma, mechanism of injury, length of treatment during prehospital care, length of hospital stay, and mortality. RESULTS Of the total number of 755 patients with major trauma, in the \"pre-COVID-19 time\" 399 patients were treated, while in the \"COVID-19 time\" it was 356 patients (p = 0.10). The mechanism of major trauma did not change, road traffic accidents prevailed (61% vs. 56%, p = 0.25), the proportion of injuries due to falls from height increased (25% vs. 32.5%, p = 0.08), a significant decrease was observed in the category of severe skiing injuries (7 vs. 2, p = 0.003). The severity of injuries evaluated by Injury Severity Score remained unchanged (25 vs. 25, p = 0.08), but an increased number of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) marked by the Abbreviate Injury Score (AIS) ≥ 4 was observed (38 vs. 56, p = 0.03). The total length of a hospital stay shortened (18 vs. 15 days, p = 0.04), but the mortality rate spiked (52 vs. 73 patients, p = 0.08). DISCUSSION In the \"COVID-19 time\", the total number of major trauma cases dropped just like in the other European countries. Despite restrictive measures imposing mobility restrictions, no change was reported in the mechanism of injury, with traffic accidents still prevalent, except for skiing injuries. Unlike the US, we did not see an increase in penetrating injuries due to interpersonal violence or suicidal behaviour. However, there was an increase in the percentage of patients with an isolated TBI as a result of a fall from height. An increase in mortality was reported due to an increase in severe TBI. The length of hospital stay was reduced as a result of efforts to maintain hospital bed availability. CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to the two years immediately preceding, no significant decrease in the number of major trauma cases was reported, despite the introduction of restrictive measures. The proportion of road traffic injuries remained the same, whereas the number of falls from height slightly increased, which consequently led to an increase in the number of severe TBI. The number of penetrating injuries due to acts of violence did not increase, but due to the lockdown there was a significant decrease in severe skiing-related injuries. The anti-epidemic measures in place did not prolong the pre-hospital care for severely injured patients. Key words: major trauma, Injury Severity Score, COVID-19, mechanism of injury.",

    "abstract": "Periprosthetic femoral fractures around the femoral stem of a hip prosthesis constitute a serious challenge.The number of these fractures, associated with a high failure rate and a high number of overall complications, including higher mortality, has been on an increase worldwide.Stable femoral stems are indicated for osteosynthesis, while in case of loosening the method of choice is the replacement by a revision implant.The aim of osteosynthesis of periprosthetic femoral fractures is a stable fixation with soft tissue preservation which results in faster union allowing the patient to return to pre-injury activities.Biomechanical studies on cadavers or on synthetic models and computer simulations make it possible to evaluate the fixation strength in various types of implants in dependence on fracture characteristics and bone quality, but cannot be substituted for clinical trials since there is no direct proportion between fixation rigidity and fracture union.Fundamental principles that shall be followed in osteosynthesis of periprosthetic fractures can be deduced from the available studies.Proximal fixation by screws or a combination of screws and cables are biomechanically more advantageous than the Ogden fixation by cerclage wires or cables.Bicortical fixation enabled by state-of-the-art implants of LAP-LCP or NCB type represents a significantly more stable construction compared to monocortical fixation and led to reduced use of structural allografts.Better stability can be achieved by \"double plating\" technique which is applied especially in revision surgeries, but also in osteoporotic periprosthetic fractures with a defect zone.In these cases, osteosynthesis with long plates is recommended, bridging the entire femur, i.e. distally with femoral condyles fixation since this prevents the risk of a fracture below the plate.In shorter plates, this risk created by stress concentration at the end screw is amplified when a distal bicortical locking screw is used.That is why it is beneficial to reduce this stress by a monocortical screw or with the use of a conventional screw.Adherence to the principles regarding the position, type and number of screws constitutes the key parameter of successful osteosynthesis of periprosthetic fractures.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSA total of 74 total knee replacements were examined at the authors' department one year after the surgery in order to determine the function of knee replacement.The patients underwent a preoperative and postoperative CT scan of the knee joint in order to determine the rotation of the dorsal line of femoral condyles relative to the transepicondylar line, the socalled condylar twist angle (CTA).The study did not explore the absolute value of CTA, but the difference between the preoperative and postoperative angle.The patients were divided into two groups.In Group 1 composed of 53 knees, the difference of the CTA was lower than 3°, Group 2 included the cases with the difference greater than 3°.After 1 year, the patients filled in the Knee Society Clinical Rating Score and WOMAC questionnaires.The statistical significance was evaluated with the use of the unpaired T-test. RESULTSGroup 1 where the original anatomy of the knee joint was respected, reported the mean value of Part 1 of the KSCRS of 83.5 points, the mean value of Part 2 of this questionnaire was 83.5 points.The mean WOMAC score was 86.4 and the mean VAS score was 2.6.In Group 2, with a difference in rotation as against the preoperative status of 3° or more, the mean value of Part 1 and Part 2 of the KSRCS was 72.4 points and 72.1 points, respectively, the mean WOMAC score was 75.5 points and the mean VAS score was 4.7.The comparison by the Student's t-test, in all the monitored values at the level of significance of p < 0.05 the patients' satisfaction and the implant's function depend on respecting the original anatomy of the distal femur. DISCUSSIONIt is generally accepted that the internal rotation of the femoral component causes patellar hyperpression, thus reduces the satisfaction of patients.There are several ways how to determine the rotation of the femoral component.An error is inherent in all of them, inversely proportional to the surgeon's experience.The purpose of our study was to show that in case of appropriately selected preoperative planning the postoperative outcome and the patients' satisfaction can improve. CONCLUSIONSOur study confirms that for the patient's satisfaction after total knee replacement it is fitting to perform preoperative planning regarding the rotation of the femoral component and to seek to maintain the original anatomy, even if the femoral component is implanted in slight internal rotation.",

    "abstract": "Neoplastic diseases continue to arouse much concern in the general population. This also applies to bone tumors. Until recently, these neoplasms, most frequently occurring in children and adolescents, were considered to have the worst possible prognosis with a minimal opportunity for a successful outcome of treatment. This is a likely reason for the still deeply rooted belief that amputation of the affected limb is necessary and disease prognosis is uncertain, which also applies to Ewing's sarcoma. Only lately could these patients be offered a hope of successful treatment including limb salvage.In the period from 1984 to mid-2003, 78 patients with Ewing's sarcoma were treated in our department. Their age ranged from 3 to 25 years, with the maximum occurrence between 13 and 17 years. We performed 27 reconstructions, 13 amputations or exarticulations and 24 resections without replacements. In 13 patients, the procedure was restricted to diagnostic biopsy only, because the tumor was inoperable.The diagnosis was made on the basis of diagnostic biopsy and, subsequently, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was administered. When this resulted in tumor regression, definitive surgery was performed, involving tumor resection and bone replacement either with autograft or allograft, or with an individual prosthesis. When an implant was not necessary for maintaining limb function, a simple resection was carried out. In the patients in whom the tumor failed to regress, amputation or exarticulation was inevitable. Inoperable tumors were managed by megadose chemotherapy and by radiotherapy. The patients after orthopedic surgery receive adjuvant therapy, including bone marrow transplantation in indicated cases.The evaluation of our 78 patients showed that patient survival is not related to the surgical procedure used. In patients with an early diagnosis and a positive response of the tumor to chemotherapy, the reconstruction procedure appeared to be sufficiently radical in terms of cancer control while preserving limb function; these patients showed neither a significant increase in disease recurrence nor metastatic dissemination. Similar outcomes were also recorded in patients with a simple resection. However, amputation and exarticulation cannot completely be avoided and they are necessary in the patients whose tumor failed to respond to chemotherapy or in whom radical removal of the tumor is not possible. The poorest outcome was recorded in the patients with inoperable tumors, in whom it was not possible to carry out a radical orthopedic operation. The time between the onset of pain and initiation of therapy is also an important factor affecting the treatment outcome. Complications of reconstructive surgery for Ewing's sarcoma recorded in our patient group included osteomyelitis and graft fracture in addition to relapse and metastatic dissemination followed by death.Reconstructive surgery for Ewing's sarcoma is carried out in our department in patients with a confirmed diagnosis, in whom neoadjuvant therapy has resulted in tumor regression and in whom the extent and site of a tumor permit this sort of procedure. If this is not possible, limb amputation is indicated. If amputation is not possible due to tumor localization, megadose chemotherapy is administered. The results of long-term survival evaluation of our patients undergoing resection and replacement show that the procedure has been sufficiently radical, because no local recurrence or metastatic dissemination followed by death were recorded. Disease recurrence, death, graft osteomyelitis and fracture of a graft inclusive of osteosynthetic material are the complications reported.This study evaluated the current techniques of treating Ewing's sarcoma, with emphasis on reconstructive surgery leading to limb salvation and maintenance of its full function. The importance of this approach is obvious when we realize that the patients are mostly children and adolescents.",

Apart from many other causes, it can also be caused by contracture of the extensor hallucis longus muscle, in our case resulting from surgical treatment of crural fracture. The authors present the case of a 17-year-old soccer player who sustained a fracture of both shin and calf bone during a soccer match and underwent surgical treatment with intramedullary nailing. While compartment syndrome wasn't observed, a postoperative complication in the form of progressive development of a dynamic type of hallux extensus was reported. The reason behind this complication was later found to be the interaction of the osteosynthesis material with the extensor hallucis longus muscle, which led to its scarring and shortening. A Z-lengthening of the musculus extensor hallucis longus tendon was indicated and performed with a good clinical outcome. During surgery, an anatomical variation in the course of the extensor hallucis longus was observed, which had to be taken into account to achieve a successful surgical outcome.

Medical history and lumbar myelogram are usually sufficient to localize the source of pain. We prefer the myelogram to CT-scan or MRI because it gives a longitudinal view of the whole lumbar spine, is easy to read and is also possible in the presence of a scoliotic deformity or claustrophobia. Between 1987 and 1993, 76 patients with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis were treated operatively by the same surgeon. Results are available for 74 patients. In all patiens, a decompression was performed, a fusion was performed in 64 patients. The follow-up ranges from 1 to 5.7 years (average 2.7 years). 59 patients (80 %) were happy with the result and would like to be operated again in the same conditions. 8 of the 15 unhappy patients had, objectively, a good result but were unsatisfied for other reasons. Our results show, that operative treatment of the lumbar spinal stenosis is a rewarding task. Decompression usually results in a dramatic decrease of the leg pain and improvement of the walking distance. Advanced age in not a contraindication for this kind of surgery. Decompression combined with fusion results in a longer operative time and greater blood loss and is only indicated in the presence of an instability in a younger patient or massive preoperative back pain.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY In view of increasing interest in a relationship between the surface of an implant and its behaviour and longevity in total hip arthroplasty (THA), the aim of this study is to present the clinical and radiographic results, as well as complications, of hip replacement surgery using the cemented femoral stem SAS I. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 298 cemented femoral stems SAS I were implanted in 275 patients at our department between 1996 and 2005. The patient average age was 72.1 years, with the range from 64 to 92 years. The pre-operative diagnoses were as follows: primary osteoarthritis in 179 (30.1%); post-dysplastic osteoarthritis in 41 (13.7%); femoral neck fracture in 44 (14.8%); avascular necrosis of the femoral head in 23 (7.7%); rheumatoid arthritis in nine (3%) and other causes in two (0.7%) patients. Of the 275 patients who had the surgery, 186 (204 THAs) underwent clinical and X-ray examination at an average follow-up of 11.5 years (range, 8 to 17 years). The clinical results were used to calculate the Harris hip score and radiographic evaluation was based on antero-posterior views. RESULTS The group of 186 assessed patients (204 THAs) comprised 106 women and 80 men, who were on average 85.4 years old on evaluation (range, 72 to 92 years). Of the remaining patients, 62 patients (64 THAs) died from causes unrelated to the surgery and 27 patients (30 THAs) were lost to follow-up. The functional outcome of surgery assessed by the Harris hip score was excellent in 61 (32.8%), good in 94 (50.5%), satisfactory in 26 (14%) and poor in five (2.7%) patients. The 93.1% SAS I stem longevity was recorded in relation to aseptic loosening; reimplantation for this indication was performed in 14 THAs. No revision surgery for failure due to valgus/varus deviations of the stem was carried out. Of the 204 hips, 188 had femoral stems aligned in neutral, 12 (5.9%) in valgus and four (2%) in varus positions. DISCUSSION The anatomical femoral stem SAS I is an implant made to fit the proximal femur anatomy. Its highly polished surface allows for optimal fitting with the supporting bone and for even distribution of weight bearing. This results in a low rate of THA failure. In accordance with the relevant literature, the acetabular components is considered to be the weakest element in total hip replacement in terms of aseptic loosening and implant failure. At present, the SAS I stem has no Morse Eurocone taper and this is the chief obstacle hindering its more frequent use in endoprosthetics. CONCLUSIONS The results of our study are in agreement with those of other successfully implanted polished cemented femoral components. Key words: anatomical cemented femoral component, surface adjustment of the femoral stem, complications.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe original aim of this prospective semi-randomised study was to determine associations between segmental sagittal alignment after Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (ACDF) and subjective and clinical results.Two types of cages, cage P with parallel end-plates and cage A with 5-degree angulations, were used in the patients treated for degenerative conditions. MATERIAL AnD METHODSA total of 94 consecutive patients, 56 treated by single-level ACDF and 38 undergoing a two-level procedure, completed 8 years of follow-up.The patients in equally-sized A and P subgroups were examined at 6 weeks and 1, 2 and 8 years after surgery.The follow-up included X-ray in a neutral lateral position, a questionnaire assessing pain in neck and shoulder regions and JOA scores.The results including the cumulative incidence of surgical procedures indicated for adjacent segment diseases were statistically evaluated. RESULTSAn average increase in the lordotic angle at 6 weeks after surgery was 2.32° for the implant P and 2.02° for the implant A subgroup.During 8 years of follow-up the average values decreased to 1.51° and 1.36°, respectively.The proportion of patients with no or minimal neck and shoulder pain decreased, in subgroup P, from the initial 85% at 6 weeks to 59% at 8 years after the surgery and, in subgroup A, from 89% to 40 %.The average JOA score of 16 at 6 weeks in both subgroups, at 8 years, had a value of 15.9 in subgroup P and 16.0 in subgroup A. The cumulative incidence of surgery for adjacent segment disease 8 years was 8.3% for subgroup P and 6.3% for subgroup A. no statistically significant differences between the subgroups at any follow-up period were recorded in either morphological characteristics or clinical outcomes. COnCLUSIOnSThe ability to lordotize a segment by stand-alone ACDF is below the angular resolution of current radiographic methods, irrespective of the sagittal profile of the implant used.Comparable morphological results haven´t been reflected by significant difference in subjective and clinical outcome and also in the incidence of surgery for adjacent segment disease.Such results were not expected and therefore post-operative sagittal alignment mechanisms in stand-alone cage assisted ACDF will require further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Congenital dislocation of the knee and congenital permanent dislocation of the patella are rare disorders usually associated with complex syndromes. Two cases of siblings, girl and boy, who had the same clinical phenotype of this disorder are presented. The diagnosis of Desbuquois dysplasia was made and its autosomal recessive heredity was confirmed by genetic analysis. DNA samples were sent for a molecular genetic analysis of the skeletal dysplasia. The girl was surgically treated for a complete (grade 3) anterior dislocation of the tibia on the femur in the first year of life. Redressing casts had not previously been applied to avoid the risk of damaging the epiphysis. The left knee was operated on by the method, as described by Curtis and Fisher, at the age of six months. The Kirschner wire was removed after one month and a plaster cast was applied to maintain the flexion required. At seven post-operative weeks physiotherapy was started with temporary use of a knee brace. The right knee was managed by a similar procedure at four months after the first surgery. Normal walking was achieved at the age of 21 months. Knee motion was symmetrically restricted, with 5 to 90 degrees of flexion. The boy was first seen at our out-patient department after his sister had achieved full walking ability. He was 10 years old at that time and presented with walking problems due to nearly 30 degrees of bilateral knee contractures. Permanent dislocation of both patellae was treated by the surgical technique described by Stanisavljevic. Revision surgery of the right knee due to patellar lateralization was required two years after the primary surgery; it was performed using the Campbell's technique. A corrective osteotomy of the left proximal tibia because of progressive genu valgum was carried out at four years following the first operation. At the last follow-up, the boy was 16 years old and the knee range of motion bilaterally was 0 to 120 degrees with good alignment of both knees. As a result of surgical treatment the two patients gained ability to walk without problems.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY To give a description of the patient group, risk factors, classification, therapeutic procedures and treatment outcomes in periprosthetic femoral fractures after total hip arthroplasty treated in the Trauma Hospital in Brno. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective study comprised of 51 patients treated for a periprosthetic femoral fracture between 2003 and 2013. This included 19 (37%) intra-operative and 32 (63%) post-operative fractures. According to the Vancouver classification, the types of fractures were as follows: 9 patients A; 21 B1; 9 B2; 6 B3 and 6 with type C. RESULTS Type A fractures were treated conservatively. Although pseudoarthrosis of the greater trochanter occurred, the patients had no clinical problems. The intra-operative type B1 fractures were managed by cerclage tapes in nine patients and the post-operative B1 fractures were treated by plate osteosynthesis in 10 patients and femoral stem reimplantation in two patients. All post-operative type B2 and type B3 fractures were managed by reimplantation of the femoral stem and type C fractures were treated by plate osteosynthesis. Serious complications requiring revision surgery were recorded in five patients; they included plate failure in two B1 fractures, dislocation of a B2 fracture, a dislocation with femoral component rotation in a B3 fracture and failure of the plate in a type C fracture. CONCLUSIONS The treatment of a periprosthetic fracture can affect the patient's life. In view of the fracture type, implant type, general health of the patient and all risk factors, the authors prefer one-stage surgical treatment. The Vancouver classification is a guidleine for the therapeutic plan. Osteosynthesis as a single procedure is indicated only if the femoral component is stable and well fixed. When the stem in B2 and B3 fractures is loose, revision surgery with stem replacement is necessary. Key words: periprosthetic fracture, total hip atrhroplasty, Vancouver classification.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYTwo-year clinical results of a multicenter prospective randomized study in patients with arthroscopically treated Femoroacetabular Impingement syndrome and concurrently performed microfracture for grade IV chondral lesions of the acetabulum. MATERIAL AND METHODSThe study evaluated a group of 55 patients of the originally enrolled 92 patients with the underlying diagnosis of FAI syndrome with intraoperatively confirmed grade IV acetabular chondropathy of up to 4 cm 2 in size, who had undergone a comprehensive hip arthroscopy (correction of structural cam-type and/or pincer-type deformity, labral refixation or partial labral resection etc.) performed by two experienced surgeons.The patients were randomized intraoperatively using a closed envelope method into two groups.In Group 1 (31 patients), microfractures for chondral defects was performed, while in Group 2 the patients underwent a defect debridement procedure only.The studied group included a total of 7 professional and 48 recreational athletes (33 men and 22 women), with the mean age of 34.4 in Group 1 and 31.1 in Group 2. Preoperatively and 6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively the modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS) parameters and VAS score were evaluated and also revision surgeries, conversion to endoprosthesis, and occurrence of complications were recorded. RESULTSPreoperatively, no statistical difference between the two groups was found in the studied parameters (mHHS and VAS).Postoperatively (after 6, 12 and 24 months), in both groups a statistically significant increase in mHHS and VAS score was reported.When comparing the mHHS parameter at individual evaluated times in Group 1 and Group 2, a statistically significant difference was confirmed at 12 and 24 months after surgery (P < 0.001), namely in favour of Group 1.At 6 months postoperatively, no statistically significant difference in this parameter between the two groups was confirmed (P = 0.068).When comparing the VAS score parameter in these two groups at individual times, no statistically significant difference was confirmed at 6 and 12 months after surgery (P= 0.83 / P= 0.39).A statistically significant difference in the VAS score parameter was observed only at 24 months after surgery, namely in favour of Group 1 (P< 0.037).In the course of the follow-up period, altogether 3 patients (2 patients from Group 1) were indicated for revision hip arthroscopy and in 1 female patient an endoprosthesis was implanted.No severe intraoperative or postoperative complications were observed. DISCUSSIONIn agreement with other authors worldwide, the arthroscopic treatment of FAI syndrome, if indicated and performed correctly, was confirmed to improve the clinical condition of patients postoperatively, regardless of the technique used in treating the chondral defect.Based on our results as well as conclusions of other world authors, in treating the grade IV defects of smaller size it is appropriate, in treating the cartilage, to prefer the microfracture surgery, which is less demanding both technically and financially and contrary to mere debridement allows to fill the original defect by fibrocartilage tissue. CONCLUSIONSThe benefits of the acetabular microfracture in patients with the FAI syndrome treated arthroscopically were confirmed.A statistically significant difference between the two studied groups was reported in the mHHS parameter at 12 and 24 months after surgery and also in the VAS parameter at 24 months in favour of the group with performed microfracture.In both the studied groups, the arthroscopy resulted in a statistically significant improvement of the assessed quality of life parameters.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYPauwels classification system is widely used to classify the femoral neck fractures.Even its widely usage there are severals debates about its reliability.After the femoral neck fracture occured the lower extremity rotates externally and this external rotation deformity could lead to misevaluation of Pauwels angle at the initial radiographs.The purpose of our study is to investigate whether the reliability of Pauwels classification increases after reduction of femoral neck fractures. MATERIAL AND METHODSTwo power point presentation was prepared with 117 slides that include antero-posterior radiographs of each femoral neck fracture.The first one included preoperatively taken radiographs and the second one included early postoperatively taken radiographs.Eight observers evaluated these radiographs and they classified the fractures according to Pauwels classification system.After 3 months, the order of the slides were changed for each presentation and the observers were asked to evaluate the radiographs again.Intraclass correlation coefficient values were calculated for evaluation of inter-and intra-observer reliability. RESULTSThe mean intra-observer agreement of preoperative evaluation was 0.406 (0.071-0.626) and the interobserver agreements were 0.263 (0.197-0.342) and 0.359 (0.287-0.447), respectively.The intra-observer agreement of postoperative evaluation was 0.508 (0.393-0.757), inter-observer agreements were 0.427 (0.353-0.509) and 0.431 (0.356-0.513), respectively.According to preoperative and postoperative evaluations, 6 of 8 observers' intra-observer agreements were found to be increased and the remaining 2 decreased.Interobserver reliability was improved from poor to fair-good values after evaluating the reducted fracture radiographs. DISCUSSIONFemoral neck fractures(FNF) are common and anatomical reduction and internal fixation are preferred as a treatment option in young people and patients have good bone quality.Pauwels classification system is used for classify the FNF based on the shearing angle of the fracture line.As this angle increases, the fracture becomes unstable and nowadays stronger fixation devices are preferred for unstable fractures.Therefore, misevaluation of the fracture can lead to wrong treatment method selection.Non-optimal X-rays taken in the emergency rooms may cause misinterpretation of femoral neck fractures according to Pauwels classification system.We hypothized that the reliability of this classification system could be improved after reduction of the fracture. CONCLUSIONSOur study showed that classifying the femoral neck fracture according to Pauwels classification system is more confidential after the reduction, however we can not state that it's reliability is adequate.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYTo investigate the pressure levels on the axillary nerve at different plate positions after plate fixation of a proximal humerus fracture. MATERIAL AND METHODSEight fresh-frozen cadaveric specimens were used.The plates were applied on the lateral side of the humerus.A FlexiForce pressure sensor was placed between the nerve and the plate, and the pressure on the nerve was measured (Group 1).The plates were then placed in two different positions such that distal portion of the plates would have 30° anterior and 30°p osterior angles to the anatomical axis of the humerus (Group 2 and 3).The anterior of the distal attachment of the deltoid muscle was then elevated and the plates were placed in the middle of the anatomical axis of the humerus (Group 4).The position of the plates were controlled by fluoroscopy and the pressure was measured for each configuration sequentially. RESULTSThe mean age of the cadavers was 70.5 ± 6.8 years (range: 61-80 years).Mean pressure values of the groups were 2.65 ± 0.8, 2.52 ± 0.8, 5.65 ± 1.4, and 2.56 ± 0.9 N, respectively.Group 3 had statistically highest-pressure values than the other groups, while no difference was found among groups 1, 2, and 4. DISCUSSIONNumbness and weakness of the shoulder muscles are other clinical findings.If numbness on the deltoid muscle is reported, then atrophy is noted in the deltoid muscle in later stages.Persistent pain may be seen even if fracture union occurs after PHF surgery.Axillary nerve entrapment may be considered after the removal of common complications such as avascular necrosis due to fracture, screw migration, infection, and biceps tendon and rotator cuff problems.The sensory branch of the axillary nerve provides the sensation of the anterior joint capsule and lateral part of the deltoid muscle. CONCLUSIONSProximal humerus plates, which are angled posteriorly along, lead to an increased pressure on the axillary nerve.Anterior orientation of the plate or elevation of deltoid insertion may be used to prevent the possible complications related to axillary nerve.Level of evidence Level II.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONThe authors present the long-term clinical outcomes of revision anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.The aim was to compare the surgical technique with respect to the clinical outcomes within 3 years postoperatively. MATERIAL AND METHODSThe clinical evaluation of revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions performed at our department in 2002-2017 was carried out.A total of 82 patients were included in the study, male as well as female patients.Apart from the clinical outcomes, the associated procedures performed as a consequence of other injuries or damage to other intraarticular structures, the surgical technique as such, potential complications of revision reconstruction and causes of failure were studied.The same criteria were followed up in all the patients -clinical range of motion (ROM) of the operated knee, knee stability -pivot shift test, instrumental Lachman test using Rolimeter, IKDC subjective form, Tegner and Lysholm scores. RESULTSIn the group of patients, the surgical technique involved the use of a harmstring tendon autograft as a new graft for revision in 43 patients, a BTB autograft in 25 patients, and a BTB cadaverous graft in 14 patients.In 24 cases, a two-stage surgery was performed.The interval between the first-and the second-stage procedure ranged from 6 weeks up to 6 months, with the median of 62.4 days.During the evaluation, no difference was observed whether one-stage or two-stage surgery was performed, therefore this is not reflected in the overall evaluation.The clinical evaluation resulted in the following mean values when comparing the preoperative and final postoperative findings: The mean value of the IKDC subjective knee form score was 42 (30-62) preoperatively and increased to 77 (66-89) at 3 months.The values obtained at 6 months, 1 year and 3 years were 84 (73-93), 88 (79-100) and 89 (78-100), respectively.The mean value of the Lysholm score in the followedup study population was 63 preoperatively, which indicates a clearly poor result.The score rose to 71 (62-88) at 3 months, to 79 (67-92) at 6 months, to 89 (67-94) at 1 year, and at 3 years the mean score was again 89 (66-95).No serious complications were reported. CONCLUSIONSThe results confirmed sufficient postoperative stability of the knee joint.In terms of function and pain perception the treatment was considered appropriate.No major complications occurred during surgeries.Based on the results, the authors foresee the patient s return to sports, at least at recreational level.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYHemiepiphyseodesis is commonly used to correct a coronal plane knee deformity during childhood.Since 2007 Blount staple method has been replaced by the eight-Plate Guided Growth System.We retrospectively analysed the indications, results and complications of the older Blount staple method so as to compare them with the newer eight-Plate Guided Growth system. MATERIAL AND METHODSIn the period from 2009 to 2019, a total of 98 lower extremities of 54 patients were treated by hemiepiphyseodesis.Lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA), medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA) and mechanical axis deviation (MAD) were measured before and after the correction.We focused on the location of hemiepiphyseodesis (distal femur/proximal tibia/both), the operative time and compared the results of implanting 2 or 3 Blount staples. RESULTSThe primary correction of valgus knee deformity was achieved in 97%, of which only partial correction was observed in 9.2% and slight overcorrection in 6.1%.A total of 4 patients (4.1%) underwent subsequent corrective osteotomy.The mean LDFA increased from 80° to 86°, while the mean MPTA decreased from 94° to 92°.The mean MAD decreased from 23 mm to 3 mm.The reported complication rate was 5.1%, including four cases of loosening of staples and one case of superficial infection. DISCUSSIONIt has been verified that the LDFA reduction correlates with staple implantation into the distal femur, conversely the increase in the MPTA correlated with the implantation of staples into the proximal tibia or into both locations.The number of implanted staples (2 or 3) did not affect the size of the resulting correction, but the operative time was statistically significantly shorter when 2 instead of 3 staples were implanted. CONCLUSIONSBlount staple hemiepiphyseodesis is an older method, but it still gives very good results with a low rate of complications.The operating time can be shortened by using 2 staples only, with the same correction effect.The LDFA and MPTA parameters are helpful in identifying the location of hemiepiphyseodesis.The key to success of treatment still remains in correct timing of the implantation of staples with sufficient growth potential.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSThe study group includes 20 patients, 9 men with the mean age of 68 years (range 62-78 years) and 11 women with the mean age of 69 years (range 52-81 years).13 patients underwent surgery on the right knee and 7 patients on the left knee.The mean length of symptoms was 13 months (range 7-20 months), the mean varus knee deformity was 7° (range 4-12°).The selected patients met both the clinical and radiological criteria for enrolment in the study.In all of them medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty was performed in 2019 by the same surgeon.After surgery, the parameters of accuracy of alignment of individual prosthetic components were measured on the full-length radiograph of the limb under load.The WOMAC score was recorded preoperatively and one year after surgery and subsequently compared.The knee joint flexion preoperatively and one year after surgery was evaluated. RESULTSThe analysis of radiographs revealed that in 12 cases the femoral component was implanted in the mean valgus angle of 1.6° (range 1-3°) and in 8 cases in the mean varus angle of 3° (range 1-5°).All femoral components were implanted in the mean flexion of 7.3° (range 3-11°), no component was implanted in extension.As concerns the tibial component, 19 components were implanted in a neutral or minimum varus angle with the mean value of 1.1° (range 0.3-4°).One component only was implanted in the valgus angle of 1°.All tibial components were implanted with the mean dorsal slope of 6.5° (range 4-8°).The incision was 5 mm deep on average (range 3-6 mm).There was a slight divergence between the components, namely 2.8° on average (range 2-7°) and the distance between the components was 4mm on average (range 3-5 mm).The mean knee joint flexion achieved preoperatively by patients was 115° (range 110-123°), whereas postoperatively the mean flexion achieved was 126° (range 111-138°).The preoperative Womac score was 84.5 points on average (range 64-96 points), whereas postoperatively it was 26.4 points on average (range 7-52 points).None of the components was implanted outside the permitted range, no early complications of the partial replacement (luxation of polyethylene mobile bearing insert, early loosening of the prosthesis, tibial fracture) were observed. DISCUSSIONOur radiographic measurements show that when Zimmer Microplasty ® instrumentation is used correct alignment of the femoral and tibial component can be achieved and the individual components were correctly aligned within the recommended range.Every single component met the required criteria for alignment.When comparing the values obtained by us in measurements with those obtained by other authors from abroad, similar results regarding the alignment of components were achieved. CONCLUSIONSWhen using Zimmer Microplasty ® instrumentation, excellent results can be achieved also at the beginning of the learning curve of partial knee replacement.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYVertically unstable transforaminal sacral fractures can be stabilized with several types of transiliac internal fixators (TIFI): the classical one (TIFI-C), the supraacetabular one (TIFI-A) and by dual application of TIFI (DTIFI). MATERIAL AND METHODSPelvic models made of solid foam (Sawbones 1301) were used in the study.Mechanical loading tests were performed in order to assess the stiffness of the studied pelvic structures.The stiffness of the intact model was approximated as the slope of load/displacement curve.Then vertically unstable right-sided linear transforaminal fracture was created and subsequently fixed by TIFI-C, TIFI-A and DTIFI (each fixator for a separate model).The fixation techniques were compared based on the ratio between the stiffness of the treated and of the intact pelvis.Motion of the posterior pelvic structures and their deformations were measured using a photogrammetric system with four synchronous cameras.Loads applied at the base of sacrum and sacral base displacements were recorded by the testing device and used to assess the stiffness of the model structure.A dedicated load cell and a monoaxial extensometer were utilised.Every measurement was repeated at least 10 times.Obtained data were analysed by one way ANOVA test with post hoc comparison by Tukey HSD test. RESULTSMean stiffness ratio (±1SD) of pelvic structure was 0.638 ± 0.005 for TIFI-C, 0.722 ± 0.014 for TIFI-A and 0.720 ± 0.008 for DTIFI.Dual transiliac internal fixation and supraacetabular fixation were superior to the classical one (p < 0.0001), but DTIFI and TIFI-A stiffness ratios were statistically equivalent (p = 0.9112). CONCLUSIONSResults of the mechanical analysis using pelvic models indicate that for linear vertical transforaminal sacral fracture without comminuted zone, an application of either TIFI-A or DTIFI provides significantly higher stiffness of the lateral pelvic segment than application of TIFI-C.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS Synovial fluid (SF) samples were collected from 82 patients. The group consisted of 60 non-inflammatory, 11 inflammatory-non-pyogenic, 11 inflammatory-pyogenic SF. SF miRNA was isolated by RNA Isolation Kit Plasma/Serum. The concentrations of miRNA were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and procalcitonin on automatic analyser, presepsin on POCT system, interleukin-1 and human neutrofil defensins 1-3 by ELISA. RESULTS A statistically significant negative correlation was found between miR-146-5p and miR-223-3p, WBC, IL-1β, IL-6 and CRP (P < 0.05) in all groups; a statistically significant positive correlation was found between miR-223-3p and miR-23a-3p, WBC, PMN, IL-1beta, IL-6 and HNP1-3, as well as a positive correlation of miR-23a-3p with IL-1β, IL-6 and HNP1-3. A statistically significant difference was found between miR-146a-5p, miR-223-3p and miR-23a-3p and individual SF groups, P = 0.006, P < 0.001, respectively. PMN, WBC, Il-1β, IL-6, HNP 1-3 predicted the inflammatory processes with excellent diagnostic power (AUC > 0.9). The clinical relevance expressed by effect size was the strongest in miR-223-3p, PMN, IL-1 , HNP 1-3 between non-inflammatory and inflammatory-pyogenic group. CONCLUSIONS Our study quantified the SF miRNA by ELISA. We have shown that miR-146a-5p, miR-223-3p and miR-23a-3p can be an important group of biomarkers for the detection and monitoring of various pathophysiological conditions in synovial fluid, including inflammatory conditions.

MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective study included all patients who underwent a whole-body CT in the University Hospital Olomouc during a period of one year. Epidemiologic data of patients and information about the trauma and injuries suffered were collected. The injuries were assessed using the Abbreviated Injury Scale and the Injury Severity Score and classified as high- and low-energy injuries. These two groups were subsequently compared. RESULTS A total of 338 patients were examined, of whom 75% were male and the median age of all patients was 48 years. The most frequent causes of trauma were road accidents in 53% and falls from height in 25%. Ninety-one percent of examined patients were admitted to hospital, 42% underwent a surgery and 3% died. The average ISS was 10.7 and the severity of injury increased with age (p = 0.01). The patients after an attempted suicide and those after motorbike and bike accidents had the highest ISS observed. A higher ISS was detected more often in high-energy traumas than in low-energy traumas (p = 0.002). A completely negative polytrauma CT scan finding was observed in 5 patients with low-energy trauma and in 9 patients with high-energy trauma. CONCLUSIONS High-energy injuries were shown to be associated with higher severity as well as more negative CT scans than lowenergy ones. Bearing in mind that a whole-body CT scan is an extensive examination in which relatively high doses of radiation are used, it should always be considered whether a selective CT of fewer body parts would not be sufficient for the diagnosis.

MATERIAL AND METHODS The evaluated outcomes of 34 patients operated in the period 2004-2017, i.e. with the minimum follow-up period of three years, were compared with the outcomes of 34 patients selected individually so that in pairs the age and sex are identical - 10 women and 24 men in the range of age from 20 to 44 years, with the median of 29 years at the time of surgery. The assessment and comparison of the outcomes achieved are done according to the Lysholm and Tegner scores. RESULTS The mean Lysholm score of the patients after the revision ACL reconstruction using the cadaverous BTB allograft achieved 54.7 points preoperatively, 72.3 points at the 1-year follow-up and 77.4 points at the 3-year follow-up. The Tegner score at the time of full performance before the injury was 7.7 points, whereas it was 5.8 points after the injury and 6.5 points three years after the surgery. In the group of patients after the primary ACL reconstruction using the autologous BTB graft, the Lysholm score was 64.4 points preoperatively, 85.1 points one year postoperatively and 88.2 points three years postoperatively. The results according to the Tegner score achieved by the primary control group at respective follow-up periods were 6.7 points, 5.1 points and 6.2 points respectively. DISCUSSION The increase in the number of performed ACL reconstructions leads also to an increase in the number of revision surgeries. This trend is also fuelled by the change in the lifestyle, the shift in age-related indication criteria for surgery, and other factors. The realistic expectations regarding the outcome of the revision ACL reconstruction shall take into account the effect of multiple insults that the knee must withstand. Even though subjective improvement of the knee condition is usually experienced postoperatively, the achieved outcomes tend to be less positive than in primary reconstructions. The return to the original pre-injury level of sports activities is achieved less frequently after revision surgeries. CONCLUSIONS The revision surgery of ACL rupture using the cadaverous BTB graft is a safe and reliable technique. It has a potential to improve the subjective satisfaction of the patient, nonetheless the mean postoperative Lysholm score is not so high as that achieved in patients after primary ACL reconstruction.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYShoulder instability is often times accompanied by associated injuries caused by the humeral head displacement.These are primarily bone lesions on the head and socket of the glenohumeral joint.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency, morphology and clinical significance of bone lesions in shoulder instabilities in a group of patients operated in our department for glenohumeral instability between 2012 and 2019. MATERIAL AND METHODSThe ongoing evaluation included 373 patients with trauma and habitual instability who had undergone surgery in our department in the period from 2012 to 2019.All patients underwent a preoperative 3D CT scan of the shoulder joint.Subsequently, the morphology and clinical significance of individual bone lesions were evaluated based on the older Burkhart s concept of engaging/nonengaging lesions and the newer concept of glenoid track by Yamamoto and Di Giacomo of 2007, 2014 or 2020. RESULTSThe frequency of Hill-Sachs lesion was 83.4% (311) in our group of patients.In nearly two thirds (211 cases) also a bone defect on glenoid was detected (59.3%).When comparing the basic types of instabilities, in the TUBS group the Hill-Sachs lesions were present up to twice as often as in the group with AMBRI instability.Clinically significant Hill-Sachs lesions according to the older concept of engaging/ nonengaging lesions of Burkhart were reported in 104 cases (34%).Clinically significant lesions according to the newer concept of Yamamoto and DiGiacomo (the so-called off-track lesions) were observed in 173 cases (55.6%).Classified as critical were the clinically insignificant lesions (the so-called on-track lesions), which by their location were near the glenoid track.These lesions were found in 80 patients.After adding up the significant (off-track) and critical on-track lesions, we arrived at 253 (81.4%) clinically significant lesions based on the updated Yamamoto concept. DISCUSSIONThe frequency of Hill-Sachs lesions and glenoid defects identified by us is close to the upper limit of the range described in literature (8 to 100%).Based on the recent study by Yamamoto, added to these defects were the so-called peripheral ontrack defects, the clinical significance of which is currently indisputable.The oldest classification into engaging/nonengaging lesions revealed only 34% of the significant lesions, but this concept does not evaluate the glenoid defect.The newer concept by Yamamoto/DiGiacomo resulted in detecting 55.6% of significant Hill-Sachs lesions.The latest modification of the glenoid track of 2020, which includes also the on-track lesions in the critical zone among the significant lesions, in our group of patients classified 81% of lesions as clinically significant. CONCLUSIONSOur study confirmed the very frequent occurrence of clinically significant Hill-Sachs lesions in shoulder instabilities.Therefore, for the sake of successful shoulder stabilisation surgery detailed preoperative planning with 3D CT of the shoulder joint and evaluation of the associated bone lesions are necessary.The highest detection of clinically significant lesions was achieved by the latest modification of the glenoid track concept.Future studies will have to prove the effect of this classification on the result of surgical treatment.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYAnterior cruciate ligament (ACL) preservation surgical techniques have been rising lately.In the acute setting, proximal ACL tears and femoral avulsions of the ACL are good indications for primary repair of the ACL.However, literature shows a wide range of failure rates.An intact synovial membrane seems to be a predicational factor for the outcome of primary ACL repair.Disruption of the synovial membrane is associated with higher failure rates.We describe a surgical technique repairing the ACL in combination with a semitendinosus augmentation for proximal ACL tears with or without disruption of the synovial membrane. MATERIAL AND METHODSThe procedure preserves as much of the original anatomy as possible by repairing the synovial membrane and ACL remnant to the femoral origin.To accomplish this, we have built on the so-called \"Single Anteromedial Bundle Biological Augmentation (SAMBBA) technique\" and developed it further to the \"Single Anteromedial Bundle Biological Augmentation and Refixation (SAMBBAR) technique\", which we firstly describe here. RESULTSAll three patients treated with the SAMBBAR technique showed very good short-term clinical outcomes comparable with successful standard ACL reconstruction.There were no complications.Twelve months postoperatively, patients had no pain.They had normal range of motion in the affected knee without any signs of instability. DISCUSSIONThe SAMBBAR technique seems to be an adequate procedure to preserve as much proprioceptive native tissue as possible, while at the same time ensuring high tissue strength in order to reduce failure rates.Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to compare the new SAMBBAR technique with standard ACL reconstruction, with the original SAMBBA technique, and with techniques of ACL refixation. CONCLUSIONSWith the presented surgical procedure, it is possible to perform a standard ACL reconstruction using an autologous semitendinosus graft and at the same time preserving the tissue remnant of the ACL in all proximal tear patterns.This might contribute to improved proprioception and rehabilitation without sacrificing stability.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSA total 44 patients operated for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture by AM portal technique between January 2013 and July 2015, were included in this study.They were subjected to a magnetic resonance imaging of the knee to assess the FT, dimensions of the FT aperture and TT.The location of the ACL graft within the joint was compared with the intact ACL of healthy individuals.The patients were also evaluated using Lysholm and IKDC subjective scores for functional outcome. RESULTSThe mean FT angle on both the coronal plane (42.88°±5.83°)and the sagittal plane (68.47°±9.57°)was significantly different from the intra-articular part of the hamstring autograft angles (74.93°±7.27°and 58.74°±4.88°,respectively) (p<0.0001).The mean distance of the FT aperture was 13.18 (±2.49) mm on vertical axis, 10.97 (±1.50) mm on the sagittal axis (p<0.0001).The difference between TT axis and the axis of the intra-articular part of autograft on both coronal (72.78°±4.67°and 74.93°±7.27°,respectively) and sagittal planes (60.12°±5.53°and 58.74°±4.88°,respectively) were not significant (p>0.05). DISCUSSIONIlingrowth et al. claimed that the FT were scattered in the very large distance and some of them were placed outside of anatomical range in the series included the cases performed with transtibial and transtibial independent techniques.In this series, in which we used a femoral guide to drill the FT at lateral femoral condyle at 2 or 10 o'clock position depended upon the site of operation, we obtained a consistent FT which is comparable with the intra-articular part of native ACL.Amano et al. found that the FT aperture enlargement was significant in the series when hamstring tendons were used as autograft, over a 6-month period.We also found a significant difference between the narrowest part of the FT (7.01 ± 1.05 mm) and its aperture (10.97 ± 1.50 mm in sagittal, 13.18 ± 2.49 mm in vertical direction).The enlargement was mainly in the vertical direction, due to the fact that the loads resulting from daily life are mostly on the horizontal plane. CONCLUSIONSThe direction of intra-articular part of the ACL graft in the cases operated with the AM portal technique is significantly different from the FT direction in both the coronal and sagittal planes.The enlargement of the FT aperture is larger in the vertical axis compared to the sagittal axis.Although the long-term clinical consequences of asymmetrical enlargement of the FT aperture are not known yet, to avoid this potential risk, a technique to approximate the direction of FT to the intra-articular part of the ACL without changing the FT entry site, can be used.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to simulate different types of cervical vertebra loading and to find out whether mechanical stress would concentrate in regions known in clinical practice as predilection sites for osteophyte formation. The objective was to develop a theoretical model that would elucidate clinical observations concerning the predilection site of bone remodelling in view of the physiological changes inside the cervical vertebral body.A real 3D-geometry of the fourth cervical vertebra had been made by the commercially available system ATOS II. This is a high-resolution measuring system using principles of optical triangulation. This flexible optical measuring machine projects fringe patterns on the surface of a selected object and the pattern is observed with two cameras. 3D coordinates for each camera pixel were calculated with high precision and a polygon mesh of the object's surface was further generated. In the next step an ANSYS programme was used to calculate strains and stresses in each finite element of the virtual vertebra. The applied forces used in the experiment corresponded in both magnitude and direction to physiological stress. Mechanical loading in neutral position was characterized by a distribution of 80% mechanical stress to the vertebral body and 10% to each of the zygoapophyseal joints. Hyperlordotic loading was simulated by 60% force transfer to the vertebral body end-plate and 20% to each of the small joint while kyphotic loading involved a 90% load on the vertebral body endplate and 5% on each facet.Mechanical stress distribution calculated in a neutral position of the model correlated well with bone mineral distribution of a healthy vertebra, and verified the model itself. The virtual mechanical loading of a vertebra in kyphotic position concentrated deformation stress into the uncinate processes and the dorsal apophyseal rim of the vertebral body. The simulation of mechanical loading in hyperlordosis, on the other hand, shifted the region of maximum deformation into the articulation process of the Z-joint. All locations are known as areas of osteophyte formation in degenerated cervical vertebrae.The theoretical model developed during this study corresponded well with human spine behaviour in terms of predilection sites for osteodegenerative changes, as observed in clinical practice. A mathematical simulation of mechanical stress distribution in pre-operative planning may lead to the optimisation of post-operative anatomical relationship between adjacent vertebrae. Such improvement in our surgical practice may further reduce the incidence of degenerative changes in adjacent motion segments of the cervical spine and possibly also lead to better subjective and clinical results after cervical spine reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Leukocyte esterase is an enzyme in neutrophils from which it is released into exudate; its detection by colorimetric test strips indicates the presence of neutrophils. This is a rapid method to find whether exudate is of infectious or non-infectious aetiology. The aim of the study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of leukocyte esterase testing with use of AUTION Sticks (Arkray) for examination of exudates obtained in inflammatory diseases of the skeletal system.Exudates associated with skeletal system diseases were collected from 45 patients in the period from July 1st to December 31 st , 2012. Aspirates obtained under sterile conditions were examined for leukocyte esterase; cytological and microbiological examinations were also carried out. For the detection of leukocyte esterase, a drop of aspirate was placed on the reagent zone of a test strip and the resulting colour reaction was read after 90 minutes. Changes in colour were compared with a reference strip provided by the manufacturer. The results were assessed on a five-shade scale as follows: 0, no colour change; 1 to 4, gradual change from light pink to deep purple. The results were compared with those of cytological and microbiological examinations. Shade 4 on the strip corresponded to a positive cytological finding of bacterial infection, and shades 3 and 4 correlated with a positive microbial finding. The sensitivity and specificity of leukocyte esterase testing were statistically evaluated for both comparisons.Based on the results of cytological and microbiological examinations, an infectious aetiology of exudate was diagnosed in 21 (44.4%) and non-infectious aetiology in 24 (63.6%) patients. With leukocyte esterase reagent strips when shade 4 was taken as a positive result, the sensitivity and specificity of examination was assessed as 0.6190 and 0.9583, respectively. When taking both shade 3 and shade 4 for a positive result, sensitivity and specificity were 0.8571 and 0.8750, respectively. Shades 0 and 1 corresponded to the number of leukocytes in exudate that was no higher than 2 x 10⁹/ml.The detection of leukocyte esterase is a quick and easy examination. It is useful for readily excluding or confirming an infectious aetiology of exudate and can, to some extent, substitute a cytological examination. It can also help to make a quick decision whether one- or two-stage joint reimplantation should be performed and thus eliminate the need of intra-operative histological examination of frozen tissue samples. A drawback of the method was that exudate samples contaminated with blood interfered with an assessment of colour shades. However, this can be avoided by centrifugation of the sample and use of a supernatant free from erythrocytes.Diagnosing infectious aetiology of joint exudate or exudate from an abscess using leukocyte esterase reagent strips appears, according to our results, to be a promising, semi-quantitative method with high specificity and sensitivity which is rapid, simple and affordable. It can be useful particularly in out-patient institutions for a quick diagnosis of arthritis; intraoperatively, it can serve as an additional method to other exudate examinations.",

    "abstract": "The number of papers reporting the occurrence of specific pathological fractures in long-term biphosphonate users has recently increased.They refer to the forms of stress fracture probably resulting from an extreme decrease in bone turnover, which may involve sub-trochanteric or isolated transverse fractures, or short transverse fractures with a unicortical beak in an area of cortrical hypertrophy.At the time of prodromal signs and symptoms, cortical bone at the site of impeding fracture appears rougher on radiographs.Gradually, an incomplete fracture develops, with a subsequent complete fracture often sustained without any mechanism of injury noted.The occurrence of such fractures is reported in the range of 2 to 8 years from the start of biphosphonate use.The fractures are often bilateral and, at the time the first occurs, it is often possible to diagnose contralateral pathological changes similar to those before the first fracture.The paper presents the case of a female patient who sustained a bilateral pathological sub-trochanteric fracture; the first fracture occurred after 5 and the other after 9 years of Rizendronat use.She was followed up for unilateral incomplete subtrochanteric fracture from the fourth year of its use.In that period, magnetic resonance imaging showed a pathological finding in the contralateral extremity.She had already had prodromal signs manifested as lasting hip pain before the first fracture.Both fractures were surgically treated.Thirty-three months later she had to undergo repeat surgery for pseudoarthrosis at the site of the first fracture.The pseudoarthrosis healed without complications.However, in the second fracture non-union was still present at 7 months after surgery.The patient took Rizendronat during the whole treatment period and thereafter.In the discussion, certain aspects of long-term biphosphonate use are addressed, as well as some preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures related to this rare complication.",

Twelve samples involving T12 to L3 vertebrae\nwere prepared and a total of 20 pedicle screws, 10 Socon CS and\n10 Socon screws, were inserted in them. All screws were 55 mm\nin length and 6 mm in diameter. After placement, Socon CS\npedicle screws were augmented with bone cement (Cimplant cement\napplication kit, B. Braun, Aesculap). The poor quality of\nosteoporotic bone is responsible for a higher frequency of\nimplant failure due to loosening, particularly when implants\ndeveloped for healthy bone are used. In this biomechanical\nstudy, we tested one of the possibilities of how to reduce the\nrisk of implant failure by pedicle screw augmentation with bone\ncement. The results of this study confirm the hypothesis that\nthe anchorage of Socon CS cannulated pedicle screws with bone\ncement augmentation is disrupted by significantly higher\npull-out strength than that of Socon screws, when subjected to\nmonotonous loading.

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to assess mortality and the complication rate after the extensive resection of chest wall tumour and subsequent soft tissue reconstruction. We wanted to evaluate the justification for major surgery in the group of patients with primary or secondary tumours, including those with an advanced stage of disease.A total of 35 patients after major chest wall resection within an eight-year period (2000-2008) were analysed retrospectively. A major resection was defined as resection of 75 cm2 or more of full thickness of the chest wall. There were 19 cases of primary malignant tumour of the chest wall, 10 cases of secondary tumour, and 6 cases of benign or semi-malignant lesions. The chest was stabilised with the help of either polypropylene or a double layer mesh of polyester covered with polyurethane. For soft tissue reconstruction, a musculocutaneous flap was used in 18 cases. The number of resected ribs ranged from two to seven. The vertebral body was partially resected in four cases, and total sternectomy was performed in two cases. This surgery was carried out with potentially curative intent in 30 (85.7%) and with palliative intent in five patients (14.3%).No post-operative mortality occurred. The complication rate was 17.1 %. The one-year survival rate was 88.6 %. There were seven long-term survivors at 5 or more years after resection of the chest wall for soft tissue sarcoma. Local recurrence occurred in six patients (17.1%). Neither the type of prosthesis nor the type of surgical procedure influenced the complication rate.Chest wall resection is an established surgical procedure in the treatment of primary chest wall tumours and, occasionally, solitary metastatic disease. The groups of patients reported in the literature have been heterogeneous and usually small, and thus an estimation of the true risk of the major procedure is difficult. Three studies involving large patient groups published in the last 11 years have shown morbidity in 24.4%, 33.2% and 46.0% of patients and mortality in 7.0%, 3.8% and 4.1% of patients, respectively. The results in our group of unselected patients are comparable with these studies; however, we did not perform extensive procedures like pneumonectomy and chest wall resection, or extended fore quarter amputation. CONCLUSIONS Complete resection of the chest wall is feasible even in advanced tumours without significant peri-operative morbidity and mortality. Major chest wall resection as a palliative procedure remains selective for motivated patients in a good physical condition but with low quality of life caused by a chest wall tumour.",

    "abstract": "Periprosthetic fractures are increasingly frequent. The fracture may be located over the shaft of the prosthesis, at its tip or below (21). The treatment of explosion fractures is difficult because the shaft blocks the application of implants, like screws, which need to penetrate the medullary cavity. The cerclage, as a simple periosteal loop, made of wire or more recently cable, does not only avoid the medullary cavity. Its centripetal mode of action is well suited for reducing and maintaining radially displaced fractures. Furthermore, the cerclage lends itself well for minimally invasive internal fixation. New insight challenges the disrepute of which the cerclage technology suffered for decades. The outcome of cerclage fixation benefits from an improved understanding of its technology, mechano-biology and periosteal blood supply. Preconceived and generally accepted opinions like strangulation of blood supply need to be re-examined. Recent mechanical evaluations (22) demonstrate that the wire application may be improved but cable is superior in hand- ling, maintenance of tension and strength. Beside the classical concepts of absolute and relative a defined condition needs consideration. It is typical for cerclage. Called loose-lock stability it specifies the situation where a loosened implant allows first unimpeded displacement changing abruptly into a locked fixation preventing further dislocation.",

Clinical (Harris Hip Score (HHS), surgical time, blood loss, length of hospital stay) and radiographic data (leg length discrepancy, cup abduction angle, stem alignment) were collected.The HHS increased from 54.7 preoperatively to 92.6 postoperatively. Mean surgical time was 103 minutes. Mean intra- operative blood loss was 410 ml. There were 11 (7.3%) complications including two dislocations (1.3%), one deep wound infection (0.7%), three minor calcar fractures (2.0 %), one periprosthetic femur fracture (0.7 %), two subsided stems (1.3%) and two femoral nerve palsies (1.3%). One of the femoral nerve palsies remained unresolved. The prevent femoral nerve palsies we used somato-sensory evoked potentials (SSEP) after the 48th case and there were no further nerve palsies. Ten complications were in the first 48 cases. In the first 28 cases the anterior skin incision was parallel to the femoral neck and then changed to parallel the intertrochanteric line. Mean length of stay was 2.2 days. Mean cup abduction angle was 39.4 degrees and mean cup anteversion was 34.6 degrees.The initial complication rate can be related to the learning curve using a new surgical technique. In the subsequent 102 surgeries there was one stem subsidence. The minimally invasive approach in THA remains new technique and carries additional risks. Secondary to the learning curve comparable short and long term follow up's are necessary.",

    "abstract": "A rotator cuff tear is a relatively frequent cause of pain and restricted motion of the shoulder. Some orthopaedists believe that any attempt at rotator cuff reconstruction will fail. The aim of this paper is to present our experience with arthroscopic reconstruction of rotator cuff tears.Between January 1998 and December 2008, 319 patients with an early diagnosis of rotator cuff rupture were treated. The group included 67 women and 252 men, with an average age of 37 years (range, 24 to 71 years) at the time of surgery. The patients indicated for arthroscopic reconstruction had to show free motion of the shoulder, had a full thickness tear up to 3 cm in size in the sagittal plane and a Patte stage 2 tear in the frontal plane at the maximum. The outcome of surgery was evaluated at one year of follow-up and included the patient's self-assessment, modified UCLA score and incidence of complications. The probability of failure was calculated as an odds ratio of an implant failure to failure of the other implants and the probability of repeat surgery in a given implant was calculated as a relative risk in relation to the other implants.The average operative time was 52 minutes (range, 25 to 85); the average UCLA score increased from 10 to 31 points (p<0.00001). An excellent or a good result was achieved in 80% of the patients. Rotator cuff reconstruction failed in 32 patients (11%), of whom 22 (7.6%) underwent revision surgery. The failure was due to migration of rotator cuff anchors or thread failure in 14 patients (14/32; 44%). The GII anchors showed the highest risk of failure, with the odds ratio of 5.55 (95 % CI, 2.22 to 13.84) for mechanical failure of the method and a relative risk of revision surgery of 7.62 (95% CI, 2.86 to 20.27). For comparison, the RC anchors had the odds ratio for mechanical failure equal to 0.55 (95 % CI, 0.25 to 1.24) and the relative risk of repeat surgery equal to 0.41 (95% CI, 0.12 to 1.43). In addition, 18 complications were recorded. The frequency of deep wound infection was 0.7% (2/319). Six patients (2.1%) required repeat surgery for symptomatic bursitis and adhesive capsulitis.A recent meta-analysis has found no significant difference between the results of surgical rotator cuff reconstruction and its conservative treatment. We do not support this view but present here evidence that, when certain conditions are fulfilled, arthroscopic reconstruction can produce a very good clinical outcome.The arthroscopic reconstruction of a rotator cuff tears results in a marked relief of pain and improved joint function. An ideal candidate for this treatment should show passive free motion at the shoulder joint, no clinical signs of bursitis, and mobilisable tendon stumps of the torn rotator cuff. In addition, these patients should be highly motivated for post-operative rehabilitation. A suture device was most effective in rotator cuff repair. For good fixation into the bone it is recommended to use special implants that have a minimal risk of dislodgement or anchor thread failure.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYSeveral former studies show the treatment of slipped epiphysis of the femoral head (SEFH).Its reason is rather unknown.On the other hand the rare traumatic SEFH takes place due to a real accident.According to the literature these injuries are treated like chronic SEFHs.The aim of this study is to show the differences in pathology and treatment of an acute traumatic SEFH in relationship to the chronic SEFH. PATIENTS AND METHODSIn 8 patients dislocated traumatic SEFHs were reduced anatomically and stabilized by the means of 3 to 4 Kirschner-(K-) wires or two cancellous screws.Each patient got a plaster-cast fixation for about 6 weeks of the ipsilateral hip and leg and was mobilized with two crutches and partial weight bearing for 12 weeks.The implants were removed 24 weeks after surgery.Four patients with not dislocated SEFHs were immobilized or mobilized with two crutches without weight bearing according to their pain sensation.The final examination of both groups took place 2 ½ to 15 years after the initial treatment. RESULTSFour patients primarily under 10 years of age showed no or minimal radiological signs of a dislocated femoral head and were without any further inconvenience -the suspected SEFHs revealed as hip contusions.8 children aged 10 years or older at the time of trauma were treated by closed reduction and internal fixation.Complications occurred in three cases -one necrosis of the femoral head because of a perforating K-wire, one subtrochanteric femur fracture after implant removal of a prophylactically stabilized contralateral femoral head and one minimally dislocated femoral head after postoperative too early full weight bearing. DISCUSSIONThe traumatic SEFH is very different to the chronic one regarding the pathology and acute treatment.Technical challenges must be solved.Unilateral K-wiring or screwing for 24 weeks and reduced weight bearing for the first 12 weeks after surgery is a sufficient way of treatment of the traumatic SEFH. CONCLUSIONSIn the case of a traumatic SEFH it needs to be reduced anatomically and stabilized by surgical means in the acute phase.A prophylactic stabilization of the opposite intact side is usually not required.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe aim of the study was to evaluate the group of patients treated for varus arthritic knee by the method of high tibial osteotomy from the lateral approach and to assess its role in the present-day orthopaedic surgery which also offers other options such as distraction osteotomy from the medial approach, autologous chondrocyte transplantation or alloplasty. MATERIAL AND METHODSThe study included 101 patients, 41 women and 60 men, undergoing lateral valgus high tibial osteotomy at our department between 2003 and 2007.The age of patients at the time of surgery ranged from 34 to 61 years, with an average of 54 years.The follow-up period was in the range of 2 to 7 years, with an average of 5.2 years.Moderate varus gonarthrosis was the most frequent indication for osteotomy.Each procedure was preceded by arthroscopy with treatment of the pathologies found; these most frequently included a torn medial meniscus, synovitis or medial compartment chondropathy.The outcomes were evaluated using a system of clinical and radiographic assessment (A) and the Lysholm score (B) before and after surgery. RESULTSThe A system evaluation showed excellent, good and poor results in 42, 47 and 12 patients, respectively.The average Lysholm score was 51 points before surgery and 73 points at the final follow-up examination; the average improvement was by 22 points.The average mechanical axis was 2 degrees of varus before and 6 degrees of valgus after surgery.The minimal correction of the axis was 4 degrees and the maximal correction was 18 degrees.The average change of the axis was 8 degrees.Complications were recorded in 21% of the patients.None of the patients had delayed healing, pseudoarthrosis, fracture of the tibial plateau or peroneal nerve palsy. DISCUSSIONLong-term excellent and good outcomes were found more often in the patients with a greater resulting valgus angle.After surgery the average anatomical axis was 7.4 degrees of valgus for good and excellent results, and 4.3 degrees of valgus for poor results.This is in agreement with the common recommendation that osteotomy should produce mild overcorrection.The 95% osteotomy survival rate in this study is in accordance with the results reported by Coventry et al. and Sprenger et al.With strict adherence to the indication criteria, we did not find any clear relationship between the severity of knee injury before surgery and the subjective evaluation of post-operative clinical outcome.The patient's body mass index (BMI) had no effect on the outcome, but the majority of our patients had a BMI below 30 (average, 28.2).The range of motion after surgery was not significantly limited.Both the occurrence of complications and alignment maintenance are comparable with the results of distraction osteotomy. CONCLUSIONSThe mid-term results of valgus osteotomy performed by the technique described by Coventry et al. testify to the lasting success of this method.Satisfaction with its outcome can be expected in about 90% of the patients in a 5-year post-operative period.To achieve this, it is necessary to strictly observe the indication criteria, operative technique and thorough arthroscopic treatment of the joint.Also, the necessity of slight over-correction to 8 degrees of valgus is emphasised.",

Of these 53.1 % patients were operated on account of primary arthritis, 29.1 % on account of postdysplastic arthritis of the hip joint. In four patients conversion of an osseous ankylosis to an endoprosthesis was performed. In 59.7 % a medium Poldi socket was used, in 36.5 % a small Poldi socket and in 13.8 % a large Poldi socket. For fixation in all patients Palacos cement with first generation technique was used. In seven patients augmentation of a dysplastic acetabulum by an autogenous graft, as described by Harris, was made. The number of peroperative complications and technical errors does not exceed data in the literature. 15.8 % hip joints were re-operated - 0.5 % on account of a relapsing dislocation, 0.5 % because of early failure of the cement-bone bond due to bad cementing technique of the acetabular component, 1 % on account of late septic release, 0.5 % because of isolated aseptic release of the shank, 2.6 % because of aseptic release of both components and 10.7 % on account of aseptic release of the acetabular component, on average 8.3 years after surgery. Aseptic release of the socket correlates significantly with the size of the socket used and with the original diagnosis. The mean wear of the small socket is 0.22 mm per year, of the medium socket 0.28 mm per year and of the large socket 0.12 mm per year. Sockets of small size become released four times as frequently as medium and large ones and release is twice as frequent after surgery of secondary postdysplastic arhritis than after implantation on account of deforming arthritis of the hip joint. When evaluating the group of 60 hip joints according to HHS in 31.7 % excellent results were achieved, in 28.3 % good results, in 20 % satisfactory results and in 20 % poor results. The authors did not find a positive correlation between painfulness of the joint and signs of aseptic release of the socket on X-ray examination.

A typical feature of these fractures is a comminuted zone of the median portion of the vertebral body, dislocation of the anterior fragment of the vertebral body in a forward direction and filling of the gap which thus arises with material from the torn intervertebral disc. \"Pincer\" fractures tend to develop into pseudoarthroses. In the investigated group 14 fractures of this type were found (14 %). All injuries were treated from a posterior approach by internal AO fixation or USS fixation resp. in two patients in the second stage an anterior approach was used and the vertebral body was substituted. Based on analysis of the initial morphology of the fractures and the peroperative reponibility of the dislocated fragment of the anterior part of the vertebral body the injuries were classified into three groups and indication criteria for surgery were established. Groups with a non-dislocated or reponible anterior fragment can be treated from the back only by instrumentation, posterior fusion and transpedicular spongioplasty with transpedicular intercorporal desis, the group with an irreponible anterior fragment must be treated by posterior instrumentation and fusion and subsequently from an anterior approach by substitution of the vertebral body and anterior fusion.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The purpose of our paper is to evaluate the mid-term to long-term results and to confirm the basic criteria of a high-quality revision implant: safe bridging of bone defects, achievement of reliable primary fixation of revision acetabular cup, achievement of good secondary stability with documentable osteointegration of cup and demonstration of remodelling of transplanted bone tissue in the area of defects and in spaces between the implant ribs. MATERIAL AND METHODS Altogether 36 patients (38 cups) were evaluated who had undergone revision hip arthroplasty in the period from 2004 to 2010. The mean follow-up was 8.2 years (5.1-11.6 years after the reimplantation, more than 10 years in 16 patients who underwent surgery). The position and osseointegration of the implant were assessed by digital radiography, the remodelling of transplanted bone tissues in the area of defects and between the implant ribs by computed tomography with reducing artefacts around the metal implant (Aquilion 64 - Toshiba Medical Systems), and for the clinical outcomes the Harris Hip Score was used. RESULTS Preoperatively, the condition of the hip joint based on the Harris Hip Score was in 30 cases evaluated as poor, in 8 patients as satisfactory. At the time of final evaluation, 8 patients achieved excellent results, in 19 patients the condition of the joint was very good (in 2 patients bilaterally), in 6 patients it was considered satisfactory and in 3 patients poor. The mean value for HHS increased from 39.5 to 84.5. Based on the radiography evaluation, in 27 patients (in 2 patients bilaterally) the osseointegration of the revision cup was good, in 8 cases with a radiolucent line of 2-4 mm in width in DeLee zone III, in one case proximal migration of the cup occurred caused by deep infection. The informed consent form for pelvic CT was signed by 25 patients of our cohort. Remodelling of bone tissue in the space between the ribs of the implant was always detected, the presence of bone cysts was not reported, the bone defects following the application of autologous spongioplasty in the monitored patients were healed. In 6 patients, an ingrowth of fibrous tissue of 2-4 mm in width in the convexity of the cup was detected. The mean survival of the revision oval-shaped cup - TC type with a follow-up of 8.2 years after the reimplantation based on Kaplan-Meier analysis was 91.4 %. DISCUSSION The number of revision total hip arthroplasties due to a younger age of patients who undergo alloplasty keeps growing. The choice of a revision implant should always match the intraoperative finding and the bone tissue quality. The standard uncemented implants with osteoactive surface can be opted for when anterior and posterior column of the acetabulum are intact (IIA and IIB according to Paprosky). Starting from type IIC, also the proximal part of acetabulum shall be considered. At our department, preference is given to the revision cup - TC type. The oval shape facilitates a lower degree of bone resection and easier restoration of the anatomical centre of rotation. Careful debridement of granulating and necrotic tissue, thorough treatment of bone defects and osteoactive surface of implants in case of adequate primary fixation of the cup substantially contribute to the quality of its osseointegration. Greater rigidity of fixation verified by pull-out tests enables to insert angular stable screws into the gaps in the proximal part of the cup. There is still room for improvement in treating the bone defect. The application of allogenic bone grafts into the defects and spaces between the ribs of the TC cup is more challenging than the use of augmentation in the systems with trabecular titanium. Based on the evaluation of CT scans, remodelling of the transplanted bone occurs, therefore the defect zone is reduced. CONCLUSIONS The oval-shaped uncemented cup - type TC meets the requirements placed on a state-of the art revision implant, moreover its specific construction helps improve the conditions where another re-operation of acetabulum is necessary. By evaluating mid-term to long-term results of non-homogenous group of 36 patients (38 cups) we have obtained data on joint function comparable to similar groups with revision uncemented implants presented in our and foreign literature. Key words: revision oval-shaped cup, bone remodelling, pull-out tests, angular stable screws, computed tomography.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF STUDY Osteochondritis dissecans (OCHD) is an increasingly diagnosed disease among adolescent patients. It is a condition affecting subchondral bone and the lining cartilage. If left untreated, it can cause destruction of cartilage of the affected joint leading to early development of arthrosis. Mostly affected joints are knees and ankles, but affected elbow and other joints have been described too. The purpose of our study is to present the patients diagnosed and treated surgically at our clinic with arthroscopic drilling in the period 2010-2015, and subsequently the clinical findings obtained at follow-up checks after the surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 2010 and 2015, a total of 34 patients (36 joints) underwent surgical treatment at our clinic. Their age ranged from 6 to 19 years at the time of surgery, 17 girls and 17 boys underwent the surgery. All the patients were treated with transarticular antegrade arthroscopic drilling. Each patient was diagnosed based on the clinical finding, radiographs, or MRI. The patients were followed after 6 weeks, thereafter 3, 6, and 12 months after the surgery. Each patient was evaluated based on the clinical findings (presence of swelling, range of motion, and pain according to VAS), and radiographs. RESULTS The preoperative VAS was 2.9 and dropped down to 1.5 at the first follow-up visit. None of the patients complained of pain at 1-year follow-up. 34 (out of 36) patients suffered joint swelling preoperatively, 6 weeks after the surgery only 9 patients presented with ongoing swelling, at 1-year follow-up no patient reported this problem. The X-ray findings showed regression in 35 of 36 patients one year after the surgery. One female patient underwent redo surgery because of an ongoing restriction of movement and X-ray finding persistence. DISCUSSION Majority of patients with OCHD can be treated conservatively. Physical activity modification and temporary immobilization are commonly used treatment methods of this condition. If conservative treatment is unsuccessful, arthroscopy should be considered. Stable lesions have a high chance of spontaneous healing without surgery. There is a variety of arthroscopic treatment methods. Mostly transarticular transchondral drilling is used to treat this condition. CONCLUSION Treatment of OCHD with arthroscopic drilling shows promising results in our cohort of patients. We recommend to use arthroscopic drilling in patients in stage I to III according to X-ray when 3 months of conservative treatment do not improve the clinical symptoms, swelling and restriction of movement. Antegrade drilling is the most frequently used treatment method in OCHD at our clinic, we consider this technique a simple and effective, with short surgical time needed.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY In the retrospective study of two South Bohemian centres we present the comparison of pre-operative anamnestic clinical signs in relation to the arthroscopic intraoperative finding. The obtained data is used also to evaluate the arthroscopic finding in relation to age and sex. MATERIAL AND METHODS The arthroscopic findings of patients who underwent surgery in 2013-2014 period (1.1.2013-31.12.2014) at the Department of Trauma Surgery of České Budějovice Hospital, a.s. and in 2014 (1.1.-31.12.2014) at the Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology of Písek Hospital, a.s. were evaluated. In total, 1 021 patients underwent surgery, with the mean age of 44 years. The patients were not selected. The group includes all the patients who underwent surgery, including those in whom repeat arthroscopy was performed, in the respective period of time, regardless of the mechanism of difficulties. A preoperative MRI scan was carried out in 470 patients. The referring physician was present during the examination. In all the patients undergoing surgery, the main clinical preoperative sign was examined based on the documentation, namely in the following order - hemarthros, locked knee, hydrops or merely a pain. In the arthroscopic finding, the medial meniscal lesion - anterior and posterior horn, and complete tear was assessed. The same was done for lateral meniscus. In anterior cruciate ligament - ACL - partial or complete tear was assessed. We identified the frequency of findings in relation to age and evaluated the correlations between the clinical signs and the arthroscopic finding. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of hemarthros as a sign of ACL tear. The analysis was conducted based on the medical history in medical record documentation and the surgical protocol. The cartilage was not assessed. RESULTS Analysis of clinical and anamnestic signs in relation to arthroscopic findings 1. Negative arthroscopic findings (potential cartilage damage with no damage to other soft structures and normal arthroscopic findings) are in 83% accompanied by a mere knee pain. 2. High percentage of isolated locked joint (15%) in negative findings 3. Complete ACL tears are most frequently reported in the under-35 age category - 43% of 191 men who underwent surgery and 33% of 102 women. 4. Isolated injuries to ACL without the meniscus tear are frequent in younger patients - 30% - 40% of the total number of patients with injured ACL. 5. In patients older than 56 years of age the ACL damage is accompanied by concurrent meniscus tear (96% in men, 100% in women). 6. Sensitivity of hemarthros (68%) for complete ACL tear. Specificity of the presence of hemarthros in complete ACL lesions (91%) indicates that there are also complete ACL tears with no hemarthros whatsoever in the medical history. For partial tears the values of sensitivity and specificity are 27% and 67%, respectively. In partial tear, the presence of hemarthros is not a diagnostic lead. 7. In 15% of negative findings a \"locked knee\" was present. It was not a genuinely locked knee, but rather an antalgic position. Not every locked knee must necessarily mean a meniscus lesion or ACL tear. 8. Isolated meniscus tear is in 75% accompanied only by pain. 9. In our group of patients, isolated osteoarthrosis or malacic cartilage without any damage to ligaments or menisci was rare - only in 22 cases (2% of the entire group). DISCUSSION There are lots of studies which focus on comparing the clinical findings with perioperative pathology of knee joint and the importance of pre-operative clinical examination. Our extensive retrospective study proved that in 56-plus age category virtually each ACL injury is accompanied by a meniscal lesion, which can be explained by a possible ACL damage at a young age and subsequent instability resulting in meniscus tear or frequent presence of degenerative meniscal changes at an older age. A small number of isolated degenerative cartilage damage was established (2%). We fully agree with the authors who prove that the degenerative cartilage changes are ever since the very beginning accompanied by changes of the other soft structure of the knee. We revealed a high percentage of locked knee joint in negative arthroscopic findings. According to the clinical pre-operative examination, the locked knee does not automatically mean the meniscal lesion or ACL tear. In agreement with the others we prove a close association between hemarthros and ACL injury. CONCLUSIONS 1. A clinical examination, a detailed medical history is necessary 2. With hemarthros in medical history, there is a likelihood of complete ACL tear. Conversely, even a seemingly trivial knee sprain without hemarthros or locked knee can mean the ACL tear. 3. Where a mere pain is present, it mostly indicates an isolated meniscal damage or a negative finding. 4. Degenerative cartilage changes are accompanied by degeneration of menisci and ligaments. 5. Our group of patients did not include any case of hemarthros in the medical history with a negative arthroscopic finding. Hemarthros always indicated a more serious damage to knee soft structures.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Carpometacarpal (CMC) instabilities of the thumb joint occur after injuries or due to joint overload in patients with congenital joint hypermobility. They are often undiagnosed and, if left untreated, are the basis for the development of rhizarthrosis in young individuals. The authors present the results of the Eaton-Littler technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS The authors present a set of 53 CMC joints of patients with an average age of 26.8 years (15-43 years) operated on in the years 2005-2017. Post-traumatic conditions were found in 10 patients and in 43 cases instability was caused by hyperlaxity, also demonstrated in other joints. The operation was performed from the Wagner's modified anteroradial approach. After the operation, a plaster splint was applied for 6 weeks, after which rehabilitation (magnetotherapy, warm-up) began. Patients were evaluated using the VAS (pain at rest and during exercise), DASH score in the work module, and subjective evaluation (no difficulties, difficulties not limiting normal activities, and difficulties limiting normal activities) before surgery and 36 months after surgery. RESULTS During the preoperative assessment, the average VAS value was 5.6 at rest and 8.3 during exercise. During the VAS assessment at rest, the values at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after surgery were 5.6, 2.9, 0.9, 1, 2 and 1.1. When evaluated in the given intervals under load, the detected values were 4.1, 2, 2.2 and 2.4. The DASH score in the work module was 81.2 before surgery, 46.3 at 6 months, 15.2 at 12 months, 17.3 at 24 months, and 18.4 at 36 months after surgery. In the subjective self-assessment made at 36 months after surgery, 39 patients (74%) assessed their condition as having no difficulties, ten patients (19%) reported difficulties that did not limit normal activities, and four patients (7%) reported difficulties limiting normal activities. DISCUSSION Most authors present the results of their surgeries in patients with post-traumatic joint instability, and they report excellent results at two to six years after surgery. There is a negligible number of studies addressing instabilities in patients with instability caused by hypermobility. When using the conventional method described by the authors in 1973, our results of the evaluation performed at 36 months after surgery are comparable to those reported by other authors. We are well aware of the fact that this is a short-term follow-up and that this method does not prevent developing degenerative changes in the case of long-term follow-up, but reduces clinical difficulties and may delay the development of severe rhizarthrosis in young individuals. CONCLUSIONS CMC instability of the thumb joint is a relatively common disorder, although not all individuals experience clinical difficulties. In the case of difficulties, the instability needs to be diagnosed and treated as this is how the development of early rhizarthrosis in the predisposed individuals can be prevented. Our conclusions suggest a possibility of a surgical solution with good results.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The study retrospectively reviews the outcomes of patella stabilisation surgeries performed at our department in the period 2010-2020. It aimed to provide a more thorough evaluation, to compare the respective types of MPFL reconstruction and to confirm the beneficial effect of tibial tubercle ventromedialization on patella height. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the period 2010-2020, a total of 72 stabilisation surgeries of patellofemoral joint in 60 patients with objective patellar instability (OPI) were performed at our department. The surgical treatment outcomes were evaluated retrospectively using a questionnaire, including the postoperative Kujala score. A comprehensive examination was carried out in 42 patients (70%) who had completed the questionnaire. In case of distal realignment, the TT-TG distance and a change in the InsallSalvati index which serve as an indication for surgery, were assessed. RESULTS Altogether 42 patients (70%) and 46 surgical interventions (64%) were evaluated. The follow-up period was 1-11 years, with the mean follow-up of 6.9 years. In the studied group of patients, only 1 case (2%) of new dislocation was seen, in 2 cases (4%) the patients reported a subluxation episode. The mean score using the school grades was 1.76. Thirty-eight patients (90%) were satisfied with the surgical outcome, 39 patients would undergo a surgery in case of identical problems with the other limb. The mean postoperative Kujala score was 76.8 points, range 28-100 points. The mean TT-TG distance in the studied group with the preoperative CT scan (33x) was 15.4 mm (12-30 mm). The mean TT-TG distance in the cases indicated for tibial tubercle transposition was 22.2 mm (15-30 mm). The mean Insall-Salvati index prior to the performance of tibial tubercle ventromedialization was 1.33 (1-1.74). Postoperatively, the index decreased by 0.11 on average (-0.00 to -0.26) to 1.22 (0.92-1.63). No infectious complications were presented in the studied group. DISCUSSION In patients with recurrent patellar dislocation, the instability is often times caused by pathomorphologic anomalies of the patellofemoral joint. In patients with clinically expressed patellar instability and physiological values of the TT-TG distance, an isolated proximal realignment is performed by medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction. In the case of pathological values of the TT-TG distance, distal realignment is performed by tibial tubercle ventromedialization to achieve physiological values of the TT-TG distance. In the studied group, tibial tubercle ventromedialization helped decrease the Insall-Salvati index by 0.11 points on average. This has a positive side effect on the patella height, thus on increasing its stability in the femoral groove. In patients with both proximal and distal malalignment, a two-stage surgery is performed. In the isolated cases of severe instability or if symptoms of lateral patellar hyperpressure are present, musculus vastus medialis transfer or arthroscopic lateral release are performed as well. CONCLUSIONS When correctly indicated, proximal, distal realignment or their combination can bring very good functional outcomes with a low risk of recurrent dislocation and postoperative complications. The importance of MPFL reconstruction is confirmed by low incidence of recurrent dislocation in the group investigated in this study, namely when compared with studies referred to in this paper, in which the patients underwent patellar stabilisation using the Elmslie-Trillat procedure. Conversely, leaving the bone malalignment untreated during the isolated MPFL reconstruction increases the risk of its failure. Judging from the obtained results, tibial tubercle ventromedialization also has a positive effect on the patella height through its distalization. Provided the stabilisation procedure is correctly indicated and performed, the patients can get back to their normal activities, often even sports activities.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 144 patients included 65 men and 79 women, with the mean age of 45.3 years, namely 44.4 years (range 18-61 years) in men and 45.8 years (range 18-60 years) in women. Each patient was clinically examined, an anteroposterior and lateral X-ray of the elbow were performed, and proper therapy was chosen - either primary diagnostic and therapeutic arthroscopy followed by open epicondylitis surgery or primary open epicondylitis surgery alone. The treatment effect was evaluated by using the QuickDASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) scoring system at 6 months after surgery. RESULTS Out of the total group of 144 patients, 114 (79%) patients completed the questionnaire. All the results of the QuickDASH score in our group of patients are in the better half (0-5 very good, 6-15 good, 16-35 satisfactory, over 35 poor), with the mean value 5.63 (in men the mean value was 2.95-2.27 for the combination of arthroscopic and open procedure of LE, 4.55 for open procedure of LE, while in women the mean value was 7.50-6.82 for the combination of arthroscopic and open procedure of LE, 9.09 for open procedure of LE only). Altogether 96 patients (72%) experienced full pain relief. In patients treated with a combination of arthroscopic and open surgery, a higher percentage of patients reported full relief (53 patients, 85%) compared to the patients treated with the open method alone (21 patients, 62%). DISCUSSION By involving arthroscopy in the surgical treatment of patients with lateral elbow pain syndrome after unsuccessful conservative treatment, a successful and early solution to the problem was achieved in 72% of patients. The advantage of elbow arthroscopy over the conventional approach to the treatment of lateral epicondylitis consists mainly in the opportunity to observe intraarticular structures, thus provide a detailed view of the entire joint without the need for direct extensive joint opening, which makes it possible to exclude other causes of problems (e. g. chondromalacia of the radial head, loose body and other intraarticular abnormalities). At the same time, we can treat this source of problems with minimum burden placed on the patient. CONCLUSIONS Arthroscopic examination of the elbow joint makes it possible to diagnose all potential intraarticular sources of difficulties. Simultaneous elbow arthroscopy and open treatment of radial epicondylitis (release of ECRB or EDC, ECU, necrotic tissue excision, deperiostation and radial epicondyle microfractures) is a safe method with low morbidity, faster rehabilitation and return to the original activities based on subjective evaluation of patients and objective scoring.

Biopsies and imaging are a fundamental step in determining correct diagnosis, grading and selection for best treatment. We describe the case of a 77-year-old male complaining of a painless swelling in the proximal phalanx of the third ray of left hand. A biopsy was performed and the histology revealed a G2 chondrosarcoma. The patient underwent III ray amputation with metacarpal bone disarticulation and sacrifice of the radial digit nerve of the fourth ray. Definitive histology revealed grade 3 CS. Eighteen months after surgery, the patient is apparently disease-free with a good functional and aesthetic outcome although with persistent paresthesia of the fourth ray. Although there is no agreement in the literature for the treatment of low-grade chondrosarcomas, wide resection or amputation can be considered the mainstay treatment for high-grade tumors.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Hip dislocation is one of the major causes of disability in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Surgical treatment can be achieved using different techniques including proximal femoral varus derotation osteotomy (FVDRO), pelvic osteotomies, and open hip reduction (OHR). However, we claim that pathologies originating from extraarticular structures in the dislocated hip in CP can be reconstructed by extraarticular methods and OHR may not always be necessary. Therefore, this study aims to discuss the results of hip reconstruction with extraarticular intervention in patients with CP. MATERIAL AND METHODS In total, 141 hips (95 patients) were included in the study. All patients underwent FVDRO, either with or without a Dega osteotomy. Changes in the Acetabular Index (AI), Migration Index (MI), neck-shaft angle (NSA), and center-edge angle (CEA) were assessed on the preoperative, postoperative, and final follow-up anterior-posterior radiographs of the pelvis. RESULTS Median age was 8 years (range between 4-18 years). The average follow-up duration was 5 years (range between 2-9 years). Changes in AI, MI, NSA and CEA values were statistically significant for postop and follow-up periods when compared to preoperative values. Of the 141 operated hips, 8 (5.6%) hips required revision surgery due to redislocation/resubluxation detected at the follow-ups, and unilateral operation can be accepted as a risk factor for redislocation. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate that reconstructive treatment consisting of FVDRO, medial capsulotomy (in the case of reduction difficulty) and transiliac osteotomy (in the case of acetabular dysplasia) provides satisfactory outcomes in hip dislocation in CP.

MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively evaluated the group of patients operated on from 2012 to 2021. The study included 45 patients (24 women and 21 men) with a pathological lesion or a pathological fracture in the area of the proximal femur. The average age was 67 years (38-90). There were 30 (67%) cases of pathological fracture and 15 (33%) cases of pathological lesions in the cohort. In each patient, the perioperative biopsy or resected sample was sent for histological examination. The type of primary malignancy with the localization of lesions and fractures was assessed. Furthermore, we evaluated the outcomes of the surgical method chosen and its complications. We monitored the patients' functional score using the Karnofsky performance status and survival interval. RESULTS The most common primary malignancy was multiple myeloma in 10 cases (22%), followed by seven cases (16%) of breast and lung cancer and 6 cases (13%) of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Internal fixation was used in 15 cases (33%). Tumor resection with hip joint replacement was performed in 29 patients (64%). One patient was treated with percutaneous femoroplasty. Out of a total of 45 patients, 10 patients (22%) survived for less than three months. The survival rate of more than one year was observed in 21 patients (47%). A total of seven complications occurred in six patients (15%). Fewer complications occurred in the group of patients with a pathological fracture compared to the group with an impending fracture. DISCUSSION Pathological lesions in the bone or an already existing pathological fracture are signs of advanced cancer. Better outcomes are reported in patients who underwent prophylactic surgery, which was, however, not confirmed by our study. The incidence of individual primary malignancies, the postoperative complications and the patient survival corresponded to the statistical data reported by the other authors. CONCLUSIONS In patients with a pathological lesion of the proximal femur, operative treatment will increase the quality of life, either when choosing osteosynthesis or joint replacement, while prophylactic treatment is usually associated with a better prognosis. As a less invasive procedure with lower blood loss, osteosynthesis is indicated for palliative therapy in patients with a limited expected survival time or in patients with a prognosis of healing of the lesion. Reconstruction of the joint with an arthroplasty is indicated in patients with a better prognosis or in cases excluding safe osteosynthesis. Our study confirmed good outcomes with the use of an uncemented revision femoral component. Key words: metastasis, osteolysis, pathological fracture, proximal femur.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS67 consecutive patients who received a fasciotomy under the impression of NF in emergency room were divided into two groups on the basis of the result of treatment; Death (D) and survival (S) groups which were compared as follows: demographics, cause of death, number of surgical procedures, surgical period, intensive care unit period, hospital period, causes of NF, underlying disease, infected site, duration from symptom appearance to surgical day, vital sign (blood pressure, pulse and respiration rates, fever, peripheral O2 saturation), wound appearance, physical examination, laboratory study (vein and artery blood), radiologic findings and microorganism cultivation (blood and infected site culture) were evaluated for analysis. RESULTSThe mortality rate was 21% (n = 14) and the survival rate was 79% (n = 53).Most common causes of death was septic shock (85%, n = 12).Mortality of patient with NF were increased with statistically significant difference when no open wound at involved site (p = 0.05), cold skin sensation compared to other site (p = 0.04), frank cutaneous gangrene with skin sloughing (p = 0.009), vascular insufficiency (p = 0.04) and motor dysfunction (motor grade < 3) (p = 0.01).Air formation along the fascial plane have statistically significantly difference (p = 0.004).Most involved sites in death group were proximal area such as hip and thigh (65%), in sequence knee (11%) and calf (24%).While distal portion of extremities such as calf (31%), ankle and foot (25%) or forearm (30%) and hand (54%) were more common in survival group.The ratio between single and multi-organisms in each group had no statistically significant difference: respectively 67% and 33% in survival and 58% and 42% in death group. CONCLUSIONSRecognition of several risk factors (cold skin sensation, gangrene, vascular insufficiency, motor dysfunction, air formation, and proximal involvement) associated with toxicity and mortality could help surgeon to determine the necessity of further evaluation, proper selection of drug and operative timing, and those could improve the referral service in suspected cases of necrotizing fasciitis and avoid unnecessary delays in treatment Level of evidence: IV, retrospective cohort study.",

However, data regarding the tumor type, neurovascular involvement, and administration of radiation therapy before or after resection are limited. This study aimed to report on popliteal fossa sarcomas analyzing data from two institutions based on a relatively large patient sample. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-four patients (80%; 9 men and 15 women) with a popliteal fossa soft tissue sarcoma were included in this study. The reviewed patient data included sex, age, duration of complaints, interval to diagnosis, radiology, pre- and postoperative biopsy, tumor histology, surgery type, complications, and pre- and postoperative oncologic and functional outcomes. The minimum follow-up was 24 months. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 48 ± 21.23 (range 3-72) years at the time of diagnosis. The mean follow-up was 41.79 ± 16.97 (range 24-120) months. The most common histological diagnoses were synovial sarcoma (6 patients), hemangiopericytoma (2 patients), soft tissue osteosarcoma (2 patients), unidentified fusiform cell sarcoma (2 patients), and myxofibrosarcoma (2 patients). Local recurrence after limb salvage was observed in six patients (26%). At the latest followup, 2 patients died of the disease, 2 patients were still alive with progressive lung disease and soft tissue metastasis, and the remaining 20 patients were free from the disease. CONCLUSIONS Microscopically positive margins may not be an absolute indication for amputation. Also, negative margins do not provide a guarantee that local recurrence will not occur. Lymph node or distant metastasis may be predictive factors for local recurrence rather than positive margins. Key words: fossa poplitea, sarcoma.",

The authors present a case report of a 65-year-old male patient with a blunt trauma to the left chest and abdomen, diagnosed with multiple left rib fractures, left hemothorax and splenic injury with a small subcapsular hematoma with no signs of active splenic bleeding. Due to hemodynamic instability and a large volume of blood loss via the chest drain, the patient was indicated for emergency left thoracotomy. A perforation in the lower lobe of the left lung caused by rib fractures was found, which was treated with sutures. Furthermore, the diaphragm was examined, two ruptures were identified from which blood was coming out, and thus a phrenotomy was performed. The bleeding central splenic rupture came as a big surprise. A spleen preserving surgery was impossible, therefore a splenectomy had to be performed, followed by chest wall stabilization with splints. Transthoracic approach to manage the splenic injury through phrenotomy should not be used as a standard. In a selected group of patients with concomitant chest and upper abdominal organ injuries, the use of this surgical approach appears to be highly beneficial.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Dislocation is one of the most common early complications of total hip arthroplasty (THA). In this manuscript, 20 years of experience with the management of this complication are presented, particularly in relation to the type of instability. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the period between January 1999 and December 2020, at least one dislocation occurred in 157 of 8 286 (1.9%) THA patients, of which 117 dislocations (1.6%) in primary and 40 (3.4%) in revision THAs. Almost all patients were operated on from the anterolateral approach during the follow-up period. The type of dislocation was evaluated using the modified Dorr classification. In the first dislocations, conservative approach was usually opted for, except for cases with a clear malposition, irreducible or unstable hips after the reduction. The minimum follow-up period was 18 months (18-240). The success rate of the chosen treatment approach was assessed by means of standard statistical methods. RESULTS The total dislocation rate in the follow-up period was 1.6% for primary THAs and 3.4% for revision THAs. The dislocation rate was slightly higher between 1999 and 2009 compared to the following decade (2.1% versus 1.3% for primary THAs; p=0.009). The most common type of dislocation was the positional dislocation (62%), followed by dislocations due to a combination of causes (17%) and component malposition (11%). Treatment of dislocation was successful in a total of 130 patients (130/157; 83%). Even though a stable hip was achieved in 21 patients (13%), the functional outcome was unsatisfactory, and in 6 patients (4%) we failed to achieve a stable hip. In the positional type of dislocation, the success rate of closed reduction following the first-time dislocation was 86.4% and a similar success rate was reported for reoperations in the first-time dislocations due to the malpositioned components (85.7%). In the second-time dislocation, the surgical therapy was significantly more reliable compared to closed reduction regardless of the type of dislocation (78.6% versus 46%). The treatment of dislocations following primary THAs showed comparable outcomes to those of the treatment of dislocations following revision THAs. Overall, the worst outcomes were achieved in patients with a combined type of dislocation. In total, the THA had to be removed in 11.5% of hips (18/157). The probability of final THA removal increased with the increasing order of dislocation. DISCUSSION In our group of patients, the dislocation rate in THA was comparable or lower than the published data. With the use of preventive measures, i.e. dual mobility cup or larger head diameters in high-risk patients, we managed to reduce the dislocation rate over time. The positional type of dislocation prevails in our group of patients just as in the previously published series, followed by instability from malposition of components. The modified Dorr classification is used to guide the treatment since it allows us not only to make good decision about the treatment modality but to some extent also to estimate the final outcome, particularly with respect to restoring a functional and stable hip. CONCLUSIONS The total dislocation rate was 1.6% for primary THAs and 3.4% for revision THAs. The first-time dislocation of the positional type shall be treated conservatively. Conversely, in the other types of dislocations and in recurrent dislocations, surgical treatment is more likely to achieve a good clinical outcome. The worst outcomes are to be expected in an instability due to combination of multiple causes, which leads to the removal of THA more often than in other types of dislocations. Also, the benefit of preventive measures in high-risk patients over time has been confirmed.

MATERIAL AND METHODS 266 patients who underwent diagnostic arthroscopy between 2015-2020 were included in this study. Age, gender, radiological fi ndings included ATT, PCLA, and FTRA were measured on preoperative MR images of all patients. RESULTS ACL tear was detected in 143 of patients and most of them were younger males. In ACL-R group, the ATT was 7 mm (-4-17 mm), PCLA value was 110º (52º-157º), and FTRA value was 5.8º (-5º-18º), while in ACL-I group, the ATT was approximately 5 mm (-4-12 mm), PCLA value was 122º (82º-162º) and FTRA value was 1.6º (-10.9º-10º) (p<0.001). ROCCurve test results showed that if ATT value was >6.05 mm (63% sensitivity, 65% specifi city) if PCLA value was <116.5º (65% sensitivity, 70% specifi city) and if FTRA value was >3.45º (73% sensitivity, 72% specifi city), these parameters could predict the probability of ACL tear, preoperatively. The Logistic Regression test results revealed that the PCLA and FTRA values could be the best markers to predict the probability of ACL tear, preoperatively. CONCLUSIONS This study results showed that the ATT, PCLA, and FTRA values could be used as predictive markers in diagnosis of ACL tear, preoperatively.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome is a complex, often post-traumatically developing impairment of the hip joint, characterized by ambiguous symptomatology, which makes early diagnosis diffi cult, especially in the early stages. Experimental retrospective study was carried out to evaluate the usability of a triaxial gyroscopic sensor in routine practice as an additional indication criterion for operative versus conservative treatment procedures. MATERIAL AND METHODS 92 patients were included in the retrospective study, and 62 completed the investigation. All patients signed informed consent. A gyroscopic sensor was placed on the right side of the pelvis above the hip joint, and the patients walked approximately 15 steps. Furthermore, an evaluation of the data during stair climbing and a complete clinical examination of the dynamics and physiological movements in the joint was carried out. Data measured with a gyroscopic sensor were processed using differential geometry methods and then evaluated using spectral analysis and neural networks. The proposed technique of diagnosing FAI using gyroscope measurement is a fast, easy-to-perform method. RESULTS Our approach in processing gyroscopic signals used to detect the stage of arthrosis and post-traumatically developing FAI could lead to more accurate early detection and capture in the early stages. CONCLUSIONS The obtained data are easily evaluated, interpretable and benefi cial in diagnosing the early stages of FAI.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The study aimed to propose an optimal based fl ap creation with the view to ensure long-term survival of the interposition arthroplasty. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 28 dorsal wrist capsules were collected from 16 cadavers (with age range at death 18 to 80 years, with no visible wrist pathology). Altogether 112 histological specimens were obtained from these 28 samples. Post-hoc Dunn's tests were used to analyse the percentage of vascularisation of individual sides of the dorsal capsule (circumference and area) at the 0.05 level of signifi cance. Spearmann's correlation analysis was used to assess the effect of age on vascularization of the dorsal wrist capsule. In cadavers in whom both capsules were collected, the limbs were compared. For the sake of comparison, the Wilcoxon matched pairs test was used. RESULTS Regarding statistical signifi cance, the largest share of the total circumference and area of the measured vessels of the dorsal capsule is constituted by the distal side (35.2% of the circumference and 30.9% of the area). The blood supply of the dorsal capsule received on the ulnar side is the lowest (12.9% of the circumference and 17.6% of the area). There was no signifi cant effect of age on vascularization of the dorsal wrist capsule confi rmed. Also, the comparison of vascularization of both limbs from a single cadaver did not yield any statistically signifi cant results. DISCUSSION Proximal row carpectomy is a long-established surgical technique used to manage the degenerative changes in the wrist. Our results showed the best vascularization on the distal and radial sides of the dorsal wrist capsule. In this light, the distally-based fl ap or the fl ap described by Berger, which respects the clinically important ligaments, appear to be the least invasive and help maintain the future stability of the wrist. CONCLUSIONS In clinical practice, we advise that a radially-based fl ap according to Berger is created and the distal side of the dorsal capsule, the most vascularized portion based on our results, is preserved as much as possible. The fl ap created in this manner also preserves the important carpal ligaments and appears to the authors of this study to be the most benefi cial, also with respect to the presence of the largest arteries, contrary to the distal side. Another option is to use a distally-based fl ap for interposition arthroplasty. Key words: interposition arthroplasty, proximal row carpectomy, vascularization, degenerative changes, wrist.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Extended lateral approach to calcaneus fractures is associated with a high risk of infection. Such risk can be reduced by using mini-invasive approaches. The sinus tarsi approach provides a good overview of the posterior joint facet of the calcaneus and can also be done as a mini-invasive procedure. The authors present their fi rst experience with osteosynthesis of joint depression calcaneal fractures using the anterolateral locking plate inserted through the sinus tarsi approach. MATERIAL AND METHODS During the period from 1 February 2020 to 31 January 2022, 18 patients were treated by the anterolateral locking plate in the authors' department (3 women, 15 men). Eleven fractures were classifi ed according to Sanders as IInd grade, fi ve as IIIrd grade and two fractures were classifi ed as tongue-type (as described by Essex-Lopresti). The fractures were treated by open reduction through the sinus tarsi approach and osteosynthesis by the anterolateral locking plate combined with headless screws. The following factors were examined: time from injury, duration of surgery, quality of reduction (post-op control with multiplanar CT scans), wound and technical complications, loss of reduction after treatment, substance abuse and comorbidities. The follow-up was 12-36 months (median 17). At one year after surgery, the functional outcomes were evaluated using the AOFAS Hindfoot score. RESULTS The most common negative predispositions for successful healing were smoking (9 cases), alcohol abuse, drug abuse, mild mental retardation, personality disorder, insulin-dependent diabetes and epilepsy (1 case each), hypothyreodism and bronchial asthma (2 cases each). The time from injury to surgery and duration of surgery surgery were measured. The quality of reduction was excellent in 12 patients (dislocation less than 1 mm), good in 6 patients (dislocation less than 2 mm), dislocation more than 2 mm was not present in the group. In one case, a revision surgery was performed because of screw malposition into the subtalar joint, delayed wound healing was observed in two cases. There was no case of deep surgical site infection or loss of reduction. The mean AOFAS score after one year was 85 points. The most common complaints were scar pain or discomfort. DISCUSSION The current studies on osteosynthesis of calcaneal fractures favor the sinus tarsi approach for its lower risk of wound-related complications compared to the extended lateral approach. The sinus tarsi approach requires the use of different osteosynthetic material than the conventional calcaneal plate. If a conventional locking plate is to be used, the surgical approach has to be modifi ed. In 2021, Wang et al. published an intermediate step leading to the reduction of early complications and the use of conventional locking calcaneal plate inserted through the sinus tarsi approach, with an additional incision. The sinus tarsi approach is used also when intramedullary nailing is performed, which is preferred by biomechanical studies evaluating the rigidity of osteosynthesis. However, when comparing nails and locking plates, the differences are insignifi cant. The use of anterolateral locking plates was presented by Xie et al., with results similar to those of our own group of patients. CONCLUSIONS The results of the followed-up group of patients confi rm low complication rate of the sinus tarsi approach as reported by current literature. At the same time, it provides good options for reduction even in complicated fractures. For successful osteosynthesis, the anterolateral locking plate with headless screws may be used. The incidence of post-operative complications is low even in high-risk patients. Adhesions of peroneal tendons can be treated with material removal and tissue release. They could be prevented by good physiotherapy. Key words: calcaneus, osteosynthesis, anterolateral plate, peroneal tendons, sinus tarsi approach.",

    "abstract": "The basic aim of the treatment of cystic nonunion is to provide stable fi xation and mechanical compression to increase union, but there is no consensus on whether to perform bone grafting in the cystic area or not. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical and radiological results of patients with cystic scaphoid non-union who received open grafting, and internal fi xation and those treated with percutaneous fi xation without grafting. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective evaluation was made of patients included those determined radiologically with Slade and Dodds grade IV scaphoid cystic non-union. Two different surgical procedures were performed. Percutaneous screw fi xation was carried out on the patients in group 1. Open curettage-grafting and screw fi xation were performed on the patients in group 2. Group 1 was comprised of 16 patients treated with percutaneous screw fi xation, and group 2 was comprised of 17 patients who had open curettage-grafting and screw fi xation. RESULTS In the radiological evaluation at the fi nal follow-up examination, union was determined in 12 of the 16 (75%) patients in group 1 and 15 of the 17 (88%) patients in group 2. There was no statistically signifi cant difference between the two groups in terms of union, functional outcomes and complication rates. DISCUSSION In the current study, the union rate was higher in the patients who had open curettage-grafting and fi xation with a headless screw (88%) than in those with percutaneous screw without grafting (75%), but the difference was not determined to be statistically signifi cant. The union rate of the group that received grafting was similar to the rates reported in the literature. CONCLUSIONS We think that both of these techniques may be successfully used for cystic scaphoid nonunions but percutaneous technique should be preferred as it is minimally invasive. Nevertheless, there is a need for further prospective, randomised studies with larger series to have better comparisons.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS Bilateral facet joint angles at the L3-4, L4-5, and L5-S1 levels were measured on axial plane in the lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 82 patients aged between 32 and 75 with LSCS, and 82 healthy individuals aged between 30 and 66 without LSCS, who were considered as the normal group. RESULTS Both groups in our study consisted of both males and females. The mean age was 51.4 for patients with LSCS and 44.7 for the healthy group, with no signifi cant difference (p>0.05). A total of 984 facet joint angles were measured, with 164 patients at three intervertebral disc levels each.

    "abstract": "The primary aim is to assess the proportion of children younger than two years with a femoral fracture who underwent a skeletal survey. The secondary aim of the study is to evaluate the patients' demographics, reported trauma mechanism, type of fracture, type of treatment and complication rate. MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a retrospective study of children younger than two years examined at the Department of Imaging Methods for a femoral fracture between 2015-2022. The type and site of the fracture were assessed on radiographs. The patients' medical records were used to assess which steps had been taken to evaluate for possible abusive etiology of the fracture. The data were correlated with the published guidelines for performing skeletal survey in young children with fractures. The patients' demographics, medical history, time interval from trauma or symptoms onset to medical examination, type of treatment, duration of orthopaedic follow-up in addition to the clinical fi ndings at the last orthopaedic follow-up visit were also retrieved from the patients' medical records. RESULTS A total of 40 children were included in the study, 21 of whom were girls (52.5%). The mean age was 13.8 months. 5 children (12.5 %) were younger than 6 months. 36 children (90%) had a history of trauma, the vast majority of whom suffered a fall. 21 patients (52.5%) sustained a distal metaphyseal fracture, 19 patients (47.5%) suffered a diaphyseal fracture. A spica cast was used in 12 patients (30%), which was applied under general anaesthesia in most cases. 28 patients (70%) received a long leg cast. A certain degree of stiffness following cast removal was the only documented complication. Based on the published guidelines, it was estimated that in 23 patients (57.5%) a skeletal survey should have been performed. However, this investigation was performed in 2 patients (5%) of the study population only. DISCUSSION Femoral fractures in young children are rare, especially in those younger than six months of age. The fractures were located in femoral diaphysis and in distal femoral metaphysis. Surgical treatment was not required, and no signifi cant complications were observed. Nonetheless, the study showed that the rate of child abuse screening was low. The skeletal survey was performed in two cases only, both children were younger than six months and had no history of trauma. Based on the published guidelines, however, it may be assumed that the skeletal survey should have been performed in more than half of the patients in the study. The failure to perform this investigation might have led to the abuse not being detected and the child being returned to the abusive environment. CONCLUSIONS Management of femoral fractures in patients younger than two years does not usually require hospitalisation and is not associated with the risk of complications. However, potential further harm may be caused if abusive etiology of the femoral fracture fails to be discovered. This study has shown that the rate of abuse evaluation is low. It is essential to initiate a multidisciplinary discussion on this topic to raise the physicians' awareness and to implement the screening for child abuse among young children with femoral fractures. This scientifi c paper also includes a summary of necessary steps to be taken in the evaluation of a young child with a femoral fracture.",

    "abstract": "Superior Capsule Reconstruction (SCR) of the shoulder joint has recently been included in the portfolio of interventions as a solution to irreparable rotator cuff tears. One of the options is to use a long head of the biceps tendon (LHBT) autograft. This paper presents the fi rst clinical outcomes of the SCR of the shoulder joint using the LHBT autograft. MATERIAL AND METHODS It is a prospective non-randomised study in which 14 patients were included, namely 7 men and 7 women. The patients were evaluated using the pain VAS, UCLA (The University of California at Los Angeles) Shoulder Rating Scale and ASES (The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons) Shoulder Score. The minimum follow-up was 12 months after surgery. The measured values were analysed using the standard statistical methods. RESULTS From August 2020 to January 2022, a total of 14 SCR with biceps tendon autograph were performed at our department. The mean age of the patients was 62 years (40-72). The mean value of the UCLA Shoulder Score was 12.36 ± 2.92 points preoperatively, while after surgery the obtained values increased to the mean value of 28.86 ± 3.08 points. The ASES score was 25.48 ± 3.89 points preoperatively and 82.41 ± 7.95 points at one year after surgery. The preoperative mean VAS score was 6.14 ± 1.10 points and 1.36 ± 0.93 points at one year after surgery. The mean active shoulder fl exion measured preoperatively was 140 degrees, whereas at one year after surgery it was 171 degrees. The mean active abduction reached 123 degrees before surgery and 169 degrees after surgery. The mean active external rotation of the shoulder joint was 59 degrees preoperatively and 52 degrees postoperatively. The mean active external rotation at 90 degrees of abduction was 52 degrees preoperatively and 60 degrees postoperatively. Whereas the improvement as against the preoperative status measured by the UCLA, ASES and pain VAS was signifi cant, the differences in the range of motion were signifi cant in the case of active fl exion and abduction only. DISCUSSION Painful irreparable rotator cuff tear constitutes an indication for SCR. The reconstruction is performed using autografts, allografts and xenografts. In literature, several SCR surgical techniques using a long head of the biceps tendon have been presented. In most of these techniques the supraglenoid insertion of the LHBT was left intact. Our study showed a signifi - cant relief from problems and good functional outcomes at 1 year after surgery when the biceps tendon had been used. Similar results are reported also by other studies using the biceps tendon for SCR. When comparing this study and the other study we published earlier on SCR with xenografts, there is no signifi cant difference in the clinical outcomes between these two techniques. On the very contrary, they are slightly better in some parameters. CONCLUSIONS Arthroscopic SCR of the shoulder joint with the biceps tendon reports good clinical outcomes at one year after surgery both with regard to the relief from problems and range of motion. Due to low morbidity of graft harvesting, low cost, and easy surgical technique, it appears to be the fi rst-choice method for superior capsule reconstruction of an irreparable tear of supraspinatus or infraspinatus if the long head of the biceps tendon is preserved. A longer follow-up period and evaluation of a larger study population would be necessary to defi nitely confi rm the success rate of the described procedure.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS Transverse, lateral oblique, and medial oblique fracture models were created in a ten years old boy's distal humerus. Eight different fi xation methods were applied to each fracture model. Displacement of the fracture models was measured under the translational and torsional forces. RESULTS In the transverse fracture model; the 6th method provided the best stability in internal rotation, external rotation, and extension loading. In varus 7th method, valgus 8th, and fl exion the 5th and 2nd methods had the best stability. In the lateral oblique fracture model; the 7th method had the best stability in all loading directions except fl exion and the 6th method had the best stability in fl exion and had acceptable values in all other directions except valgus and external rotation. In the medial oblique fracture model; the 6th method had the best stability in all directions except varus. 3rd method was the best fi xation type against varus and the second stable fi xation type in all other directions. CONCLUSIONS Combining lateral antegrade with lateral retrograde wire and lateral condylomedullary wire provides strong stability in the lateral oblique fracture. Two condylomedullary Kirchner wires and one antegrade lateral wire results in a strong stability in the medial oblique fracture. Medial-lateral condylomedullary and lateral antegrade wires provided the best stability against varus in transverse and lateral oblique fractures.",

    "abstract": "The article presents a retrospective evaluation of a group of 119 patients treated for acetabular fractures between 1996 and 2002.In the monitored period 119 patients, (89 men, 30 women) average age 35 years, were hospitalized with an acetabular fracture. Surgically treated were 91 patients (70 men, 21 women), average age 29 years. Prevailing in this group were Type A fractures which accounted for 45%, Type B was represented by 35% and Type C included 19%. Twenty-eight patients were treated conservatively.Indication for surgical treatment was instability, hip incongruence or combination of both. Conservative treatment was chosen in the fractures without displacement, in fractures with secondary congruency and in case of contraindication of surgical treatment. The indication was always based on CT examination with a three-dimensional reconstruction. The surgery was performed within 24 hours in 42%, within 48 hours in 64%, within 72 hours in 87%. Posterior Kocher-Langenbeck approach was used in 54%, anterior ilioinguinal approach in 22% and the combination of both approaches in 24%. Posterior approach was indicated in A1, A2, B1 fractures, ilioinguinal approach in A3, B3, C1 Types, the combination of both approaches in B2, C2, C3 fractures. Osteosynthetic material was chosen according to the fracture type, bone quality and fragment size.The evaluation was based on subjective complaints, radiograph and clinical examination using Harris Hip Score. In the group of 91 patients treated surgically we achieved excellent result in 41 cases (45%), very good result in 28 cases (31%), fair result in 7 cases (9%) and poor result in 13 cases (15%). We recorded 17 peroperative complications--11 times inadequate reduction, 5 times nerve injury, once vascular injury. Early complications included infect--twice and loosening of implant--once. Late complications occurred in 26 cases--paraarticular ossification in 17 cases, aseptic necrosis of the femoral head in 8 cases.The treatment of fractures of the acetabulum as any intraarticular fracture is based on a precise anatomical reduction, stable fixation and early mobilization. Difficulties of the treatment of the acetabulum arise from the anatomical relations. Decisive for the indication, the method of treatment and prognosis is the type of the injury of the weight-bearing area of the acetabulum. In order to understand the type of the fracture it is necessary to make a careful preoperative examination based particularly on CT examination with a three-dimensional reconstruction. The indication and treatment strategy--surgical approach, method of reduction, type of fixation--is selected accordingly. Each surgical approach has its limits and also the possibilities of fixation are limited by the type of the fracture. The outcomes depend directly on the quality of the reconstruction of the articular surface and the incidence of complications, caused either by the injury or preoperatively.The treatment of displaced fractures of the acetabulum is on principle surgical. Satisfactory results are produced only by anatomical reconstruction of the weight-bearing area of the acetabulum.

    "abstract": "Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) often suffer from instability of the upper cervical spine. The most common instability is anterior atlanto-axial subluxation (AAS). Instability may lead to neurologic deficits from spinal cord compression and intractable pain, decreasing quality of life and its length.This prospective study analyzed different fixation methods and the influence of atlanto-axial and occipito-cervical fusion on clinical and radiological outcome. 41 patients with RA with instability of the upper cervical spine were treated surgically for progressive instability, pain and neurological deficit. Average age of our patients was 52.4 years (21-76 years). At the time of surgery, duration of the disease was in average 18.6 years (2-47 years). Patients had advanced stage of the disease according to Steinbroker, on hands stage 3.7 and feet stage 2.9. Atlanto-axial fixation was done for AAS in 27 (24 Magerl transarticular fixations and Brooks-Jenkins technique in 3 patients). Occipito-cervical fusion was done in 13 patients (3 with Ransford loop and sublaminar wires and 9 with CerviFix). One patient was managed in halo-cast fixation. Spinal fusion was performed in all patients using autologenous bone graft. Patients were evaluated by using Functional Rating Index (FRI), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and visual pain analogue scale (VAS) before and after surgery in set intervals, when radiological examination was also performed including dynamic films.Three patients died in the postoperative period (3 weeks, 11 and 18 months). 38 patients remained for follow up, which was in average 28.4 months. Fusion was considered when hardware was intact and patient was satisfied, no motion was detected on dynamic X rays or bony fusion was clearly visible. Fusion was assessed in 40 patients, 32 fused, 8 had fibrous non-union. 3 of these patients had hardware failure. 9 patients had preoperatively verified panus formation peridentally, which resorbed after the surgery. FRI evaluation was done in 40 patients, 30 improved (14 patients by more than 10 points), 6 patients did not change and 4 worsened. The improvement after 3 and 12 months was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Average HAQ score decreased after surgery, but the change was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Average VAS score decreased significantly after surgery (p < 0.05). There were 5 hardware related complications including one vertebral artery injury. None of these complications required subsequent surgery nor had any influence on good clinical outcome.Results of FRI and VAS show the benefit from early indication of surgical stabilization of upper cervical spine in patients with RA. Based on our experience, as well as other authors, fixation of AAS by transarticular screw fixation according to Magerl is the preferred method in the younger patient group. Once destruction of the atlanto-axial joints, lateral subluxation or cranial migration of the dens is present, occipito-cervical fusion using titanium malleable implant (CerviFix) is necessary.Positive clinical outcomes advocate early surgical intervention as described in recent literature. Surgery prevents subsequent neurological damage life quality deterioration and shortening of life expectancy.",

    "abstract": "Arthroscopy of the wrist is a method facilitating the establishment of diagnosis in patients with wrist complaints which may also serve for surgical management of some of the causes of wrist pathology. The author presents his first experience with carpal arthroscopy as a diagnostic method as well as a therapeutic technique performed in one or two stages.A total of 34 patients, 12 women and 22 men, in the age range of 14 to 64 years, underwent carpal arthroscopy. This was performed to treat acute or chronic conditions in 16 and 18 patients, respectively.Arthroscopy was carried out with the hand in vertical traction, using distraction forces of 50 to 70 N, from the approach between the third and fourth or/and the fourth and fifth extensor compartments, in order to inspect the mediocarpal joint by an arthroscope with a diameter of 2.4 mm. Neither a tourniquet nor a pump was employed. When a lesion was detected, it was treated by arthroscopy or an open procedure in one surgical procedure. When indicated, further surgical intervention followed.The arthroscopic inspection revealed triangular fibrocartilagenous complex (TFCC) lesions in 18 patients. Injury to the scaphoid-lunate (SL) ligament was found in 16 patients. One patient had a combined lesion of the triquetral-lunate and SL ligaments, two showed a SL lesion together with a distal radius fracture, three were diagnosed with pseudoarthrosis of the scaphoid bone and one with synovitis after rheumatoid arthritis. In two patients, adhesions in the radiocarpal joint following a fracture of the distal radius were found and shaved. A total of 22 patients were treated by arthroscopic surgery; 19 underwent open procedures in one stage and five were indicated for secondary surgery.Wrist arthroscopy has been reported in the literature as the only method that can reveal damage to SL ligaments not shown by X-ray or magnetic resonance imaging examination. During arthroscopy, several interventions can directly be carried out by this procedure, such as treatment of the TFCC, and thus relieve the patient's complaints. Arthroscopy is irreplaceable in the diagnosis of dynamic carpal instability or injury to TFCC in ulnar-carpal impingement. Our experience suggests that arthroscopically-guided osteosynthesis of the distal radius has great prospects.In our hospital acute arthroscopy is indicated when carpal connective tissue lesions, potentially leading to wrist instability, are suspected, when damage to carpal ligaments is found by X-ray examination or when an acute TFCC lesion is suspected. Arthroscopically-guided osteosynthesis of the distal radius appears to be a prospective method. In patients with chronic complaints, wrist arthroscopy is indicated in suspected TFCC lesions with ulnar-carpal impingement, in chronic carpal synovitis, and before sperious operations on the carpal bones in order to ascertain the state of cartilage and plan the appropriate surgery.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The authors present the clinical use of the new instrumentation set for the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using the hamstring tendons (HS). The positionning of the femoral tunnel and the fixation of the graft play an important role for the results of the surgery. The aim of the study was to confirm the proposed surgical technique and the methods of the graft fixation, especially from the point of view of the clinical midterm results at the evaluation up to eight years after the surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS The clinical evaluation comprises 58 patients operated from 2007 to 2014 using the new instrumentation set. There were 9 men and 49 women included in the sample. The mean age was 34.6 years (range 18 - 58 yrs), namely 36.7 in women and 32.4 years in men. The evaluation was performed pre-opeatively and at 3 and 6 months, 1, 3, 5 and 8 years post-operatively. All the patients were followed based on the same criteria - clinical range of motion (ROM), stability of the knee - instrumentation Lachman test utilizing Rolimeter, subjective IKDC score and pain VAS scale for the harvesting site. The ocurrence and the rate of post-operative complications were monitored. RESULTS The integration and the ingrowth of the graft were achieved in all cases, the full ROM was gained as well, no pathological instability was observed. The fixation of the HS graft in the bone was confirmed by post-op X ray at 3 months after the surgery. The clinical evaluation showed the following mean differences in the pre-op and final post-op findings. The average preoperative laxity using the Lachmann test was 9.7 mm (range 6-12 mm), at 3 months 1.8 mm (1.4-2.1 mm), at 6 months 1.6 mm (1.2 - 2.2 mm), at 1 year 1.6 mm (1.1-2.3 mm), at 3 years the stability was 1.7 mm (1.2 mm-2.4 mm), at 5 years 2.3 mm (1.2-3.6 mm) and at 8 years after surgery it was 2.5 mm (1.2-3.9 mm). None of the patitents included in the study showed pathological instability that would be considered an indication for revision. In the evaluation of the subjective IKDC score, the pre-operative average was 56, with the range of 42-66, at 3 months post-operatively 79 (69-85), at 6 months 88 (74-92), at 1 year 95 (88-100), at 3 years 96 (89-100), at 5 years 94 (87-100), and at 8 years 92 (84-98). No severe complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS The method provided sufficient post-operative stability of the knee joint. Fixation of the femoral screw satisfied the demands laid on it. Regarding the pain perception, the method was considered positive, the level of pain involved in the procedure was low. No severe complications or technical mistakes occurred during the surgical procedures. The new instrumentation set developed for the ACL reconstruction offers an easy technique and comfortof use.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The method of stabilising the osteoporosis-related spinal fractures using an expandable stent (vertebral body stent - VBS) and bone cement is generally accepted for its minimal invasiveness, a low risk of complications and confirmed analgesic effect. The efficiency of reduction of a compressed vertebra is, however, still discussed in the literature. Our hypothesis was that the stent expansion in the vertebral body can achieve a statistically significant reduction in the anterior, middle and posterior part of the vertebra. MATERIAL AND METHODS The patients in whom the VBS technique was used to treat an osteoporosis-related fracture of Th/L spine in the period 2010-2014 were included in the study, namely 29 patients with 31treated fractures. The following radiographic parameters were monitored - anterior, middle and posterior vertebral body height, kyphotic angle between the upper and lower endplates of the vertebral body. Also, the radiation burden, painfulness according to VAS score and occurrence of complications were monitored. The minimum follow-up was 12 months. RESULTS The mean height of the anterior part of the vertebral body before the surgery, on the 1st postoperative day and at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months was 23.5/25.4/23.9/23.6/23.6 mm respectively. The mean height of the middle part of the vertebral body at the same intervals was 17.9/24.0/23.4/22.9/22.9/22.9 mm. The mean height of the posterior part of the vertebral body was 29.6/29.8/29.4/29.3/29.2/29.2 mm. The kyphotic angle between the endplates of the vertebral body was 8.6/5.3/7.4/7.9/8.0/8.0°. The mean VAS values were 8.2/2.4/2.0/1.9/1.8/1.7. The mean duration of surgery was 54.3 minutes. The mean time of fluoroscopy was 33.4 s. The mean radiation dose was 443.1 cGycm2. The observed complications comprised 2 cases of dilatation balloon rupture, one case of a failure to expand the stents in a healed fracture due to incorrect indication. In total, four cases of cement leakage outside the vertebral body were reported, always with no clinical response. DISCUSSION All the authors agree that the method brings immediate analgesic effect, comparable to kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty. In our cohort, good reduction ability of the implant in the middle part of the vertebral body was confirmed. This has been confirmed also by other authors. Nonetheless, at a longer time interval the loss of correction was observed, which was reported only by Hartmann (5). The other authors mostly did not take into account the longer-term outcomes. CONCLUSIONS The hypothesis that the stent is capable of a statistically significant reduction in the anterior, middle and posterior portion of the vertebral body was only partially confirmed. A statistically significant reduction was seen only in the middle portion of the vertebral body. In the anterior portion of the vertebral body the reduction was demonstrable only immediately after the surgery, while the later follow-up checks revealed the loss of correction. The statistically significant improvement of the kyphotic angle between the endplates of the injured vertebra was also seen only on the first postoperative radiographs and at later follow-up checks the improvement was no more significant. The change in the height of the posterior portion of the vertebral body was not statistically significant at any of the follow-up intervals.

    "abstract": "Vascularized bone grafting was for the first time described in the 1970s. It has become a crucial component in the reconstruction of long bone defects and non-unions in a poorly vascularised environment. Although the vascularized bone is well described for the lower extremity and mandibular reconstructions, it started to be used for the upper extremity bone defects only recently. This publication presents a case of a young man with an open fracture of both the forearm bones. The treatment of the injury has been complicated with anaerobic gas gangrene of the forearm. This resulted in a non-union, radius shortening and necrosis of both the thumb extensors and flexors muscles. Once the acute infection was managed, the patient received a two-step treatment provided jointly by orthopaedic and plastic surgeons at the University Hospital in Bratislava. At the first stage auto transplantation of the vascularized fibula into the defect of radius was performed, with radial artery and radial veins being the recipient vessels. One year later, a tendon transfer was made in order to reconstruct the extension and flexion of the thumb. Donor tendons were the following: extensor indicis proprius and flexor digitorum superficialis for ring finger. The result of the reconstruction is the full incorporation of the fibular transplant (6 months after the primary operation) and the excellent range of motion of the hand and wrist. Thanks to the tendon transfer the function of the thumb, including the opposition, was achieved two months after the secondary surgery. Key words: defect of radius, tendon transfer, anaerobic infection, gas necrosis, microsurgery.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY For an orthopedic surgeon it is difficult or even impossible to estimate the real quality of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) liners that are used in the total joint replacements (TJR) just on the basis of information given by the manufacturers. At the same time, the quality of the UHMWPE liner can impact strongly on the total lifespan of the implanted TJR. This work aims at independent, objective comparison of properties of the UHMWPE liners for total hip replacements (THR), which are most frequently used in the Czech Republic. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analyzed seventeen most frequently implanted UHMWPE cups of different manufacturers implanted in the Czech Republic between 2014 and 2015 and four control samples prepared by standard industrial-scale procedures according to our instructions, whose modification (crosslinking, thermal treatment, stabilization and sterilization) was known in detail. The UHMWPE polymer was characterized by four independent microscale methods, suitable for relatively small and irregular specimens such as THR cups: infrared microspectroscopy (IR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). RESULTS The employed methods yielded quite complete information about the investigated UHMWPE materials. IR spectra enabled us to calculate oxidation indexes (OI, measure of oxidative damage), trans-vinylene indexes (VI, measure of absorbed radiation dose during crosslinking and/or sterilization) and crystallinity indexes (CI, amount of crystalline phase that strongly influences mechanical performance). DSC curves were employed in calculation of crystallinities (wc, proportional to CI) and melting points (Tm, proportional to the average thickness of crystalline lamellae). MH measurements confirmed that the observed structure changes showed a real impact on mechanical properties. TGA experiments gave rough estimate of stabilization and, consequently, possible long-term oxidation resistance. Significant correlations among oxidative damage (OI), crystallinity (CI, wc) and microhardness (Hv) were statistically proven. The highest oxidative degradation was usually observed in samples thermally treated by annealing and/or sterilized by gamma irradiation. DISCUSSION The results confirmed our expectations that the UHMWPE liners from various manufacturers can be significantly different as far as their molecular structure, supermolecular structure, and mechanical properties are concerned. The differences among the various UHMWPE can be expected to increase after the implantation during in vivo. CONCLUSIONS From the clinical practice point of view, the results showed the following facts: (i) In the field of THR, all manufactures prefer crosslinked types of UHMWPE due to their increased wear resistance; non-crosslinked UHMWPEs are regarded as obsolete. (ii) Most of the manufacturers prefer ethylene oxide or gas plasma sterilization to gamma sterilization because the gammasterilized UHMWPEs exhibit lower long-term oxidation resistance. (iii) Modern trend is the stabilization of UHMWPEs with vitamin E. Key words: UHMWPE, hip replacements, oxidative degradation, infrared spectroscopy, microhardness.",

    "abstract": "Injuries of the flexor finger apparatus are very common. Primarily, it is routinely treated by suture of the tendon. Isolated deep flexor injuries, when the flexion restriction only reaches the DIP joint, are sometimes overlooked by the surgeon or by the patients themselves, especially if the deep flexor is injured, after a closed rupture or cutaneous injury with a small skin wound. The patient is then sent to a department specializing in hand surgery after a few weeks. Subsequent shortening of the tendon apparatus makes flexor suture more difficult or sometimes even impossible. Many ways of suturing the tendons and subsequent treatment are described. The treatment results vary immensely. It depends on the mechanism of injury, injury zone, the suture suture technique used, time that has elapsed since primary treatment, surgeon experience and subsequent postoperative and rehabilitative care. One of them is reconstruction of the flexor apparatus by primary transplantation of an autologous tendon graft. Most commonly, the tendon graft is taken from the palmaris longusfrom the same hand. The tendon graft can subsitute the entire area of zones I and II. The tendon suture is made in the palm proximal to the A1 pulley outside the tendon sheath in the area where the muscular belly of thelumbricalis is located on the tendon of the deep flexor. The distal end is reinserted to the base of the distal phalanx. The primary use of the autologous tendon graft can be used in the reconstruction of obsolete deep-flexor injuries in Zone II, but also in primary treatments. This type of treatment has a number of advantages. Performing the reinforcement of the tendon at the base of the distal phalanxand the suture in the palm of the hand completely eliminates the complications caused by the tendon suture in zone II. There is no injury to the tendon sheath, or the need for intersection of the tendons. The transplanted tendon is smaller in diameter than the deep flexor, so it can also be used for older injuries when the tendon sheath is in partially missing. It removes painful palmar resistance by restoring the right position and a tension of tendon of lumbricalis and the tendon of the deep flexor. This type of reconstruction allows immediate active or semi-rehabilitation of the hand and fingers.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-six patients with chronic dynamic SL instability of Geisler-Messina - EWAS grade IIIB, C and IV were treated by artificial synarthrosis of SL joint using an arthroscopic technique. The mean follow-up period of the patients was 32.2 months (28-39 months, when the range of motion and grip strength were assessed. The functional results were evaluated through the Mayo wrist score. RESULTS Post-operatively, a statistically significant improvement in grip strength was reported, with the mean improvement of 9 kg. On the other hand, significant worsening of flexion with a mean change of -6°, a mean change in extension of -5° and ulnar deviation -2° were identified. According to the visual analogue scale, there was a significant reduction in pain associated with everyday activity (mean change -4) as well as with heavy manual work (mean change -4). According to the Mayo wrist score, the overall results in 3 patients were excellent, in 16 patients good, in 6 patients satisfactory, and in one patient poor. DISCUSSION A limited range of motion significantly influencing the overall results of the functional assessment on the Mayo wrist score does not have a substantial subjective impact on patients and their routine activities. All the studies evaluating the operative techniques restoring stability of proximal row of the carpal bones report limited range of motion in the wrist. These interventions aim at a strong, pain-free grip with preserved wrist function. CONCLUSIONS This study illustrates that the arthroscopic stabilisation of scapholunate joint by synarthrosis is a reliable, minimally invasive surgical method to treat the higher grade of dynamic SL instability. This method makes it possible to achieve good stability of the damaged joint and leads to satisfactory functional results. Key words:wrist, instability, scapholunate joint, arthroscopy, bone graft.",

    "abstract": "The team of authors presents a case of the patient who suffered an isolated unstable extra-articular distal ulnar fracture, the surgical treatment of which was affected by a postponed management in consequence of inadequate primary treatment. The primary non-operative treatment resulted in a complex malunion ad latus, ad axim and ad peripheriam. The malunion which led to a painful restricted range of motion of the forearm (59%), decreased hand grip strength and significant limitation of activities of daily living was surgically treated by a triplane corrective osteotomy at 11 months after injury. At 12 months after surgery, a complete ulnar bone union was observed, the patient showed no residual wrist pain, the range of motion of the injured forearm reached 97 % of the range of motion of the unaffected forearm (side), and the hand grip strength was 95% of the hand grip strength in contralateral limb. The treatment outcome can be assessed as very good based on the Quick DASH score. Displaced isolated distal ulnar fractures cause a change in the axial position of the distal end of the bone and can be associated with an injury to the stabilizers of the DRUJ. Thus, they can result in a limited range of motion of the forearm due to the impaired DRUJ biomechanics and development of early post-traumatic osteoarthritis of the DRUJ. The non-operative treatment is recommended only for stable and non-displaced fractures as well as fractures in which surgical treatment is contraindicated. Corrective osteotomy of the distal ulna is the method of choice in managing distal ulna malunion as a result of isolated distal ulnar shaft fractures in symptomatic patients. Good functional outcomes may be achieved if the anatomical position of DRUJ is restored. Key words:corrective osteotomy, distal ulnar fracture.",

During the autopsy, apart from the signs of multiple surgeries, a dynamic hip screw implant with a well identifiable serial number was found. Based on this number, health care facilities were traced back in which such an implant had been used, and through studying the documentation of 117 cases, a male patient was finally identified whose other autopsy findings matched the clinical finding.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The calcaneus bone is the largest tarsal bone of a complex shape, the restoration of which after fracturing, often caused by a high-energy injury, is critical. The top priority in treating these fractures is to correctly asses the condition of the surrounding soft tissues that may be further excessively traumatized by inappropriate timing, surgical approach or technique. Even when adhering to all the rules and guidelines, complications in surgical wound healing have been described in up to 16-33% cases when the extended lateral approach was used. Therefore, the development of minimally invasive techniques, approaches and implants are a promise for improvement. One of them is the C-Nail developed by Medin. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the period from 1 January 2014 to 30 March 2017, a total of 25 patients with calcaneus bone fracture treated with C-Nail using the sinus tarsi approach were followed up at our department. Radiological assessment was made in the patients, the fractures were classified by Sanders and Essex-Lopresti classification systems, the Böhler and Gissane angles before and after reduction were measured. The occurrence of postoperative complications in soft tissue healing and complications caused by the C-Nail and the functional outcome according to the Ankle-Hindfoot Score (AOFAS) were tracked. RESULTS Only one complication in wound healing, namely in case of sinus tarsi approach, was reported in this group of patients. In 9 patients, prominence of osteosynthesis material was observed. Of whom in 4 patients a clinically significant prominence into posterior talocalcaneal articulation was present. Severely limited subtalar range of motion was seen in 5 patients, in other three patients ankylosis was observed, or arthrodesis performed. 8 patients experienced mild reduction of subtalar joint range of motion. 6 patients suffered from mild reduction of range of motion in talocrural joint. The functional outcome according to the Ankle-Hindfoot Score (AOFAS) was 89.4 on average. CONCLUSIONS Our so far limited experience with the osteosynthesis of calcaneal fractures using the C-Nail entitles us to claim that this type of osteosynthesis material allows for adequate stability and subsequent healing of a correctly reduced calcaneal fracture. It is an implant inserted by a minimally invasive surgery and the fracture reduction, when mastering the learning curve, can be efficiently performed from sinus tarsi approach. In our group of patients, the number of complications in soft tissue healing was low, which is why we believe that this type of osteosynthesis is another suitable option to treat the comminuted calcaneal fractures. The handling of the implant as such and other osteosynthesis material is safe provided all the rules covered in detail in the discussion are observed. Key words: calcaneal fracture, C-Nail, sinus tarsi approach.",

The lesions were localized in the femur, humerus and tibia in 11, five and four patients, respectively. The metaphysis was affected in eight and the diaphysis in 12 patients.Clinical, radiological and scintigraphic examinations were carried out at 2 to 12 years (7 years on average) after surgery. The clinical evaluation included subjective complaints and objective findings. Radiographs were made in standard projections and the osteo-integration of glass-ceramic material was investigated. Three-phase bone scans were made and the healthy and the affected limbs in each patient were compared by means of an index. Radionuclide uptake was considered normal when the index value was equal to 1.0, mildly increased at an index value of 1.2, moderately increased at 1.2-1.5 and markedly increased at an index value higher than 1.5.The clinical evaluation showed that, in the patients with glass-ceramic filling of metaphyses, six had no subjective complaints and two reported transient pain. In the patients with implants in diaphyses, subjective complaints were recorded in nine and no complaints in three patients. No inflammatory changes in soft tissues were found. No restriction in weightbearing of the limb treated was reported by any of the patients. On radiography, 18 patients were free from any disease residue or recurrence. Two patients had a residual defect. The bioactive glass-ceramic material BAS-0 was completely incorporated in all patients. On three-phase bone scans, radionuclide distribution on the flow phase and soft tissue phase was symmetrical in both limbs of all patients. For the metaphyseal location of implants, the delayed images demonstrated physiological radionuclide distribution in one patient, mildly increased distribution (index up to 1.2) in four, increased uptake (index up to 1.5) in two patients, and highly increased uptake (index above 1.5) in one patient. For the diaphyseal location of implants, the delayed scans demonstrated slightly increased radionuclide distribution in two, markedly increased in two and highly increased uptake in eight patients.The tissue during incorporation of a non-resorbable synthetic material is influenced by stress-shielding. This changes local mechanical signals, which has a negative effect on the adjacent bone tissue. Stress accumulating at the interface of a rigid implant and bone tissue may result in pain, and is detected by scintigraphy as an increased nucleotide uptake, particularly in diaphyseal grafts.This paper presents problems associated with implantation of the non-resorbable bioactive glass-ceramic material BAS-0 in the treatment of diaphyseal defects of long bones. The results show that, for filling of the defects described herein, non-resorbable glass-ceramic materials are not suitable.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe purpose of the study is to share the first experience of authors with the management of glenoid defects by a bone graft in reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. MATERIAL AND METHODSEvaluation of 7 patients was conducted, who underwent reverse total shoulder arthroplasty at the authors' department.Due to the presence of glenoid bone defect, augmentation was performed by bone graft, obtained either as an autograft harvested from the humeral head of the patient intraoperatively or as an allograft from the femoral head from the bone tissue bank.In all the implantations, a glenoid component with an extra-long \"revision\" peg was used.Postoperative fixation was secured only by a shoulder brace.Limited rehabilitation was commenced on the first postoperative day, full rehabilitation 5 weeks after the surgery. RESULTSThe total ASES Shoulder Score increased from the mean 39.8 preoperatively to 75.2 postoperatively.Also, the overall range of motion improved, with the preoperative ventral flexion increasing from the mean 65.5° to 135.2°, abduction increasing from 63.9° preoperatively to 127.7° postoperatively, and external rotation increasing from 27.4° preoperatively to 45.1°p ostoperatively.In the evaluated group, 2 complications were observed, namely 1 case of bone graft breakage intraoperatively, necessitating the harvesting of a new bone graft, and 1 case of postoperative paresthesia of the fourth and the fifth finger, which completely disappeared within 4 months after the surgery.In the group of followed-up patients, no loosening of endoprosthetic components has so far been reported. DISCUSSIONGlenoid defect constitutes one of the problems that need to be dealt with by the surgeon during the reverse total shoulder arthroplasty, most often it is accompanied by glenoid retroversion.The basic approach to defect management is to use the eccentric reaming technique which is, however, limited by the size of glenoid retroversion and can also worsen the already present glenoid medialization, with all the resulting consequences.Another option is to use solid bone grafts to correct glenoid version and simultaneously to lateralize the glenoid component.Yet another option is to use the prefabricated glenoid augments that are, however, not commonly available in the Czech market. CONCLUSIONSThe short-term clinical outcomes of patients, in whom glenoid defect was during the reverse total shoulder arthroplasty managed by bone grafts, are very good.Radiological signs of bone-to-graph incorporation were present in all the patients of the followed-up group.Nonetheless, for the sake of evaluation of this method, more patients shall be included in the group and a longer follow-up is needed for their evaluation.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The purpose of our study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes in patients at 3-6 years follow-up after primary implantation of RM Pressfit Vitamys cementless elastic cup and cementless Optimys short stem, including bone tissue remodelling around both the components. MATERIAL AND METHODS The evaluation covered 49 joint replacements in patients who had undergone surgery at our department between 2012 and 2015. The age at the time of primary surgery ranged from 29 to 71 years, with the mean value of 59.2 years. Postoperatively, the position of endoprosthesis, changes in femoroacetabular offset, signs of osseointegration of the implant, bone tissue remodelling around both the components and potential signs of aseptic loosening were assessed. The functional status of the joint was evaluated according to the Harris scale. RESULTS The mean follow-up time of Vitamys cup and Optimys stem was 5.6 years and 4.6 years, respectively. We focused on the combination of RM Pressfit Vitamys (49x), Optimys (28x) and Bionit 2 (41x) implants. All the cups showed good osseointegration. Based on the comparisons with a postoperative X-ray, at least mild osteoporosis in the acetabular roof was confirmed in 6 cases. All Optimys femoral components were in direct contact with the Adams arch and with the endosteal side of lateral cortex of proximal femoral metadiaphysis. Femoroacetabular offset was slightly decreased in 5 patients only. The final evaluation in 2018 did not confirm any radiolucent lines or signs osteolysis around any of the components. In 2 stems only, distal migration less than 2 mm was obvious, with subsequent good osseointegration. Signs of stress shielding were present in 2 femoral components in the form of mild cortical atrophy in the region of the Adams arch. Distal femoral cortical hypertrophy was not observed, the greater trochanter did not show the loss of bone tissue in any of the patients. There were no signs of polyethylene wear. The mean value of HHS increased from 53 to 97 points. An excellent result was achieved in 44 total hip replacements, of which 100 points in 28 cases. In the remaining 5 patients the result was good. The survival rate of both the components was 100% according to the Kaplan-Meier analysis. DISCUSSION The successful functioning of cementless total hip arthroplasty is the correct placement of both components with good primary fixation. Excessive proximal and lateral shift of the centre of rotation results in increased load of endoprosthesis and risk of earlier aseptic loosening, its reduction leads to the weakening of pelvitrochanteric muscles. The shift of the centre of rotation from the original anatomical position should therefore not exceed 5 millimetres. Insufficient cup fixation always results in mechanical failure of an endoprosthesis. Distal migration of stems without contact with external femoral cortex with full weight-bearing of the operated lower extremity in the postoperative period does not constitute a sign of instability, but only its placement enables good osseointegration. Bone remodelling can be assessed by imaging techniques at 2 years after the primary implantation at the earliest. At places with lower load, the bone loss occurs and the loss of bone trabeculae can lead to the failure of fixation of the component. At places with load accumulation, the bone hypertrophy occurs that can be manifested by thigh pain. In case of cementless press-fit cup, the degree of bone remodelling depends on its elasticity, in case of stem on the used material, shape and fixation site. CONCLUSIONS The RM Pressfit Vitamys monobloc cup through its mechanical properties approximates the best the elasticity of bone tissue. The stress distribution around the implant is more symmetrical as against other conventional cementless cups. The Optimys stem enables the reconstruction of anatomical conditions corresponding a healthy hip joint. Respecting the rule of at least three-point fixation is a precondition for good and fast secondary stability of components. Minimising the wear of articulating surfaces and physiological remodelling of adjacent bone tissue are the main factors that help prolong the survivorship of both the components, while also securing more favourable conditions and better outcomes in case of necessity of reimplantation. Key words: cementless elastic cup, short cementless stem, femoroacetabular offset, stress shielding, osseointegration of the implant.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY In this study it is aimed to prospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of 20 mg/2 ml Hyaluronic Acid (HA) injections for non-operative palliation treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee joint. MATERIAL AND METHODS After institutional review board approval was obtained for the study, 63 patients were enrolled and followed prospectively. All the patients have signed informed consent form. Patients who had diagnosis of gonarthrosis according to clinical and radiological evaluation, were given nonsteroid antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment for four weeks. Patients between 55-80 years old in both sexes, whose pain did not relieve were included to the study and were followed up for 6 months. They were applied HA injections in total; three times with one week of interval. Patients were evaluated three times during the study. First one at third week (at the control visit of third injection), secondly at third month and lastly at sixth month. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) and Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) scores were used to clinically evaluate the patients at follow ups. RESULTS 56 (88.9%) patients completed the study and 7 (11.1%) patients did not show up for follow-up examinations and they were excluded. The mean age of the patients was 63.6 ± 6.90 (range 47 and 76) years old. 22 (39.2%) of the patients were male and 34 (60.7%) were female. Any adverse events and adverse effects were not seen in the enrolled patients group. CONCLUSIONS Results of this study revealed that the use of 20 mg/2 ml HA injection was effective in improving the WOMAC index score in patients of knee OA. Additionally, patients' quality of life as measured by SF-36 questionnaire was also significantly improved at the end of the study. None of the patient reported any of the adverse events during the study. Overall, the 20 mg/2 ml HA injection can be considered as a good treatment option for the knee OA in patients who do not respond to non-pharmacological therapy, NSAIDs or analgesics.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYFractures of the scapula are less frequent, with the incidence reported in literature of approximately 1% of all fractures and 3-5% fractures of shoulder.These fractures are predominantly treated non-operatively.Osteosynthesis is indicated in displaced intra-articular fractures and severely displaced extra-articular fractures of the scapular body, its lateral border in particular.Apart from open reposition and osteosynthesis, also minimally invasive osteosynthesis under fluoroscopic and arthroscopic control has recently been used to treat intra-articular fractures of the scapula.The arthroscopy facilitates debridement of the fracture line in the intra-articular region and control over the insertion of the osteosynthesis material in the subchondral bone of the glenoid and it also makes visible the accuracy of reduction of fractures of the glenoid articular surface. MATERIAL AND METHODSIn 2013-2017, osteosyntheses of 9 intra-articular fractures of the scapula were performed with the use of both perioperative fluoroscopy and arthroscopy.The group included 7 men and 2 women, with the mean age of 37 years (range 24-52 years).4.5 mm cannulated screws inserted in the subchondral bone either from the cranial or dorso-caudal part of the glenoid in dependence on the type of the fracture were used as osteosynthesis material.Postoperatively, the extremity was fixed by Desault type shoulder brace for 4 weeks.Rehabilitation using standard procedures for shoulder joint followed.The patients were followed up at regular intervals, namely on 10th day, at 4 weeks, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively.The clinical outcomes and radiologic signs of healing were evaluated continuously and two years after the surgery the clinical outcomes were assessed using the Constant score.Arm elevation was assessed separately, as a dominant indicator of shoulder joint function. RESULTSNo perioperative complications were reported, the operative times ranged from 45 to 120 minutes.Reduction was always performed in fractures with intra-articular displacement of less than 2 mm, which was measured both arthroscopically and on perioperative and postoperative radiographs.No complications of wound healing were observed.One patient experienced temporary paresthesia in the innervation zone of the sensitive branch of the radial nerve.The mean healing time of fractures was 121 days (range 107-146 days).The mean Constant score at two years after surgery was 83 points (range 78-87 points), the resulting restriction of elevation was 12° on average (range 0-23°). DISCUSSIONThere are not many papers covering a similar topic in world literature, most of them present the benefits of arthroscopy in some types of osteosyntheses of intra-articular fractures of the scapula.Most frequently mentioned are osteosyntheses of the anterior portion of the glenoid in case of a bony Bankart lesion.These papers highlight the benefits of minimal invasiveness of this procedure. CONCLUSIONSBy visualising the fracture line, the arthroscopy facilitates a more accurate reduction of fragments and a minimally invasive osteosynthesis of some intra-articular fractures of the scapula when compared to closed reduction with fluoroscopic intraoperative control only.The use of arthroscopy in these interventions is conditional on perfect mastering of the surgical technique and also the use of special instruments both for arthroscopy and minimally invasive osteosynthesis.If these criteria are observed and the surgical technique mastered, the authors consider this method beneficial in treating the glenoid fractures.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The study evaluated the possibilities of the application of the surgical method of fusion and the mutual comparison of its individual types in the treatment of planovalgus deformity in the foot in spastic patients affected by infantile cerebral palsy. Escalated spasm of eversion muscles of the foot with a simultaneous weakening of tibial muscles resulted in their case in relatively very severe deformities of feet and their poor function. The decision on the type of the chosen arthrodesis (extraarticular talocalcanear or triple subtalar) is based on the bone maturity of the patient and the degree of the possible correction of the deformity. On their own group of patients the authors present their experience in the application of the two types of arthrodesis and point out the necessity of an early treatment of the deformity by a less extensive and more considerate type of extraarticular arthrodesis, in their case with the use of a tricortical pelvic bone graft after Grice-Thomas. MATERIAL At the Orthopaedic Department of the Faculty Hospital Brno-Bohunice we treated in the period of 1992-1999 by arthrodesis 31 patients (49 feet) with the basic diagnosis of the spastic form of infantile cerebral palsy.The group comprises 27 girls and 22 boys. Forty-one feet (84 %) was operated on by the method of extrarticular talocalcanear arthrodesis after Grice with the use of a tricortical pelvic bone graft modification afterThomas.The average age of the patients in this group was at the time of operation 10 years and 8 months. The method of a triple subtalar fusion was used for the operation of 8 feet (16 %) in patients of the average age of 19 years and 9 months at the time of the operation. The combined method with the simultaneous lengthening of the shortened Achilles tendon was used in 21 feet. In 18 feet the lengthening of the Achilles tendon as a separate operation was performed prior to the arthrodesis. Ten Achilles tendons did not require such lengthening. A simultaneous combination of the transposition of the tibialis angerior muscle tendon (the Young technique) with extraarticular arthrodesis was used in 19 feet. Surgical results were evaluated on the basis of x-ray measurable angles, the talocalcanear angle in particular, measured on the lateral radiograph. Of great importance is the monitoring of the change of the movement stereotype and clinical examination with the possibility of photo and video documentation. RESULTS The average follow-up of our group of patients is 4 years and 5 months after operation. The minimum follow-up is 12 months after the operation. Regular clinical and x-ray examinations inform about clinical condition of the deformity (derotation of the heel, condition of the longitudinal arch), walking stereotype and evaluation of the position of the bone graft. The results may be divided into 3 categories. The category of excellent results comprises 25 (61 %) operated on feet from the group of extraarticular arthrodesis and 3 feet (37 %) from the group of triple arthrodesis. The category of satisfactory results included 13 (32 %) operated on feet from the first group and 4 feet (50 %) from the second group and 3 operated on feet (7 %) from the first group and 1 foot (13 %) from the second group fell into the category of unsatisfactory results. The talocalcanear angle had a mean preoperative value of 43,5 degrees (28-54) and its postoperative average value was 27 degrees (20-37). The average correction is 16,5 degrees . DISCUSSION In the discussion the authors compared the Thomas technique of harvesting tricortical bone grafts from the iliac crest with harvesting bone grafts from other locations (tibia, fibula, rib, etc.) The main reasons why the authors prefer this type of bone graft is mainly the solidity of the pelvic bone graft, the possibility to avoid its internal fixation, a quality ingrowth of the bone graft and excellent healing of the harvesting location. They compare their experience with the works of Banwart, Bar ras, Dennyson, Lancaster, McCall. Partio, Pirani and Smetana. CONCLUSIONS Both types of fusion have significantly contributed to the solution of planovalgus deformity of the foot in spastic patients. An early extraarticular arthrodesis brings high quality results of the functional condition of the foot. This method can prevent the necessary treatment of a rigid painful planovalgus deformity of the foot in the adult age requiring an extensive operation with the resection of subtalar joints. Both types of arthrodesis increase the stability of planovalgus feet and improve the walking stereotype in general.planovalgosity of the foot, cerebral palsy, arthrodesis.",

    "abstract": "The authors describe their experience of valgus osteotomy of the first metatarsal in hallux valgus - metatarsus primus varus (HV-MTPV). It is based on the Stamm technique consisting in the resection of one third of the base of the proximal phalanx of the great toe. From the resected part they make a wedge-shaped bone graft. Subsequently, they extend the section and perform a two-third transversal osteotomy of the first metatarsal (MT) 1 cm distal to the cuneometatarsal joint. The rest of the bone is broken into valgus position by pressure. Afterwards, the bone graft is inserted in the open osteotomy line from the medial side. Valgus position is fixed a wire loop. In contrast to the Stamm procedure the authors perform no additional operations on the tendon apparatus. They put emphasis on a stable fixation and an early rehabilitation of the metatarsal joint. Since 1991 they have performed in total 69 valgus osteotomies on 51 patients. In eight cases only osteotomy was performed without the resection of the base, the bone graft was made from the resected bone prominence of the head of the first metatarsal and the adductor of the great toe was released. In case of metatarsalgia this procedure is combined with Helal or Wolf osteotomy. The operation has proved successful in the most severe defects with hallux valgus angle (HVA) exceeding 40 degrees , intermetatarsal angle (IMA) above 16 degrees and incongruency of the MTP joint. Lateralisation of sesame bones is spontaneously corrected after the surgery. Six months after operation 90 % of patients were satisfied with the result. In four patients the surgery did not bring the expected effect. The first after valgus revision of the great toe and varus revision of the metatarsal. In his case osteotomy was combined with Silver operation without resection of the base. Insufficient release of the adductor of the great toe resulted in the recurrence of the defect. In the second patient there occurred necrosis of the head and in the third patient the MTP joint got rigid as a result of the inadequate resection of the base of the phalanx of the great toe. The fourth patient was lost to follow-up. The surgical lengthening of the first metatarsal is 1 mm. The authors evaluated its relative length together with HVA and IMA angles and compared the group of patients with healthy population. They came to the conclusion that a longer first metatarsal potentiates the development of the defect. A detailed statistic analysis of these measurements will be presented in the next publication.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Revision surgery for the loosening of total hip arthroplasty with the use of cemented implants does not guarantee good long-term results. The current trend prefers the use of cementless implants, particularly of the press-fit type. In our group of patients with aseptic loosening of the acetabular cup with a preserved acetabular bone stock without segmental defects we used for the revision surgery a Spotorno CLS cementless cup. MATERIAL The group comprised 33 patients, 29 women and 4 men, of the average age of 66 years, with the loosened acetabular component, of which 31 had originally a cemented Poldi cup and 2 a cementless threaded Walter-Motorlet cup. Cup revision only was performed in 25 cases, both components (cup and stem) were replaced in 8 cases. METHODS We used a standard cementless Spotorno CLS cup. In case of a preserved circular bone stock of acetabular rim the cup was implanted in the standard position. Cavity defects were filled by cancellous bone grafts. In case of poor anatomical bone stock the cup was implanted deeper in acetabular cavity usually in a more varus position and rarely in valgus position depending on the localisation of segmental defect. RESULTS The average follow-up was 38 months (range, 16-63 months). In one case there occurred aseptic loosening after 12 months and the second revision surgery was necessary in order to replace the implant by the same type of a greater size. In one case after 6 months there developed a hematogeneous infection and the implant was replanted by a two-stage procedure. In the remaining cases osteointegration took place in the course of 12 months after the operation. In 7 cases the cups were implanted in a slightly varus/valgus position necessitated by the acetabular bone stock, without any impact on the osteointegration or function. DISCUSSION The disadvantage of cemented implants in the revision surgery consists in the limited possibility of the integration of cemented mantle and the destructed bone interface. The advantages of cementless implant in the revision surgery of a loosened cup is confirmed by a number of authors but they relate mainly to press-fit cups. The data on the use of Spotorno CLS expansion cup in the revision surgery are rare. Our group with a short follow-up demonstrates that the integration and the function of the CLS cup as a revision implant seems to be reliable. The main prerequisite, however, is a good acetabular bone stock without greater segmental defects. Cavity defects may be filled in by autologous or homologous cancellous bone grafts. The CLS cup may be fixed, if necessary, in a slightly non-anatomical position without any impairment of the function. It includes mainly the cases of the ovoid shape of acetabulum when the cup is implanted in the acetabula roof in greater varus slope than recommended by the author of implant. CONCLUSIONS The Spotorno CLS cementless expansion cup as a revision implant in the right indication brings good short term results on condition of a good primary stability of the implant and a spherical acetabulum without great segmental defects.THA, revision surgery, cementless CLS cup.",

The drawback of this procedure are frequent non-unions of the acromion due to the poor stability of the osteosynthesis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Three osteosynthese methods were tested at random in 18 cadaver scapulae using a Zwick-Universal material testing device (1). Osteosynthesis with 4 screws and a plate according to Grammont (2). Osteosynthesis using special designed Y-plate according to Rozing (3). Osteosynthesis with a tension-wire-band construct using 2 mm threaded wires. The load was applied above the M. deltoideus, parallel to the osteotomy in the sagittal plane and in 90 degress to the acromion in the frontal plane. All constructs were tested until failure occurred. The maximum postoperative stability values (N) and the average apparent stiffness values (N/mm) were calculated. RESULTS The average maximum stability value for Grammont osteosynthesis was 270.1 +/- 17.3 (243.3-294.0) N, for Rozing osteosynthesis 404.7 +/- 49.1 (312.9-445.4) N and for tension-wire-band osteosynthesis 491.9 +/- 60.1 (419.6-558.8) N. The differences were statistically significant (p < 0.01). The highest stiffness values were achieved for tension-wire-band osteosynthesis (13.27 +/- 0.80 N/mm; 12.03-14.35) in comparison with Rozing osteosynthesis (12.86 +/-0.68 N/mm; 11.88-13.67) and Grammont osteosynthesis (10.64 +/- 0.25 N/mm; 9.72-10.44). CONCLUSION Experimentally, the tension-wire-band technique and the Y-plate according to Rozing provided a higher stability and stiffness for lateral acromion osteosynthesis than the Grammont method.shoulder, acromion, Delta prosthesis, osteosynthesis, biomechanical.",

Also, we strived to present our experience and outcomes of posterior dislocation treatment by McLaughlin procedure and its modified version. MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively evaluated 7 patients who had been treated at our department in the period 2015-2019 by McLaughlin procedure or its modification. The group consisted of 5 men and 2 women aged 33-79 years. In five patients, the dislocation occurred during an epileptic seizure, in two patients during an accident. The patients were treated by McLaughlin procedure or the Neer modification of McLaughlin procedure. The deltoideopectoral surgical approach was always used. Based on the preoperative planning, we decided, or intraoperatively changed our decision, as to whether mere transposition of the subscapularis is satisfactory or whether transposition of the lesser tuberosity to the defect, a bone graft and arthroplasty are necessary. Postoperatively, the operated limb was fixed for 6 weeks in neutral position, which was followed by rehabilitation. RESULTS We evaluated subjective and objective outcomes of the surgery, the radiological finding and in 2 patients also a control CT scan. The function of the shoulder was assessed using the Constant shoulder score and the OSIS scoring system. The resulting score: the mean OSIS was 55.7 points (92.8%) and the mean Constant score was 86.2 points (86.2%), which we regard as a very good result. All patients consider the surgery successful and are satisfied with the outcome. No patient reported recurrent dislocation. DISCUSSION When treating the posterior dislocation of the shoulder, vital is the shoulder reducibility and also the presence or the size of reverse Hill-Sachs defect. The transfer of the subscapularis tendon can be performed as an open procedure or arthroscopically. Inveterate irreducible posterior dislocation of the shoulder is quite a rare diagnosis, which is why even at our department the McLauglin procedure is performed in the order of units per year only. CONCLUSIONS The surgical solution of inveterate posterior dislocation of the shoulder is hardly ever uncomplicated. The reduction alone is often insufficient and some other way of shoulder stabilisation is necessary, often times addressing the humeral head defect. In our to date experience, the McLaughlin procedure or the Neer s modification is an elegant and safe method to treat posterior dislocation with a humeral head defect. The functional outcomes are very good and enable the patients to reengage in everyday activities. Thanks to this procedure shoulder joint arthroplasty can be avoided in younger patients. Nonetheless, in defects that are greater than 50% of the head the replacement is necessary. Due to frequently associated rotator cuff injuries, the most often procedure indicated by us is the reverse total shoulder replacement.

Ischemia occurs in 3.7-5% of dialysis patients, in dependence on the type of vascular access. The main cause behind the risk of digital upper limb ischemia in dialysis patients is the presence of an arteriovenous fistula. The higher the location of arteriovenous fistula, the higher the risk of onset of ischemia. In case of brachiocephalic and brachiobasilic fistulas, the risk for developing symptomatic ischemia is faced by 10-25% of patients, in case of radiocephalic fistula only by 1-1.8% of patients. In making the diagnosis we rely on the history of symptoms and physical examinations of both upper limbs. The patient may describe subjective symptoms as pain, having cold fingers, cramps during and outside dialysis, altered sensation and impaired finger movement. The therapy includes radiological intervention, removal of high-flow arteriovenous fistula, its closure, and amputation. The treatment aims to provide the patients with maximum possible multidisciplinary care and to prevent amputation. In this respect the orthopaedic examination is critical for further diagnosis and therapy of the patient at risk of upper limb impairment or for upper limb salvage.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the subjective evaluation of treatment by patients with respect to their return to work and recreational sport following the fracture of clavicle diaphysis with posttraumatic shortening of 1.5 cm, or more, treated non-operatively and surgically. MATERIAL AND METHODS Our group of patients consisted of 51 patients (14 females, 37 males) aged between 18 and 89 years (average age 46 years). We concentrated on the parameters of sex, age, side of injury, extent of posttraumatic shortening, method of treatment, return to work or recreational sport, DASH score at one year post non-operative or surgical treatment. Patients who sustained a pathological fracture, fractures of the clavicle combined with an injury of the acromioclavicular joint or simultaneous fracture of the humerus or the ribs were excluded from the study. Patients with open fractures or re-fractures were excluded as well. The indication for treatment selection was based on pre-operative discussion of the doctor with the patient and the Informed Consent was signed. The patient was informed about different treatment options. A shorter period of fixation of the arm and post-operative physiotherapy was mentioned in connection with surgical treatment as well as potential surgical complications. A statistical analysis comparing the data in both groups was conducted using the Fisher exact test. The p-value of 0.05 or less was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS The right side was affected 26 times, the left side 25 times. The shortening ranged from 1.5 to 3.7 cm. 24 patients (8 females, 16 males) aged 21 to 89 years (average 54 years) were treated non-operatively. 27 patients (6 females, 21 males) aged 18 to 74 years (average 38 years) underwent surgery. The difference in sex distribution in both groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.5311). According to the Robinson classification, there were 17 patients with type 2A2 fractures, of whom 8 underwent surgery and 9 were treated non-operatively, 19 patients with type 2B1 fractures, of whom 9 underwent surgery and 10 were treated non-operatively, and 15 patients with type 2B2, of whom 10 underwent surgery and 5 were treated non-operatively. The surgically treated patients prevailed in type 2B2 only, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.2350). In the non-operatively treated group, 23 out of 24 patients returned to pre-injury activities in 3 months on average. Ten patients (48%) reported reaching the same function as on the other side. In the DASH score evaluation, 11 patients reached the value of 0-3.3, five patients 3.4-10, six patients 10.1-30.0 and two reached the score of more than 30. In the evaluation of capacity to work, 15 out of 24 patients were able to work, 11 of them without any restrictions or difficulties. In the evaluation of the sport and playing musical instrument module, 9 out of 24 patients did not engage in sports activities or do not play any musical instruments. In the surgically treated group, 26 out of 27 patients returned to pre-injury activities within 6 weeks. 19 (70%) patients reported reaching the same function as on the other side. In the DASH score evaluation, 19 patients reached the value of 0-3.3, two patients 3.4-10, 5 patients 10.1-30.0 and one patient with nonunion 72.5. Comparison of the average values of the DASH score demonstrated slightly better results achieved by surgical treatment (9.03 vs 6.77). When assessing the work module, 24 out of 27 patients returned to work, 20 of them without any restrictions or difficulties. Out of 27 patients, 4 patients were no longer able to engage in sports activities or to play a musical instrument. Of the 23 remaining patients, 18 did not have any problems, 5 suffered from minimal problems. The group of patients treated non-operatively included one case of non-union and the same applies to the surgically treated group. In 3 patients the removal of hardware was performed, 3 patients underwent revision of the surgical wound because of infection. DISCUSSION The recommendation of the weight-bearing of the upper extremity was similar in both groups, 12 weeks post injury/surgery on average. It is clear that sooner return to work or sports activities in the surgically treated group was preferred by younger patients who expected quicker recovery. Younger patients were less patient and more eager to return to work and sports, while the older patients, on the other hand, were more cautious about possible complications of surgery. CONCLUSIONS The results of our study did not identify any correlation between the clavicle shortening and the indication for surgical treatment. Surgical treatment was preferred by younger patients, more frequently by males. The rationale was supported by the perspective of sooner return to work and favourite sports activities. Their decision was not affected by the known risks of surgical treatment. Evaluation of the DASH score at one year after injury/surgery showed similar results. A higher incidence of complications in the surgically treated group did not lead to negative evaluation of the selected treatment modality by the highly motivated group of patients either.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 86 patients referred for TKA were included in this study. Sleep duration, sedentary behavior (SB), light physical activity (LPA), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were assessed using multi-day 24-hour raw data from wrist-worn accelerometers. Compositional data analysis was used to analyze the differences between the age categories. RESULTS On average (SD), the adults were 59.0 (± 4.9) years; 63% female. The older adults were 72.4 (± 5.5) years; 58% female. The adults reached 23.9 milli-gravitational units (mg) as a mean acceleration over the whole day; 34% (8.1 h/day) of the time was classified as sleep, 48.9% (11.7 h/day) as SB, 12.1% (2.9 h/day) as LPA, and 5.1% (72.9 min/day) as MVPA. The older adults reached 21.3 mg; 35.2% (8.4 h/day) of the time was classified as sleep, 50.4% (12.1 h/day) as SB, 11.3% (2.7 h/day) as LPA, and 3.1% (44.9 min/day) as MVPA. Compared with the older adults, the proportion of time spent in total MVPA (P = 0.008) and MVPA bouts of ≥1 min were greater (P ≤ 0.028) in the adult group, while the proportion of time spent in total SB was lower (P = 0.045). No age difference was found for the proportion of time spent asleep. DISCUSSION Sleep, SB, and PA are exclusive and exhaustive parts of the overall 24-h day. Using accelerometer-based measures of 24-hour movement behavior to describe these behaviors more accurately is crucial for a better understanding of patients with end-stage KOA. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that the adults and older adults referred for TKA are physically active despite suffering from severe knee osteoarthritis. Such a high level of physical activity may be difficult to increase by TKA postoperatively. If replicated by other studies, 24-hour movement behaviors should be implemented among the examinations required before TKA.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Axial deformities of the lower limbs of various aetiologies are relatively common orthopaedic diagnoses in paediatric population. Fixed deformity is an indication for correction in order to reduce the pain and to delay the early osteoarthrosis of adjacent joints and pain. Temporary hemiepiphysiodesis is technically a fairly simple method for modulating growth at the level of the growth plate and thus correcting the skeletal axis. MATERIAL AND METHODS 59 patients who underwent axial deformity correction of lower limbs at KDCHOT FN Brno were retrospectively analysed. Group 1 consisted of 21 patients with Blount staples implantation, Group 2 consisted of 38 patients to whom eight-figure plates had been applied. Anthropometric parameters (BMI, age, gender, intermalleolar distance (IMD)), duration of therapy, X-ray parameters (anatomical lateral distal femoral angle (aLDFA), anatomical medial proximal tibial angle (aMPTA)) and complications were recorded. The rate of correction was evaluated as the difference in X-ray parameters before and after surgery with respect to the time interval of the therapy. RESULTS The groups were comparable in terms of anthropometric parameters (BMI (p=0.800), IMD (p=0.334), gender (p=0.87)). The only statistically significant difference was found when comparing the mean age of the groups (p=0.005), with Group 1 (12.7±0.7) containing patients with a higher mean age than Group 2 (11.6±1.5). The groups were also comparable in terms of the average rate of correction over a one-month interval (aLDFA p=0.393; aMPTA p=0.831). The mean correction rate for Group 1 was: aLDFA 0.52±0.20/month, aMPTA 0.12±0.08/month; for Group 2: aLDFA 0.56±0.28/month, aMPTA 0.12±0.20/month. Individual implants differed in the type of complications, but no significant statistical difference in the incidence of complications was found between the analysed groups (p=0.526). DISCUSSION Recently, the system of eight-figure plates has been adopted as a standard method for correction of axial deformities of limbs. Although the benefits of this system are indisputable, when comparing the average monthly correction rate, no significant difference was found between the system of eight-figure plates and Blount staples in our study. Another monitored parameter was the occurrence of complications, which was evaluated fairly strictly. Even in this case, no statistically significant difference was found. We believe that the issue of using eight-figure plates is still open, as evidenced by studies, which often produce different results and conclusions. Therefore, a precise evaluation of the indication for correction, including individual characteristics of patients, is needed. CONCLUSIONS Based on the results, it can be concluded that the use of eight-figure plates in comparison with Blount staples provides neither faster correction of axial deformities nor lesser occurrence of complications. It can therefore be argued that the Blount staples still have their place in the indication of correction of axial deformities. The use of eight-figure plates represents a suitable solution for children of younger age to whom anchoring of the screws of eight-figure plates is a suitable solution in the cartilaginous epiphysis of long bones of younger children. Key words: temporary hemiepiphysiodesis, growth plate, Blount staples, eight-figure plates.",

    "abstract": "Osteoid osteoma is a primary benign bone tumor with rare intra-articular occurrence. Our case report describes a rare case of a 21-year-old man with long-term severe pain in the right hip region caused by osteoid osteoma managed by arthroscopic excision. The clinical finding of pains and a limited range of motion did not correlate with the normal plain X-ray finding. The osteoid osteoma was suspected based on the CT scan. In literature, several methods of resection of intraarticular osteoid osteoma of the hip are described. Since our department has long specialised in arthroscopic hip surgery and based on the available examinations the tumor appeared to be located within the arthroscopic reach, we decided for arthroscopic resection of the tumor. Our study comprises a detailed description of the entire surgical procedure, the used arthroscopic approaches and the arthroscopic technique of tumor excision. The histological examination of samples taken from the mass confirmed the suspected osteoid osteoma. The success of arthroscopic excision of the tumor was later confirmed also by very positive postoperative recovery when the patient very soon experienced a considerable reduction of pain observed during our five-year follow-up of the patient (Day 13, Week 2 and 6, Year 1, 2 and 5). During the follow-up period, an increase of the Harris Hip Score (13.5 preoperatively vs 76.6/91/94/96/96 postoperatively) and a decrease in VAS (9 preoperatively vs. 3/1/1/1/1) were reported. The follow-up CT and MRI performed at 2 or 5 years after surgery did not show tumor recurrence. The case report includes also illustrations consisting of X-rays, CT and MRI scans before and after surgery as well as multiple scans taken intraoperatively. It has to be emphasized that this is a rare case and an evaluation of a larger group of patients would be necessary to verify the successful outcomes of arthroscopic technique in treatment of the hip joint osteoid osteoma.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The hip fracture is the leading cause of disability and deaths in elderly. If left untreated, the hip fracture results in inability to walk, and therefore the patient is dependent on the other's people help. The aim of this study was to determine the predictive values of the functional status, present comorbidities, and the types of treatment on the long-term functional status and mortality in patients with the hip fracture. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analyzed the data about the patients with the hip fractures treated in the period between 01.07.2006. and 01.07.2016., with the mean follow-up period between 34.3±4.9 months. The data included radiographs, age, comorbidities, functional status on admission, functional status on discharge, and follow-ups. RESULTS Female sex, increasing age, and poorer functional status upon admission, conservative treatment, trochanteric fracture, the presence of neurological or lung disease, diabetes, were all significant risk factors leading to poorer functional outcomes on the latest follow-up (p < 0.05). On the other hand, the patients who were mobile upon admission had a longer survival (38.1±3.51 months) as compared with the other patients (12.3±5.1 months; χ2=25.202, p = 0.001). Besides, the results of this study revealed that the direct, statistically significant relationship exists between the untreated internal and neurological diseases, and increased mortality and poorer functional outcomes on the latest follow-up. CONCLUSIONS These results are useful for the orthopedic and trauma surgeons, who are treating these patients, the physical medicine and rehabilitation specialists, who are performing the rehabilitation of these patients, but also the health policy makers, who may promote the programmes of healthy aging (treating the diseases, maintaining fitness, etc.) Key words: hip fracture; comorbidity; mortality; functional status.",

We present five cases of musculoskeletal tumors in pregnant women, three with metastasizing malignant neoplasms and two with aggressive giant cell tumors. The three patients diagnosed during their gestational period were operated before the end of pregnancy, adapting surgical techniques to minimize risk to mother and fetus. Adjuvant therapies were postponed until the end of gestation. All newborns were delivered at term vaginally, except for one where a cesarean section was required. After a mean follow-up of 69.96 months (±56.38), all patients were free of disease, except for the one diagnosed with an extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma who died at 4 years from diagnosis.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY As in orthopedic trauma patients, a hyperinflammatory response due to cytokine release occurs in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 infection. In these patients, untimely surgical intervention can create more destructive situations in the postoperative period. Our aim in this study was to investigate the effect of COVID-19, trauma and surgical intervention on acute phase reactants' levels in patients with and without COVID-19 infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-four patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection and major fractures requiring surgical treatment were evaluated retrospectively (Group 1). Twenty-four COVID-19 negative patients with similar trauma were included in the study as a control group (Group 2). These two groups were compared in terms of demographic data, time to surgery, total hospitalization time, and preoperative and postoperative acute phase reactants' [C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, ferritin, fibrinogen and white blood cell (WBC)] values. RESULTS Time to surgery was 8.3 ± 0.7 days and the total hospital stay was 15.2 ± 0.8 days, in Group 1. These values were determined as 3.3 ± 0.4 and 6.5 ± 0.6 days, respectively for the patients in Group 2 (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). When the acute phase reactant values studied during admission were examined, a significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of CRP, D-dimer, ferritin and WBC (p = 0009, p = 0.002, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). In the preoperative period, a significant difference was observed between the groups in terms of CRP and ferritin (p = 0.011, p < 0.001, respectively). A significant difference was found only in terms of ferritin from the laboratory values studied in the postoperative period (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION To our knowledge, the present study is the first study which compares and investigates the effects of COVID-19 infection, major fracture and surgical intervention on acute phase reactants' values. Surgical treatment is generally recommended as soon as possible in daily orthopedic practice. However, in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19 infection, it remains unclear how long surgical intervention will be delayed after admission and clinical stabilization of patients with a fracture that requires surgical fixation. In a meta-analysis, patients with COVID-19 infection accompanying hip fracture had a mortality rate of 32.6% in the early postoperative period, and the mortality risk of these patients was found to be 5.66 times higher compared to patients without COVID-19 infection. In our study, one patient (4.2%) with COVID-19 infection who underwent partial hip arthroplasty due to femoral neck fracture. CONCLUSIONS The follow-up and treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection with accompanying a major fracture requiring orthopedic surgery is a complex situation. We recommend that acute phase reactants such as CRP, D-dimer, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and ferritin should be closely monitored in these patients during the period from admission to surgery, and surgical intervention should be performed while these values are in remission or decline.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocation and its surgical treatment still raises a number of questions that remain to be answered. In some types of dislocations, Rockwood type III in particular, the indication for surgical treatment as such is relative. There are numerous techniques and implants available for the reconstruction of AC joint. In our research we focused on the necessity of coracoclavicular (CC) joint reconstruction. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this paper, a cohort of 56 patients with Rockwood type III AC joint injury who underwent surgical treatment at our department in 2010-2016 period was retrospectively evaluated. The patients were treated with open reduction with AC joint stabilisation using hook plate or tension band. The patients were divided into 2 groups, namely group 1 with CC ligament reconstruction and group 2 without CC ligament reconstruction. The assessment was done at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after surgery. The clinical outcomes were assessed based on the absolute Constant score (CS) and coracoclavicular distance (CCD) on the X-ray. Subsequently, the outcomes were statistically processed and compared using the Student s ttest. RESULTS The least invasive surgical intervention, as to the length of incision, was the reconstruction using the hook plate without CC ligament suture, whereas the longest incision was performed in tension band with CC ligament suture. In the CC ligament suture group, the mean operative time was 10 minutes longer. When evaluating the CS of the compared groups with and without CC ligament reconstruction, no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) was found between the two groups. Similarly, the CCD values at 2-year follow-up did not show any statistically significant difference between the two groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The available outcomes suggest that the surgical methods used by us are adequately safe and reliable. Good clinical outcomes can be achieved by open reduction and fixation of Rockwood type III AC joint dislocation even without CC ligament reconstruction.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYIn clinical practice UHMWPE is the most commonly used material for manufacturing articular components of joint replacements.The purpose of this study is to find out whether repeated ethylene oxide sterilization results in oxidative degradation of UHMWPE or not and also whether the oxidative degradation of various types of ethylene oxide-sterilized UHMWPE depends on storage time or not. MATERIAL AND METHODSThe set included 12 samples of UHMWPE (three samples with different modifications (virgin PE, with E vitamin and cross-linked with thermal treatment) and different number of sterilizations (0×-3×)).The set also included 8 samples of commercial components of hip or knee replacements sterilized with ethylene oxide and stored for different storage periods.The oxidative degradation was assessed by infrared microspectroscopy, based on which the oxidation index (OI), transvinylene index (VI), crystallinity index (CI) and E vitamin index (EI) were calculated.Mechanical properties of UHMWPE were obtained through microhardness measurements.Statistical processing of the results was performed. RESULTSIn all the samples, very low oxidative degradation values were reported (most OI values < 0.1).All radiation crosslinked UHMWPE samples showed an increased VI index and a slightly lower crystallinity index.All unmodified samples (irrespective of whether or not and how many times or how long ago the samples were sterilized with EtO) had almost zero value of VI.Changes in crystallinity were negligible (in the rage of 0.56-0.63),which required very accurate measurements of micromechanical properties.Yet, linear correlation was established between microhardness and crystallinity. DISCUSSIONAll the mentioned indices changed as anticipated: OIs were very low and slightly increased with time of storage, VIs of radiation crosslinked samples grew in proportion to the total gama radiation dose, CIs decreased in samples thermally treated by remelting, and EIs were very low due to negligible concentration of stabiliser (0.1%) in the samples of medical grade UHMWPE. CONCLUSIONSAll samples showed zero or minimum oxidative degradation.This confirmed that neither ethylene oxide sterilization, nor multiple EtO sterilization or longer storage of polymer after ethylene oxide sterilization result in major oxidative degradation.",

The aim of this retrospective cohort study is to evaluate the results of patients who underwent revision surgery with compressive intramedullary nailing implemented a single type of surgical technique in aseptic humeral nonunions without bone defects. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data of 15 patients with humerus nonunion, all were treated with compressive intramedullary nailing between 2000 and 2019 were retrospectively evaluated. Three patients were hypertrophic and 12 were atrophic types. The mean ages of patients at the surgery was 47.3±18 years. In all cases, maximal bone contact was created between the proximal and distal bone fragments after reaming and debridement, and fixation was performed with compressive intramedullary nailing. Radiological assessment of union was performed based on the RUSHU criteria, and functional outcomes were assessed according to Constant-Murley scoring criteria. RESULTS The ten out of 15 patients were male. The radiological union was achieved at a mean duration of 16.6±2.3 weeks in 14 patients. The average time of follow-up after nonunion treatment was 25.2±8.8 months. Twelve out of 15 patients implemented bone grafting taken form iliac bone with spongiosa obtained via reaming. The functional results were made according to the Constant-Murley score and excellent functional results were obtained in nine patients, good in four patients and poor functional results in one patient. Implant failure was not observed. One patient has had post-operative transient ulnar nerve palsy and another patient developed transient radial nerve palsy.

MATERIAL AND METHODSA total of 12 patients (7 women, 5 men), with the mean age of 54.3 years, underwent surgical treatment at our department in 1998-2018.Sacral chordoma proximally achieved S1 level in three cases, S2 level in four cases and S3 level in five cases with volume less than 800 cm³ in eight and greater in four patients.In nine patients sacrectomy using isolated posterior approach was performed and in three patients antero-posterior approach was applied.The Kaplan-Meier survival curve was calculated to estimate the survival of patients.The patients were divided into groups and subsequently compared with respect of achieved radicality of surgical resection, i.e.R0 vs. R1 or R2 resection, secondly of the proximal margin of the tumor/resection, i.e.S1 or S2 vs. S3 distally, and thirdly of the volume of the tumor, i.e. less than 800 cm³ vs. more than 800 cm³. RESULTSAt the time of evaluation, a total of seven patients were alive (58.3%), with the mean survival of 9.5 years.One patient died from complications associated with the treatment of obstructive ileus manifested 10 months after primary surgery.The remaining four patients died in relation to the generalization of the disease 14.8 years after primary surgery on average.All the patients, in whom R0 resection was achieved, at the average time of evaluation of 7.3 years (range 2.8-15.8years) showed no signs of local recurrence or generalization of the disease, whereas in group with R1, R2 resection at the time of evaluation only two patients were still alive, both 16.8 years on average (range 15.2-18.4years) after surgery with repeatedly treated recurrencies.Frequent postoperative complications were observed in a total of five patients (41.7%). DISCUSSIONThe study did not confirm any difference in patient's survival with respect of the proximal margin affection of sacrum or tumor size.The decisive factor for survival of patients with sacral chordoma is achieving the R0 resection.The size of the chordoma and proximal achievement increase the complexity of surgery, manifestation of early perioperative and subsequently postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONSIn primary surgical treatment of sacral chordoma, we always try to achieve R0 resection.In the case of low-volume tumors from S3 distally, we resect the tumor using the isolated posterior approach.The anterior-posterior approach is preferred in the case of large tumors presenting in the S1/2 region.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Many physicians believe that loco-regional anaesthesia and analgesia improve the postoperative course of patients indicated for total hip arthroplasty compared to general anaesthesia. However, there are many patients who refuse subarachnoid or epidural anaesthesia, or have contraindications or conditions making the use of such techniques impossible. An alternative option is the combination of general anaesthesia and a peripheral nerve blockade. The aim of this prospective randomized open-label clinical trial was to compare the efficacy and quality of postoperative analgesia between fascia iliaca block combined with general anaesthesia (GA) and subarachnoid anaesthesia with morphine and bupivacaine (SAB). MATERIAL AND METHODS After having obtained the ethics committee approval and the patients consent, a prospective, open-label, randomized trial was conducted in patients referred for total hip arthroplasty (THR). The GA group was administered ultrasound-guided fascia iliaca block with 40 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine solution after the induction of general anaesthesia. In the SAB group, subarachnoid blockade was performed with a mixture of 3 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine with 0.150 mg morphine prepared in the hospital pharmacy. Right after surgery the patients were taken to the ICU for 24 hours, after which they were transferred to a general ward. In addition to vital signs monitoring, pain intensity using a 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS), first morphine administration at NRS >4, total morphine consumption and potential adverse effects were observed over the period of 72 hours. RESULTS There was no statistical difference between the GA (14 persons) and the SAB (14 persons) group in demographic parameters, time to first morphine administration (10 hrs vs. 19 hrs, p=0.10), number of persons with no need for morphine after surgery (5 vs. 7), tingling sensation (1 vs. 0) or numbness of the limb (0 vs. 1). There was no difference in cardiorespiratory parameters or side effects of therapy. In neither case was there respiratory depression or delayed rehabilitation. No patient developed delirium after surgery, and no patient reported dissatisfaction with pain management. DISCUSSION The fascia iliaca block and subarachnoid anaesthesia using local anaesthetic with opioid addition have been repeatedly published for patients after total hip arthroplasty, but this study is unique by comparing the two methods. The study added a new piece of knowledge to the findings of several recent meta-analyses on the comparable outcomes of general and subarachnoid anaesthesia for hip replacement in the perioperative period. CONCLUSIONS If subarachnoid anaesthesia cannot be used in hip arthroplasty, general anaesthesia with fascia iliaca block provides comparable analgesia and quality of postoperative course. Key words: total hip arthroplasty, general anaesthesia, fascia iliaca block, subarachnoid anaesthesia, postoperative analgesia, postoperative course.",

We did not find notable risk factors for the development of CDI. In 2 patients diagnosis of CDI, was made. Length of hospital stays, and readmissions were significantly higher in patients with CDI. CONCLUSIONS CDI is a rare post-surgical complication in patients who undergo surgery for idiopathic scoliosis. Currently, we cannot identify predisposing factors for the development of CDI in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Partial knee replacement appears to be an appropriate surgical solution of unicompartmental knee joint osteoarthritis in correctly indicated cases. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the mid-term outcomes of unicondylar knee replacement using the Oxford Phase III system in the group of patients treated by the First Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, St. Anne s University Hospital Brno. MATERIAL AND METHODS The prospective study evaluated 47 patients (in 4 patients bilaterally) after the Oxford unicompartmental knee replacement performed between 2011 and 2016. The patients were evaluated using the Knee Society Score (KSS), Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and radiological examination performed at 7.3 years after surgery on average. All the patients were operated on by the same surgeon. RESULTS Based on the questionnaires and the clinical examination, the clinical and functional status was assessed, using the Knee Society Score (KSS). The mean preoperative KSS and FS values were 59.8 and 56.5, respectively. The postoperative KSS and FS values were 91.2 and 83.4. The mean preoperative value of the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) was 27.3. Postoperatively the values reached 40.7 on average. Based on the radiological examination, the lower limb correction of axis in the frontal plane was assessed. The mean axis correction was 3.1°. The mean tibial component slope measured on lateral radiograph was 82.7°. The basic analysis of X-rays did not reveal any component malposition. The implant survival rate was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival curve. In our group of patients, the mean survival rate of Oxford Phase III unicondylar knee replacement at 7.3 years postoperatively is 98.0%. DISCUSSION Many studies have reported excellent results of unicondylar knee replacement and a long survival rate of over 90%. Still debated, however, are the indication criteria and also the importance of the surgeon s experience and mastery of the surgical technique. CONCLUSIONS The results of the study confirm our excellent clinical experience and the survival rate of 98% at the mean follow up of 7.3 years after surgery shows great promise for quality long-term results. Overall, crucial for the success of UKR continues to be the compliance with the indication criteria for surgery. The choice of the type of implant and, last but not least, the correct surgical technique and postoperative rehabilitation programme are also important.

The aim of study was evaluating the differences in gene expression of miR-124 of human physiological osteoblasts (HOB) and human osteoarthritic osteoblasts (OSBA) as a response to NiTi alloy in different heat treatments. MATERIAL AND METHODS The cells were cultivated with NiTi discs with/without addition of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 72 hours. MicroRNAs were isolated, underwent reverse transcription and were analyzed by RT-PCR. RESULTS As a response to LPS, HOB overexpressed miR-124, while in OSBA expression change did not occur. Overexpression was also observed in both cell lines as a response to hydrogen and helium treated NiTi discs. HOB expressed significantly higher amount of miR-124 than OSBA as a response to hydrogen treatment of NiTi discs. In addition, hydrogen treatment caused significantly higher expression in HOB than LPS. The combination of NiTi disc and LPS treatment in HOB didn't cause any expression changes. Comparing to LPS-only treatment, the expression in HOB with combination of LPS and alloy was significantly lower. In OSBA, the expression was increased by the combination of LPS and hydrogen disc, in case of helium disc, the expression was decreased. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, human physiological and osteoarthritic osteoblasts respond to NiTi alloy with both surface (hydrogen and helium atmosphere) treatment by overexpression of miR-124. The effect of LPS as inflammatory modulator suggests the presence of an \"anti-inflammatory preconditioning\" in osteoarthritic osteoblasts, as physiological osteoblasts overexpression was significantly higher.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Limb lengthening has always belonged to the most complex surgical techniques in paediatric orthopaedics. In our study, we compared the results of femoral and tibial lengthening using three different surgical techniques. The presented study aimed to shorten the duration of external fixation to a minimum and to reduce the complication rate. MATERIAL AND METHODS The retrospective study compared 74 patients (38 boys, 36 girls) who had undergone stepwise progressive lengthening of the femur or tibia between the years 2007 and 2019. The most frequent indication was the proximal focal femoral deficiency (PFFD, 33 patients). The total number of lengthening procedures was 130 (femur 72, tibia 58), the follow-up period was 2-14 years. The following modifications of surgical techniques were used: (i) standard approach, i.e. corticotomy with a two-stage removal of the fixator, (ii) preventive fixation with elastic stable intramedullary nails (ESIN) and also with a two-stage removal of the fixator, and (iii) standard approach with an early removal of the external fixator and plate osteosynthesis. RESULTS The mean lengthening achieved was 56 ± 18 (27-114) mm in femur and 54 ± 16 (25-110) mm in tibia. There was no statistical difference in the lengthening achieved by different modifications. The mean duration of external fixation in femur and tibia lengthening was comparable (166 and 164 days). The complications were observed in 60% of lengthening procedures, the most frequent being the pin release or axial malalignment of the lengthening (33 cases, 25%). The patients with ESIN displayed statistically the lowest complication rate (26%), the highest complication rate was seen in children with osteosynthesis using a plate (80%). CONCLUSIONS It follows from our results that fixation with intramedullary nails in comparison with the standard approach and plate osteosynthesis helped decrease the number of complications by more than 50%. The plate osteosynthesis is indicated in patients with repeated lengthening (achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia or PFFD with pronounced shortening) since it significantly reduces the duration of external fixation.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY In the last number of years, the anatomic hemiarthoplasty has gradually been pushed out of clinical practice by modern reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) designs. This is due to the clear excellent functional results of RSAs in a wide spectrum of indication criteria. Nevertheless, RSAs have several possible complications that cannot occur in an anatomic hemiarthroplasty. In anatomic hemiarthoplasty, the importance of correct indication criteria and observing correct operative technique including soft tissue reconstruction is much more important than in RSA. Furthermore, there is a clear recent trend of increased use of humeral components fixed only in the proximal metaphyseal cancellous bone. Our aim was to summarise our six-year experience with the SMR® Stemless (LimaCorporate, Italy) system which is one of the most modern ones. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty cases of SMR® Stemless anatomic shoulder hemiarthroplasty performed between 2016 and 2021 were included in the study. All patients were followed up prospectively. The function was evaluated preoperatively and at the last follow-up. We evaluated the range of active elevation, classic Constant Score (CS) and pain level according to the visual analogue scale (VAS). Statistical evaluation was performed by using basic statistical methods and the statistical significance of the results was assessed with a paired t-test. Level of statistical significance was set at p= 0.01. RESULTS The mean follow-up in our cohort was 3.01 years (range 0.32-5.69, Median 2.82, SD 1.56) All cases were indicated for surgery due to primary osteoarthritis with a limitation of movement and pain. The mean postoperative CS was 85.7 (range 70-96, Median 86, SD 6.83). The mean active elevation postoperatively was 143° (range 100-170°, Median 150°, SD 20.76). Mean postoperative pain according to VAS was 1.05 (range 0-4, Median 1, SD 1.02). The mean preoperative elevation was 60.5° (range 30-100°, Median 65°, SD 18.83). After surgery the mean elevation increased to 143° (range 100-170°, Median 150°, SD 20.76). Statistical evaluation showed a statistically significant increase in the CS (41.7 preoperatively to 85.7 postoperatively), range of active elevation (60.5° preoperatively to 143° postoperatively) and a statistically significant decrease in pain (VAS 6.95 preoperatively to 1.05 postoperatively). We observed no cases of failure or loosening of the implant. A statistically significant increase in post-operative range of motion was demonstrated. DISCUSSION Most modern shoulder arthroplasty designs now include implants allowing for proximal humerus metaphyseal fixation in hemiarthroplasty and even RSA designs. The advantage of metaphyseal fixation without the use of a longer stem is clear. Notably, treatment of periprosthetic humeral fractures is simpler, extraction of the implant for any reason is easier and the preoperative anatomic position of the humeral head can be respected. As with any anatomic shoulder arthroplasty, the functional result is dependent on correct indication criteria, precise surgical technique, correct humeral head position and soft tissue reconstruction - primarily the rotator cuff. CONCLUSIONS Between 2016 and 2021, we performed 20 SMR® stemless shoulder hemiarthroplasties for primary osteoarthritis. The mean follow up was 3 years. The shoulder function improved significantly post-operatively in all patients. There were no cases of implant loosening or failure. Radiographic evaluation showed no implant loosening or change in implant position in the humeral metaphysis.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY This study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes and the rate of recurrence in patients who had undergone arthroscopic Bankart repair with remplissage for anterior instability of the glenohumeral joint. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 96 arthroscopic Bankart procedures with remplissage performed between 2013 and 2019 at our department in 93 patients (81 men and 12 women; with the mean age of 33 years). We gathered and analysed preoperative data, including a 3D-CT scan of the affected shoulder. Apart from stability, the functional results were assessed postoperatively using the WOSI, SSV, Rowe score, and by measuring the strength of shoulder girdle muscles. The non-parametric MannWhitney U-test was used to identify the predisposing factors for recurrence of glenohumeral instability. RESULTS The arthroscopic Bankart repair with remplissage was indicated in 74 shoulders for primary TUBS and in 22 shoulders as a revision procedure. The recurrent instability was observed in 13 of 96 operated shoulders (13.5%). Subjective instability (positive apprehension test in the extreme positions of the shoulder joint, in abduction and external rotation in particular) was reported by 10 patients (10/13; 77%), three patients experienced a redislocation of the glenohumeral joint in the postoperative follow-up (3/13 patients; 23%). The risk of recurrence of the glenohumeral instability was not correlated with either the number of previous stabilisation procedures, or any other preoperative or intraoperative parameters. Conversely, a new postoperative injury was a factor of key importance. The patients with recurrent instability (subjective instability or glenohumeral dislocation) achieved a significantly lower Rowe score, SSV, postoperative VAS, and worse overall satisfaction with the procedure compared to the group with no recurrent instability. The remplissage induced minor limitations of external rotation at 0° abduction and internal rotation at 90° abduction. After rehabilitation, the muscle strength of the operated shoulder in both groups was comparable to that of the untreated shoulder in all planes of the shoulder range of motion. DISCUSSION Our study confirms the clinical relevance of the addition of remplissage to the arthroscopic Bankart procedure for reducing the rate of recurrent glenohumeral instability in TUBS with a clinically significant Hill-Sachs lesion. Satisfaction with the surgical outcome is high; the functional outcomes are very good, including muscle strength. Surprisingly, though, the risk of recurrent instability does not correlate with the number of implants used in the stabilisation procedure. CONCLUSIONS Addition of remplissage to the arthroscopic Bankart stabilisation in patients with a clinically significant Hill-Sachs lesion shows a low risk of recurrence of glenohumeral instability after surgery compared to the conventional arthroscopic Bankart repair alone. The remplissage does cause minor restrictions in the glenohumeral joint external rotation, but it was not reflected in the satisfaction of patients or a lower clinical score of the shoulder joint. The preoperative assessment of the HillSachs lesion using the \"glenoid track\" on a 3D-CT scan helps improve the preoperative planning and prediction of outcomes of the stabilisation procedure.

    "abstract": "The aim of this communication is to provide both clinical and radiological evaluation of short-term results of the lengthening osteotomy of the anterior part of the calcaneus after Evans in the treatment of the flat foot in children and determine indication criteria of this operation. In the 1996-1999 period 35 feet were operated on in 23 children (13 boys, 10 girls), 12 children underwent bilateral surgery in the interval of 6-12 months. The average age at the time of surgery was 10,5 years and the age range 4,3-18,5. Most operations were performed in the age range of 11-15 years (16 operations). Indication to the operation was a symptomatic flexible pes planus (29 times), the flat foot with a neurogenic defect twice, with talus obliquus twice, deformity after the treatment of pes equinovarus congenitus once and the flat foot after a burn injury once. The period of postoperative follow-up ranged between 3 months and 2,5 years. The evaluation focussed on subjective complaints, clinical finding, plantogram and radiological indicators of flat foot. For the purpose of the objectivization of the shortening of the lateral pillar of the foot the so called talocalcanear differential index was monitored under weightbearing from the lateral radiograph. This index was calculated on the basis of the difference of the distance between the distal edge of talus and the calcaneus against the length of the medial pillar of the foot. The postoperative monitoring did not record any infection complications or failure of the surgical technique. Based on the subjective evaluation the condition in 21 patients with the operation of 32 feet (91 %) improved after the surgery and in 2 patients with the operation of 3 feet (9 %) the condition did not improve. In no patient the complaints were worse. Valgus position of the heel of all patients was corrected after the surgery to the normal. There was no functional limitation of the ankle and subtalar joints in any of the patients. Plantograms changed after the surgery by 2 degrees in 16 feet (52 %), by 1 degree in 13 feet (42 %), the plantogram did not change in 2 feet (6 %). Plantogram got to its normal in 12 feet operated on (38 %). Radiological evaluation showed in all feet operated on a change in the course of the joint line of the Chopart joint in both projections and the monitored angles either improved or became normal. Tolacalcanear differential index descreased except for one foot in all feet operated on. This index was directly proportionate to the preoperative and postoperative clinical finding or to the severity of the flat foot or the correction according to the plantogram and on average it was preoperatively four times higher than in normal healthy feet. In most operated feet a shift was found in the calcaneocuboid joind which did not have any relation to the subjective evaluation. Radiological indicators did not correspond unequivocally to the resulting subjective evaluation of the operation but in the case of a satisfactory clinical correction of the deformity of the foot both the subjective evaluation and radiological correction were mostly very good. The lengthening osteotomy of the calcaneus is a safe surgical method which leads to a significant clinical and radiological correction of the valgus deformity of the hindfoot and elevation of the foot arch. Indicated to the surgery are symptomatic flat feet with the symptoms of eversion in the subtalar joint and shortening of the lateral pillar in the radiograph which are not fixed by articular contractures. It is recommended to evaluate the shortening and lengthening of the lateral pillar of the foot according to the proposed talocalcanear differential index which can be used for the indication consideration as well as for the evaluation of the correction achieved.

Among the most serious are definitely unstable fractures of the pelvic ring with both vertical and rotational instability, i. e. type C fractures according to AO classification scheme. The recent therapeutic concept recommends in case of these fractures an active reconstruction on the dorsal SI complex which evidently improves the final perspective of patients with such a severe injury. The author presents his own clinical experience and literary data relating to the treatment of 11 patients who underwent reconstruction in the region of dorsal sacro-iliac complex due to type C unstable fracture. Clinical results achieved on the basis of the evaluation of a group of 11 patients are favourable and promising despite a significant complexity of the problems of unstable pelvic fractures. In 9 patients the anatomical result on radiograph was excellent, 9 patients regained full mobility after the proper physiotherapy, 10 patients resumed their work and 6 patients resumed even professional sports activity. In the conclusion the author states that in suitable, mainly young and fully stabilized patients the reconstruction surgery on the dorsal pelvic SI segment is fully justified which is documented both by the literary data and his own experience. Key words: unstable pelvic fractures.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDYThe aim of our study is to investigate the reliabilities of the radiographic union score for tibial fracture (RUST) and modified RUST scoring systems in the evaluation of fracture healing in adult tibia fractures treated with intramedullary nailing and pediatric tibia fractures treated with closed reduction and cast immobilization and to compare the reliabilities between two groups. MATERIAL AND METHODSBetween January 2016 and January 2020, the informations of patients (ages of 4-10) with tibia fractures treated with closed reduction and casting and patients (aged 18-65 years) with tibia fractures treated with intramedullary nailing were analyzed retrospectively.Forty-seven good quality AP and lateral radiographs (represent different healing stages) each for pediatric and adult fracture groups were selected and were included in two PPTs separately.The radiographs were assessed twice with an interval of three weeks by an observer group consisting of four senior orthopedic surgeons and four orthopedic residents, and fractures were evaluated according to the RUST and mRUST scoring systems. RESULTSThe inter-observer agreement of RUST and mRUST were 'perfect' in adult tibia fractures and 'substantial' in pediatric tibia fractures in both evaluations.However, in deciding fracture consolidation, inter-observer agreement was found to be 'perfect' in pediatric tibia fractures, while it was 'substantial' in adult fractures in both assessments.The mean intra-observer reliability of RUST system in adult tibia fractures was 0.860 (0.674-0.968) and 0.818 (0.693-0.909) in pediatric tibia fractures, respectively.The mean intra-observer agreement of mRUST system was 0.842(0.745-0.979) in adult fractures and 0.857 (0.756-0.932) in pediatric fractures, respectively.The mean intra-observer reliability of decision on union was 0.842 (0.638-1.000) in adult fractures and 0.785 (0.611-0.977) in pediatric fractures, respectively. DISCUSSIONThe decision of union in tibia shaft fractures is based on repeated clinical and radiological evaluations but there are no universally accepted guidelines to evaluate radiographic union.It has been shown in previous studies that the RUST and mRUST scoring systems can be used safely in the evaluation of fracture healing in adult patients with tibia fracture treated with intra-medullary nailing.To our knowledge, there are no studies investigating the reliability of RUST and mRUST systems in conservatively treated pediatric tibial fractures.We hypothesized that the plaster of Paris makes it difficult to assess fracture union on direct radiographs and reduce the reliabilities of these scoring systems in pediatric tibial fractures. CONCLUSIONSOur study showed that both RUST and mRUST scoring systems are useful tools that can be used safely assessing fracture healing in both pediatric and adult tibia fractures.The presence of a plaster of Paris on the extremity did not adversely affect the inter-observer and intra-observer agreement of the RUST and mRUST scoring systems.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS85 patients were followed after an acute knee injury with an isolated anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) lesion.There were 51 men and 34 women with the average age of 32 years.All patients underwent an acute knee arthroscopy with subsequent ACL reconstruction according to the type of lesion.The results were evaluated according to the clinical examination, Lysholm and Tegner activity scores.We compared 2 surgical techniques (Internal Brace, All-Inside ACL reconstruction) and assessed the possible occurrence of complications. RESULTSThe injury was most often observed in patients aged 20-40 years, when mainly sports activities put a major strain on the knee joint.After performing ACL reconstruction, all patients reported a subjective improvement in the overall condition.The number of complications was very low -only in connection with a slower warm-up of the knee joint after surgery. DISCUSSIONAll patients achieved full stabilization of the knee joint, which is objectified by an increase in the Lysholm score.The improvement in patient's subjective feelings is also confirmed by the increase in Tegner activity scores.Only a few patients experienced a slight restriction of movement in the 8 th week after surgery, but thanks to intensive rehabilitation the function of the knee joint was completely restored within 3 months of the operation. CONCLUSIONSOur study proves that if the set rules are followed, it is possible to perform the ACL reconstruction already in the acute phase.However, in order to choose this approach, the patient's motivation, gently performed procedure and early intensive rehabilitation are necessary.When meeting these criteria, the patient is able to return to normal life, including sports activities, quite early and there is no increased risk of complications.",

MATERIAL AND METHODSThe patients were evaluated preoperatively and in the postoperative follow-up examinations with the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores and visual analog pain scale scores (VAS).Satisfaction with the surgical results was assessed at 3, 6, 12 months and the final follow-up visit, and the factors affecting patient satisfaction were examined. RESULTSEvaluation was made of 13 (65%) females and 7 (35%) males with a mean age of 45.8±8.1 years (range, 37-53 years).The AOFAS values were mean 44.4±8.4 preoperatively, and increased statistically significantly to 89.2±3.2 at the final follow-up examination (p<0.001).At 3 months postoperatively, 65% of the patients evaluated the results as good or excellent and this rate was 100% at the final follow-up examination.According to the correlation analysis, the main determinant of patient satisfaction was pain (r:-0.749,p<0.001), and a strong positive relationship was determined between the AOFAS score and satisfaction (r: 0.892, p<0.001). DISCUSSIONThe results of this study showed that the central tendon-splitting approach can be used in the treatment of Haglund's triad, with low complication rates, and high success and patient satisfaction rates. CONCLUSIONSIn addition, the two components underlying patient satisfaction with Haglund's surgery were found to be the elimination of pain and the ability to return to normal daily activities.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS From the beginning of 2003 to the end of 2020, a total of 36,342 surgeries were performed at our department. We retrospectively reviewed and analysed all surgeries for native joint septic arthritis (a total of 538 surgical interventions). The study included all adult patients who were operated for native joint septic arthritis in our department in 2003-2020. We included all revision surgeries for ongoing infection (excluding the management of post-infectious findings) as well as all operations performed in patients with multiple joint involvement. Based on the analysis of our data and review of published guidelines for antibiotic treatment of septic arthritis, we have outlined our own antibiotic therapy guidelines for the treatment of native joint septic arthritis. RESULTS From 2003 to 2020 we performed a total of 36,342 surgeries, of which 538 (1.5%) in 461 patients was indicated for native joint septic arthritis. The cohort consisted of 292 men (63%), who underwent 344 surgeries, and 169 women, in whom 194 surgeries were performed. The mean age of patients irrespective of the arthritis location was 62.4 years. Altogether, 19 patients (4.1%) suffered from multi-joint arthritis. The most frequently operated joint was the knee with 252 (54%) patients and 300 surgeries (56%), followed by the shoulder with 68 (14.7%) patients and 78 (14.5%) surgeries, the hip with 38 (8.2%) patients and 42 surgeries (8%), the carpal with 30 (6.5%) patients and 35 (6.5%) surgeries, the ankle with 25 patients (5.4%) - 31 (6%) surgeries, the small finger joints with 22 (4.75%) patients and 23 (4%) surgeries, the elbow with 14 (3%) patients and 14 (2.6%) surgeries, the sternoclavicular joint with 9 (1.9%) patients and 12 (2.2%) surgeries and the acromioclavicular joint with 3 patients and 3 (0.5 %) surgeries, respectively. DISCUSSION The management of septic arthritis relies heavily on early diagnosis, early surgical intervention and adequate antibiotic therapy. The diagnostic process and surgical treatment have their specifics related to the affected location, therefore, respective guidelines will be published separately for each location including the results. On the other side, antibiotic management is not dependent on the location and therefore the guidelines are included in this first analysis septic arthritis in the whole cohort. CONCLUSIONS Septic arthritis in adults in an ongoing issue with rising incidence. Early diagnosis, urgent and adequate surgical treatment, and optimal antibiotic therapy are preconditions for successful outcome.

    "abstract": "Subcutaneous emphysema can be a secondary complication of chest trauma or one of the complications of ruptured bullae in advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Massive subcutaneous emphysema impairs the respiratory mechanics and affects the venous returns of the head and neck. It can lead to respiratory insufficiency with the need for mechanical ventilation. The treatment should focus on the primary pathology. Nonetheless, in patients with subcutaneous emphysema as the only but serious symptom, the treatment can zero in solely on this complication. The standard procedure consists in the insertion of chest drain which does not necessarily have to lead to successful treatment results. The authors present a case study of a 77-year-old man with major comorbidities, with extensive subcutaneous emphysema after blunt chest wall trauma, in which respiratory insufficiency developed. The chest drain was ineffective. The solution was to apply subfascial negative pressure therapy infraclavicularly to the area of the pectoral muscle, which made the subcutaneous emphysema almost immediately subside and which substantially improved the clinical condition of the patient. Local negative pressure therapy can be used as the method of choice for treating massive subcutaneous emphysema in patients, in whom the standardised treatment by chest drain with active suction mechanism failed and the lung is expanded in the pleural cavity, and for whom surgery is far too risky.

The anatomical investigation revealed that for extension of the fork of the talus the proximal shift of the ankle is most important (9, 10) . A three-millimetre shift is sufficient to widen the fork of the talus by 5 - 6 mm which leads to severe instability and valgus position of the talus. In the widening of the fork of the talus participates in a minor way also axial valgus dislocation of the fibular ankle and its external rotation. Preoperative assessment of the proximal shift of the fibula will enable us to assess accurately in advance the required prolongation of the fibula. The crucial point of reconstruction of poorly healed bimaleolar fractures of the talus associated with a lesion of the syndesmosis is perfect restoration of the anatomical length of the fibula and congruence of tibiofibular syndesmosis (5, 8, 11). Reposition of the inner ankle is achieved after appropriate osteotomy spontaneously by pressure of the medially forward pushed talus.

    "abstract": "Diaphyseal fractures of the humerus are not common in children. With the exception of fractures which occur during delivery they do not differ substantially from diaphyseal fractures in adults as far as the etiology and line of fracture is concerned. They differ, however, substantially as regards treatment. At the Department for Paediatric Surgery, Thomayer Hospital during the period from January 1986 to December 1995, i.e. during a 10-year period, 66 were treated with injuries of the diaphysis of the humerus, which accounts for 6 % of all fractures of the humerus treated at the Department during the investigation period. One fifth was formed by pathological fractures, mostly in a juvenile bone cyst. In 61 instances (92, 5 %) conservative treatment was sufficient, using a Desault bandage reinforced with a plaster splint or treatment with suspended plaster or reposition under general anaesthesia with subsequent fixation. In some instances traction was used, skeletal or skin traction. Only in five instances an operation was performed. Osteosynthesis was used once using external fixation, once using an AO splint, twice using an intermedulla-ry procedure according to Hackethal and once by intramedullary fixation by Métaizeau's method. Except for one case, where monotrauma with a lesion of the radial nerve was involved, in all instances patients with multiple injuries were operated. In all children, treated by conservative methods or osteosynthesis, recovery was satisfactory without functional sequelae. The only exception was a patient with osteogenesis imperfecta who had, due to the basic disease, repeated fractures and developed typical deformities of both humeri. Only in two patients (3 %) a posttraumatic lesion of the radial nerve was recorded. Key words: humerus, diaphysis, fracture, child.",

    "abstract": "The authors made an open multicentre clinical study with the administration of hyaluronic acid (Hyalgan(R) - Fidia) in patients with gonarthritis. The study comprised 31 patients with gonarthritis grade II-III according to Kellgren, 30 of whom completed the study. Hyalgan was administered to the patients - vials á 2 ml in five injections in weekly intervals by the intraarticular route. The patients were followed up for another three months after completed treatment. A significant decline of pain on the visual analogue scale (VAS) was recorded already two weeks after onset of treatment (p = 0.001) and this decline persisted for another 13 weeks after termination of treatment. The algofunctional indices (Lequesne, Jezek) also declined after the first injection, whereby a statistically significant reduction was recorded still after 12 weeks, as compared with values before the onset of treatment (p = 0.001). Similar results were obtained also in objective evaluations (effusion, temperature above joint, tenderness). Already after the second injection a significantly shorter time was required for a 20 m walk. The mean daily paracetamol consumption declined from a mean value of 1496 +/- 777 mg before administration to 670 6 661 mg at the end of the investigation (p = 0.00006). Undesirable effects (increased intensity of pain after puncture) was recorded in one patient (3.3%). Evidence was provided that Hyalgan(R) belongs as to its profile of effectiveness among so-called SYSADOAs (symptomatic slow acting drugs for OA). Treatment is quite safe. Key words: knee osteoarthritis, hyaluronic acid, i. a. treatment.",
