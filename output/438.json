    "abstract": "This study reports the results of a comprehensive survey of 16 states regarding the coordination and characteristics of universal newborn hearing screening, audiologic assessment, and intervention programs. The survey establishes a baseline assessment that was conducted by states as part of their first year of participation in a Maternal and Child Health Bureau grant on state systems for universal newborn hearing screening, assessment, and intervention. States are making progress toward achieving universal newborn hearing screening. However, several issues continue to impede the establishment of statewide systems for linking screening programs to diagnosis and intervention.",

    "abstract": "Hyperacusis can be extremely debilitating, and at present, there is no cure. We provide an overview of the field, and possible related areas, in the hope of facilitating future research.We review and reference literature on hyperacusis and related areas. We have divided the review into 2 articles. In Part I, we discuss definitions, epidemiology, different etiologies and subgroups, and how hyperacusis affects people. In Part II, we review measurements, models, mechanisms, and treatments, and we finish with some suggestions for further research.Hyperacusis encompasses a wide range of reactions to sound, which can be grouped into the categories of excessive loudness, annoyance, fear, and pain. Many different causes have been proposed, and it will be important to appreciate and quantify different subgroups. Reasonable approaches to assessing the different forms of hyperacusis are emerging, including psychoacoustical measures, questionnaires, and brain imaging.Hyperacusis can make life difficult for many, forcing sufferers to dramatically alter their work and social habits. We believe this is an opportune time to explore approaches to better understand and treat hyperacusis.",

    "abstract": "Classrooms are often filled with deterrents that hamper a child's ability to listen and learn. It is evident that the acoustical environment in classrooms can be one such deterrent. Excessive background noise and reverberation can affect the achievement and educational performance of children with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and children with normal hearing sensitivity who have other auditory learning difficulties, as well as elementary school children with no verbal or hearing disabilities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the extent of the problem of noise and reverberation in schools. To that end, we measured reverberation times and background noise levels in 32 different unoccupied elementary classrooms in eight public school buildings in central Ohio. The results were compared with the limits recommended in the American National Standards Institute standard for acoustical characteristics of classrooms in the United States (ANSI S12.60-2002). These measurements were also compared to the external and internal criteria variables developed by Crandell, Smaldino, & Flexer (1995) to determine if a simple checklist can accurately predict unwanted classroom background noise levels and reverberation. Results indicated that most classrooms were not in compliance with ANSI noise and reverberation standards. Further, our results suggested that a checklist was not a good predictor of the noisier and more reverberant rooms.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The development of therapeutic interventions for chronic tinnitus requires sensitive and clinically responsive tools to measure treatment-induced changes in tinnitus loudness and annoyance. In this study, the authors evaluated the psychometric properties of patient-reported visual analog scales (VAS) for measuring subjectively perceived tinnitus loudness and annoyance. Method The authors analyzed data from a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of acoustic coordinated reset (CR) neuromodulation in patients with chronic tinnitus (trial registration: “Randomized Evaluation of Sound Evoked Treatment of Tinnitus [RESET] study”; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00927121) to assess the reliability, validity, and minimally clinically identifiable difference (MCID) of the VAS loudness and VAS annoyance. The VAS loudness and VAS annoyance were completed at screening, at baseline, and at 5 visits during the 16 weeks of the clinical study. Data were analyzed with respect to test–retest reliability, validity, and MCID. Results VAS loudness and VAS annoyance showed good test-retest reliability of .8 and .79, respectively. In terms of convergent validity, VAS loudness and VAS annoyance correlated well with the tinnitus questionnaire at all clinical visits (max r = .67, p &lt; .05). MCID estimates clustered between 10 and 15 points. Conclusion VAS loudness and VAS annoyance are valid and effective measurements for capturing reductions in tinnitus severity in patients with chronic tinnitus.",

Design The design of this study was a single-site, prospective, double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial with three parallel branches: (a) audiology best practices (AB), (b) consumer decides OTC model (CD), and (c) placebo devices (P). Outcome measures were obtained after a typical 6-week trial period with follow-up 4-week AB-based trial for those initially assigned to CD and P groups. Setting Older adults from the general community were recruited via newspaper and community flyers to participate at a university research clinic. Participants Participants were adults, ages 55–79 years, with mild-to-moderate hearing loss. There were 188 eligible participants: 163 enrolled as a volunteer sample, and 154 completed the intervention. Intervention(s) All participants received the same high-end digital mini-behind-the-ear hearing aids fitted bilaterally. AB and P groups received best-practice services from audiologists; differing mainly in use of appropriate (AB) or placebo (P) hearing aid settings. CD participants self-selected their own pre-programmed hearing aids via an OTC model. Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures Primary outcome measure was a 66-item self-report, Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (Cox &amp; Gilmore, 1990). Secondary outcome measure was the Connected Speech Test (Cox, Alexander, &amp; Gilmore, 1987) benefit. Additional measures of hearing-aid benefit, satisfaction, and usage were also obtained. Results Per-protocol analyses were performed. AB service-delivery model was found to be efficacious for most of the outcome measures, with moderate or large effect sizes (Cohen's d ). CD service-delivery model was efficacious, with similar effect sizes. However, CD group had a significantly ( p &lt; .05) lower satisfaction and percentage (CD: 55%; AB: 81%; P: 36%) likely to purchase hearing aids after the trial. Conclusions Hearing aids are efficacious in older adults for both AB and CD service-delivery models. CD model of OTC service delivery yielded only slightly poorer outcomes than the AB model. Efficacious OTC models may increase accessibility and affordability of hearing aids for millions of older adults. Purchase price had no effect on outcomes, but a high percentage of those who rejected hearing aids paid the typical price (85%).

The authors used available records to capture ages of confirmation of hearing loss, hearing aid fitting, and entry into early intervention. Linear regression models were used to investigate relationships among individual predictor variables and age at each follow-up benchmark.Of several predictor variables, only higher levels of maternal education were significantly associated with earlier confirmation of hearing loss and fitting of hearing aids; severity of hearing loss was not. No variables were significantly associated with age of entry into early intervention. Each recommended benchmark was met by a majority of children, but only one third met all of the benchmarks within the recommended time frame.Results suggest that underserved communities need extra support in navigating steps that follow failed newborn hearing screening.",

Because of this, patients may raise psychosocial concerns regarding their hearing rehabilitation during audiology appointments, particularly in relation to getting hearing aids. However, thus far there has been little systematic research exploring how patients' concerns about hearing aids are addressed by audiologists within appointments.This study used conversation analysis to examine a corpus of 63 video-recorded initial audiology appointments with older adults with hearing impairment.The findings demonstrated that when patients expressed concerns regarding hearing aids, these concerns were typically psychosocial in nature and expressed in a way that carried a negative emotional stance. These types of turns thus invited an empathic response. However, patients' concerns were not typically addressed by audiologists during the appointment. As a consequence, patients persistently re-raised their concerns in subsequent turns, leading to expanded sequences of interaction during the management phase of the appointment.Older adults' psychosocial concerns regarding hearing aids may not always be sufficiently addressed within audiology appointments. A greater emphasis on emotionally focused communication within audiology could result in improved outcomes from hearing health care services.",

In this detailed review of the field, we consolidate present knowledge in the hope of facilitating future research. Method We review and reference the literature on hyperacusis and related areas. This is the 2nd of a 2-part review. Results Hyperacusis encompasses a wide range of reactions to sounds, which can be grouped into the categories of excessive loudness, annoyance, fear, and pain. Reasonable approaches to assessing the different forms of hyperacusis are emerging, including brain-imaging studies. Researchers are only beginning to understand the many mechanisms at play, and valid animal models are still evolving. There are many counseling and sound-therapy approaches that some patients find helpful, but well-controlled studies are needed to measure their long-term efficacy and to test new approaches. Conclusions Hyperacusis can make life difficult in this increasingly noisy world, forcing sufferers to dramatically alter their work and social habits. We believe this is an opportune time to explore approaches to better understand and treat hyperacusis.",

In addition, recent data on effects of lifestyle engagement on cognitive processes are reviewed.There is substantial evidence for age-related declines in both auditory processes and cognitive abilities. Accumulating evidence supports the idea that the perceptual burden associated with hearing loss impacts the processing resources available for good comprehension and memory for spoken language, particularly in older adults with limited resources. However, many language abilities are well preserved in old age, and there is considerable variability among individuals in cognitive performance across the life span. The authors discuss how lifestyle factors and socioemotional engagement can help to offset declining abilities.It is clear that spoken language processing in adulthood and old age is affected by changes in perceptual, cognitive, and socioemotional processes as well as by interactions among these changes. Recommendations for further research include studying speech comprehension in complex conditions, including meaningful-connection spoken language, and tailoring clinical interventions based on patients' auditory processing and cognitive abilities along with their individual socioemotional demands.",

Method Using a cross-sectional design, the author assessed TFS sensitivity in 102 normal-hearing adults sampled from across the entire range of adulthood (ages 18–90 years), using 2 psychophysical tests for the assessment of within- and across-ear TFS processing. Results Both types of TFS sensitivity (monaural and binaural) declined gradually starting in young adulthood, with the earliest significant deficit already apparent in early midlife (i.e., between ages 40 and 49 years). TFS sensitivity was not correlated with absolute sensitivity at the test frequency. Conclusions Some suprathreshold auditory processing abilities decline throughout adulthood, even when an individual's peripheral hearing is clinically normal. These deficits are not captured by a conventional, audiometric hearing assessment but may contribute to the increasing difficulties with age to identify speech in noisy environments. From a methodological point of view, the existence of such age effects warrants the use of age-matched participant groups when comparing normal and impaired peripheral hearing.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: For some people, exposure to everyday sounds presents a significant problem. The purpose of this tutorial was to define and differentiate between the various sound tolerance conditions and to review some options for their clinical management.We informally reviewed the literature regarding sound tolerance conditions. The terminology and definitions provided are mostly consistent with how these terms are defined. However, many inconsistencies are noted. Methods of assessment and treatment also differ, and different methodologies are briefly described.Hyperacusis describes physical discomfort or pain when any sound reaches a certain level of loudness that would be tolerable for most people. Misophonia refers to intense emotional reactions to certain sounds (often body sounds such as chewing and sniffing) that are not influenced by the perceived loudness of those sounds. Noise sensitivity refers to increased reactivity to sounds that may include general discomfort (annoyance or feeling overwhelmed) due to a perceived noisy environment, regardless of its loudness. Phonophobia, as addressed in the audiology profession, describes anticipatory fear of sound. Phonophobia is an emotional response such as anxiety and avoidance of sound due to the \"fear\" that sound(s) may occur that will cause a comorbid condition to get worse (e.g., tinnitus) or the sound itself will result in discomfort or pain. (Note that phonophobia is a term used by neurologists to describe \"migraineur phonophobia\"-a different condition not addressed herein.) Conclusions: The literature addresses sound tolerance conditions but reveals many inconsistencies, indicating lack of consensus in the field. When doing an assessment for decreased sound tolerance, it is important to define any terms used so that the patient and all health care professionals involved in the care of the patient are aligned with the goals of the treatment plan. Treatment generally involves gradual and systematic sound desensitization and counseling.https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.20164130.",

For each of these listeners with hearing loss, recognition performance reached an asymptote of &lt;100%. When the spectrum of the speech for this asymptotic performance level was compared with the listener's pure-tone thresholds, it was seen that providing audible speech to high-frequency regions (≥3000 Hz), where hearing loss exceeds 55 dB HL, tended to produce little or no improvement in recognition scores. In contrast, providing audible speech to lower frequency regions for a listener with a flat, severe-to-profound hearing loss did show improvement with increasing speech audibility, despite this listener's thresholds being greater than 55 dB HL. The present study adds further support to the idea that attempting to provide amplification to regions with severe high-frequency hearing loss (≥3000 Hz) may not necessarily benefit many individuals with hearing loss.",

Method Semistructured interviews were conducted with 17 families (21 parents) of preschool children in 4 centers in Ontario, Canada. Parents of children identified by neonatal screening as well as those identified through traditional referral routes participated. We asked parents to share their perceptions of the strengths and gaps in the care system. Results Although the majority of parents were satisfied with the range and quality of audiology and therapy services available, they identified gaps in the areas of service coordination, availability of information, and the integration of social service and parent support into the system. Access to audiology services appears to have been facilitated for children who were systematically screened. Conclusions The findings provide insights into the services most valued by families. These findings highlight the importance of eliciting parents’ perspectives in designing optimal care models for children and families.",

    "abstract": "Purpose This review outlines the anatomical and functional bases of somatosensory influences on auditory processing in the normal brainstem and midbrain. It then explores how interactions between the auditory and somatosensory system are modified through deafness, and their impact on tinnitus is discussed. Method Literature review, tract tracing, immunohistochemistry, and in vivo electrophysiological recordings were used. Results Somatosensory input originates in the dorsal root ganglia and trigeminal ganglia, and is transmitted directly and indirectly through 2nd-order nuclei to the ventral cochlear nucleus, dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), and inferior colliculus. The glutamatergic somatosensory afferents can be segregated from auditory nerve inputs by the type of vesicular glutamate transporters present in their terminals. Electrical stimulation of the somatosensory input results in a complex combination of excitation and inhibition, and alters the rate and timing of responses to acoustic stimulation. Deafness increases the spontaneous rates of those neurons that receive excitatory somatosensory input and results in a greater sensitivity of DCN neurons to trigeminal stimulation. Conclusions Auditory-somatosensory bimodal integration is already present in 1st-order auditory nuclei. The balance of excitation and inhibition elicited by somatosensory input is altered following deafness. The increase in somatosensory influence on auditory neurons when their auditory input is diminished could be due to cross-modal reinnervation or increased synaptic strength, and may contribute to mechanisms underlying somatic tinnitus.",

Similarities between the way PTSD and tinnitus influence auditory behaviors include exaggerated startle responses and decreased loudness tolerance. Tinnitus loudness is often exacerbated by sounds that trigger PTSD-related anxiety. This report addresses physical and psychological relations between PTSD and tinnitus. Method A chart review of veterans seen over a 4-year period for tinnitus services was conducted. Case history and self-assessments of tinnitus handicap were examined in all patients. A review of the literature related to triggers and effects of PTSD was conducted to explore potential consequences related to the presence of PTSD in the Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) tinnitus population. Results Chart review confirmed that 34% of the first 300 patients enrolled in the VAMC Tinnitus Clinic also carried a diagnosis of PTSD. Patient reports citing tinnitus severity, suddenness of tinnitus onset, sound-tolerance problems, and sound-triggered exacerbation of tinnitus were more common for patients with a PTSD diagnosis than patients with tinnitus only. Conclusions Several neural mechanisms linked to both tinnitus and PTSD affect auditory behaviors. Audiologists should be aware that patients with tinnitus and PTSD will require test protocols and referrals that address these powerful responses.",

In Stage 1, the authors conducted focus groups of children with UHL and their parents to elicit perceptions of how UHL affected the lives of these children. In Stage 2, a generic pediatric quality of life survey was used to measure HRQOL quantitatively in children with normal hearing, UHL, and bilateral hearing loss. Participants were recruited from the clinical and research populations of an academic otolaryngology department. Results The focus groups revealed that the children with UHL experienced barriers due to their hearing loss but learned to adapt. Quantitatively, statistically significant differences between groups were not observed on the 3 main HRQOL scales (Total, Psychosocial, and Physical). Children with UHL had a significantly larger variance on the social functioning score than children with normal hearing and bilateral hearing loss. Conclusions UHL may affect the HRQOL of children; this possibility should be included when counseling parents. However, further research is warranted to determine whether the authors' findings are generalizable to other children with UHL.",

Method In this study, we developed the Practical Hearing Aid Skills Test (PHAST) to objectively test a hearing aid user’s ability to manipulate his or her hearing aids. The PHAST requires hearing aid users to perform 8 hearing aid care and use tasks that are basic skills typically taught to new hearing aid users at the time of their hearing aid fitting. The PHAST was administered to a group of 50 experienced hearing aid users. In addition, participants were administered questionnaires about hearing aid satisfaction (i.e., Satisfaction With Amplification in Daily Life; R. M. Cox &amp; G. C. Alexander, 1999), benefit (i.e., Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit; R. M. Cox &amp; G. C. Alexander, 1995), and use. Results Participants' performance on the PHAST ranged from 48% to 100%, and the scores were normally distributed around the mean (78.56%). No significant relationship was observed between the PHAST and any of the other tests administered in this study. The only variable significantly associated with participants' performance on the PHAST was age. Conclusions Results from this study suggest that experienced hearing aid users range from having an excellent understanding of how to use their hearing aids to a poor understanding. The variability in performance among experienced hearing aid users highlights the importance of directly assessing a client’s ability to use his or her hearing aids.",

These options are briefly reviewed, followed by data suggesting that gap detection procedures might be used to efficiently measure acute, salicylate-induced tinnitus and possibly hyperacusis in rats. Method Fischer Brown Norway rats ( n = 10) were given intraperitoneal injections of 350 mg/kg sodium salicylate on 2 consecutive days, and the effects on gap detection were observed across 9 different frequency bands. Pretest, posttest, and washout data were collected. An additional 4 rats were each given 4 different doses of sodium salicylate (0, 150, 250, and 300 mg/kg), and gap detection and prepulse inhibition were measured. Results Significant gap detection deficits were observed from pre- to posttest that were consistent with tinnitus. Consistent gap detection deficits were found using broadband noise backgrounds, while significant improvements in responding to frequency-specific test bands were found. Similar effects were repeated in the dose response portion of the study. Conclusions Gap detection procedures efficiently measured salicylate-induced changes in behavior that were consistent with the presence of tinnitus. In addition, the reliable, stronger responses at many frequencies after salicylate injections suggest the possibility of measuring a hyperacusis-like phenomenon using these methods.",

Telehealth technology typically has been employed to increase the level of health care access for consumers living in rural communities. In this way, audiologists can use telehealth to provide services in the rural school systems. This is important because school hearing screening programs are the foundation of educational audiology programs. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine the feasibility of providing hearing screening services by telehealth technology to school-age children.Hearing screening services-including otoscopy, pure-tone, and immittance audiometry-were conducted on 32 children in 3rd grade attending an elementary school in rural Utah. Each child received 1 screening on-site and another through telehealth procedures.Immittance and otoscopy results were identical for on-site and telehealth screening protocols. Five children responded differently to pure-tone stimuli presented by the telehealth protocol than by the on-site protocol. However, no statistically significant difference was found for pure-tone screening results obtained by telehealth or on-site screening procedures (binomial test, p = .37). Likewise, overall screening results obtained by traditional and telehealth procedures were not statistically significant (binomial test, p = .37).The results of this study suggest that school hearing screenings may be provided using telehealth technology. This study did find that 5 students performed differently to pure-tone screenings administered by the telehealth protocol in contrast to on-site hearing screening services. Further research is necessary to identify factors leading to false responses to pure-tone hearing screening when telehealth technology is used. In addition, telehealth hearing screening protocols should be conducted with participants of different age groups and experiencing a wide range of hearing loss to further clarify the value of telehealth technology.",

Method The authors used data from 2 waves of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (4-year follow-up, baseline ages 63–93 years). Sample sizes were 996 (self-report analyses) and 830 (speech-in-noise test analyses). The authors used multiple linear regression analyses to assess the associations between baseline hearing status and 4-year follow-up of depression, social loneliness, and emotional loneliness. Hearing was measured by self-report and by a speech-in-noise test. Age, gender, hearing aid use, baseline depression or loneliness, and relevant confounders and effect modifiers were incorporated. Results Both hearing measures showed significant associations with loneliness ( p &lt; .05), but these effects were confined to specific subgroups of older persons. For instance, adverse effects were confined to nonusers of hearing aids (self-report, social loneliness model) and men (self-report and speech-in-noise test, emotional-loneliness model). No significant effects appeared for depression. Conclusion Significant adverse effects of poor hearing on loneliness were found for specific subgroups of older persons. In future research, investigators should further examine the subgroup effects observed. Eventually, this may contribute to the development of tailored prevention programs.",

This standardized scale provides a measure of general fatigue, sleep/rest fatigue, cognitive fatigue, and an overall composite measure of fatigue. To date, data from 10 children with hearing loss (CHL) and 10 age-matched children with normal hearing (CNH) have been analyzed.These preliminary results show that subjective fatigue is increased in school-age children with hearing loss (Cohen's d = 0.78-1.90). In addition, the impact of hearing loss on fatigue in school-age children appears pervasive across multiple domains (general, sleep/rest, and cognitive fatigue).School-age CHL reported significantly more fatigue than did CNH. These preliminary data are important given the negative academic and psychosocial consequences associated with fatigue. Further research is needed to determine the underlying mechanisms responsible for this increased fatigue in school-age children with hearing loss, and to identify factors that may modulate (e.g., degree of loss) and mediate (e.g., hearing aid or cochlear implant use) its impact.",

Method Two distinct domains were reviewed: one concerning technological and the other concerning psychological aspects of training.

Results Over the last century, technological advances have influenced both the design of hearing aids and training systems. Initially, training focused on children and those with severe loss for whom amplification was insufficient. Now the focus has shifted to older adults with relatively little loss but difficulties listening in noise. Evidence of brain plasticity from auditory and cognitive neuroscience provides new insights into how to facilitate perceptual (re-)learning by older adults. Conclusions There is a new imperative to complement training to increase bottom-up processing of the signal with more ecologically valid training to boost top-down information processing based on knowledge of language and the world. Advances in digital technologies enable the development of increasingly sophisticated training systems incorporating complex meaningful materials such as music, audiovisual interactive displays, and conversation.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether older cochlear implant (CI) listeners differ from younger CI listeners on measures of speech understanding, music perception, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). In the study, the authors hypothesized that speech recognition would be more difficult for older adults, especially in noisy conditions. Performance on music perception was expected to be lower for older implanted listeners. No differences between age groups were expected on HRQoL.Twenty older (>60 years) and 20 younger (<60 years) implanted adults participated. Speech understanding was assessed using words and sentences presented in quiet, and sentences presented at +15, +10, and +5 dB signal-to-noise ratio conditions. Music perception was tested using the University of Washington Clinical Assessment of Music, and HRQoL was measured using the Njimegen CI survey.Speech understanding was significantly lower for the older compared with the younger group in all conditions. Older implanted adults showed lower performance on music perception compared with younger implanted adults on 1 of 3 subtests. Older adults reported lower HRQoL benefit than younger adults on 3 of 6 subdomains.Data indicate that older CI listeners performed more poorly than younger CI listeners, although group differences appear to be task specific.",

References cited in retrieved articles were also reviewed.In total, 69 articles contained relevant information about pediatric outcomes and/or intervention for unilateral hearing loss, 50 for mild hearing loss, and 6 for high-frequency hearing loss. Six challenges associated with MHL emerged, and 6 interventions were indicated. Evidence indicates that although some individuals may appear to have no observable speech-language or academic difficulties, others experience considerable difficulties. It also indicates that even though children with MHL may appear to catch up in some areas, difficulties in select domains continue into adulthood.Evidence indicates significant risks associated with untreated MHL. Evidence also demonstrates the need for early intervention and identifies several appropriate intervention strategies; however, no single protocol is appropriate for all children. Therefore, families should be educated about the impact of MHL and about available interventions so that informed decisions can be made.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study was to analyze data from the EuroTrak surveys performed from 2009 to 2015 in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom to identify factors that could account for the growth in hearing aid sales over that period. Method Data of 132,028 people—approximately 15,000 for each of the 3 countries at 3-year intervals—were collected using a questionnaire. The sample in each country was weighted using the respective country age–gender populations to get balanced results. Furthermore, 11,867 persons with self-reported hearing impairment filled in a comprehensive questionnaire on hearing status and related matters; 4,631 were hearing aid owners. Data were pooled over the 3 countries for each of the years 2009, 2012, and 2015 and analyzed for developments over the 6-year period. In certain cases, data were pooled across countries and years. The analysis focused on hearing loss prevalence, hearing aid adoption rates, satisfaction with hearing aids, and benefits of hearing aid use. Results Hearing loss prevalence was stable over the period around 10%—slightly higher for men than for women. Hearing aid adoption overall increased from 33% to 37%, and bilateral use increased from 55% to 69%. Intervals between hearing aid renewals decreased. These factors contribute to increased hearing aid sales. Bilateral users are more satisfied with the hearing aid product features (76%) and performance (72%) and use their hearing aids 9.1 hr per day, compared with unilateral users where the corresponding numbers are 71%, 67%, and 7.8 hr, respectively. Satisfaction with hearing aid product features and performance in general is slightly increasing; hearing aid users are 14.5% less exhausted at the end of the day compared with nonusers with similar hearing loss and exhibit less depressive and forgetfulness symptoms. Conclusions The prevalence of self-reported hearing loss is 10.6% and stable, and hearing aid adoption has increased, particularly of bilateral fittings that are more satisfactory and exhibit higher daily use patterns. Higher uptake of hearing aids contributes to growing hearing aid sales.",

Of children with DS, 22%-30% experienced a transient hearing loss, with a high incidence of middle ear pathologies from infancy until early adulthood. There were no statistical differences between ethnicity and permanent/transient hearing loss diagnosis. Twenty-three percent were current hearing aid users or had them recommended in a treatment plan.The prevalence of hearing loss and abnormal middle ear status is high in the pediatric population with DS. Audiologic evaluations should follow the American Academy of Pediatrics practice guidelines to monitor this high-risk population, and amplification should be considered as an appropriate intervention option if repeated audiologic examinations reveal hearing loss.",

    "abstract": "This review article reviews the contemporary studies of localization ability for different populations in different listening environments and provides possible future research directions.The ability to accurately localize a sound source relying on three cues (interaural time difference, interaural level difference, and spectral cues) is important for communication, learning, and safety. Confounding effects including noise and reverberation, which exist in common listening environments, mask or alter localization cues and negatively affect localization performance. Hearing loss, a common public health issue, also affects localization accuracy. Although hearing devices have been developed to provide excellent audibility of speech signals, less attention has been paid to preserving and replicating crucial localization cues. Unique challenges are faced by users of various hearing devices, including hearing aids, bone-anchored hearing instruments, and cochlear implants. Hearing aids have failed to consistently improve localization performance and, in some cases, significantly impair sound localization. Bone-conduction hearing instruments show little to no benefit for sound localization performance in most cases, although some improvement is seen in binaural users. Although cochlear implants provide great hearing benefit to individuals with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss, cochlear implant users have significant difficulty localizing sound, even with two implants. However, technologies in each of these areas are advancing to reduce interference with desired sound signals and preserve localization cues to help users achieve better hearing and sound localization in real-life environments.",

Although laboratory studies have validated many OTC hearing technologies, there are limited real-world benefit studies. This study compared hearing aid outcomes reported by clients from OTC and conventional hearing care professional (HCP) service delivery models.An ecological, cross-sectional survey design was employed. An online survey was sent to the Hearing Tracker user and OTC Lexie hearing aid user databases. Moreover, 656 hearing aid users completed the survey-406 through conventional HCP services (Mage = 66.7 ± 13.0 years) and 250 through the OTC model (Mage = 63.7 ± 12.2 years). Self-reported hearing aid benefit and satisfaction were measured with the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids outcome tool.No significant difference for overall hearing aid outcomes between HCP and OTC users was evident using regression analyses, controlling for age, gender, duration of hearing loss, duration before hearing aid purchase, self-reported hearing difficulty, and unilateral versus bilateral fitting. For the \"daily use\" domain, HCP clients reported significantly longer hours of daily use. For the \"residual activity limitations\" domain, OTC hearing aid users reported significantly less difficulty hearing in situations where they most wanted to hear better.OTC hearing aid outcomes could complement and provide similar satisfaction and benefit to HCP models for adults. Service delivery aspects such as self-fitting, acclimatization programs, remote support, behavioral incentivization, and payment options should be investigated for their potential role in OTC hearing aid outcomes.https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.22134788.",

    "abstract": "This clinical focus article describes the development of a novel, remotely delivered counseling program for patients with hyperacusis. For many patients, seeking management of hyperacusis is limited by accessibility and affordability issues of care. By reducing these barriers, remote counseling has the potential to advance hyperacusis care and improve outcomes for many people suffering from hyperacusis. We created a 4-week remote counseling program that included asynchronous videos, hands-on activities and quizzes, handouts and resources for teaching coping skills and keeping patients engaged, and synchronous discussions for coaching. Weekly content was derived from in-person therapy using hyperacusis activities treatment (HAT) and focused on five relevant topics that included (a) an overview of hyperacusis, tinnitus, hearing, and hearing loss; (b) reactions to hyperacusis and strategies to reduce negative reactions to sounds; (c) thought analysis and restructuring; (d) relaxation techniques and mindfulness; and (e) gradual sound exposure and proper use of hearing protection. Our remote counseling program, HAT-Online, provides holistic education about hyperacusis, coping strategies to lessen reactions to everyday sounds and challenge thoughts and fears, and management options including customized sound therapy and relaxation exercises. With implementation of this remote counseling program, our team anticipates gathering early clinical evidence needed to support larger, multisite, future randomized clinical trials that will be designed to more fully evaluate the effectiveness of the remote delivery of HAT's counseling and customized sound therapy components to reduce reactions to hyperacusis.",

Women and men differ in how they age and adjust to impaired hearing, yet little is known specifically about women's perceptions of stigma related to hearing loss and hearing aid use. The purpose of this study was to examine the degree of stigma associated with hearing loss and hearing aid use among women in three age groups (35-45 years, 55-65 years, and 75-85 years). Participants were 191 women with hearing within normal limits based on age-related norms. Using pairs of descriptors (i.e., semantic differentials), participants completed statements related to hearing loss and hearing aid use. Results suggest that negative perceptions associated with hearing loss and hearing aid use are affected by age. Younger women perceive greater stigma than older women. Less stigma is associated with hearing aid use than hearing loss, suggesting a positive effect of hearing loss management. Implications for clinical practice and marketing of hearing instruments are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: This article argues for the use of modality specificity as a unifying framework by which to conceptualize and diagnose central auditory processing disorder (CAPD). The intent is to generate dialogue and critical discussion in this area of study. Method: Research in the cognitive, behavioral, and neural sciences that relates to the concept of modality specificity was reviewed and synthesized. Results: Modality specificity has a long history as an organizing construct within a diverse collection of mainstream scientific disciplines. The principle of modality specificity was contrasted with the unimodal inclusive framework, which holds that auditory tests alone are sufficient to make the CAPD diagnosis. Evidence from a large body of data demonstrated that the unimodal framework was unable to delineate modality-specific processes from more generalized dysfunction; it lacked discriminant validity and resulted in an incomplete assessment. Consequently, any hypothetical model resulting from incomplete assessments or potential therapies that are based on indeterminate diagnoses are themselves questionable, and caution should be used in their application. Conclusions: Improving specificity of diagnosis is an imperative core issue to the area of CAPD. Without specificity, the concept has little explanatory power. Because of serious flaws in concept and design, the unimodal inclusive framework should be abandoned in favor of a more valid approach that uses modality specificity.",

These tests were labeled the Multiple Auditory Processing Assessment (MAPA) and then administered to an initial sample of 81 third grade children, along with the SCAN screening test for auditory processing disorders. Afterward, several exploratory factor analyses were performed on the findings, and comparisons were made between the results for the MAPA and SCAN. Four separate factors emerged from the four MAPA tests, which were linked closely to the components of central auditory processing disorders (CAPDs) defined by ASHA (1996, American Journal of Audiology, 5 (2), 41–54). These factors were labeled monaural separation/closure (MSC), auditory pattern/temporal ordering, binaural integration, and binaural separation (BS). SCAN appears to measure two of these factors, MSC and BS. Use of MAPA is encouraging. Our findings suggest it may provide an appropriate multiple-test, CAPD battery for third grade children, and it meets at least some of the objectives described in the consensus document proposed by ASHA (1996, American Journal of Audiology, 5 (2), 41–54).",

The method, termed audiologic tinnitus management (ATM), was developed to incorporate management strategies that can be implemented most efficiently by audiologists. Method: Development of ATM has been drawn from the clinical and research experience of the authors and numerous audiologists. Certain elements of ATM are adapted from the methods of tinnitus masking and tinnitus retraining therapy. Procedures are described in the present article for performing the intake assessment, while the companion article (J. A. Henry, T. L. Zaugg, &amp; M. A. Schechter, 2005) describes treatment methodology. Results: Development of ATM has resulted in defined procedures to conduct a basic tinnitus assessment that includes written questionnaires, an intake interview, audiologic evaluation, and a psychoacoustic assessment of tinnitus perceptual characteristics. If patients report a sound tolerance problem (hyperacusis), loudness discomfort levels are measured at audiometric frequencies. There are special procedures for selecting hearing aids, ear-level noise generators, combination devices (noise generator and hearing aid combined), and personal listening devices (i.e., portable radios and tape, CD, and MP3 players). Conclusions: This article explains each of these assessment components in detail. Adoption of the ATM assessment protocol by audiologists can contribute to the establishment of uniform procedures for the clinical management of tinnitus patients.",

Method Baseline questionnaires were completed by 478 4th-grade students and 550 7th-grade students. Approximately half of the students in each grade received a 35-min interactive classroom presentation on hearing and hearing loss prevention. The remaining students served as comparison groups. Students who received the curriculum filled out questionnaires immediately after the presentation. All students filled out follow-up questionnaires 3 months after baseline. Results Fourth-grade students who participated in the Dangerous Decibels presentation exhibited significant improvements in knowledge and attitudes related to hearing and hearing loss prevention. These improvements were maintained 3 months after the presentation. Seventh-grade students also experienced long-term improvements in their knowledge base. However, attitudes and intended behaviors in 7th graders returned to baseline levels 3 months postpresentation. Conclusion The Dangerous Decibels hearing loss prevention program was effective at producing long-term improvements in the knowledge base of 4th- and 7th-grade students. Future studies should include components on peer pressure and should incorporate repeated, multimodality interventions to increase the likelihood of long-term improvement in adolescents.",

Conclusions Over the past decade, numerous studies have converged to support the hypothesis that the DCN may be an important brain center in the generation and modulation of tinnitus. Although other auditory centers have been similarly implicated, the DCN deserves special emphasis because, as a primary acoustic nucleus, it occupies a potentially pivotal position in the hierarchy of functional processes leading to the emergence of tinnitus percepts. Moreover, because a great deal is known about the underlying cellular categories and the details of synaptic circuitry within the DCN, this brain center offers a potentially powerful model for probing mechanisms underlying tinnitus.",

This report presents a cross-language comparison of reference speech intelligibility functions for monaural headphone measurements with normal-hearing listeners. The same model function was employed to describe the speech intelligibility functions for all of the tests. Results Reference speech intelligibility functions of the new versions of the Digit Triplet Test and Matrix Test show high comparability to the HearCom tests. In order to achieve the highest possible comparability across languages, language- and speaker-dependent factors in speech intelligibility should be compensated for.

However, CMHL are a heterogeneous group, and the profile of at-risk children is unknown. Data regarding the characteristics of early school-age CMHL are needed to extend previous findings and determine potential risk factors associated with psychoeducational difficulties. Method Psychoeducational outcomes were evaluated at baseline and longitudinally in age-matched groups of 27 CMHL (ages 4–10 years) and 26 children with normal hearing (CNH) using assessments of language, reading, behavior, speech recognition in noise, and cognition. Additional analyses were used to identify demographic characteristics among CMHL that are associated with psychoeducational difficulties. Results At the earliest age tested, CMHL had greater teacher-rated attention difficulties in the classroom than CNH. Differences in the rate of psychoeducational development were not observed between groups. Among CMHL, psychoeducational difficulties were associated with delays in identification of hearing loss and low maternal education. Conclusions Classroom attention abilities should be monitored for early school-age CMHL. Late-identified CMHL and CMHL with low maternal education levels may be in particular need of academic and social support. Continued efforts for early identification of CMHL should be made to improve outcomes for these children.",

Articles meeting the selection criteria were critically appraised for quality.

Sensitivity and specificity were used to calculate positive and negative likelihood ratios that could be compared between instruments.Eighteen studies were included in the final analysis. There was considerable variability among studies on stimulus levels, response criteria, and definition of hearing loss. Approximately half of positive and negative likelihood ratio pairs for OAEs (52%) and pure-tone screening (45%) were considered suggestive or informative for identifying hearing loss.Both pure-tone and OAE screening can identify hearing loss in preschool- and school-age children. Studies that compared both tools in the same population concluded that pure-tone screening had higher sensitivity than OAE screening and thus was considered the preferred tool.

    "abstract": "Purpose The primary purposes of this study were to examine the effects of hearing loss and respondent type (self- vs. parent-proxy report) on subjective fatigue in children. We also examined associations between child-specific factors and fatigue ratings. Method Subjective fatigue was assessed using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Multidimensional Fatigue Scale (PedsQL-MFS; Varni, Burwinkle, Katz, Meeske, &amp; Dickinson, 2002). We compared self- and parent-proxy ratings from 60 children with hearing loss (CHL) and 43 children with normal hearing (CNH). The children ranged in age from 6 to 12 years. Results School-age CHL experienced more overall and cognitive fatigue than CNH, although the differences were smaller than previously reported. Parent-proxy report was not strongly associated with child self-report, and parents tended to underestimate their child's fatigue, particularly sleep/rest fatigue. Language ability was also associated with subjective fatigue. For CHL and CNH, as language abilities increased, cognitive fatigue decreased. Conclusions School-age CHL experience more subjective fatigue than CNH. The poor association between parent-proxy and child reports suggests that the parent-proxy version of the PedsQL-MFS should not be used in isolation when assessing fatigue in school-age children. Future research should examine how language abilities may modulate fatigue and its potential academic consequences in CHL.",

Audiologists around the world were surveyed on their attitudes toward teleaudiology and their willingness to use it.An online survey was sent to audiologists through professional associations' mailing lists. The survey included questions on the use of computer and video-conferencing technologies, awareness and previous use of teleaudiology, and willingness to use teleaudiology.Responses were provided by 269 people from 28 different countries, representing a wide cross-section of experience, qualification, and work settings; 77.8% of respondents were women. Almost all respondents had used PC-based video-conferencing; most had used related technologies and reported positive attitudes toward using these. However, less than 25% had used teleaudiology.Despite positive attitudes toward telehealth and associated technology, the low number of audiologists who have used teleaudiology for services indicates limited clinical adoption.",

Sentence recognition in quiet and in noise and subjective ratings were obtained in 3 conditions of wireless signal processing.Performance by the listeners with HI when using the adaptive digital technology was significantly better than that obtained with the FM technology, with the greatest benefits at the highest noise levels. The majority of listeners also preferred the digital technology when listening in a real-world noisy environment. The wireless technology allowed persons with HI to surpass persons with normal hearing in speech recognition in noise, with the greatest benefit occurring with adaptive digital technology.The use of adaptive digital technology combined with speechreading cues would allow persons with HI to engage in communication in environments that would have otherwise not been possible with traditional wireless technology.",

Post hoc explainability techniques were applied to highlight the role of each feature in predicting hearing loss.Random forest (accuracy = .85, sensitivity = .86, specificity = .85, precision = .84) performed, on average, better than decision tree (accuracy = .82, sensitivity = .84, specificity = .80, precision = .79). Support vector machine, logistic regression, and gradient boosting had similar performance as random forest. According to post hoc explainability analysis on models generated using random forest, the features with the highest relevance in predicting hearing loss were age, number and percentage of correct responses, and average reaction time, whereas the total test time had the lowest relevance.This study demonstrates that a multivariate approach can help detect hearing loss with satisfactory performance. Further research on a bigger sample and using more complex ML algorithms and explainability techniques is needed to fully investigate the role of input features (including additional features such as risk factors and individual responses to low-/high-frequency stimuli) in predicting hearing loss.",

The aim of this study was to perform a preliminary analysis comparing the scores for self-report questionnaires before and after audiologist-delivered CBT via video calls for adults with misophonia, hyperacusis, or tinnitus or a combination of these. Method: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study. The data for 37 consecutive patients who received CBT for misophonia, hyperacusis, or tinnitus from a private institute in the United Kingdom were analyzed. Self-report questionnaires taken as part of routine care were as follows: 4C Questionnaires for tinnitus, hyperacusis, and misophonia (4C-T, 4C-H, and 4C-M, respectively), Tinnitus Impact Questionnaire (TIQ), Hyperacusis Impact Questionnaire (HIQ), Misophonia Impact Questionnaire (MIQ), Sound Sensitivity Symptoms Questionnaire (SSSQ), and Screening for Anxiety and Depression in Tinnitus (SAD-T). Responses were also obtained to other questionnaires related to tinnitus, hyperacusis, insomnia, and anxiety and mood disorders. A linear mixed-model method was used to assess the changes in response to the questionnaires pretreatment and posttreatment. Results: Pretreatment–posttreatment comparisons showed that scores for the 4C-T, 4C-H, 4C-M, TIQ, HIQ, MIQ, SSSQ, and SAD-T improved, with effect sizes of 1.4, 1.2, 1.3, 2.6, 0.9, 0.7, 0.9, and 1.4, respectively (all p &lt; .05). Conclusions: This preliminary analysis suggests that CBT via video calls may be effective in reducing the impact of misophonia, hyperacusis, and tinnitus. However, this study did not have a control group, so its results need to be interpreted with caution.",

One way to improve the number of available audiologists is to improve retention. The purpose of this study was an exploration of audiologist attrition as a first step toward creating strategies to improve retention. Method: A survey completed by 47 former audiologists included questions about demographics, why participants entered and exited the audiology profession, and job satisfaction. Results: Participants cited lack of reward as the most common reason for leaving the profession. About a third disliked the for-profit hearing aid dispensing aspect of the profession, and a few would return to the profession for an audiology job that did not involve hearing aid dispensing. About a quarter left audiology to pursue other opportunities (e.g., selling a private practice), and about a quarter reported poor psychosocial work environment. Conclusion: Findings highlight the need for national efforts focused on (a) improving audiology awareness so students have a greater understanding of audiology as they are exploring career choices, (b) advocating for improved compensation overall and compensation models that de-emphasize sales-based financial incentives, and (c) creating strategies to help improve audiologists' work environment and opportunities for leadership roles.

Burkard ( Hearing Research, 127 , 86–94) investigated aging effects on auditory brainstem response (ABR) wave V latency using a tone-on-toneburst forward-masking paradigm. They found that at short forward-masking intervals, wave V latency shift was greater in normal-hearing older adults than in normal-hearing young adults for moderate level, high-frequency toneburst maskers and probes. It was not possible to evaluate wave I latency because stimulation and recording procedures did not produce a consistently observable wave I. In order to optimize the recording of wave I, the present study used a high-level (115 dB pSPL) click stimulus, combined with a tympanic membrane inverting electrode, and investigated the latencies and amplitudes of waves I and V across click rate. Young adults had hearing thresholds within normal limits, whereas older adults had normal hearing or mild threshold elevation. All data were collected and analyzed with a Nicolet Bravo. Using conventional recording procedures, ABRs were obtained at click rates of 11, 25, 50, and 75 Hz. Using maximum length sequences (MLSs), ABRs were obtained at 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 Hz. Results across age groups were very similar. With increasing click rate, peak latencies increased, the I–V interval increased and peak amplitudes decreased. The most notable difference between age groups was that wave I amplitude was substantially smaller in the older subjects. It appears that changes in the ABR with increasing rate are remarkably similar in young and older adults when audiometric thresholds are normal or near-normal in both age groups.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Otitis media is the most common condition diagnosed by pediatricians and is estimated to affect approximately 70% of the pediatric population. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of otoscopy and multifrequency tympanometry (MFT) for diagnosis of otitis media in children. Method: Twenty-one children, age 1 to 10 years, who were seeking medical treatment for suspected middle ear disease were selected to participate. Data were collected prior to myringotomy to determine the sensitivity and specificity rates of the following otologic and audiologic measures: (a) pneumatic otoscopy, (b) conventional tympanometry, and (c) MFT. For this study, the \"gold standard,\" myringotomy, was used along with pneumatic otoscopy to determine the effectiveness, sensitivity, and specificity of conventional 226-Hz tympanometry, 678-Hz tympanometry, and 1000-Hz tympanometry to predict middle ear disease. Results: The diagnoses provided with pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry were both similar, agreeing in diagnosis 80%–100% of the time. The diagnoses from 678-Hz and 1000-Hz tympanometry were nearly equal and proved to detect abnormality at a higher rate. Conclusions: MFT is recommended on a routine basis with children having a history of otitis media, or else abnormal or notched 226-Hz tympanograms. Further research with a larger sample size will illuminate the possible predictive potential of MFT in otitis media.",

    "abstract": "A central \"auditory\" processing disorder (CAPD) is an auditory perceptual dysfunction that cannot be explained on the basis of peripheral hearing loss. As a concept, CAPD has not been completely validated, and many issues continue to be controversial. A primary issue of concern is whether currently used tests to evaluate CAPD are sensitive to factors that are not of an auditory perceptual nature. In this paper, we consider the case for modality specificity as a criterion for improving the specificity of diagnosing CAPD. Demonstrating the modality-specific nature of sensory processing deficits is one way to rule out nonperceptual factors as explanations for observed dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "This response to A. T. Cacace and D. J. McFarland (2005) identifies points of agreement and disagreement regarding the concept of modularity in the diagnosis of (central) auditory processing disorder [(C)APD]. We concur that the evaluation of (C)APD must take into consideration the influence of higher order global or pansensory issues on performance on tests of central auditory function. To accomplish this goal, multidisciplinary (e.g., multimodal) testing is an integral part of differential diagnosis of (C)APD. We also agree that the efficiency of diagnostic tests of (C)APD should not be evaluated by imprecise criteria [e.g., \"presumed\" or \"suspected\" (C)APD], which do not provide accurate measures of the true sensitivity and specificity of these tests. Our conceptualization and recommendations for clinical practice in this area diverge, however, from that of Cacace and McFarland in a number of pivotal ways. Based on the current limitations of multimodal assessment relative to issues related to scope of practice and test efficiency, as well as the accumulated basic science and clinical literature that demonstrates the nonmodularity and interactive organization of the brain, we recommend use of the sensitized test battery of the central auditory nervous system (CANS) in combination with multidisciplinary testing to differentially diagnose (C)APD and to guide treatment of the disorder. We assert that sensitivity and specificity measures derived from individuals with well-circumscribed lesions of the CANS provide an important guide to establishing the validity of central auditory diagnostic tests. We note that researchers in the area of auditory science and (C)APD must acknowledge the challenges of the clinical arena, and we encourage their continued help to develop diagnostic tools that are both efficient and practical for the differential diagnosis of (C)APD. We conclude that our approach, which combines multidisciplinary evaluation and specific tests of central auditory function that have demonstrated sensitivity and specificity for disorders of the CANS, allows us to identify (and thus rehabilitate) the auditory deficits present in individuals with (C)APD in its \"purest\" form. It also permits the identification and rehabilitation of auditory deficits in individuals who exhibit auditory perceptual problems that coexist with other processing problems, while ruling out those who perform poorly on auditory tests because of a global, supramodal problem involving cognition, attention, language, memory, or related skills.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Tinnitus is the persistent perception of a subjective sound. Tinnitus is almost universally experienced in some forms. In most cases, recovery may occur in seconds, hours, or days. How does tinnitus shift from a transient condition to a lifelong disorder? Several lines of evidence, including clinical studies and animal models, indicate that the brain, rather than the inner ear, may in some cases be the site of maintenance of tinnitus. One hypothesis is that normal electrical activity in the auditory system becomes pathologically persistent due to plasticity-like mechanisms that can lead to long-term changes in the communication between neurons. A candidate site for the expression of this so-called synaptic plasticity is a region of the brainstem called the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), a site of integration of acoustic and multimodal, sensory inputs. Conclusions Here we review recent findings on cellular mechanisms observed in the DCN that can lead to long-term changes in the synaptic strength between different neurons in the DCN. These cellular mechanisms could provide candidate signaling pathways underlying the induction (ignition) and/or the expression (maintenance) of tinnitus.",

Method College students who were frequent MP3 player users ( N = 428) filled out a 30-item online survey. Specific areas probed by the present survey included frequency and duration of MP3 player use, MP3 player volume levels used, types of earphones used, typical environments in which MP3 player was worn, specific activities related to safety while listening to MP3 players, and attitudes toward MP3 player use. Results The majority of listeners wore MP3 players for less than 2 hr daily at safe volume levels. About one third of respondents reported being distracted while wearing an MP3 player, and more than one third of listeners experienced soreness in their ears after a listening session. About one third of respondents reported occasionally using their MP3 players at maximum volume levels. Listeners indicated willingness to (a) reduce volume levels, (b) decrease listening duration, and (c) buy specialized earphones to conserve their hearing. Conclusion The study found concerns regarding the occasional use of MP3 players at full volume and reduced environmental awareness among some college student users.",

    "abstract": "Purpose To determine whether specific sentence recognition assessments were sensitive enough to serve as objective outcome measurements that document subjective improvements in speech understanding with hearing aids. Method The Revised Speech Perception in Noise test (R-SPIN; R. C. Bilger, J. M. Nuetzel, W. M. Rabinowitz, &amp; C. Rzeczkowski, 1984), the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT; M. Nilsson, S. D. Soli, &amp; J. A. Sullivan, 1994), and the Quick Speech-in-Noise test (QuickSIN; Etymotic Research, 2001; M. C. Killion, P. A. Niquette, G. I. Gudmundsen, L. J. Revit, &amp; S. Banerjee, 2004) were administered to 21 hearing aid users to determine whether the tests could adequately document improvements in speech understanding with hearing aids compared with the research participants' self-assessments of their own performance. Comparisons were made between unaided and aided performance on these sentence tests and on the Hearing Aid Performance Inventory (HAPI; B. E. Walden, M. Demorest, &amp; E. Hepler, 1984). Results The R-SPIN, the HINT Quiet threshold, and the QuickSIN signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss were the most sensitive of the sentence recognition tests to objectively assess improvements in speech perception performance with hearing aids. Comparisons among the subjective and objective outcome measures documented that HAPI ratings improved as performance on the R-SPIN, the HINT Quiet threshold, and the QuickSIN SNR loss improved. Conclusions Objective documentation of subjective impressions is essential for determining the efficacy of treatment outcomes in hearing aid fitting. The findings reported here more clearly define the relationship between objective and subjective outcome measures in an attempt to better define true hearing aid benefit.",

Records were limited to those within 6 months of the soldier's return date from April 2003 through June 2009. To account for changes in STS coding practice, STS rates observed after October 1, 2006, were used to extrapolate prior probable postdeployment STS.Statistically significant increases were observed for tinnitus, dizziness, eardrum perforations, and speech-language disorders. The combination of observed and extrapolated STS yielded a conservative estimate of 27,427 cases.Estimates can be used to forecast resource requirements for hearing services among veterans. This article could serve as a guide for resourcing and innovating prevention measures and treatment in this population. Data provided may also serve as a baseline for evaluating prevention measures.",

Method The authors conducted a literature review regarding help seeking for hearing-related communication difficulties as well as for other chronic medical conditions.

The authors describe models relevant to understanding the help-seeking and decision-making behaviors of older adults with hearing loss and discuss recommendations for future research. Conclusion Because of the considerable overlap in factors associated with help-seeking behaviors across chronic medical conditions and because help-seeking behaviors are complex, help seeking should be examined within the framework of a multifactorial model, such as the health belief model or the transtheoretical stages of change model.",

The students interacted with 24 nursing home residents with dementia; specifically, the audiology students conducted 2 hearing evaluations with the residents, and the speech-language pathology students socialized with the residents during 15 visits. The students’ attitudes toward older adults with dementia were assessed using Kogan’s Attitudes Toward Old People Scale (Kogan, 1961) and qualitative analysis of their journal entries. The results were compared across groups over time. Results The SL groups showed more positive attitudes than the non-SL students, and their later journal entries were more positive than earlier entries. Conclusions This SL experience provided clinical opportunities for audiology and speech-language pathology students to work with adults with dementia. Direct contact with the residents resulted in more positive attitudes toward older adults in residential facilities.",

On the basis of the offered services, apps were classified into 4 application domains: (a) screening and assessment, (b) intervention and rehabilitation, (c) education and information, and (d) assistive tools. Conclusions A large variety of apps are available in the hearing health care domain. These cover a wide range of services for people with hearing or communication problems as well as for hearing professionals, families, or informal caregivers. This evolution can potentially bring along considerable advantages and improved outcomes in the field of hearing health care. Nevertheless, potential risks and threats (e.g., safety, quality, effectiveness, privacy, and regulation) should not be overlooked.

    "abstract": "Purpose The aim of this study was to determine if there are factors that can predict whether a child with hearing loss will also have vestibular loss. Method A retrospective chart review was completed on 186 children with hearing loss seen at Boys Town National Research Hospital for vestibular testing from 1999 to 2015 through neurosensory genetics clinic or cochlear implant candidacy. Each child's medical chart was reviewed to obtain the following data: vestibular loss severity (classified as normal, bilateral, or mild to moderate), degree of hearing loss (bilateral pure-tone average [PTA]), imaging abnormalities (classified as “normal” or “abnormal”), parental concerns for gross motor delay (classified as “yes, there is concern” or “no, there is not a concern”), parent report of age when their child sat (months) and walked independently (months), comorbidities (classified as “yes” if there were 1 or more comorbidities or “no” if there were no comorbidities), and score on the Developmental Profile-3. Results Children were grouped according to vestibular loss severity; 115 children had normal vestibular function, 31 had bilateral vestibular loss, and 40 had mild-to-moderate vestibular loss. As severity of vestibular loss increased, children (a) sat and walked later, (b) scored more poorly on the Developmental Profile-3 physical subscale, (c) had more severe hearing loss, (d) had parents who more frequently reported concern for gross motor delay, and (e) were more likely to have other comorbidities. Of these factors, age-to-sit, age-to-walk, PTA, and parental concerns for gross motor developmental delay had the greatest ability to differentiate children with vestibular loss from children with normal vestibular function. For age-to-sit, using a cutoff value of 7.25 months yielded a sensitivity of 62% and a specificity of 81%. For age-to-walk, a cutoff value of 14.5 months yielded a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 77%. For PTA for the neurosensory genetics group, a cutoff value of 40 dB yielded a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 55%; however, a cutoff value of 66 dB yielded a sensitivity of 33% and an improved specificity of 91%. Conclusions A referral for vestibular evaluation should be considered for children whose hearing loss is greater than 66 dB and particularly those who sit later than 7.25 months or walk later than 14.5 months or whose parents report concerns for gross motor development. Collectively, these factors appear to be more sensitive for identifying children with bilateral vestibular loss compared with children with mild-to-moderate vestibular loss. Because of the benefit of physical therapy, children identified with vestibular loss should then be referred to physical therapy for further evaluation and treatment.",

Method Readability levels were calculated using the Fry Graph adapted for Spanish, as well as the Fernandez-Huerta and the Spaulding formulae for several commonly used audiology- and otolaryngology-related PROMs. Results Readability calculations agreed with previous studies analyzing audiology-related PROMs in English and demonstrated many Spanish-language PROMs were beyond the 5th grade reading level suggested for health-related materials written for the average population. In addition, the functionalist versions of the PROMs yielded lower grade-level (improved) readability levels than the published versions. Conclusion Our results suggest many of the Spanish-language PROMs evaluated here are beyond the recommended readability levels and may be influenced by the approach to translation. Moreover, improved readability may be possible using a functionalist approach to translation.

Secondary aims were to identify any predictors of outcome and whether there were any unwanted events related to undertaking iCBT for tinnitus. Method Participants who had previously undertaken a randomized iCBT efficacy trial for tinnitus were invited to participate. Of the 146 who were initially randomized for the efficacy trial, 104 participants completed the 1-year postintervention assessment measures. The primary outcome was a change in tinnitus distress as assessed by the Tinnitus Functional Index. Secondary assessment measures were included for insomnia, anxiety, depression, hearing handicap, hyperacusis, cognitive failures, and satisfaction with life. An intention-to-treat analysis using repeated-measures analysis of variance and hierarchical multiple regression was used for statistical analysis. Unwanted effects were categorized according to the unwanted events checklist. Results Undertaking iCBT for tinnitus led to significant improvements 1 year postintervention for tinnitus and related difficulties, for example, insomnia, anxiety, depression, hearing handicap, hyperacusis, and life satisfaction. The best predictors of improving tinnitus severity at 1-year postintervention were greater baseline tinnitus severity scores, reading more of the modules, and higher satisfaction with the intervention. Unwanted events were reported by 11% of the participants and were more likely to be reported by women than men. These events were related to worsening of symptoms, the emergence of new symptoms, negative well-being, and prolongation of treatment. Conclusions The clinical benefits of audiologist-guided iCBT for tinnitus and tinnitus-related difficulties were sustained 1 year postintervention. Predictors of outcome indicated that the intervention is applicable to a wide range of participants regardless of their demographic backgrounds. Attempts should be made to minimize unwanted events in subsequent trials.",

Method This retrospective analysis examined receptive and expressive language outcomes at 3 years of age for 40 children with CIs. Multiple linear regression analyses were run with age at surgery and age at FTU as predictor variables. FTU definitions included 8 hr of device use and 80% of average waking hours for a typically developing child. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the establishment and degree of FTU. Results Although 8 hr of daily wear is typically considered FTU in the literature, the 80% hearing hours percentage metric accounts for more variability in outcomes. For both receptive and expressive language, age at FTU was found to be a better predictor of outcomes than age at surgery. It took an average of 17 months for children in this cohort to establish FTU, and only 52.5% reached this milestone by the time they were 3 years old. Conclusions Children with normal hearing can access spoken language whenever they are awake, and the amount of time young children are awake increases with age. A metric that incorporates the percentage of time that children with CIs have access to sound as compared to their same-aged peers with normal hearing accounts for more variability in outcomes than using an arbitrary number of hours. Although early FTU is not possible without surgery occurring at a young age, device placement does not guarantee use and does not predict language outcomes as well as age at FTU.",

A forced-choice, picture-pointing paradigm was selected for adaptively estimating masked speech reception thresholds. Speech stimuli were spoken by simultaneous bilingual Spanish-English talkers. The target stimuli were 30 disyllabic English and Spanish words, familiar to 5-year-olds and easily illustrated. Competing stimuli included either 2-talker English or 2-talker Spanish speech (corresponding to target language) and spectrally matched noise.For both groups of children, regardless of test language, performance was significantly worse for the 2-talker than for the noise masker condition. No difference in performance was found between bilingual and monolingual children. Bilingual children performed significantly better in English than in Spanish in competing speech. For all listening conditions, performance improved with increasing age.Results indicated that the stimuli and task were appropriate for speech recognition testing in both languages, providing a more conventional measure of speech-in-noise perception as well as a measure of complex listening. Further research is needed to determine performance for Spanish-dominant listeners and to evaluate the feasibility of implementation into routine clinical use.",

Thirteen hearing-aid users and 13 nonusers self-adjusted before and after taking a speech perception test incorporated into the software.All 26 participants were able to complete the 2 adjustments and the intervening test in an average of 6.5 min-20 of them from on-screen instructions without experimenter help. Relative to a generic starting condition, the average participant opted to increase overall output, reduce low-frequency cut, and increase high-frequency boost. The first and second self-selected values were highly correlated, but there was evidence of further increases of overall volume and high-frequency boost after speech perception testing with the initial adjustment. There was no evidence that prior hearing-aid experience affected the ability to understand or complete the self-fitting process.This approach to hearing-aid self-fitting can be a speedy, reliable, and feasible alternative to, or supplement to, conventional fitting procedures, but many questions remain to be answered.",

    "abstract": "Background Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a method to evaluate hearing aids in everyday life that uses repeated smartphone-based questionnaires to assess a situation as it happens. Although being ecologically valid and avoiding memory bias, this method may be prone to selection biases due to questionnaires being skipped or the phone not being carried along in certain situations. Purpose This investigation analyzed which situations are underrepresented in questionnaire responses and physically measured objective EMA data (e.g., sound level), and how such underrepresentation may depend on different triggers. Method In an EMA study, 20 subjects with hearing impairment provided daily information on reasons for missed data, that is, skipped questionnaires or missing connections between their phone and hearing aids. Results Participants often deliberately did not bring the study phone to social situations or skipped questionnaires because they considered it inappropriate, for example, during church service or when engaging in conversation. They answered fewer questions in conversations with multiple partners and were more likely to postpone questionnaires when not in quiet environments. Conclusion Data for social situations will likely be underrepresented in EMA. However, these situations are particularly important for the evaluation of hearing aids, as individuals with hearing impairment often have difficulties communicating in noisy situations. Thus, it is vital to optimize the design of the study to find a balance between avoiding memory bias and enabling subjects to report retrospectively on situations where phone usage may be difficult. The implications for several applications of EMA are discussed. Supplemental Material https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.12746849",

    "abstract": "Purpose Teleaudiology helps improve access to hearing health care by overcoming the geographic gap between providers and patients. In many teleaudiology encounters, a facilitator is needed at the patient site to help with hands-on aspects of procedures. The aim of this study was to review the scope and nature of research around patient-site facilitators in teleaudiology. We focused on identifying the facilitators' background, training, and responsibilities. Method To conduct this scoping review, we searched PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase. To be included, studies needed to address teleaudiology; be experimental/quasi-experimental, correlational/predictive, or descriptive; be published in English; and include the use of a facilitator at the patient location. Results A total of 82 studies met the inclusion criteria. The available literature described a number of different individuals in the role of the patient-site facilitator, including audiologists, students, and local aides. Fifty-seven unique tasks were identified, including orienting the client to the space, assisting with technology, and assisting with audiology procedures. The largest number of studies (n = 42) did not describe the facilitators' training. When reported, the facilitators' training was heterogenous in terms of who delivered the training, the length of the training, and the training content. Conclusions Across studies, the range of duties performed by patient-site facilitators indicates they may have an important role in teleaudiology. However, details are still needed surrounding their background, responsibilities, and training. Future research is warranted exploring the role of the patient-site facilitator, including their impact on teleaudiology service delivery.

    "abstract": "Purpose This retrospective study used a cochlear implant registry to determine how performing speech recognition candidacy testing in quiet versus noise influenced patient selection, speech recognition, and self-report outcomes. Method Database queries identified 1,611 cochlear implant recipients who were divided into three implant candidacy qualifying groups based on preoperative speech perception scores (≤ 40% correct) on the AzBio sentence test: quiet qualifying group, +10 dB SNR qualifying group, and +5 dB SNR qualifying group. These groups were evaluated for demographic and preoperative hearing characteristics. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare pre- and postoperative performance on the AzBio in quiet and noise with qualifying group as a between-subjects factor. For a subset of recipients, pre- to postoperative changes on the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale were also evaluated. Results Of the 1,611 patients identified as cochlear implant candidates, 63% of recipients qualified in quiet, 10% qualified in a +10 dB SNR, and 27% qualified in a +5 dB SNR. Postoperative speech perception scores in quiet and noise significantly improved for all qualifying groups. Across qualifying groups, the greatest speech perception improvements were observed when tested in the same qualifying listening condition. For a subset of patients, the total Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale ratings improved significantly as well. Conclusion Patients who qualified for cochlear implantation in quiet or background noise test conditions showed significant improvement in speech perception and quality of life scores, especially when the qualifying noise condition was used to track performance.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Tinnitus and hyperacusis are debilitating conditions often associated with age-, noise-, and drug-induced hearing loss. Because of their subjective nature, the neural mechanisms that give rise to tinnitus and hyperacusis are poorly understood. Over the past few decades, considerable progress has been made in deciphering the biological bases for these disorders using animal models. Method Important advances in understanding the biological bases of tinnitus and hyperacusis have come from studies in which tinnitus and hyperacusis are consistently induced with a high dose of salicylate, the active ingredient in aspirin. Results Salicylate induced a transient hearing loss characterized by a reduction in otoacoustic emissions, a moderate cochlear threshold shift, and a large reduction in the neural output of the cochlea. As the weak cochlear neural signals were relayed up the auditory pathway, they were progressively amplified so that the suprathreshold neural responses in the auditory cortex were much larger than normal. Excessive central gain (neural amplification), presumably resulting from diminished inhibition, is believed to contribute to hyperacusis and tinnitus. Salicylate also increased corticosterone stress hormone levels. Functional imaging studies indicated that salicylate increased spontaneous activity and enhanced functional connectivity between structures in the central auditory pathway and regions of the brain associated with arousal (reticular formation), emotion (amygdala), memory/spatial navigation (hippocampus), motor planning (cerebellum), and motor control (caudate/putamen). Conclusion These results suggest that tinnitus and hyperacusis arise from aberrant neural signaling in a complex neural network that includes both auditory and nonauditory structures.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Human studies of noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy using physiological indicators identified in animal models (auditory brainstem response [ABR] Wave I amplitude, envelope following response [EFR], and middle ear muscle reflex [MEMR]) have yielded mixed findings. Differences in the population studied may have contributed to the differing results. For example, due to differences in the intensity level of the noise exposure, noise-induced synaptopathy may be easier to detect in a military Veteran population than in populations with recreational noise exposure. We previously demonstrated a reduction in ABR Wave I amplitude and EFR magnitude for young Veterans with normal audiograms reporting high levels of noise exposure compared to non-Veteran controls. In this article, we expand on the previous analysis in the same population to determine if MEMR magnitude is similarly reduced. Method: Contralateral MEMR growth functions were obtained in 92 young Veterans and non-Veterans with normal audiograms, and the relationship between noise exposure history and MEMR magnitude was assessed. Associations between MEMR magnitude and distortion product otoacoustic emission, EFR, and ABR measurements collected in the same sample were also evaluated. Results: The results of the statistical analysis, although not conventionally statistically significant, suggest a reduction in mean MEMR magnitude for Veterans reporting high noise exposure compared with non-Veteran controls. In addition, the MEMR appears relatively insensitive to subclinical outer hair cell dysfunction, as measured by distortion product otoacoustic emissions, and is not well correlated with ABR and EFR measurements. Conclusions: When combined with our previous ABR and EFR findings in the same population, these results suggest that noise-induced synaptopathy occurs in humans. In addition, the findings indicate that the MEMR may be a good candidate for noninvasive diagnosis of cochlear synaptopathy/deafferentation and that the MEMR may reflect the integrity of different neural populations than the ABR and EFR.

    "abstract": "Background: Hearing loss poses a significant public health challenge as a common chronic condition with many known side effects that are often worse when left untreated. Aural rehabilitation (AR) is an umbrella term that encompasses a range of interventions (e.g., informational counseling and perceptual training) designed to reduce deficits related to hearing loss that may stand alone or be used in combination as part of a holistic plan. Purpose: This evidence-based clinical practice guideline is intended to inform the implementation of person-centered AR to adults with hearing loss. Given the well-known benefits of sensory management, it was not included within the scope of this guideline. The recommendations aim to help clinicians, individuals with hearing loss, and other stakeholders make evidence-informed treatment decisions and improve clinical outcomes, as well as provide payers and policymakers with information detailing a comprehensive approach to AR. Method: The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) and a multidisciplinary panel of subject matter experts prioritized key clinical questions and outcomes that served as the foundation of the guideline. The clinical recommendations were based on a comprehensive systematic review and a meta-analysis of 85 studies published between 1978 and 2021. Recommendations: Given the current state of the evidence, resource considerations, patient acceptability, clinical feasibility, and the overall balance of benefits and harms, ASHA developed several evidence-based recommendations for the provision of AR to adults with hearing loss. Each recommendation is accompanied by a series of key practice points to support its implementation within a person-centered framework.",

    "abstract": "Cochlear implant (CI) recipients with hearing preservation experience significant improvements in speech recognition with electric-acoustic stimulation (EAS) as compared to with a CI alone, although outcomes across EAS users vary. The individual differences in performance may be due in part to default mapping procedures, which result in electric frequency-to-place mismatches for the majority of EAS users. This study assessed the influence of electric mismatches on the early speech recognition for EAS users.Twenty-one participants were randomized at EAS activation to listen exclusively with a default or place-based map. For both groups, the unaided thresholds determined the acoustic cutoff frequency (i.e., > 65 dB HL). For default maps, the electric filter frequencies were assigned to avoid spectral gaps in frequency information but created varying magnitudes of mismatches. For place-based maps, the electric filter frequencies were assigned to avoid frequency-to-place mismatches. Recognition of consonant-nucleus-consonant words and vowels was assessed at activation and 1, 3, and 6 months postactivation.For participants with default maps, electric mismatch at 1500 Hz ranged from 2 to -12.0 semitones (Mdn = -5 semitones). Poorer performance was observed for those with larger magnitudes of electric mismatch. This effect was observed through 6 months of EAS listening experience.The present sample of EAS users experienced better initial performance when electric mismatches were small or eliminated. These data suggest the utility of methods that reduce electric mismatches, such as place-based mapping procedures. Investigation is ongoing to determine whether these differences persist with long-term EAS use.https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.22096523.",

Application of EMA in audiological research brings with it opportunities and challenges that differ from other research disciplines. This tutorial discusses important considerations when conducting EMA studies in hearing care. While more research is needed to develop specific guidelines for the various potential applications of EMA in hearing research, we hope this article can alert hearing researchers new to EMA to pitfalls when using EMA and help strengthen their study design. The current article elaborates study design details, such as choice of participants, representativeness of the study period for participants' lives, and balancing participant burden with data requirements. Mobile devices and sensors to collect objective data on the acoustic situation are reviewed alongside different possibilities for EMA setups ranging from online questionnaires paired with a timer to proprietary apps that also have access to parameters of a hearing device. In addition to considerations for survey design, a list of questionnaire items from previous studies is provided. For each item, an example and a list of references are given. EMA typically provides data sets that are rich but also challenging in that they are noisy, and there is often unequal amount of data between participants. After recommendations on how to check the data for compliance, reactivity, and careless responses, methods for statistical analysis on the individual level and on the group level are discussed including special methods for direct comparison of hearing device programs.",

To improve test accuracy, alternative stimuli were constructed by pairing familiar English digits. These digit pairs were used to measure SRT for 12 non-native speakers of English and 12 native speakers of English. Results indicate that digit pairs effectively measure SRT for both participant groups; and more importantly, for non-native speakers of English, digit pairs are more accurate than CID W-1 words in measuring the hearing threshold for speech. Digit-pairs have cross-linguistic appeal and should greatly facilitate accurate SRT testing for listeners with minimal exposure to English.",

Although agreeing with the general thrust of their attempts to exclude supramodal causes of impaired auditory performance as being labeled CAPD, I argue that this definition suffers from a number of serious deficiencies. It is both too loose and too restrictive, excluding what might be low-level deficits that occur in more than one modality, at the same time including at least one form of modality-specific linguistic processing. I argue that any useful definition of CAPD must not only exclude supramodal causes of auditory deficits, but must be based on the notion of impaired brain function demonstrable for nonspeech sounds.",

    "abstract": "Purpose A hallmark listening problem of individuals presenting with auditory processing disorder (APD) is their poor recognition of speech in noise. The underlying perceptual problem of the listening difficulties in unfavorable listening conditions is unknown. The objective of this article was to demonstrate theoretically how to determine whether the speech recognition problems are related to an auditory dysfunction, a language-based dysfunction, or a combination of both. Method Tests such as the Speech Perception in Noise (SPIN) test allow the exploration of the auditory and language-based functions involved in speech perception in noise, which is not possible with most other speech-in-noise tests. Psychometric functions illustrating results from hypothetical groups of individuals with APD on the SPIN test are presented. This approach makes it possible to postulate about the origin of the speech perception problems in noise. Conclusion APD is a complex and heterogeneous disorder for which the underlying deficit is currently unclear. Because of their design, SPIN-like tests can potentially be used to identify the nature of the deficits underlying problems with speech perception in noise for this population. A better understanding of the difficulties with speech perception in noise experienced by many listeners with APD should lead to more efficient intervention programs.",

Method A total of 555 children (6–12 years of age) from a rural and an urban school in the Shebin El-Kom District of Egypt were screened for HI at their schools. A 2-stage screening procedure was used, and positive cases were referred for a diagnostic hearing assessment at a regional medical facility. Risk factors were investigated through a parent questionnaire and an environmental study consisting of noise, ventilation, and crowding measurements at the schools. Results The screening failure rate was 25.6%, and the prevalence of confirmed HI was 20.9%. The rate of HI did not differ across the schools. Conductive hearing loss of minimal to mild severity was the most common type of HI. The most important predictors for HI were parent suspicion, otitis media, household smoking, low socioeconomic status, and postnatal jaundice. Conclusions The prevalence of HI did not differ across settings and was more common than reported in children from developed countries. The screening results also suggest that professionals with limited audiology background can be trained to implement hearing screening programs in Egyptian schools.",

Method Research spanning the past 6 decades reviewed for this article has both hypothesized and confirmed the cardiovascular system’s effects on the peripheral and central auditory systems. A review of the influence of the cardiovascular system is presented in this article, and a potential new avenue for auditory rehabilitation is postulated. The review presented in this article does not represent all studies conducted in the topic area but does provide an in-depth look into this fascinating area of research. Conclusions The negative influence of impaired cardiovascular health on both the peripheral and central auditory system and the potential positive influence of improved cardiovascular health on these same systems have been found through a sizable body of research that has been conducted over more than 6 decades. The most significant positive relationship between improved cardiovascular health and improvements in those auditory systems has been found among older adults. If that relationship continues to be confirmed, then a potential new avenue for auditory rehabilitation on behalf of adults who possess impaired auditory function may be discovered.",

The difference between the real ear insertion gain (REIG) and the NAL-NL1 target REIG was recorded. The initial fitting was considered acceptable if the difference was less than 10 dB at all frequencies. If an initial fitting was not acceptable, the frequency-gain response was modified. The difference between the final REIG and the NAL-NL1 target REIG was recorded as final target mismatch.Of the 51 initial fittings, 36 (71%) failed to achieve a match within ±10 dB of the NAL-NL1 insertion gain target at 1 or more frequencies between 0.25 and 4 kHz. After the authors adjusted the frequency-gain response of the hearing aids, only 9 fittings (18%) failed to achieve a match.These outcomes suggest that target insertion gains for the open-fit hearing aids used here are rarely achieved with a first fitting but can usually be achieved through adjustments based on REIG measurements.",

Results On the objective measures, adaptive FM processing resulted in significantly better speech recognition in noise than fixed FM processing for 68- and 73-dBA noise levels. On the subjective measures, all individuals preferred adaptive over fixed processing for half of the activities. Adaptive processing was also preferred by most (8–9) individuals for the remaining 4 activities.

Method The authors examined available LACE training data for 5 tasks (i.e., speech-in-babble, time compression, competing speaker, auditory memory, missing word) from 50 hearing-aid users who participated in a larger, randomized controlled trial designed to examine the efficacy of LACE training. The goals were to determine: (a) whether there were changes in performance over 20 training sessions on trained tasks (i.e., on-task outcomes); and (b) whether compliance, defined as completing all 20 sessions, vs. noncompliance, defined as completing less than 20 sessions, influenced performance on parallel untrained tasks (i.e., off-task outcomes). Results The majority, 84% of participants, completed 20 sessions, with maximum outcome occurring with at least 10 sessions of training for some tasks and up to 20 sessions of training for others. Comparison of baseline to posttest performance revealed statistically significant improvements for 4 of 7 off-task outcome measures for the compliant group, with at least small (0.2 &lt; d &lt; 0.3) Cohen's d effect sizes for 3 of the 4. There were no statistically significant improvements observed for the noncompliant group. Conclusion The high level of compliance in the present study may be attributable to use of systematized verbal and written instructions with telephone follow-up. Compliance, as expected, appears important for optimizing the outcomes of auditory training. Methods to improve compliance in clinical populations need to be developed, and compliance data are important to report in future studies of auditory training.",

Pre- and postoperative assessments were performed per typical clinic routines with modifications described. Postimplant habilitation was customized for each recipient using a combination of traditional methods, newer technologies, and commercial materials.The 5 children included in this report are consistent users of their cochlear implants and demonstrate speech recognition in the implanted ear when isolated from the better hearing ear.Candidacy criteria for cochlear implantation are evolving. Children with single-sided deafness or asymmetric hearing loss who have traditionally not been considered candidates for cochlear implantation should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Audiological management of these recipients is not vastly different compared with children who are traditional cochlear implant recipients. Assessment and habilitation techniques must be modified to isolate the implanted ear to obtain accurate results and to provide meaningful therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "The smartphone digits-in-noise hearing test, called hearZA, was made available as a self-test in South Africa in March 2016. This study determined characteristics and test performance of the listeners who took the test.A retrospective analysis of 24,072 persons who completed a test between March 2016 and August 2017 was conducted. User characteristics, including age, English-speaking competence, and self-reported hearing difficulty, were analyzed. Regression analyses were conducted to determine predictors of the speech reception threshold.Overall referral rate of the hearZA test was 22.4%, and 37% of these reported a known hearing difficulty. Age distributions showed that 33.2% of listeners were ages 30 years and younger, 40.5% were between ages 31 and 50 years, and 26.4% were older than 50 years. Age, self-reported English-speaking competence, and self-reported hearing difficulty were significant predictors of the speech reception threshold.High test uptake, particularly among younger users, and high overall referral rate indicates that the hearZA app addresses a public health need. The test also reaches target audiences, including those with self-reported hearing difficulty and those with normal hearing who should monitor their hearing ability.",

The HA-related community used social media sources for advice and support, information sharing, and service-related information. Conclusions HA users, other individuals, and organizations interested in HAs leave their digital footprint on a wide variety of social media sources. The community connects, offers support, and shares information on a variety of HA-related issues.

Participants underwent aided testing using 3 PSAPs and a traditional hearing aid, as well as unaided testing. PSAPs were adjusted based on participant preference, whereas the hearing aid was configured using best-practice verification protocols. Audibility provided by the devices was quantified using the Speech Intelligibility Index (American National Standards Institute, 2012). Outcome measures assessing speech recognition, listening effort, and sound quality were administered in ecologically relevant laboratory conditions designed to represent real-world speech listening situations.All devices significantly improved Speech Intelligibility Index compared to unaided listening, with the hearing aid providing more audibility than all PSAPs. Results further revealed that, in general, the hearing aid improved speech recognition performance and reduced listening effort significantly more than all PSAPs. Few differences in sound quality were observed between devices. All PSAPs improved speech recognition and listening effort compared to unaided testing.Hearing aids fitted using best-practice verification protocols were capable of providing more aided audibility, better speech recognition performance, and lower listening effort compared to the PSAPs tested in the current study. Differences in sound quality between the devices were minimal. However, because all PSAPs tested in the study significantly improved participants' speech recognition performance and reduced listening effort compared to unaided listening, PSAPs could serve as a budget-friendly option for those who cannot afford traditional amplification.",

Predictive validity data are presented for the first 100 Noise Outcomes in Servicemembers Epidemiology Study participants. Method The Tinnitus Screener was administered to participants by telephone. In lieu of a gold standard for determining tinnitus presence, the predictive validity of the tinnitus category assigned to participants on the basis of the Screener results was assessed when the participants attended audiologic testing. Results Of the 100 participants, 67 screened positive for intermittent or constant tinnitus. Three were categorized as “temporary” tinnitus only, and 30 were categorized as “no tinnitus.” Tinnitus categorization was predictively valid with 96 of the 100 participants. Conclusions These results provide preliminary evidence that the Screener may be suitable for quickly determining essential parameters of reported tinnitus. We have since revised the instrument to differentiate acute from chronic tinnitus and to identify occasional tinnitus. We are also obtaining measures that will enable assessment of its test-retest reliability.",

In addition, the study aimed to compare the reliability of the Virtual system with a previously established bucket test of SVV. Study Design Fifteen participants with normal hearing, normal middle ear function, and normal utricular function were included in the study. Each participant underwent static SVV testing using both the Virtual system and the bucket test. Subjects completed 2 testing sessions to determine test–retest reliability. For each test, data were collected with the head at 0°, tilted 45° to the right, and tilted 45° to the left. Setting This study was conducted in a balance function laboratory embedded in a large, tertiary care otology clinic. Results The mean SVV values obtained with the Virtual system were within 1°–2° from 0 with the head positioned at 0°, which is in agreement with many other studies of SVV with the head at 0° (Akin &amp; Murnane, 2009; Halmagyi &amp; Curthoys, 1999; Zwergal, Rettinger, Frenzel, Dieterich, &amp; Strupp, 2009). Using the intraclass correlation coefficient, test–retest reliability of the Virtual system was excellent in the 45° left position and fair to good in the 45° right and 0° position. Test–retest reliability of the bucket test was poor in all head positions. Conclusions The Virtual system is a more reliable measure of static SVV than the bucket test. Therefore, the Virtual system could be utilized as a screening device for utricular dysfunction in busy clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Purpose To evaluate the test–retest reliability of a headphone-based spatial release from a masking task with two maskers (referred to here as the SR2) and to describe its relationship to the same test done over loudspeakers in an anechoic chamber (the SR2A). We explore what thresholds tell us about certain populations (such as older individuals or individuals with hearing impairment) and discuss how the SR2 might be useful in the clinic. Method Fifty-four participants completed speech intelligibility tests in which a target phrase and two masking phrases from the Coordinate Response Measure corpus (Bolia, Nelson, Ericson, &amp; Simpson, 2000) were presented either via earphones using a virtual spatial array or via loudspeakers in an anechoic chamber. For the SR2, the target sentence was always at 0° azimuth angle, and the maskers were either colocated at 0° or positioned at ± 45°. For the SR2A, the target was located at 0°, and the maskers were colocated or located at ± 15°, ± 30°, ± 45°, ± 90°, or ± 135°. Spatial release from masking was determined as the difference between thresholds in the colocated condition and each spatially separated condition. All participants completed the SR2 at least twice, and 29 of the individuals who completed the SR2 at least twice also participated in the SR2A. In a second experiment, 40 participants completed the SR2 8 times, and the changes in performance were evaluated as a function of test repetition. Results Mean thresholds were slightly better on the SR2 after the first repetition but were consistent across 8 subsequent testing sessions. Performance was consistent for the SR2A, regardless of the number of times testing was repeated. The SR2, which simulates 45° separations of target and maskers, produced spatially separated thresholds that were similar to thresholds obtained with 30° of separation in the anechoic chamber. Over headphones and in the anechoic chamber, pure-tone average was a strong predictor of spatial release, whereas age only reached significance for colocated conditions. Conclusions The SR2 is a reliable and effective method of testing spatial release from masking, suitable for screening abnormal listening abilities and for tracking rehabilitation over time. Future work should focus on developing and validating rapid, automated testing to identify the ability of listeners to benefit from high-frequency amplification, smaller spatial separations, and larger spectral differences among talkers.",

    "abstract": "Objectives There were 2 main objectives. The primary objective was to replicate a prior clinical trial of a consumer-decides (CD) approach to selecting hearing aids in older adults as a potential model for over-the-counter (OTC) intervention using less front-end screening of participants and a wider range of frequency-gain characteristics in the devices. The 2nd objective, only feasible if participant choices allowed, was to evaluate the efficacy of the CD approach relative to a CD-based placebo device. Design The design of this study is a single-site, prospective, double-blind clinical trial. Outcome measures were obtained after a typical 4- to 5-week trial period. An optional follow-up of a 4-week audiology-based (AB) best practices trial was also included for replication and comparison purposes. Setting Older adults from the general community were recruited via newspaper and community flyers to participate at a university research clinic. Participants Participants were adults, aged 54-78 years, with mild-moderate hearing loss. Forty-one participants enrolled as a volunteer sample; 40 completed the intervention. Intervention(s) All participants received the same high-end digital mini-behind-the-ear hearing aids fitted bilaterally. CD participants self-selected their own preprogrammed hearing aids via an OTC-type model. One of the 3 devices from which participants could choose was programmed to be a placebo device with no functional gain. Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure is the 66-item self-report Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit ( Cox & Alexander, 1990 ). The secondary outcome measure is the Connected Speech Test ( Cox, Alexander, & Gilmore, 1987 ) benefit. Additional measures of hearing aid benefit and usage were also obtained. Results Per-protocol analyses based on the data from the 40 (of 41) participants who completed the study were performed. Hearing aid outcomes from this follow-up CD (CD2) cohort were positive and generally the same as for the original CD cohort. CD service delivery model was efficacious relative to CD-based placebo control, with medium effect sizes observed. Approximately half of the CD2 group was likely to purchase hearing aids after the trial, similar to findings for the original CD cohort. Outcomes improved significantly for the 32 CD2 participants who elected to complete the optional 4-week AB trial. For this largely unscreened sample, more individuals with healthy hearing sought amplification, and many of these individuals (35%) chose placebo devices for both ears. Conclusions Prior positive outcomes for CD service delivery have been replicated in a less restrictive approach to participant recruitment. The CD approach was again found to be efficacious. Significantly better outcomes were observed after subsequent AB service delivery follow-up, also replicating prior findings. Efficacious OTC models, including those using similar CD approaches to hearing aid self-selection, may increase accessibility and affordability of hearing aids for millions of older adults. Front-end guidance to consumers regarding the best path to intervention, ranging from self-screening of hearing online to a full audiologic assessment, appears to be critical to optimize the success of OTC approaches.

This hospital is not a birthing hospital. Therefore, the first recommendation (hearing screen by 1 month of age) was not evaluated. Method One hundred forty-one auditory evoked potential evaluations for infants under the age of 6 months were reviewed for this study. Data were only gathered for infants identified with a bilateral hearing loss ( n = 34). The following was recorded: degree of hearing loss, number of diagnostic sessions over time, the percentage of infants who transitioned to hearing aid fittings, and the age at which JCIH benchmarks were accomplished. Results Sixty-two percent of infants were diagnosed with hearing loss by 3 months of age, 48% of infants were fitted with hearing aids by 4 months of age, and the average age of infants enrolled in early intervention was 4.58 months. Seventy percent of infants were fitted within 1 month of the diagnosis of hearing loss. The identified variables that led to the hearing aids being fitted greater than 1 month after the diagnosis are as follows: cancellations/missed appointments, middle ear involvement, and mild hearing loss. Conclusions Results of this internal audit revealed opportunities for growth in better meeting and exceeding JCIH recommendations of diagnosis by 3 months of age and hearing aid fitting within 1 month of diagnosis. Adjustments in the scheduling process and appointment options have been implemented in response to these results. Additional examination of why these recommendations are not being met and what can be done to achieve them is needed.",

Studies that utilized chirp stimuli within the pediatric population that met all of the inclusion criteria were included in this review. Qualitative synthesis and interpretation of the data were completed.Seven studies that met the inclusion criteria were included in the review. Chirp stimuli produce auditory brainstem response (ABR) waveform amplitudes in children similar to those in adults when presented at moderate to low frequency levels. Latency data from chirp stimuli are not consistent when stimulus presentation rates are altered. Test-retest reliability when using the chirp stimulus was found to be good, as were sensitivity and specificity of chirp-evoked ABRs utilized in a newborn hearing screening protocol.Reviewed studies indicated that when presented at 60 dB nHL or lower, broadband chirp-generated ABRs have larger amplitudes than click-generated ABRs in children with normal hearing. Utilization of chirp stimuli decreases test time because waveforms are easier to detect with increased synchronization. Further research should focus on correlating chirp thresholds with behavioral hearing thresholds. Given the variance of results in these select studies, future research should also evaluate latency findings and focus on developing normative data for infants with hearing impairment and normal hearing.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Teleaudiology helps connect patients in rural and underresourced areas to hearing health care providers, minimizing the barrier of geography (Swanepoel et al., 2010). In the United States, teleaudiology is at the initial stages of implementation (Bush, Thompson, Irungu, &amp; Ayugi, 2016). Telehealth researchers recommend conducting a comprehensive planning assessment to optimize implementation and adoption (AlDossary, Martin-Khan, Bradford, Armfield, &amp; Smith, 2017; Alverson et al., 2008; Krupinski, 2015). A geographic analysis of the hearing aid dispensing workforce served as the initial stage of a teleaudiology planning assessment in Arizona. Method The analysis used publically available data sets from the U.S. Census, Arizona Department of Health Services, and the U.S. Veterans Administration. Geographic information system tools were used to analyze and visually represent population, potential teleaudiology site data, and hearing aid dispensing workforce (defined as audiologists and hearing instrument specialists licensed to dispense hearing aids in Arizona). ArcGIS was used to generate road networks and travel distance estimations. Results The number of audiologists per county ranged from 0 to 216 (average 22.1). Six out of Arizona's 15 counties lacked a single audiologist, and 2 counties lacked a hearing instrument specialist. Potential expansion sites for teleaudiology were located in areas of the state that lacked practice locations for hearing aid services. Conclusions There are geographic areas of Arizona that lack licensed hearing aid locations yet are populated by individuals who may need services. Resource availability data inform teleaudiology program expansion. Future research will include data from providers and community members on their perceived needs for services.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Tinnitus is prevalent among military Veterans and may frequently co-occur with mental health disorders. This study examined health care utilization and mental health diagnoses among Veterans with and without tinnitus who receive Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care. Method We randomly sampled 10% of VA health care users for a 5-year period between 2011 and 2016. Tinnitus and other diagnoses were identified using International Classification of Diseases diagnosis codes; Veterans assigned 1 or more inpatient codes or 2 or more outpatient codes were considered to have the respective diagnosis. We examined demographics, military service, clinical characteristics, and health care utilization of Veterans with and without tinnitus diagnoses. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate associations between tinnitus and mental health diagnoses of interest. Results Among 617,534 eligible Veterans, 3.8% met criteria for tinnitus diagnosis. Prevalence of tinnitus was associated with sex, age, race, marital status, and VA service connection status; additionally, hearing loss and traumatic brain injury were frequently codiagnosed with tinnitus. Veterans with tinnitus had higher annual health care utilization than those without. While controlling for potential confounders, tinnitus diagnoses were associated with mental health diagnoses, including anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders. Conclusion Findings suggest that Veterans who are diagnosed with tinnitus have more health care utilization and are more frequently diagnosed with mental health disorders than Veterans who are not diagnosed with tinnitus. This suggests a need for coordinated tinnitus and mental health care services for Veterans in the VA system of care.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Complaints of auditory perceptual deficits, such as tinnitus and difficulty understanding speech in background noise, among individuals with clinically normal audiograms present a perplexing problem for audiologists. One potential explanation for these “hidden” auditory deficits is loss of the synaptic connections between the inner hair cells and their afferent auditory nerve fiber targets, a condition that has been termed cochlear synaptopathy . In animal models, cochlear synaptopathy can occur due to aging or exposure to noise or ototoxic drugs and is associated with reduced auditory brainstem response (ABR) wave I amplitudes. Decreased ABR wave I amplitudes have been demonstrated among young military Veterans and non-Veterans with a history of firearm use, suggesting that humans may also experience noise-induced synaptopathy. However, the downstream consequences of synaptopathy are unclear. Method To investigate how noise-induced reductions in wave I amplitude impact the central auditory system, the ABR, the middle latency response (MLR), and the late latency response (LLR) were measured in 65 young Veterans and non-Veterans with normal audiograms. Results In response to a click stimulus, the MLR was weaker for Veterans compared to non-Veterans, but the LLR was not reduced. In addition, low ABR wave I amplitudes were associated with a reduced MLR, but with an increased LLR. Notably, Veterans reporting tinnitus showed the largest mean LLRs. Conclusions These findings indicate that decreased peripheral auditory input leads to compensatory gain in the central auditory system, even among individuals with normal audiograms, and may impact auditory perception. This pattern of reduced MLR, but not LLR, was observed among Veterans even after statistical adjustment for sex and distortion product otoacoustic emission differences, suggesting that synaptic loss plays a role in the observed central gain.

This study provides a preliminary investigation into the current knowledge, beliefs, and practices of Australian audiologists in addressing the emotional and mental health needs of adults with hearing loss. Method A 22-item survey using open- and closed-ended questions was completed by 95 Australian audiologists using a cross-sectional study design. Results Two thirds of audiologists described being underconfident and lacking the skills required to provide emotional support to people with hearing loss. Barriers to delivering emotional support included feeling out of their depth (56.6%), time/caseload pressures (55.3%), and the perception that the provision of emotional support was not within an audiologist's scope of practice (31.6%). Audiologists described a desire to refer clients to mental health professionals yet highlighted significant barriers, including not knowing who to refer to (54.7%), when to make a referral (49.3%), or how to make a referral (38.6%). Audiologists overwhelmingly (96%) indicated that they would like to develop their knowledge and skills associated with the provision of emotional and mental health support in the audiological setting.

    "abstract": "Objective Although tinnitus is one of the most commonly reported symptoms in the general population, patients with bothersome tinnitus are challenged by issues related to accessibility of care and intervention options that lack strong evidence to support their use. Therefore, creative ways of delivering evidence-based interventions are necessary. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) demonstrates potential as a means of delivering this support but is not currently available in the United States. This article discusses the adaptation of an ICBT intervention, originally used in Sweden, Germany, and the United Kingdom, for delivery in the United States. The aim of this study was to (a) modify the web platform's features to suit a U.S. population, (b) adapt its functionality to comply with regulatory aspects, and (c) evaluate the credibility and acceptability of the ICBT intervention from the perspective of health care professionals and patients with bothersome tinnitus. Materials/Method Initially, the iTerapi ePlatform developed in Sweden was adopted for use in the United States. Functional adaptations followed to ensure that the platform's functional and security features complied with both institutional and governmental regulations and that it was suitable for a U.S. population. Following these adaptations, credibility and acceptance of the materials were evaluated by both health care professionals ( n = 11) and patients with bothersome tinnitus ( n = 8). Results Software safety and compliance regulatory assessments were met. Health care professionals and patients reported favorable acceptance and satisfaction ratings regarding the content, suitability, presentation, usability, and exercises provided in the ICBT platform. Modifications to the features and functionality of the platform were made according to user feedback. Conclusions Ensuring that the ePlatform employed the appropriate features and functionalities for the intended population was essential to developing the Internet-based interventions. The favorable user evaluations indicated that the intervention materials were appropriate for the tinnitus population in the United States.",

    "abstract": "Background Patients often report that living with a condition such as tinnitus can be debilitating, worrying, and frustrating. Efficient ways to foster management strategies for individuals with tinnitus and promoting tinnitus self-efficacy are needed. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) for tinnitus shows promise as an evidence-based intervention in Europe, but is not available in the United States. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of an ICBT intervention for tinnitus in the United States. Method This study reports the Phase 1 trial intended to support implementation of a larger randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing ICBT to a weekly monitoring group. As a pilot study, a single-group pretest-posttest design was used to determine outcome potential, recruitment strategy, retention, and adherence rates of ICBT for tinnitus. The primary outcome was a change in tinnitus distress. Secondary outcome measures included measures of anxiety, depression, insomnia, tinnitus cognitions, hearing-related difficulties, and quality of life. Results Of the 42 screened participants, nine did not meet the inclusion criteria and six withdrew. There were 27 participants who completed the intervention, with a mean age of 55.48 (± 9.9) years. Feasibility was established, as a large pretest-posttest effect size of d = 1.6 was found for tinnitus severity. Large pretest-posttest effect sizes were also found for tinnitus cognitions and hearing-related effects, and a medium effect was found for insomnia and quality of life. Treatment adherence varied with a retention rate of 85% (n = 23) at post-intervention assessment and 67% (n = 18) for the follow-up assessment. Conclusions This pilot study supported the feasibility of ICBT for tinnitus in the United States. Ways of improving intervention retention and recruitment rates need to be explored in future ICBT studies. Protocol refinements that were identified will be implemented prior to further RCTs to investigate the efficacy of ICBT for tinnitus in the United States.

Case reports and retrospective studies have indicated that a cochlear implant (CI) may improve masked speech recognition in children with SSD. This prospective study was conducted to determine whether providing a CI to children with SSD supports spatial release from masking (SRM), an improvement in speech recognition associated with separating the target and masker sources. Method Twenty children with at least a moderate-to-profound hearing loss in one ear and normal hearing in the contralateral ear underwent cochlear implantation. The average age of implantation was 5.5 years (range: 3.5-12.7). After 12 months of CI use, subjects completed a sentence recognition task in multitalker masker with and without the CI. The target was presented from the front, and the masker was either colocated with the target (0°) or from the side (+90° or -90°). A two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was completed to investigate SRM with and without the CI. Results Pediatric CI recipients experienced significant SRM when the masker was directed to the normal-hearing ear or to the affected ear. Conclusions The results indicate that cochlear implantation in children with SSD supports binaural skills required for speech recognition in noise. These results are consistent with improved functional communication in multisource environments, like classrooms.",

    "abstract": "Cochlear implant (CI) recipients demonstrate variable speech recognition when listening with a CI-alone or electric-acoustic stimulation (EAS) device, which may be due in part to electric frequency-to-place mismatches created by the default mapping procedures. Performance may be improved if the filter frequencies are aligned with the cochlear place frequencies, known as place-based mapping. Performance with default maps versus an experimental place-based map was compared for participants with normal hearing when listening to CI-alone or EAS simulations to observe potential outcomes prior to initiating an investigation with CI recipients.A noise vocoder simulated CI-alone and EAS devices, mapped with default or place-based procedures. The simulations were based on an actual 24-mm electrode array recipient, whose insertion angles for each electrode contact were used to estimate the respective cochlear place frequency. The default maps used the filter frequencies assigned by the clinical software. The filter frequencies for the place-based maps aligned with the cochlear place frequencies for individual contacts in the low- to mid-frequency cochlear region. For the EAS simulations, low-frequency acoustic information was filtered to simulate aided low-frequency audibility. Performance was evaluated for the AzBio sentences presented in a 10-talker masker at +5 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), +10 dB SNR, and asymptote.Performance was better with the place-based maps as compared with the default maps for both CI-alone and EAS simulations. For instance, median performance at +10 dB SNR for the CI-alone simulation was 57% correct for the place-based map and 20% for the default map. For the EAS simulation, those values were 59% and 37% correct. Adding acoustic low-frequency information resulted in a similar benefit for both maps.Reducing frequency-to-place mismatches, such as with the experimental place-based mapping procedure, produces a greater benefit in speech recognition than maximizing bandwidth for CI-alone and EAS simulations. Ongoing work is evaluating the initial and long-term performance benefits in CI-alone and EAS users.https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.19529053.",

Method: This is a comprehensive narrative literature review of cultural constructs, hearing health disparities, and SDoH as they relate to the CDC EHDI HSFS data. We explore the maternal demographic data reported on the CDC EHDI website and report disparities for maternal age, education, ethnicity, and race for 2016, 2017, and 2018. We focus on LTF/D for screening and diagnosis within the context of racial and cultural bias. Results: A literature review demonstrates the increase in quality of the CDC EHDI HSFS data over the past 2 decades. LTF/D rates for hearing screening and audiologic diagnostic testing have improved from higher than 60% to current rates of less than 30%. Comparisons of diagnostic completion rates reported on the CDC website for the EHDI HSFS 2016, 2017, and 2018 data show trends for maternal age, education, and race, but not for ethnicity. Trends were defined as changes more than 10% for variables averaged over a 3-year period (2016–2018). Conclusions: Although there have been significant improvements in LTF/D over the past 2 decades, there continue to be opportunities for further improvement. Beyond neonatal screening, delays continue to be reported in the diagnosis of young children with hearing loss. Notwithstanding the extraordinarily diverse families within the United States, the imperative is to minimize such delays so that all children with hearing loss can, at the very least, have auditory accessibility to spoken language by 3 months of age. Conscious awareness is essential before developing a potentially effective plan of action that might remediate the problem.",

Method: A systematic review of qualitative and quantitative peer-reviewed literature published between 2000 and 2023 was conducted. The PICO mnemonic (where P = population, I = intervention, C = comparison, and O = outcomes) was used to frame the clinical question and generate search terms. Search strategies were executed in seven databases. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were used to track the peer-reviewed literature identification and selection process. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklists and Levels of Evidence were used to characterize the research studies. Results: A total of 668 records were identified. Nineteen peer-reviewed publications met the inclusion criteria. Diverse study designs, interventions, assessment techniques, and simulation types were identified. Characteristics of included studies (e.g., author, year, study purpose) were reported by evidence tables. Primary and secondary outcomes were identified and described. Results indicate statistical and/or clinically significant improvements in knowledge, skills, and/or self-confidence following simulation training. Each study was critically appraised, and the level, quality, and strength were assigned. Conclusions: The use of simulation as an educational method among audiology students has been shown to dramatically increase knowledge, skills, and self-confidence. However, the use of simulation in audiology education is still behind compared to other health professions. As a result, there are a limited number of simulation-based studies in audiology. Most health academic institutions have well-designed simulation centers; therefore, audiology programs are urged to collaborate with colleagues in other professions and benefit from the services offered by these facilities.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Unilateral cochlear implant (CI) recipients with limited hearing in the contralateral ear are deprived of the advantages of binaural hearing. To address speech recognition challenges arising from the head shadow effect, a contralateral routing of signal (CROS) device can be used; however, less is known of the broader impact of a CROS device on an individual's quality of life (QoL) or that of their frequent communication partners (FCPs). This preliminary study aimed to evaluate the impact of CROS on speech recognition in noise and its influence on the QoL of unilateral CI recipients and their FCPs. Method: This preliminary study enrolled seven adult unilateral CI recipients and their FCPs. All CI recipients were fitted with CROS devices during their initial appointments. Speech recognition testing was conducted in noise with and without the CROS device in a sound booth before a take-home trial. Participants used the CROS devices for approximately 1 year, with device fitting occurring before and continuing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants completed two QoL questionnaires, the Auditory Performance and Satisfaction Scale for Single-Sided Deafness (APS-SSD) and the Nijmegen Cochlear Implant Questionnaire (NCIQ), twice: once prior to CROS device use and once after the take-home trial. Additionally, the FCPs of each CI recipient completed the Significant Other Scale of Hearing Disability (SOS-HEAR) Questionnaire twice, once before and once after extended CROS device use. Results: When noise was directed toward the CI ear and speech toward the non-CI ear, speech recognition improved by 32% with the CROS device ( p = .001). CI recipients reported significant median improvement in the “general” domain of the APS-SSD after the take-home trial (Wilcoxon Z = 12.0, p &lt; .05). FCPs reported a significant median reduction in concerns related to their partner's hearing when the CI recipient used the CROS device (Wilcoxon Z = 2.0, p &lt; .05). Conclusions: This preliminary study demonstrates the benefit of CROS devices for unilateral CI recipients in noisy environments. Additionally, it highlights the positive impact of CROS devices on the QoL of both CI recipients and their FCPs. These findings emphasize the importance of considering CROS devices as a valuable solution for unilateral CI recipients to enhance their hearing experience, overall well-being, and that of their FCPs.",

Method: Nineteen participants completed pitch similarity ratings in the laboratory and at home. All participants first completed laboratory tests (at 500–16000 Hz) and then later completed at-home tests (at 250–8000 Hz) using their own personal computers and headphones. Six participants repeated these measurements after at least 3 weeks. Results: Tinnitus spectra (plots of pitch similarity rating vs. frequency) were analyzed using linear regression and Bland–Altman plots for frequencies that were common to both environments (500–8000 Hz). Although the Bland–Altman plots indicated that absolute ratings used by participants differed in the two settings with online ratings tending to be higher than lab ratings, the regression analysis indicated that the tinnitus spectra had similar shapes (evidenced by significantly positive slopes) between the two environments for 14 of the 19 participants. Similar results were evident for test–retest reliability of the six returning participants in both settings. Conclusions: We conclude that the pitch similarity rating method is potentially viable for measuring tinnitus pitch at home. At-home implementation could expedite clinical tinnitus assessments and could be used in conjunction with at-home implementations of tinnitus treatment strategies.

Method: Fifteen children and fifteen adults with hearing thresholds below 15 dB HL were considered for the study. Ipsilateral 500-Hz narrow-band chirp (NB CE-chirp) evoked mVEMP responses were elicited via a zygomatic montage through both air- and bone-conduction modes of stimulation. Therefore, the recorded responses were analyzed for various mVEMP parameters, namely, absolute P11 and N21 peak latencies, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the P11–N21 complex, and the interaural asymmetry ratio. Results: NB CE-chirp–evoked mVEMPs were 100% present at 500 Hz using both air- and bone-conduction modes of stimulation. No significant differences were found in mVEMP parameters between ears, genders, or modes of stimulation in both children and adults. However, a significant P11–N21 amplitude difference was observed between the two groups. Conclusion: The findings of the study highlighted the need to incorporate age-appropriate reference values for interpreting mVEMP responses for children and adults across air- and bone-conduction modes.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Diabetes affects the peripheral auditory and vestibular systems. Research suggests that both cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMP) and ocular VEMP (oVEMP) are affected in individuals with diabetes. Masseter VEMP (mVEMP) is a new tool that assesses the vestibulomasseteric reflex pathways. The study aimed to characterize the cVEMP and mVEMP latency and amplitude parameters in diabetes mellitus type 2. Method: The study included 21 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 21 age- and gender-matched participants without diabetes aged 48–68 years. mVEMP and cVEMP were recorded using 500 Hz tone burst stimuli, presented at an intensity of 125 dB peSPL for both the groups. Results: The study suggests significantly prolonged P13 ( p = .00) and P11 latencies ( p = .00) in participants with diabetes ( M for p11 = 15.81, M for p13 = 15.39) compared to participants without diabetes ( M for p11 = 13.12, M for p13 = 14.19) for both cVEMP and mVEMP, respectively. No significant differences were observed in N23 ( p = .4) and N21 latencies ( p = .18) between the diabetes ( M for N21 = 22.62, M for N23 = 22.61) and nondiabetes groups ( M for N21 = 22.21, M for N23 = 22.40). Additionally, a significant reduction in cVEMP amplitude (P13-N23) was noted in the diabetes group ( M for P13-N23 = 0.71, p = .00) than the nondiabetes group ( M = 1.44), while mVEMP amplitudes (P11-N21) remained similar across groups ( M for P11-N21 for diabetes = 0.72, ( M for P11-N21 for nondiabetes = 0.77, p = .44). There were no significant correlations between the duration of diabetes and VEMP parameters, nor between cVEMP and mVEMP responses in either group. Conclusions: The findings revealed notable differences in cVEMP and mVEMP findings in diabetes individuals. These results suggest that diabetes may lead to neural and labyrinthine impairments. The degree of vestibular impairment varies and affects different reflex pathways. Even though mVEMP has a similar saccular origin as cVEMP, the results between the two do not correlate with each other.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Assessment of the middle ear muscle reflex (MEMR) is a standard part of the clinical audiological test battery that is used to assess middle ear function and identify possible retrocochlear lesions. The use of a wideband MEMR probe allows for additional information across frequency and lower reflex thresholds compared to the standard tonal probe used clinically. Recent animal studies suggest that the wideband MEMR is sensitive to noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy, the selective loss of the synaptic connections between the inner hair cells and the afferent auditory nerve fibers. However, the clinical utility of the wideband MEMR as an indicator of cochlear deafferentation is still unclear. Prior to adoption of the wideband MEMR as part of a diagnostic battery for cochlear deafferentation, it is necessary to determine the test–retest reliability of the measurement. Method: In a sample of 45 adults with normal hearing and normal tympanograms, wideband MEMR magnitude and threshold were measured at two different test sessions in response to a contralateral broadband noise stimulus at elicitor levels ranging from 60 to 100 dB SPL. The time between test sessions ranged from 2 hr to 5 months. Results: Test–retest differences increased with elicitor level. In some individuals, there were changes in the magnitude and/or the frequency response of the MEMR between test sessions. Conclusion: When wideband MEMR testing becomes clinically available, test–retest differences in contralateral wideband MEMR magnitude and threshold can be referenced by clinicians to help with interpretation of wideband MEMR test results.

    "abstract": "With current advances in experimental techniques, there is a renewed interest in studying communication behavior, reflecting a desire to improve our understanding of hearing disability and the effects of treatment interventions at the level of in-the-moment behaviors. Group conversations are among the most challenging situations for people with hearing loss. Experiments on group conversations are increasingly common and disproportionately more demanding than dyad studies to design and execute. Thorough design and planning are critical for successfully capturing valid behavioral data, highlighting the value of sharing behind-the-scenes experiences with the researcher community. We have completed a laboratory study of four-way group conversations involving people with and without hearing loss. This article describes the goals and compromises involved in our design choices and evaluates their effectiveness through participant feedback. Aspects covered include contrasts and covariates, group composition and physical arrangement, participant characteristics, hearing devices, participant experience, physical environment, conversational task, and measurement modalities. Next, we briefly describe the experiment's execution. Finally, we analyze and discuss participants' feedback and reflect on what proved effective, what did not, and what design “worries” proved founded or unfounded. We hope thereby to provide support and inspiration for others who may be faced with similar design challenges. The main message is that such an experiment can be carried out successfully and in such a way that the behavioral and self-report data collected are likely to carry a relatively high degree of ecological validity while still supporting experimental and statistical control.",

Method: In Experiment 1, five children assessed four hearing aid fittings based on combinations of fitting formula (Adaptive Phonak Digital Bimodal [APDB], DSL v5.0, APDB fit to DSL v5.0 targets), hearing aid type (dedicated hearing aid for bimodal listeners, independent hearing aid), and/or prescriptive targets. Speech recognition scores were obtained in a sound booth in quiet and in noise. In Experiment 2, two participants from Experiment 1 were retested with an updated bimodal system. Results: Bimodal speech recognition in quiet in both experiments was similar across all fitting formulas. In Experiment 1, bimodal speech recognition in noise was similar across fitting formulas; however, both in noise and in quiet, individual differences were observed. In Experiment 2, optimized APDB improved speech recognition in noise performance compared to APDB and similar performance compared to DSL v5.0 in a small set of bimodal listeners. Conclusion: Preliminary results point to the value of individualized selection of hearing aid fitting formula settings for pediatric bimodal recipients.",

Method: Using Portable Automated Rapid Testing software on an iPad, participants were asked to understand target speech (always simulated at 0° azimuth) in the presence of speech or “garbled speech” maskers (simulated from 0°, 6°, or 45° azimuth spatial locations). Additionally, suprathreshold sensitivities to temporal (TM), spectral (SM), and spectrotemporal (STM) modulation as well as binaural temporal fine structure (TFS) were estimated. Results: Older adults showed worse speech in competition (SiC) performance with 6° and 45°, but not 0°, masker spatial locations and benefited less from only 45° of spatial separation compared to young controls for speech masking. For garbled-speech masking, older adults showed worse performance overall, but benefited similarly from spatial separation compared to young controls. Older adults also showed worse sensitivity for binaural TFS, but comparable TM, SM, and STM sensitivity. Age as well as TM and SM sensitivities predicted SiC performance, whereas STM and binaural TFS sensitivities did not.

The relationships between demographic characteristics, self-perceived hearing difficulty, resilience, and psychological distress were assessed using bivariate analyses and multiple regressions. Results: Self-perceived hearing difficulty and resilience both predict psychological distress in adults with hearing loss, while controlling for age and income. Conclusions: Findings suggest that both audiologic and mental health interventions support positive mental health outcomes in adults with hearing loss.

    "abstract": "Purpose: Individuals with hearing loss typically experience greater listening effort, which is the additional recruitment of cognitive/mental resources such as attention and memory to understand speech and can be aversive and tiring. Reducing effort is an important goal of the hearing health care industry. Pupillometry is an objective and increasingly popular measure of listening effort, but gold standard measures of pupil size are expensive and unwieldy. The purpose of this study was to compare a low-cost and portable pupillometry device (Gazepoint GP3 HD) to a more traditional gold standard pupillometry tool (EyeLink 1000) for indexing listening effort via pupil size. Method: Twenty normal-hearing young adults (age range: 18–23 years) were recruited in this study. Participants' pupil size was measured using the Gazepoint and EyeLink pupillometry devices while listening to Hearing in Noise Test sentences in stationary speech–shaped noise at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) ranging from −8 to +8 dB. Results: Participants' word report accuracy increased from approximately 12% to 100% when the SNRs increased from −8 to +8 dB. Peak pupil diameter decreased for both devices and was smaller with the Gazepoint device. Data quality was comparable for the two devices. Conclusion: Gazepoint appeared to be an effective pupillometry device that records pupil dilation across a wide range of SNRs, without interfering with the auditory task.",

The Parenting Stress Index (PSI; Abidin, 1995), a screening and diagnostic assessment questionnaire designed to measure the relative magnitude of stress in a parent-child dyad, was used. Twenty MWIP and 20 MWIF participated. The PSI was administered through a telephone interview approximately 1 month after participants' discharge while their infants were between their fourth and fifth week of life. In the case of MWIF, the interview occurred before their infant's hearing retest. No significant differences in Total Stress, Life Stress, Child Domain, and Parent Domain subscale raw scores of the PSI were found between MWIP and MWIF (p > .05). An examination of the individual PSI profiles of all participants for \"high\" and \"low\" normative percentile scores (i.e., percentile scores > or = 90th percentile and percentile scores < or = 0 percentile for the former and latter, respectively) revealed that the incidence of high scale/subscale percentile scores was essentially equivalent between groups. MWIP, however, displayed lower scale/subscale percentile scores. The results of the study suggest that those mothers whose infants receive a refer outcome after a newborn hearing screening demonstrate equivalent stress levels as those mothers whose infants received a pass.",

    "abstract": "Conventional analysis of the click-evoked electrocochleogram includes measurement of the amplitudes of the cochlear summating potential (SP) and auditory nerve action potential (AP) to derive the SP/AP amplitude ratio. It is now well documented that an amplitude ratio where SP is elevated relative to AP may be a positive finding for endolymphatic hydrops in patients suspected of having Meniere's disease (MD). However, the incidence of an elevated SP/AP amplitude ratio in the general MD population is only ≈60%. This relatively low value necessitates efforts to improve the diagnostic sensitivity of electrocochleography (ECochG) for MD. A review of early and more recent literature in this area indicates that consideration of both the amplitude and duration of ECochG components may help to achieve this goal. The present study combined these features to measure the \"area\" of the SPAP complex in normal and MD populations. A software routine was used to measure the amplitude x duration area of the SP-AP complex in (a) normally hearing adults with normal SP/AP amplitude ratios (Group 1), (b) confirmed MD patients with elevated SP/AP amplitude ratios (Group 2), and (c) probable MD patients with normal SP/AP amplitude ratios (Group 3). Ninety percent of the confirmed MD patients in Group 2 displayed elevated SP/AP area ratios relative to the normative value established from Group 1. In addition, almost half of the probable MD patients from Group 3 displayed elevated area ratios. These findings indicate that measurement of the SP/AP area ratio holds promise for improving the sensitivity of ECochG in the diagnosis of MD.",

    "abstract": "The Auditory Behavior in Everyday Life (ABEL) questionnaire was developed to assess parental perceptions of their children's auditory behavior. The original 49-item questionnaire was intended to assess auditory communication, environmental awareness, functional independence, and social/communication skills. Our goal was to capture some of the changes in children's everyday auditory behavior in a reliable and easily quantifiable manner. Parents of 28 children aged 4 to 14 years with varying degrees of hearing loss (mild-profound) completed the questionnaire. The results were used to examine the reliability and factor structure of the questionnaire. Eleven items had poor item-total correlations. After these items were removed, the questionnaire had an overall reliability of 0.94 (Cronbach's alpha), and three factors accounted for 20.5% of the variance in the data. In a pilot investigation of the ABEL to determine its appropriateness for children with cochlear implants, questionnaires were also given to a separate group of parents of seven children aged 3 to 12 years who were about to receive a cochlear implant. Questionnaire and speech perception results were obtained preimplant and at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months. Complete (6 visits) or nearcomplete (4 visits) results were obtained for four children. There were significant improvements over time for both speech perception and questionnaire ratings and there was significant agreement between the two measures. Overall the results indicate excellent reliability and validity of the ABEL questionnaire. Our intent was to develop a simple, quick tool for parents to rate children's auditory skills in everyday life. A shorter questionnaire can be achieved by eliminating items with the poorest reliability and factor loadings. The resultant 24-item ABEL questionnaire has an excellent overall reliability of 0.95. The items fall within three factors, \"Aural-oral,\" \"Auditory Awareness,\" and \"Social/Conversational Skills.\" Children's auditory behavior can be assessed using an overall rating or separately for the three factors. Further research is needed to evaluate this short version of the questionnaire in children wearing hearing aids and cochlear implants.",

    "abstract": "We examined the effects of ipsilateral-direct, continuous, broadband noise on auditory brainstem response (ABR) wave I and V latencies and amplitudes in young adult versus older adult humans. It was hypothesized that age might influence the effects of masking noise on ABR peak latencies and/or amplitudes, given the frequent complaint of older persons’ ability to process speech in background noise. Young adults had hearing thresholds of 20 dB HL or better for the octave frequencies from 250 to 8000 Hz. A subset of older study participants had thresholds of 20 dB HL or better across frequency, but others had thresholds up to 45 dB HL. All data were collected and analyzed with a Nicolet Bravo. An electrode was placed on the tympanic membrane (as well as on high forehead and contralateral mastoid), and a click level of 115 dB pSPL was used to maximize wave I amplitude. Masker conditions included a no-noise control and noise levels ranging from 20 to 70 dB effective masking, in 10 dB steps. With increasing noise level, both age groups showed minimal changes in wave I latency, but substantial increases in wave V latency and I–V interval. Peak amplitudes decreased with increasing noise level. Mean amplitudes were smaller for the older group, most notably for wave I. Mean peak latencies were greater in the older group, but the I–V interval was similar across age groups, as was the change in peak latencies and I–V interval across noise level. ABR parameters for the older adults with hearing meeting the 20-dB HL criterion at all frequencies (older-better) were compared to those who didn’t meet this criterion (olderworse). Mean wave I latency was greater and wave V latency and I–V interval were smaller for the older-worse group at all noise levels. Mean wave I and V amplitudes were similar for the older-better and older-worse groups. In participants with normal or near-normal hearing, ABR changes with increasing age included small latency increases and a substantial reduction in wave I amplitude. The effects of ipsilateral-direct masking noise on the click-evoked ABR are similar for young and older adults.",

    "abstract": "In this tutorial, the characteristics of compression amplification in analog hearing aids and the experimental results obtained with single- and multichannel compression amplification systems are reviewed. Single-channel compression systems are classified into four broad groups on the basis of their static and dynamic characteristics: compression limiters, syllabic compressors, automatic volume control (AVC) systems, and \"others,\" those with adaptive recovery time (aRT) and dual frontend automatic gain control (AGC) (Moore, 1990; Moore & Glasberg, 1988). Multichannel compression devices have, to date, used a variety of different types of compression, with syllabic compression in each frequency channel being the most popular. Experimental evidence suggests that compression limiting is generally superior to peak clipping as a means of controlling output, except for some individuals with severe to profound hearing loss. There is some evidence that syllabic compression and AVC systems enhance speech perception in quiet compared to conventional linear amplification; however, this improvement is not consistently maintained in the presence of background noise. The majority of recent research has focused on multichannel compression, and favorable results have been obtained with some systems. Research findings about the efficacy of using compression amplification for people with hearing loss have been extremely variable, and possible reasons for this are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Speech understanding with cochlear implants has improved steadily over the last 25 years, and the success of implants has provided a powerful tool for understanding speech recognition in general. Comparing speech recognition in normal-hearing listeners and in cochlear-implant listeners has revealed many important lessons about the types of information necessary for good speech recognition--and some of the lessons are surprising. This paper presents a summary of speech perception research over the last 25 years with cochlear-implant and normal-hearing listeners. As long as the speech is audible, even the relatively severe amplitude distortion has only a mild effect on intelligibility. Temporal cues appear to be useful for speech intelligibility only up to about 20 Hz. Whereas temporal information above 20 Hz may contribute to improved quality, it contributes little to speech understanding. In contrast, the quantity and quality of spectral information appear to be critical for speech understanding. Only four spectral \"channels\" of information can produce good speech understanding, but more channels are required for difficult listening situations. Speech understanding is sensitive to the placement of spectral information along the cochlea. In prosthetic devices, in which the spectral information can be delivered to any cochlear location, it is critical to present spectral information to the normal acoustic tonotopic location for that information. If there is a shift or distortion of 2 to 3 mm between frequency and cochlear place, speech recognition is decreased dramatically.",

Although psychophysical laboratory procedures exist for the measurement of temporal resolution, none are clinically feasible. This study was designed to obtain preliminary data on a new clinical measure of gap detection, the Adaptive Test of Temporal Resolution (ATTR). Method The ATTR, a currently available clinical test (Random Gap Detection Test), and a standard psychophysical laboratory procedure were used to measure gap detection thresholds (GDTs) from a group of 30 young adults with normal hearing. Results Mean ATTR GDTs were 2.2 ms, consistent with GDTs measured using the psychophysical laboratory procedure (3.2 ms) and significantly smaller than those measured using the Random Gap Detection Test (7.0 ms). Conclusions Because it incorporates standard adaptive psychophysical methodology in a computer application that can be used on any desktop computer but does not depend on specialized hardware for application, the ATTR promises to be a clinically feasible addition to the APD test battery.",

    "abstract": "Purpose To ascertain whether current pure-tone school hearing screening criteria used across the United States are adequate for the early identification of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in adolescents. Method School-based pure-tone hearing screening protocols were collected, reviewed, and consolidated from 46 state agencies. A retrospective categorical analysis of air-conduction audiometric thresholds from a computerized database of 9th-grade ( n = 376) and 12th-grade ( n = 265) students from a suburban high school was conducted. The database analysis was designed to determine whether each screening protocol would identify high-frequency notched audiometric configurations suggestive of NIHL when using the noise notch criteria described by A. S. Niskar et al. (2001). Results All of the school-based hearing screening criteria identified significantly ( p ≤ .05) fewer students with a high-frequency notch (HFN) than the noise notch protocol regardless of screening decibel level specified. Over half of the school-based hearing screening protocols used in the United States will identify only 22% of the students with an HFN and consequently would fail to detect a potential NIHL. Conclusions Currently implemented school-based hearing screening guidelines are nonstandardized and inadequate for the early identification of NIHL. This denies the majority of students the opportunity to receive early intervention and to prevent further progression of NIHL. It is necessary to identify, standardize, and implement effective and efficient screening or monitoring programs for the early detection and prevention of NIHL in adolescents.",

Without complete reporting by audiologists to EHDI programs, accurate calculation of performance measures is impossible. Lack of documentation can lead to the overstatement of \"loss to follow-up.\" Also, standardization of measures is essential for programs to evaluate how many children receive recommended services and assess progress toward national goals.

Those findings were interpreted in the context of what is expected from studies in humans, specifically in the brains of people with tinnitus.Tinnitus is an auditory percept to which several central structures in the auditory system may contribute. Because the central auditory system has both feed-forward connections and feedback connections, it can be described as a set of nested loops. Once these loops become activated in a pathological fashion, as they may be in tinnitus, it becomes hard to assign importance to each contributing structure. Strongly interconnected networks, that is, neural assemblies, may be determining the quality of the tinnitus percept.It is unlikely that tinnitus is the expression of a set of independently firing neurons, and more likely that it is the result of a pathologically increased synchrony between sets of neurons.

Analyses of variance and regression modeling were used to determine the effect of age and audibility on GIN performance. Comparisons of thresholds obtained from the 4 test lists of the GIN were also conducted. Results Approximate gap thresholds differed significantly across all groups, with the poorest thresholds found in older adults with SNHL and with the best thresholds found in young adults with normal hearing. The strongest predictor of decreases in GIN performance was increased Audibility Index score, but a significant independent effect of age was also documented. Test list influenced GIN performance only in the group of young adults with normal hearing. Conclusions The GIN test is a promising clinical measure of temporal resolution.

This study describes the minimum level of self-reported English proficiency that identifies bilingual individuals who may perform on par with monolingual listeners on an English word recognition test. Method A total of 125 normal hearing bilingual listeners rated their English proficiency in listening, speaking, and reading on an 11-point scale. Other related linguistic variables were also obtained. A randomly selected Northwestern University Auditory Test No. 6 (NU-6) list (50 English monosyllabic words) was presented to all participants at 45 dB HL in quiet. Results Over 90% of the listeners self-rated to have at least “good” proficiency in English listening, speaking, or reading. Of these participants, more than 30% did not achieve a monolingual normative level in English as delimited by binomial distribution. Composite proficiency ratings across language domains better predicted word recognition performance than self-ratings for listening proficiency only. Combining language dominance and age of English acquisition with proficiency ratings further improved prediction specificity. Conclusions Self-rated English proficiency can predict bilingual listeners’ performance on the NU-6 test. For desirable sensitivity and specificity in predicting monolingual-like performance, a minimum rating of 8 out of 10 across all language domains is recommended.",

Survey methods included a face-to-face interview and hearing screening using pure tones as well as a self-report questionnaire on other health issues.The survey highlighted additional hearing-related factors that will enable referral decisions in primary care to be made with reasonable confidence that patients will use hearing aids and benefit from them. Some relevant nonhearing factors are also reported.There is a growing aging population with increasing needs and expectations for hearing services. Targeted screening and triage in primary care, as well as use of advanced technologies, are discussed for the future.",

The purpose of this study is to characterize new-onset conductive hearing losses after cochlear implantation.In a prospective study, air- and bone-conduction audiometric testing were completed on cochlear implant recipients. An air-bone gap equal to or greater than 15 dB HL at 2 frequencies determined the presence of a conductive component.Of the 32 patients with preoperative bone-conduction hearing, 4 patients had a new-onset conductive component resulting in a mixed hearing loss, with air-conduction thresholds ranging from moderate to profound and an average air-bone gap of 30 dB HL. One had been implanted through the round window, 2 had an extended round window, and 1 had a separate cochleostomy.Loss of residual hearing following cochlear implantation may be due in part to a conductive component. Identifying the mechanism for this conductive component may help minimize hearing loss. Postoperative hearing evaluation should measure both air- and bone-conduction thresholds.",

Method Pertinent archival studies were reviewed, and an original analysis on U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) audiometric survey data from children (ages 6–19) was performed. Conclusion The definition of an otologically normal individual, the pass–fail criterion representing the upper limit of the range of normal hearing, and the quality of the audiometry affect the percentage of persons who are falsely identified as having a minimal HL. An upper limit of normal hearing of 15 dB HL yields an unacceptably high false-positive rate, particularly when the more variable higher audiometric frequencies are examined. When air-conduction thresholds are assessed in isolation to estimate potential noise damage, the failure to exclude persons who have possible middle and external ear problems, including earwax, results in high false-positive rates. When these factors and other limitations are considered, audiograms from teens from a recent CDC survey do not show evidence consistent with widespread noise-induced HL.

The objective of this study was to evaluate 4 individuals who transitioned from bimodal to bilateral stimulation.Participants had completed a larger study of bimodal hearing and subsequently received a second CI. Test procedures from the bimodal study, including roaming speech recognition, localization, and a questionnaire (the Speech, Spatial, and Qualities of Hearing Scale; Gatehouse & Noble, 2004) were repeated after 6-7 months of bilateral CI experience.Speech recognition and localization were not significantly different between bimodal and unilateral CI. In contrast, performance was significantly better with CI&CI compared with unilateral CI. Speech recognition with CI&CI was significantly better than with CI&HA for 2 of 4 participants. Localization was significantly better for all participants with CI&CI compared with CI&HA. CI&CI performance was rated as significantly better on the Speech, Spatial, and Qualities of Hearing Scale compared with CI&HA.There was a strong preference for CI&CI for all participants. The variability in speech recognition and localization, however, suggests that performance under these stimulus conditions is individualized. Differences in hearing and/or HA history may explain performance differences.",

Method Sixty participants were randomized to 1 of 3 groups that used sound therapy devices during sleep that differed in their acoustic stimulus: (a) tinnitus-matched (TM), (b) noise stimulus (NS), and (c) bedside sound generator (BSG). Outcome measures were the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI), numeric rating scale of tinnitus loudness, and tinnitus loudness match. A Bayesian hierarchical model was fit to estimate the differences in treatment efficacy among groups. Results Average tinnitus reactions and perceptions improved across treatment groups. We are at least 87% certain that treatment with TM or NS reduces mean TFI compared to treatment with BSG, with an estimated relative efficacy of 4.5–5 points greater reduction. We are at least 95% certain that treatment with TM results in greater reduction in mean numeric rating scale (NRS) of tinnitus loudness compared to the other groups, with an estimated relative efficacy of about 0.75 points greater reduction. Conclusions This study offers some support for greater average improvement in reactions to tinnitus with TM or NS devices compared to the BSG device. The TM group, compared to the BSG and NS groups, showed a greater reduction in ratings of tinnitus loudness on the NRS on average. Supplemental Material https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.5545759",

Counseling and tinnitus sound therapy options are not currently widespread for cochlear implant (CI) users. The goal of this study was to determine whether tinnitus therapy sounds created for individuals with acoustic hearing may also benefit CI users.Sixteen sounds from the ReSound Relief app (Version 3.0) were selected for the study. Sixteen participants were asked to rate the overall acceptability of each sound and to write the description of the sound they perceived. Sounds were streamed from an Apple™ iPod (6th generation) to the CI using a Cochlear™ Wireless Mini Microphone 2+. Thirteen participants then completed a 5-min trial where they rated their pretrial and posttrial tinnitus and the acceptability of a subset of preferred sounds. Ten out of these 13 participants completed a 2-week home trial with a preferred sound after which they answered an online tinnitus questionnaire and rated the effectiveness of the sound therapy.Individual differences were large. Results from the 5-min trial showed that sounds perceived as rain, music, and waves were rated the most acceptable. For all of the participants, the posttrial tinnitus loudness rating was lower than the pretrial rating, with some participants experiencing greater difference in their tinnitus loudness than others. At the end of the 2-week home trial, 3 of 10 participants rated the effectiveness of sound therapy 70% or higher.The results suggest that the use of tinnitus therapy sounds delivered through a CI can be acceptable and provides relief for some tinnitus sufferers.",

Acoustic environments were automatically and continuously classified about every 4 s, using the hearing aids' signal processing, into 1 of 7 acoustic environment categories.For both groups, older adults wore their hearing aids about 60% of the time in quiet or speech-only conditions. The automatic classification of sound environments was shown to be reliable over relatively short (6-week) and long (13-month) durations. Moreover, the results were shown to have some validity in that the obtained acoustic environment profiles matched a self-reported measure of social activity administered prior to hearing aid usage. For a subset of 56 older adults with data from both the 6-week and 13-month wear times, the daily amount of hearing aid usage diminished but the profile of sound environments frequented by the wearers remained stable.Examination of the results from the automatic classification of sound environments by the hearing aids of older adults provides reliable and valid environment classifications. The present data indicate that most such wearers choose generally favorable acoustic environments for hearing aid use.",

This is the 2nd stage of a dual-stage scoping review. Purpose This study sought stakeholder opinion and feedback with an aim to achieve consensus on the constructs, components, and design of the initial conceptual framework. Research Design A modified electronic Delphi study was completed with 21 handpicked experts from 7 countries who have experience in provision, research, or experience in the area of parent-to-parent support. Participants completed an online questionnaire using an 11-point Likert scale ( strongly disagree to strongly agree ) and open-ended questions to answer various questions related to the descriptor terms, definitions, constructs, components, and overall design of the framework. Results Participant responses led to the revision of the original conceptual framework. Conclusion The findings from this dual-stage scoping review and electronic Delphi study provide a conceptual framework that defines the vital contribution of parents in Early Hearing Detection and Intervention programs that will be a useful addition to these programs.

Method Ages at and delays between service delivery steps (first diagnostic evaluation, confirmation of HL, hearing aid [HA] fitting, entry into early intervention) were investigated for 113 children with mild HL. Comparisons were made to children with moderate-to-severe HL. Parents of children with mild HL reported reasons for delays and their perceptions of intervention and amplification for their children. Results Seventy-four percent of children with mild HL were identified through the newborn hearing screen; 26% were identified later due to passing or not receiving a newborn hearing screen. Ninety-four percent of children with mild HL were fit with HAs, albeit at significantly later ages than children with moderate-to-severe HL. Most parents indicated that their children benefited from HA use, but some parents expressed ambivalence toward the amount of benefit. Conclusions Audiologists appear to be moving toward regularly providing amplification for children with mild HL. However, delays in HA fittings indicate that further educating professionals and parents about the benefits of early amplification and intervention is warranted to encourage timely fitting and consistent use of HAs.",

There is no standard test for tinnitus loudness, but matching and rating methods are popular. This article provides important new knowledge about the reliability and validity of an audiologist-administered tinnitus loudness matching test and a patient-reported tinnitus loudness rating. Method Retrospective analysis of loudness data for 91 participants with stable subjective tinnitus enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of a novel drug for tinnitus. There were two baseline assessments (screening, Day 1) and a posttreatment assessment (Day 28). Results About 66%–70% of the variability from screening to Day 1 was attributable to the true score. But measurement error, indicated by the smallest detectable change, was high for both tinnitus loudness matching (20 dB) and tinnitus loudness rating (3.5 units). Only loudness rating captured a sensation that was meaningful to people who lived with the experience of tinnitus. Conclusions The tinnitus loudness rating performed better against acceptability criteria for reliability and validity than did the tinnitus loudness matching test administered by an audiologist. But the rating question is still limited because it is a single-item instrument and is probably able to detect only large changes (at least 3.5 points).",

Method Fifteen hearing mothers of children with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss were interviewed. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and a grounded theory approach was used to inductively analyze parental stress in mothers of D/HH children. Theory generation was achieved through triangulation of data sources and systematic organization of data into codes. The coding process identified salient themes that were constantly cross-checked and compared across data to further develop categories, properties, and tentative hypotheses. Results In general, two main themes emerged from the interviews: the contextual stressors and stress-reducing resources. The contextual stressors were labeled as distress over audiology-related needs, pressure to acquire new knowledge and skills, apprehension about the child's future, and demoralizing negative social attitudes. The stress-reducing resources that moderated parenting stress were identified to be the child's progress, mother's characteristics, professional support, and social support. The interaction between the identified stressors and adjustment process uncovered a central theme termed maternal coherence. Conclusion The substantive theory suggests that mothers of D/HH children can effectively manage parenting stress and increase well-being by capitalizing on relevant stress-reducing resources to achieve maternal coherence.",

Interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis, and a process of member checking was used to enhance the trustworthiness of findings reported.The importance of promoting partnership emerged as the overarching theme. Audiologists valued promoting partnership with family members so that a shared understanding could be established, family members could be active participants with distinct roles in hearing rehabilitation, and the rehabilitation outcomes for the person with HI could be improved. Audiologists generally reported low attendance rates of family members to appointments and identified 5 major factors affecting family participation.There is growing recognition among audiologists of the importance of promoting partnership with family members during the hearing rehabilitation process.

Materials and Method Forty-four bilaterally deaf patients aged more than 60 years (25 with CI candidacy and 19 with HA candidacy) were enrolled. Patients were subjected to audiological evaluation, to a battery of neuropsychological tests (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE], Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Task [RAVLT], Rey–Osterreith Complex Figure Test, Digit/Corsi Span Forward and Backward, Multiple Features Target Cancellation, Trail-Making Test, Stroop Test, and Phonological and Semantic Word Fluency), and to a quality of life assessment (Short Form 36, Glasgow Benefit Inventory, Glasgow Health Status Inventory) at the baseline and after a long-term follow-up (6–12 months). Results Speech recognition scores in quiet and in noise were significantly improved even 6 months after auditory rehabilitation. Significant differences between pre- and post-rehabilitation scores were reported in physical and emotional impacts in life, general global health, vitality, and social activities. MMSE and RAVLT scores were significantly improved in both groups after 6 months of follow-up, suggesting a global involvement of memory domain. Mnesic performances remained unchanged between the first and second follow-up, but a further significant improvement in executive functions (Stroop Test) was detected in patients with CI reevaluated 12 months after implantation. A significant correlation of the RAVLT with signal-to-noise ratio at +10 dB speech-in-noise scores and the MMSE with signal-to-noise ratio at 0 dB speech-in-noise scores suggests the pivotal role of executive functions in recognition in noisy environment. Conclusions Our preliminary data confirm that hearing deprivation in aged patients represents a truly modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline, which can be positively faced by acoustic rehabilitation. The improvement of short- and long-term memory performances and the amelioration of executive and attentive functions suggest that hearing restoration with both HAs and CI may provide a recovery of superior cognitive domains probably through a reallocation of cortical resources altered by hearing deprivation.",

Method Regression and relative importance analysis was used to model several behavioral and physiological measures of hearing in 32 adults ranging in age from 20 to 74 years. Predictors for the model were hearing sensitivity and performance on a number of cognitive tasks. Results There was a significant influence of cognitive capacity on several measures of cochlear synaptopathy and hidden hearing disorder. These measures include frequency modulation detection threshold, time-compressed word recognition in quiet and reverberation, and the strength of the frequency-following response of the speech-evoked auditory brainstem response. Conclusions Measures of hearing that involve temporal processing are significantly influenced by cognitive abilities, specifically, short-term and working memory capacity, executive function, and attention. Research using measures of temporal processing to diagnose peripheral disorders, such as noise-induced synaptopathy, need to consider cognitive influence even in a young, healthy population.",

A regression analysis with subject as a random variable was used to test the fixed effect of listener group and masker language and the interaction of these two effects. Results Thresholds were approximately 5 dB higher for children than for adults in both maskers. However, children and adults benefited to the same degree from a mismatch between the target and masker language with approximately 3 dB lower thresholds in the Spanish than the English masker. Conclusions Results suggest that children are able to take advantage of linguistic differences between English and Spanish speech maskers to the same degree as adults. Yet, overall worse performance for children may indicate general cognitive immaturity compared with adults, perhaps causing children to be less efficient when combining glimpses of degraded speech information into a meaningful sentence.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Cochlear implant (CI) performance varies considerably across individuals and across domains of auditory function, but clinical testing is typically restricted to speech intelligibility. The goals of this study were (a) to develop a basic auditory skills evaluation battery of tests for comprehensive assessment of ecologically relevant aspects of auditory perception and (b) to compare CI listeners' performance on the battery when tested in the laboratory by an audiologist or independently at home. Method The battery included 17 tests to evaluate (a) basic spectrotemporal processing, (b) processing of music and environmental sounds, and (c) speech perception in both quiet and background noise. The battery was administered online to three groups of adult listeners: two groups of postlingual CI listeners and a group of older normal-hearing (ONH) listeners of similar age. The ONH group and one CI group were tested in a laboratory by an audiologist, whereas the other CI group self-tested independently at home following online instructions. Results Results indicated a wide range in the performance of CI but not ONH listeners. Significant differences were not found between the two CI groups on any test, whereas on all but two tests, CI listeners' performance was lower than that of the ONH participants. Principal component analysis revealed that four components accounted for 82% of the variance in measured results, with component loading indicating that the test battery successfully captures differences across dimensions of auditory perception. Conclusions These results provide initial support for the use of the basic auditory skills evaluation battery for comprehensive online assessment of auditory skills in adult CI listeners.",

This work aimed to provide more information about what audiologists are currently doing in the clinic to manage auditory difficulties in this patient population and their views on the efficacy of recommended rehabilitation methods. Method A questionnaire survey containing multiple-choice and open-ended questions was developed and disseminated online. Invitations to participate were delivered via e-mail listservs and through business cards provided at annual audiology conferences. All responses were anonymous at the time of data collection. Results Responses were collected from 209 participants. The majority of participants reported seeing at least one normal-hearing patient per month who reported significant communication difficulties. However, few respondents indicated that their location had specific protocols for the treatment of these patients. Counseling was reported as the most frequent rehabilitation method, but results revealed that audiologists across various work settings are also successfully starting to fit patients with mild-gain hearing aids. Responses indicated that patient compliance with computer-based auditory training methods was regarded as low, with patients generally preferring device-based rehabilitation options. Conclusions Results from this questionnaire survey strongly suggest that audiologists frequently see normal-hearing patients who report auditory difficulties, but that few clinicians are equipped with established protocols for diagnosis and management. While many feel that mild-gain hearing aids provide considerable benefit for these patients, very little research has been conducted to date to support the use of hearing aids or other rehabilitation options for this unique patient population. This study reveals the critical need for additional research to establish evidence-based practice guidelines that will empower clinicians to provide a high level of clinical care and effective rehabilitation strategies to these patients.",

Although clinical trials of such interventions were completed in Europe, the United Kingdom, and Australia, their suitability for adults with tinnitus in the United States is yet to be established. The aim of this study was to improve the cultural and linguistic suitability, and lower the readability level, of an existing program for tinnitus to ensure its suitability for U.S. English- and Spanish-speaking populations. Method Guidelines for adaptation were followed and involved four phases: (a) cultural adaptations, as interventions targeted at specific cultures have been shown to improve outcomes; (b) creating Spanish materials to improve access of the materials to the large Spanish-speaking population in the United States; (c) professional review of the materials for acceptability as an intervention tool for a U.S. population; and (d) literacy-level adjustments to make the content accessible to those with lower levels of health literacy skills. Results Cultural adaptations were made by using word substitutions, changing examples, and modifying the spelling of certain words. The materials were then translated into Spanish and cross-checked. Professional review ensured suitability of the chapters. Literacy-level adjustments ensured all chapters were within the guidelines for readability grade levels below the sixth-grade level. Conclusions The previously developed tinnitus materials were revised to adhere to best practice guidelines and ensure cultural suitability for adults with tinnitus in the United States. As it is also available in Spanish, members of the large Hispanic community also have access to the intervention in their first language. Further studies should determine whether these changes improve patients' self-efficacy, engagement, and motivation to complete the intervention.",

To ensure audiological rehabilitation is provided appropriately for older adults with comorbid psychological symptoms, a greater understanding of their preferences and experiences is needed. This study sought to understand experiences of hearing loss and audiological rehabilitation from the perspective of older adults with comorbid psychological symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety, psychosis). Design A qualitative study using in-depth semistructured interviews was conducted with older adults who had attended audiological rehabilitation within the last year and scored above established cutoffs on measures of depression, anxiety, and psychosis. A thematic analysis generated themes that related to participants' experiences of hearing loss and audiological rehabilitation. Results Participants included 14 older adults (eight men and six women) with an average age of 70.5 years (SD = 4.45, range: 64-80) who received hearing aids or a cochlear implant. Three major themes emerged from the analysis of participant interviews. \"The cumulative impact of hearing loss and psychological symptoms\" theme describes the two-way, additive relationship between hearing ability and psychological symptoms. \"The experience of loss throughout hearing loss and audiological rehabilitation\" captures subjective losses, the impact they have, and how participants cope with them. In contrast, \"The experience of gain throughout hearing loss and audiological rehabilitation\" describes the participants' reported gains, their related impacts, and coping strategies. Conclusions The experiences of participants revealed that the presence of comorbid psychological symptoms can influence the experience of hearing loss and audiological rehabilitation. These findings have implications for how audiological rehabilitation is provided to ensure optimal outcomes for adults with hearing loss and comorbid psychological symptoms.

Method We did an observational, cross-sectional investigation of hearing function in children, teens, and young adults with CF (n = 57, M = 15.0 years) who received intravenous aminoglycoside antibiotics and age- and gender-matched controls (n = 61, M = 14.6 years). Participants completed standard and extended high-frequency audiometry, middle ear measures, speech perception tests, and a hearing and balance questionnaire. Results Individuals with CF were 3-4 times more likely to report issues with hearing, balance, and tinnitus and performed significantly poorer on speech perception tasks compared to controls. A higher prevalence of hearing loss was observed in individuals with CF (57%) compared to controls (37%). CF and control groups had similar proportions of slight and mild hearing losses; however, individuals with CF were 7.6 times more likely to have moderate and greater degrees of hearing loss. Older participants displayed higher average extended high-frequency thresholds, with no effect of age on average standard frequency thresholds. Although middle ear dysfunction has not previously been reported to be more prevalent in CF, this study showed that 16% had conductive or mixed hearing loss and higher rates of previous otitis media and pressure equalization tube surgeries compared to controls. Conclusions Individuals with CF have a higher prevalence of conductive, mixed, and sensorineural hearing loss; poorer speech-in-noise performance; and higher rates of multiple symptoms associated with otologic disorders (tinnitus, hearing difficulty, dizziness, imbalance, and otitis media) compared to controls. Accordingly, children with CF should be asked about these symptoms and receive baseline hearing assessment(s) prior to treatment with potentially ototoxic medications and at regular intervals thereafter in order to provide otologic and audiologic treatment for hearing- and ear-related problems to improve communication functioning.",

However, few studies simultaneously examine music perception and speech-in-noise perception in adult CI recipients. This study explores the effect of auditory status on music perception and speech-in-noise perception recognition in noise as well as the relationship among music engagement, music perception, and speech-in-noise perception. Method Participants include 10 adults with typical hearing (TH) and 10 adults with long-term CI use. All participants completed the Music-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire, which assesses subjective music experiences and their importance; the Pitch Direction Discrimination, Familiar Melody Recognition, and Timbre Recognition subtests of the Clinical Assessment of Music Perception for Cochlear Implants; the Unfamiliar Melody Recognition subtest of the Profile of Music Perception Skills; and the Bamford–Kowal–Bench Speech-in-Noise Test . Results The TH group significantly outperformed the CI group for speech-in-noise perception and on all four music perception tasks. The CI group exhibited not only significantly poorer mean scores but also greater variability in performance compared to the TH group. Only Familiar Melody Recognition and Unfamiliar Melody Recognition subtests significantly correlated with speech-in-noise scores. Conclusions Patients and professionals should not assume speech perception and music perception in adult CI users derive from the same auditory or cognitive foundations. The lack of significant relationships among music engagement, music perception, and speech-in-noise perception scores in adult CI users suggests this population enjoys music despite poor and variable performance in discrete music tasks.",

We collected data via focus groups and interviews from three stakeholder groups-CHL, their parents, and teachers/school professionals-in order to define the construct of listening-related fatigue from the perspective of CHL and key stakeholders. This is an important first step in our long-term goal to construct and validate a measure (i.e., scale) of listening-related fatigue for the pediatric population, with a focus on CHL. This article provides an overview of the data gathering process, analysis of qualitative reports, and the development of a theoretical framework for understanding the experience of listening-related fatigue in CHL.We conducted focus groups and interviews in school-age children exhibiting bilateral, moderate-to-profound hearing loss (n = 43), their parents (n = 17), and school professionals who work with CHL (n = 28). The discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded using a hierarchical coding system. Qualitative analysis was conducted using an iterative inductive-deductive approach.We identified primary themes from the focus group/interview discussions to develop a theoretical framework of listening-related fatigue in CHL. The framework demonstrates the complex interaction among situational determinants that impact fatigue, symptoms or manifestations of fatigue, and the utilization of, and barriers to, coping strategies to reduce listening-related fatigue.Participant discussion suggests that listening-related fatigue is a significant problem for many, but not all, CHL. Qualitative data obtained from these stakeholder groups help define the construct and provide a framework for better understanding listening-related fatigue in children.",

This study compared listening effort in school-age children with normal hearing and children with limited hearing unilaterally using behavioral and subjective listening effort measures. Design Two groups of school-age children (aged 7–12 years) participated: 19 with limited hearing unilaterally and 18 with normal hearing bilaterally. Participants completed digit triplet recognition tasks in quiet and in noise (−12 dB SNR) in three loudspeaker conditions: midline, direct, and indirect. Verbal response times during the recognition task were interpreted as behavioral listening effort. Subjective ratings of “task difficulty” and “hard to think” were interpreted as subjective listening effort. Participant age was included as a covariate in analysis of behavioral data. Results Noise negatively affected digit triplet recognition for both groups in the midline loudspeaker condition and for participants with limited hearing unilaterally in the direct and indirect conditions. Relative to their peers with normal hearing, children with limited hearing unilaterally exhibited significantly longer response times and higher ratings of effort only in the noisy, indirect condition. Differences between groups were evident even when age differences were controlled for statistically. Conclusions Using behavioral and subjective indices of listening effort, children with limited unilateral hearing demonstrated significantly more listening effort relative to their peers with normal hearing during the difficult indirect listening condition.

Patients may experience vestibular symptoms, such as vertigo and imbalance, with or without other migrainous symptoms. Recent evidence has also shown that patients with VM are at higher risk for cochlear dysfunction, such as sudden deafness, sensorineural hearing loss, and tinnitus. The heritability and genetics are not well understood, and the pathogenesis may involve calcitonin gene-related peptide, which is also implicated in migraine headaches. A disease-specific patient reported outcome measure, the Vestibular Migraine Patient Assessment Tool and Handicap Inventory, was recently developed and validated. A limited number of controlled trials have assessed various therapies for VM, including triptans and beta-blockers. More data are needed to understand whether or not currently available migraine treatments are effective for VM.VM is a common etiology of vertigo and dizziness, presenting with a characteristic spectrum of symptoms.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine telephone use among cochlear implant recipients. A questionnaire was constructed and mailed to 803 adults who received a Clarion cochlear implant system manufactured by Advanced Bionics Corporation. Question-naire recipients were implanted at least 12 months prior to receiving the questionnaire (i.e., they were implanted in 1998 or 1999). Approximately 60% ( n = 478) responded, of whom 70% ( n = 336) were considered \"telephone users\" (i.e., they answered the telephone and/or initiated calls). Telephone users were significantly younger and had significantly more daily hours of cochlear implant use than nonusers. Not surprisingly, there were differences between groups with respect to method of communication (i.e., more users employed oral communication, while more nonusers employed both oral and manual communication) and ability to understand words without lipreading (i.e., more users were able to understand). Thirty-seven percent of the telephone users were male, and 63% were female. The average age was 51.8 years ( SD = 15.5). Ninety-five percent of users initiated calls to family and friends, 65% made appointments by phone, and approximately 50% asked for information about a product or service and conducted business over the phone. Over 95% of users could identify a dial tone, a busy signal, and voices. The average telephone use per week was 5.4 hr. Approximately 85% indicated that they were able to interact with strangers on the telephone within 5 months of receiving the sound processor. Approximately 30% communicated via a cellular phone for personal use. The findings of this survey suggest an increase in cochlear implant users' telephone use relative to a decade earlier. Advances in cochlear implant and telephone technologies are 2 of several factors that may contribute to the changes observed.",

Sentinel NIHLI outcomes of interest included acoustic trauma, permanent threshold shift, eardrum perforation, tinnitus, and military-specific H-3 and H-4 hearing loss profiles. Results: Significantly higher rates of NIHLI and associated outcomes were observed among soldiers whose diagnoses were postdeployment-related. Conclusions: Based on the findings from this evaluation, recommendations are provided for enhancing the force health protection posture for prevention of hearing loss in future deployments.",

Included are questions regarding the target population(s) of screening programs, well baby versus NICU screening, dealing with false-positives and the effects on parent-child relationships, and finally, the availability of resources for screening and follow-up. The results of a recent study in the United Kingdom that assessed the current state of audiology services and found there is a difference between existing standards and what is actually being done in practice, are presented and considered in terms of current trends in the United States to move ahead with universal screening without a solid database of information regarding the preparedness of clinical centers to deal with the need for services that will result from the initiation of universal programs.

    "abstract": "Tinnitus can be the most debilitating symptom faced by people with hearing impairments. In the past 10 years, there has been a large increase in tinnitus research and in the development of clinical protocols. New animal models and physiological procedures provide an important contribution to the understanding and measurement of tinnitus. The annoyance of tinnitus likely depends on its loudness and the psychological makeup of the patient. The loudness of a person's tinnitus can be compared with the equivalent loudness of a 1000 Hz tone in a normal ear. Several questionnaires have recently been introduced to quantify the handicap caused by tinnitus. Tinnitus maskers are apparently ineffective for most patients but they can be helpful in a few patients. Medications are largely ineffective in reducing tinnitus in most people. However, several psychological techniques for reducing the stress associated with tinnitus are currently under investigation, and preliminary results show some promise. Tinnitus can be reduced by electrical stimulation in a few patients, and this is also an important area for future research.",

Covariate and regression analyses were used to address the study purpose.On average, participants recognized 74% of the information immediately following HAO and 78% at 1 month. Hearing loss was associated with declining recognition for hearing aid use and care information immediately following HAO, whereas prior knowledge was associated with successful recognition. Participants who recognized more HAO content immediately also remembered more at 1 month. A difference in recognition of hearing aid information based on audiologist was suggested immediately following HAO, but there were no differences at 1 month. Ability to recognize HAO content was not related to age of participants.On average, participants recognized approximately 75% of the HAO content, which is encouraging from a clinical standpoint, providing support for the efficacy of the HAO and the time audiologists spend in completing it. Moreover, recognition of HAO content improved when tested at 1 month, suggesting audiologists may expect their patients to be aware of a majority of hearing aid use and care information following the hearing aid trial period.",

Overall, the data suggest lower reliability for MCL than for UCL and lower reliability for pure-tone MCLs than for speech MCLs. Lower MCLs are typically obtained when measured by an ascending approach, in contrast to a descending approach. Results suggest that audiological efforts should be directed toward the development of a standardized test procedure that yields adequately reliable and valid MCLs and UCLs for routine clinical use.",

In this protocol, no additional testing is done for those passing the OAE screening, but infants failing the OAE are also screened with automated auditory brainstem response (A-ABR). This study evaluated how many infants who failed the OAE and passed the A-ABR had permanent hearing loss (PHL) at 8–12 months of age. Method: A total of 86,634 infants were screened at 7 birthing centers using a 2-stage OAE/A-ABR hearing screening protocol. Of infants who failed the OAE but passed the A-ABR, 1,524 were enrolled in the study. Diagnostic audiologic evaluations were performed on 64% of the enrolled infants (1,432 ears from 973 infants) when they were 8–12 months old. Results: Twenty-one infants (30 ears) who passed the newborn A-ABR hearing screening were identified with PHL when they were 8–12 months old. Most (71%) had mild hearing loss. Conclusions: If all infants were screened for hearing loss using a typical 2-stage OAE/A-ABR protocol, approximately 23% of those with PHL at 8–12 months of age would have passed the A-ABR.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Difficulty understanding speech in background noise is one of the most common complaints of hearing aid users. In modern hearing aids, directional microphones (d-mics) are considered the method of choice in improving signal-to-noise ratio, with demonstrated improvement in speech-perception-in-noise tasks. On the other hand, digital noise reduction (DNR) algorithms, in commercially available products, are considered to provide comfort but not significant assistance in improving speech perception in noise. In practice, these 2 technologies are often used in conjunction, but few studies have evaluated their interaction and the resultant effect on speech perception in noise. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect on speech performance of using d-mics and DNR in isolation as well as in conjunction in the presence of background noise. Method This study evaluates the performance of 16 experienced adult hearing aid users on the Hearing in Noise Test when each technology was activated independently and then simultaneously in 4 commercially available hearing aids. Result Approximately 50% of our participants performed better with both d-mics and DNR activated in conjunction, while the other 50% performed best in the d-mic-only condition. When considering statistically significant differences in performance only, a reduction or improvement in performance was observed in 17% and 14% of the conditions, respectively. Conclusion A direction for further research would be to identify predictive variables that could help the audiologist determine an individual’s preference a priori.",

This article provides a plan for establishing a tinnitus treatment program that can be implemented in stages at most audiology clinics. Method Preparation for establishing a tinnitus clinic includes having an overall plan regarding the type and degree of tinnitus management. Assessment involves a measurement of tinnitus and of the reaction a patient has to the tinnitus, including the use of handicap questionnaires. Management typically involves some form of counseling and sound therapy. Four problematic areas in tinnitus management are thoughts and emotions, hearing and communication, sleep, and concentration. Conclusions Licensed audiologists generally have the essential training necessary to provide counseling and sound therapy to treat tinnitus patients. We introduce 3 levels of treatment implementation, depending on whether the patient is curious, concerned, or distressed. Follow-up and referrals might be necessary in more severe cases. Finally, the development of a tinnitus clinic centers around establishing a need for individual treatment, creating a treatment plan, estimating the need for additional staff and resources, reimbursement options, and assessing the effectiveness of the program.",

Familial aggregation was also evaluated by tetrachoric correlations, odds ratios, and lambda statistics in 594 sibling pairs from 373 sibships. Results The prevalence of presbycusis conformed to previous research, increasing with age and male sex. Heritability estimates for presbycusis adjusted for age, sex, education level, and exposure to work noise exceeded 50%, and siblings of an affected relative were at 30% higher risk. When stratified by sex, estimates of familial aggregation were higher in women than men.

Gain and output were prescribed for 3 hearing loss configurations using National Acoustic Laboratories prescriptive procedures. Low-range hearing devices were measured electroacoustically, and technical specifications were used as the source of electroacoustic information for the midrange hearing devices. Results Overall, midrange hearing devices met gain and output targets to a greater extent than did low-range devices. All low-range devices could be classified as special-purpose hearing aids with low-frequency emphasis. The low-range group had high equivalent input noise levels and potentially posed a residual hearing safety hazard. Conclusions The low-range OTC devices were found to be electroacoustically inadequate to meet the needs of the hearing impaired. Midrange OTC hearing devices are arguably a good solution for the cost-conscious consumer who cannot afford professional audiologic rehabilitation, especially if considered an interim step in the rehabilitation process.",

Method After a brief overview of why people with hearing loss have greater difficulty in understanding speech than people with normal hearing, the authors describe a study that was aimed to predict speech intelligibility from audibility, psychoacoustic abilities, cognitive ability, and age. Results The study showed that the ability of people with hearing loss to extract speech information from an audible signal decreased with increase in hearing loss. This hearing loss desensitization was significantly related to hearing thresholds, sharpness of psychophysical tuning curves, presence of dead regions, age, and cognitive ability. After allowing for the effects of hearing loss, the authors found that speech intelligibility was significantly related to age and cognitive ability. The effects did not vary with frequency. Conclusions The current evidence supports the allowance of hearing loss desensitization in prescribing amplification that is aimed to maximize speech intelligibility.

Results Two studies that met the inclusion criteria were included in the review. Fourteen studies were excluded. There were substantive within-study clinical heterogeneities with regard to the baseline tinnitus handicap scores, duration of tinnitus, and severity of hearing loss in the included double-blind RCTs. Conclusion The authors of both studies reported that gabapentin was not superior to placebo in their primary outcomes. However, following the assessment of risk of bias and within-study clinical heterogeneities, this review concludes that there is insufficient evidence regarding the effect of gabapentin on tinnitus.",

To be specific, if clinicians are recommending bimodal stimulation, who programs the hearing aid in the bimodal condition, and what method is used for programming the hearing aid?An 11-question online survey was created and sent via email to a comprehensive list of cochlear implant programming centers in the United States. The survey was sent to 360 recipients.Respondents in this study represented a diverse group of clinical settings (response rate: 26%). Results indicate little agreement about who programs the hearing aids, when they are programmed, and how they are programmed in the bimodal condition. Analysis of small versus large implant centers indicated small centers are less likely to add a device to the contralateral ear.Although a growing number of cochlear implant recipients choose to wear a hearing aid on the contralateral ear, there is inconsistency in the current clinical approach to bimodal programming. These survey results provide evidence of large variability in the current bimodal programming practices and indicate a need for more structured clinical recommendations and programming approaches.",

Method Speech reception thresholds (SRTs) were determined using a matrix-sentence test. Unmodulated noise, modulated noise (International Collegium for Rehabilitative Audiology [ICRA] noise 5-250), and speech fragments (International Speech Test Signal [ISTS]) were used as background maskers. Verbal WM was assessed using the Verbal Learning and Memory Test (VLMT; Helmstaedter &amp; Durwen, 1990). Measurements were conducted with 14 normal-hearing older individuals and a control group of 12 normal-hearing young listeners. Results Despite their normal hearing ability, the young listeners outperformed the older individuals in all background maskers. These differences were largest for the modulated maskers. SRTs were significantly correlated with the scores of the VLMT. A linear regression model also included WM as the only significant predictor variable. Conclusions The results support the assumption that WM plays an important role for speech understanding and that it might have impact on results obtained using speech audiometry. Thus, an individual's WM capacity should be considered with aural diagnosis and rehabilitation. The VLMT proved to be a clinically applicable test for WM. Further cognitive functions important with speech understanding are currently being investigated within the SAKoLA ( Sprachaudiometrie und kognitive Leistungen im Alter [Speech Audiometry and Cognitive Functions in the Elderly]) project.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study was to analyze a database of completed International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA) questionnaires obtained from over 100,000 clients fitted with new hearing aids in Sweden during the period of 2012–2016. Mean IOI-HA total scores were correlated with degree of hearing loss, unilateral versus bilateral fitting, first-time versus return clients, gender, and variation among dispensing clinics. The correlations with expectations, service quality, and technical functioning of the hearing aids were also analyzed. Method Questionnaires containing the 7 IOI-HA items as well as questions concerning some additional issues were mailed to clients 3–6 months after fitting of new hearing aids. The questionnaires were returned to and analyzed by an independent research institute. Results More than 100 dispensing clinics nationwide take part in this project. A response rate of 52.6% resulted in 106,631 data sets after excluding incomplete questionnaires. Forty-six percent of the responders were women, and 54% were men. The largest difference in mean score (0.66) was found for the IOI-HA item “use” between return clients and first-time users. Women reported significantly higher (better) scores for the item “impact on others” compared with men. The bilaterally fitted subgroup reported significantly higher scores for all 7 items compared with the unilaterally fitted subgroup. Experienced users produced higher scores on benefit and satisfaction items, whereas first-time users gave higher scores for residual problems. No correlation was found between mean IOI-HA total score and average hearing threshold level (pure-tone average [PTA]). Mean IOI-HA total scores were found to correlate significantly with perceived service quality of the dispensing center and with the technical functionality of the hearing aids. Conclusions When comparing mean IOI-HA total scores from different studies or between groups, differences with regard to hearing aid experience, gender, and unilateral versus bilateral fitting have to be considered. No correlation was found between mean IOI-HA total score and degree of hearing loss in terms of PTA. Thus, PTA is not a reliable predictor of benefit and satisfaction of hearing aid provision as represented by the IOI-HA items. Identification of a specific lower fence in PTA for hearing aid candidacy is therefore to be avoided. Large differences were found in mean IOI-HA total scores related to different dispensing centers.",

Initial testing was completed on 29 normally hearing young adults to determine typical responses in dB SPL and reliability. Corrections to dB HL were determined for each stimulus. Twenty-seven adults and 5 children with hearing losses were tested. Results Average normal sound field thresholds were 1 dB HL. Aided thresholds for adults varied with unaided hearing level and were better for low-frequency sounds. Adults and children performed differently, possibly because of greater hearing aid gain for children.

Typical performance ranges may vary with hearing level and prescription. More data are required to fully characterize this trend in the pediatric population.",

Training and control subjects are older adults with mild-to-severe hearing loss. Subjects train for about 30 hr with monaurally presented, spectrally shaped stimuli (IU) or through loudspeakers with their own hearing aids (SPATS). Displays and feedback use auditory and visual/orthographic cues. Outcome measures include objective measures of speech recognition in noise and other training benefits. Results Significant improvements were observed in open-set recognition of trained sounds, words, phrases, and sentences. Large individual differences in training benefit were apparent. Generalization varied with the speech-perception task, competing noise, listening strategy, and pretraining scores. Conclusions High-level evidence is needed to support the effectiveness of auditory training for older adults as a supplement to aided listening. Studies are needed to predict who will benefit from specific types of training, to assess compliance and engagement, and to discover benefits beyond communication.",

This article presents user-innovated eHealth solutions targeting older persons with hearing impairment. Our research question was: What are the key users' needs, expectations, and visions within future hearing rehabilitation service delivery? Method We applied a participatory design approach to facilitate the design of future eHealth solutions via focus groups. We involved older persons with hearing impairment ( n = 36), significant others ( n = 10), and audiologists ( n = 8) following 2 methods: (a) human-centered design for interactive systems and (b) user innovation management. Through 3 rounds of focus groups, we facilitated a process progressing from insights and visions for requirements (Phase 1), to app such as paper version wireframes (Phase 2), and to digital prototypes envisioning future eHealth solutions (Phase 3). Each focus group was video-recorded and photographed, resulting in a rich data set that was analyzed through inductive thematic analysis. Results The results are presented via (a) a storyboard envisioning future client journeys, (b) 3 key themes for future eHealth solutions, (c) 4 levels of interest and willingness to invest time and effort in digital solutions, and (d) 2 technical savviness types and their different preferences for rehabilitation strategies. Conclusions Future eHealth solutions must offer personalized rehabilitation strategies that are appropriate for every person with hearing impairment and their level of technical savviness. Thus, a central requirement is anchoring of digital support in the clients' everyday life situations by facilitating easy access to personalized information, communication, and learning milieus. Moreover, the participants' visions for eHealth solutions call for providing both traditional analogue and digital services. Supplemental Material https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.7310729",

In a separate prospective study, 1,704 children were screened at school under typical conditions, and a subsample had complete audiological evaluations. Referral rates, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated for each screening level.Referral rates varied by grade and criterion level, with comparable results between the two data sets. In both studies, when the screening level increased, the sensitivity to MSHL declined markedly, whereas specificity increased in the prospective study.Screening at 25 dB yields poor sensitivity to MSHL. Converging evidence from these diverse populations supports using the 20 dB level to help identify MSHL. Multistage screening is recommended to limit referral rates. Even at 20 dB HL, cases of MSHL may be missed. Audiologists should encourage parents, educators, and speech–language pathologists to refer children suspected of hearing difficulty for complete audiological evaluations even if they pass school screenings.",

In about one third (21/56) of the subjects, there was no significant effect from any masker. In other subjects, 54.3% (19/35) showed a greater reduction for the S-Tones, 20% (7/35) showed a greater reduction with the noise, and 25.7% (9/35) showed similar performance between the 2 stimuli. The S-Tones showed a statistically significant benefit ( p < .01) versus noise at reducing the patient's tinnitus perception. Using low-level stimuli that were rated much softer than the subjects' baseline tinnitus, the S-Tones reduced the tinnitus loudness by 1.9 times the amount that noise did (about 28% on average, whereas the noise reduced the tinnitus by about 15%).S-Tones at the tinnitus pitch-match frequency are more likely to be effective than broadband noise at reducing tinnitus loudness.",

Across phases, nearly all respondents reported assessing speech perception both preoperatively and postoperatively. The most frequently used parent questionnaires were the Infant-Toddler Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (Robbins, Renshaw, & Berry, 1991), the Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (Robbins et al., 1991), and LittlEARS (Kuehn-Inacken, Weichboldt, Tsiakpini, Coninx, & D'Haese, 2003). The most commonly used speech perception measure for children <23 months of age was the Early Speech Perception Test-Low Verbal (ESP-LV; Moog & Geers, 1990). The most commonly used measures for children 24-35 months of age were the ESP-LV, the Northwestern University of Children's Perception of Speech (Elliot & Katz, 1980), and the Mr. Potato Head task (Robbins, 1993). For children >36 months of age, there was a wide variety of speech perception tests utilized. Patient follow-up visits were weekly or biweekly immediately following CI activation, then every 3 months for the remainder of the 1st year. After the 1st year, most children were seen semiannually.Although trends emerged, there is a lack of consistency in the selection of speech perception measures utilized across centers for children <36 months of age. The development of a working group to establish a standard minimum pediatric test battery (similar to the adult Minimum Speech Test Battery) would promote uniformity in clinical protocols used to assess children who receive CIs.",

Social media platforms are being used increasingly by patients to seek health-related information for various conditions including tinnitus. These online platforms may be used to seek guidance from and share experiences with individuals suffering from a similar disorder. Some social media platforms can also be used to communicate with health care providers. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of tinnitus-related information on social media platforms.The present investigation analyzed the portrayal of tinnitus-related information across 3 social media platforms: Facebook (pages and groups), Twitter, and YouTube. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the platforms using the key words \"tinnitus\" and \"ringing in the ears.\" The results on each platform were manually examined by 2 reviewers based on social media activity metrics, such as \"likes,\" \"followers,\" and \"comments.\"The different social media platforms yielded diverse results, allowing individuals to learn about tinnitus, seek support, advocate for tinnitus awareness, and connect with medical professionals. The greatest activity was seen on Facebook pages, followed by YouTube videos. Various degrees of misinformation were found across all social media platforms.The present investigation reveals copious amounts of tinnitus-related information on different social media platforms, which the community with tinnitus may use to learn about and cope with the condition. Audiologists must be aware that tinnitus sufferers often turn to social media for additional help and should understand the current climate of how tinnitus is portrayed. Clinicians should be equipped to steer individuals with tinnitus toward valid information.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Counseling practices in audiology play a critical role in helping patients and families understand, accept, and adjust to the dynamic impacts ear-related disorders have on their lives. The purpose of this study was to identify what competencies (i.e., knowledge, skills, and attitudes) are important for audiologists to possess to provide effective counseling in practice. Method A modified Delphi study design was used to survey a panel of 33 professionals with expertise in audiologic counseling from 5 different countries. In the 1st survey round, experts were asked to respond to 3 open-ended prompts. Responses were condensed and revised into items experts were asked to rate during the 2nd and 3rd survey rounds, on a 6-point Likert scale of importance. Results A total of 819 items were generated from the open-ended prompts. A total of 72 items were included in the 2nd and 3rd rounds of survey instruments. Consensus was met on 64 audiologic counseling competency items. Conclusions The competency items identified in this study reflect important knowledge, skills, and attitudes that are important to audiologic counseling. Items that met consensus in this study can inform competencies audiology students can acquire during graduate training. Practice guidelines in the field currently lack the necessary clarity and detail needed for implementation of counseling competencies in clinical education. Future research is needed to explore factors important for implementation of evidence-based counseling training in graduate audiology programs.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The goal of this study was to assess whether peripheral auditory sensitivity in frequency regions above 8 kHz is related to central inhibitory function, as measured through a sensory gating paradigm, in normal-hearing adults with tinnitus (TINN) and without tinnitus (NTINN). The contribution of gating processes and peripheral sensitivity in extended high frequencies to tinnitus severity was evaluated via a hierarchical multiple regression method. Method Cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) were recorded in response to pairs of tones in normal-hearing adults without tinnitus, NTINN ( n = 45), and adults with tinnitus, TINN ( n = 21). CAEP peak component amplitude, latency, and gating indices were compared and correlated with extended high-frequency (EHF) pure-tone averages (PTAs) across groups and with tinnitus severity. An exploratory analysis was performed to investigate gating variability within the TINN group. Based on Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (Newman, Jacobson, &amp; Spitzer, 1996) median scores, the TINN group was categorized into low- and high-median subgroups, and gating indices were compared between these subgroups. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the amount of variance accounted for in the TINN group. Results Decreased gating via the CAEP Pa component and increased gating via the N1 component correlated with increased tinnitus severity, even in individuals who would traditionally be classified as having no tinnitus handicap. In the TINN group, lower EHF PTA thresholds correlated with tinnitus severity and decreased Pa gating. Individuals with a greater severity of tinnitus demonstrated atypical gating function reflected in both Pa and N1 components. Gating function and EHF PTA accounted for significant variance regarding tinnitus severity. Conclusions A trade-off between lower and higher level gating function was observed in adults with normal hearing and tinnitus, indicative of higher order compensatory mechanisms. Better cochlear sensitivity in extended high frequencies was related to decreased lower level gating processes and increased tinnitus THI scores, suggestive of an interaction between decreased gating and heightened auditory awareness. We are currently exploring whether gating processes in this population are compensatory, and the role of gating in auditory awareness.",

Design This was a review of studies identified from the literature having both pure-tone audiometry and functional measures of speech communication from relatively large samples of older adults. Study sample Three population or population–sample data sets and 2 clinical data sets were identified and included in the review. Results As the WHO-HI grade progressed from “normal” to “severe” (insufficient data from older adults were available for the “profound” category), each step in this progression led to a significant difference in functional communication relative to all other WHO-HI grades. This was true for self-report measures of speech communication and direct measures of speech recognition in quiet and noise. Cohen's d effect sizes were moderate to very large between each successive step on the WHO-HI grading scale. Conclusions The long-standing WHO-HI grading system, developed through expert opinion and adopted by WHO originally in 1991, is validated here with evidence from studies of functional communication in older adults. The WHO-HI grade system is compared to a proposed new WHO-HI grade system that introduces several changes to the grading system.",

Method A website was created for people with tinnitus to complete a variety of questions. Results The 1,788 subjects who responded to questionnaires came from 53 different countries; 413 (23.1%) reported taking supplements. No effect on tinnitus was reported in 70.7%, improvement in 19.0%, and worsening in 10.3%. Adverse effects were reported in 6% ( n = 36), including bleeding, diarrhea, headache, and others. Supplements were reported to be helpful for sleep: melatonin (effect size, d = 1.228) and lipoflavonoid ( d = 0.5244); emotional reactions: melatonin ( d = 0.6138) and lipoflavonoid ( d = 0.457); hearing: Ginkgo biloba ( d = 0.3758); and concentration Ginkgo biloba ( d = 0.3611). The positive, subjective reports should be interpreted cautiously; many might have reported a positive effect because they were committed to treatment and expected a benefit. Users of supplements were more likely to have loudness hyperacusis and to have a louder tinnitus. Conclusions The use of dietary supplements to treat tinnitus is common, particularly with Ginkgo biloba , lipoflavonoids, magnesium, melatonin, vitamin B12, and zinc. It is likely that some supplements will help with sleep for some patients. However, they are generally not effective, and many produced adverse effects. We concluded that dietary supplements should not be recommended to treat tinnitus but could have a positive outcome on tinnitus reactions in some people.",

In addition, parents reported the number of hours their children used hearing aids at school.Nearly 24% of children were observed not wearing their hearing aids in the classroom on either observation day. Both grade level and degree of hearing loss appeared to affect hearing aid use. Children in Grades 5-7 and those with milder hearing losses were less likely to wear hearing aids. Overall, parents accurately reported classroom hearing aid use; however, those with children in Grades 5-7 were less accurate than those with children in earlier grades.These preliminary results suggest that children with milder hearing loss and those in Grades 5-7 are at increased risk for reduced hearing aid use in the classroom. Also, parents of school-age children in these later grades are less accurate reporters of classroom hearing aid use compared to parents of children in earlier grades.",

These services have not been standardized, and patients are vulnerable to receiving services that may appear legitimate but are not based on research evidence. The purpose of this clinical focus article is to promote standardization of tinnitus services by proposing an efficient clinical protocol for audiologists. Method The suggested clinical protocol is based primarily on research conducted at the National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research for the past 2 decades, with the focus on 2 randomized controlled trials completed recently that showed efficacy of an audiologic protocol involving hearing aids and brief tinnitus counseling. The protocol is mostly consistent with clinical practice guidelines that have been published. Results The two National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research randomized controlled trials revealed significant reduction of tinnitus functional effects for both hearing aids and “combination instruments” (hearing aids with a built-in sound generator), although there were no significant differences between devices. Existing clinical practice guidelines for tinnitus are summarized with respect to their common recommendations for assessment and intervention. Conclusions A defined clinical protocol is suggested for audiologists, which includes a case history, appropriate referral, audiologic assessment, use of the Tinnitus and Hearing Survey ( Henry, Griest, et al., 2015 ), brief tinnitus counseling, hearing aids or combination instruments as warranted, follow-up assessment, and criteria for determining if further tinnitus-specific services are needed. Use of this protocol can help to promote standardization of tinnitus practice by audiologists.",

    "abstract": "Purpose There is a growing body of literature that suggests a linkage between impaired auditory function, increased listening effort, and fatigue in children and adults with hearing loss. Research suggests this linkage may be associated with hearing loss-related variations in diurnal cortisol levels. Here, we examine variations in cortisol profiles between young adults with and without severe sensorineural hearing loss and examine associations between cortisol and subjective measures of listening effort and fatigue. Method This study used a repeated-measures, matched-pair design. Two groups (n = 8 per group) of adults enrolled in audiology programs participated, 1 group of adults with hearing loss (AHL) and 1 matched control group without hearing loss. Salivary cortisol samples were collected at 7 time points over a 2-week period and used to quantify physiological stress. Subjective measures of listening effort, stress, and fatigue were also collected to investigate relationships between cortisol levels, perceived stress, and fatigue. Results Subjective ratings revealed that AHL required significantly more effort and concentration on typical auditory tasks than the control group. Likewise, complaints of listening-related fatigue were more frequent and more of a problem in everyday life for AHL compared to the control group. There was a significant association between subjective ratings of listening effort and listening-related fatigue for our AHL, but not for the control group. In contrast, there was no significant difference in cortisol measures between groups, nor were there significant associations between cortisol and any subjective measure. Conclusions Young AHL experience more effortful listening than their normal hearing peers. This increased effort is associated with increased reports of listening-related fatigue. However, diurnal cortisol profiles were not significantly different between groups nor were they associated with these perceived differences.",

    "abstract": "Purpose This dual-aim study was intended to develop and validate a new fitting paradigm for over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids. Aim 1 was undertaken to create a limited set of evidence-based preconfigured gain-frequency responses (\"presets\") for use in OTC devices. Aim 2 tested the efficacy of the presets relative to best-practice verification and determined the best method(s) for older adults to self-select amplification from the set. Method In Aim 1, audiometry data from 267 older adults with mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database. Using these data and the National Acoustic Laboratories-Non-Linear 2 (NAL-NL2) prescriptive formula, a set of four presets were created that can fit a large percentage of older Americans with presbycusis. In Aim 2, 37 older adults with hearing loss used five methods to select presets. The selection methods were select-by-audiogram, select-by-self-test, select-by-trying, select-by-questionnaire, and random assignment. Using a crossover design, each participant completed speech recognition testing and sound quality ratings in quiet and noise for all selection methods and a verified NAL-NL2 condition. Results The set of presets can fit 67.9% of older Americans with mild-to-moderate hearing loss (Aim 1). Controlling for hearing thresholds and sound quality ratings, liner mixed-effects models indicated that speech recognition scores for select-by-audiogram, select-by-self-test, and select-by-trying were not statistically different from the NAL-NL2 condition. Statistical analysis indicated that select-by-self-test produced outcomes most consistent with individual outcomes for the NAL-NL2 condition (Aim 2). Conclusion This newly developed fitting paradigm may provide efficacy comparable to best-practice verification and could be used in OTC hearing aids.",

Method: A single-blinded, counterbalanced crossover design was used. Eleven hearing-impaired adults were bilaterally fitted with behind-the-ear devices with NM either activated (NMon) or deactivated. For the retrospective self-reports, the short scale of the Speech, Spatial, and Qualities Hearing Scale questionnaire (SSQ12) was applied. For the EMAs, smartphone-based self-reports combined with hearing aid (HA)–based classifications of the listening environments (“soundscapes”) experienced by the participants was used. To explore potential associations with the real-life data, two laboratory measures of aided speech recognition in noise were administered. Results: The soundscapes in which the participants submitted their EMAs were representative of the soundscapes they experienced during normal HA use and of the soundscapes reported in the literature for older HA users. The SSQ12 and EMA scores both showed an overall benefit from NMon. The EMA scores, together with the logged acoustic data, revealed that this benefit was driven by NMon being preferred particularly in listening environments classified as “speech” or “speech in noise.” The laboratory measures of aided speech recognition in noise were unable to predict the real-life data. Conclusions: EMA combined with acoustic data-logging is suited for more targeted evaluations of real-life HA benefit. Advanced NM settings can provide subjective user benefits in specific listening situations.",

The mean age of the 14 audiology students participating in this study was 24.79 years (SD = 1.58). Participants completed a pre- and postevent questionnaire in which they rated their level of confidence for specific knowledge and skills. Six students (2 students in each scenario) volunteered to participate in the infant hearing screening and counseling scenarios, whereas others participated as observers. All participants participated in the briefing and debriefing sessions immediately before and after each of 3 scenarios. After the last scenario, participants were asked to complete a satisfaction survey of their learning experience using simulation and standardized parents.Overall, the pre- and post-simulation event questionnaire revealed a significant improvement in the participants' self-rated confidence levels regarding knowledge and skills.

Method Vowel–consonant–vowel sounds in a multiple-choice consonant discrimination task were used. Recordings from a professional male native English speaker were used. A novel adaptive staircase procedure was developed, based on the estimated intelligibility of stimuli rather than on theoretical binomial models. Test performance was assessed in a population of 26 young adults (YAs) with normal hearing and in 72 unscreened adults (UAs), including native and nonnative English listeners. Results The proposed test provided accurate estimates of the speech recognition threshold (SRT) compared to a conventional adaptive procedure. Consistent outcomes were observed in YAs in test/retest and in controlled/uncontrolled conditions and in UAs in native and nonnative listeners. The SRT increased with increasing age, hearing loss, and self-reported hearing handicap in UAs. Test duration was similar in YAs and UAs irrespective of age and hearing loss. The test–retest repeatability of SRTs was high (Pearson correlation coefficient = .84), and the pass/fail outcomes of the test were reliable in repeated measures (Cohen's κ = .8). The test was accurate in identifying ears with pure-tone thresholds &gt; 25 dB HL (accuracy = 0.82). Conclusion This study demonstrated the viability of the proposed test in subjects of varying language in terms of accuracy, reliability, and short test time. Further research is needed to validate the test in a larger population across a wider range of languages and hearing loss and to identify optimal classification criteria for screening purposes.",

This systematic review aimed to investigate how intersubject differences in cognition could influence the aided benefit for speech understanding and listening effort with bilateral digital hearing aids. Method Articles were selected through systematic searches in MEDLINE, Embase, Central, and reference lists. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. Results The initial search resulted in 1,092 unique hits, of which 16 were included. The effect of cognition on the aided benefit in terms of speech understanding and listening effort was examined in 12 and four studies, respectively. The aided speech and listening effort benefit obtained from hearing aid use in general or from a specific digital feature (i.e., microphone directionality, noise reduction, amplitude compression, and frequency compression) was associated with four cognitive functions (i.e., working memory, processing speed, selective attention, and executive functions). Conclusions Hearing aid users with poorer cognitive functioning derived more aided benefit in terms of speech understanding from hearing aid settings facilitating the matching process between the incoming auditory signal and representations stored in long-term memory. However, since the number of included studies was limited, this trend should be interpreted with caution. Supplemental Material https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.13626509",

    "abstract": "Purpose A need exists to investigate the short- and long-term impact of noise exposures during and following military service on auditory health. Currently available questionnaires are limited in their ability to meet this need because of (a) inability to evaluate noise exposures beyond a limited time frame, (b) lack of consensus on scoring, (c) inability to assess impulse exposures (e.g., firearm use), (d) lack of a single questionnaire that assesses both military and nonmilitary exposures, and (e) lack of validity and reliability data. To address these limitations, the Lifetime Exposure to Noise and Solvents Questionnaire (LENS-Q) was developed. The purpose of this report is to describe the development and initial validation of the LENS-Q as a measure of self-reported noise exposure. Method Six hundred ninety participants, consisting of current Service members and recently military-separated (within about 2.5 years) Veterans, completed the LENS-Q, additional study questionnaires, and comprehensive audiometric testing. Noise exposure scores were computed from LENS-Q responses using a simple scoring algorithm that distinguishes between different cumulative levels of exposure and allows for the inclusion of both continuous and impulse noise exposures. Results The LENS-Q demonstrates good construct validity as evidenced by measures of hearing loss, tinnitus, and subjective hearing difficulties all increasing with an increase in noise exposure scores. A logistic regression, adjusting for age and sex, revealed that participants in the highest exposure group were 2.4–3.9 times more likely to experience hearing loss, 2.7–2.8 times more likely to experience tinnitus, and 3.0–3.7 times more likely to report hearing difficulties compared with individuals in the lowest exposure group. Conclusions The LENS-Q captures noise exposure over an individual's lifetime and provides an alternative scoring metric capable of representing exposure to both continuous and impulse noise. Findings suggest that the LENS-Q is a valuable tool for capturing and measuring both military and nonmilitary noise exposure. Supplemental Material https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.14582937",

    "abstract": "Hyperacusis is the most common of the different types of sound tolerance conditions. It has been defined as physical discomfort or pain when any sound reaches a certain level of loudness that would be comfortable for most people. Because hyperacusis and tinnitus occur together so often, it has been theorized that they have a common neural mechanism. A leading contender for that mechanism is enhancement of auditory gain. The purpose of this tutorial is to review the evidence that sound/acoustic therapy can reduce auditory gain and, thereby, can increase loudness tolerance for people with hyperacusis and/or suppress the percept of tinnitus.The scientific literature was informally reviewed to identify and elucidate relationships between tinnitus, hyperacusis, sound therapy, and auditory gain.Evidence exists, both in animal and human studies, that enhanced auditory gain is associated with hyperacusis and tinnitus. Further evidence supports the theory that certain forms of sound therapy can reduce neural hyperactivity, thereby reducing auditory gain. The evidence for sound therapy reducing auditory gain is stronger for hyperacusis than it is for tinnitus.Based on results from numerous studies, sound therapy clearly has application as a method of desensitization for hyperacusis. Enhanced auditory gain might be responsible for tinnitus, but other mechanisms have been theorized. A review of the relevant literature leads to the conclusion that some form(s) of sound therapy has the potential to suppress or eliminate tinnitus on a long-term basis. Systematic research is needed to evaluate this premise.",

Clinical management of patients with FHDs is the subject of considerable debate, with few evidence-based guidelines to direct patient care. A better understanding of the characteristics of patients who seek help for FHDs, as well as current audiological management practices, is needed to direct research efforts to the areas greatest opportunity for advancement of clinical care.A retrospective chart review was conducted examining the medical records of a random sample of 100 Veterans who underwent auditory processing assessments across the VA Health Care System between 2008 and 2020.Patients were young to middle-age, often with previous traumatic brain injury or blast exposure. Mental health, sleep, and pain disorders were common. No consistent relationships emerged between specific patient factors and domains of auditory processing deficits. Low-gain hearing aids were provided to 35 patients, 69% of whom continued wearing their hearing aids for at least 2 years.Future research should address the potential overlap in symptoms and treatment for comorbid health conditions and FHDs, as well as the conditions underlying successful hearing aid use in this patient population.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Noise reduction technologies in hearing aids provide benefits under controlled conditions. However, differences in their real-life effectiveness are not established. We propose that a deep neural network (DNN)–based noise reduction system trained on naturalistic sound environments will provide different real-life benefits compared to traditional systems. Method: Real-life listening experiences collected with Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs) of participants who used two premium models of hearing aid are compared. One hearing aid model (HA1) used traditional noise reduction; the other hearing aid model (HA2) used DNN-based noise reduction. Participants reported listening experiences several times a day while ambient SPL, SNR, and hearing aid volume adjustments were recorded. Forty experienced hearing aid users completed a total of 3,614 EMAs and recorded 6,812 hr of sound data across two 14-day wear periods. Results: Linear mixed-effects analysis document that participants' assessments of ambient noisiness were positively associated with SPL and negatively associated with SNR but are not otherwise affected by hearing aid model. Likewise, mean satisfaction with the two models did not differ. However, individual satisfaction ratings for HA1 were dependent on ambient SNR, which was not the case for HA2. Conclusions: Hearing aids with DNN-based noise reduction resulted in consistent sound satisfaction regardless of the level of background noise compared to hearing aids implementing noise reduction based on traditional statistical models. While the two hearing aid models also differed on other parameters (e.g., shape), these differences are unlikely to explain the difference in how background noise impacts sound satisfaction with the aids.

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study explored user perspectives on the relationship between hearing aid cost and uptake, as well as cost-related recommendations for others with hearing difficulties, in a sample of prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aid users. Method: A secondary analysis was conducted on a cross-sectional survey using qualitative content analysis to analyze responses related to the cost of hearing aids. The study included a total of 241 adult participants, comprising 179 prescription hearing aid users from the Hearing Tracker website and 62 OTC hearing aid users from the Lexie Hearing U.S. database. Results: Prescription users had a mean age of 66.7 years ( SD = 13.2), including 62.0% males, 37.4% females, and 0.6% nonbinary individuals. OTC users had a mean age of 63.0 years ( SD = 13.4), with 48.4% males and 51.6% females. Three overarching domains were identified: perceived enablers to hearing aid uptake related to the cost, perceived barriers to hearing aid uptake related to the cost, and recommendations to others with hearing difficulties related to the cost, with 14 categories recognized for prescription users and 12 for OTC users. Both groups identified the high cost of hearing aids and lack of insurance coverage as significant barriers to uptake. Many prescription users reported external support (e.g., financial support and health insurance coverage) as an enabler, while OTC users frequently mentioned the affordability of OTC devices. The most common recommendation among prescription users was to seek professional support, whereas OTC users recommended researching hearing aids before making a purchase. Conclusions: Cost and insurance coverage consistently emerge as primary barriers to hearing aid adoption for both prescription and OTC users. To foster greater accessibility, initiatives should target these financial obstacles. Additional research is warranted on the relationship between hearing aid cost and uptake, especially among OTC users and those seeking financial assistance.

In this study, the nine lists were tested for equivalency and the test-retest reliability was determined. Twenty listeners with normal hearing and 20 listeners with sloping sensorineural hearing losses served as subjects. Five sentences were presented at each SNR at each level, and five key words in each sentence were scored (100 key words per presentation level). Each key word was scored as correct or incorrect, with errors of plurality scored as half-correct words. for percent-correct scores, Lists 1, 2, and 9 and Lists 3, 4, and 5 were found to be equivalent for listeners with normal hearing. For both groups of listeners, the test-retest correlations were high, and the critical differences appropriate for sentence material were 10 to16% at a .95 level of confidence. Because of floor and ceiling effects across the different lists, many subjects with normal hearing did not score as low as the 50% level, and many subjects with hearing loss did not score as high as 50%. Suggestions are offered for alternate scoring in order to obtain a SNR for 50% performance. Future versions of this test should be designed with improved list equivalency and 50% performance capability.",

Signals were delivered acoustically to both groups of subjects through a loudspeaker. P-300 peak latencies for the implant recipients were significantly longer than those for the hearing subjects for the 500-1000 and 500-2000 Hz frequency contrast conditions, but not for the 500-3000 Hz contrast condition. For the hearing subjects, P3 latency did not change significantly across the three frequency contrast conditions; however, for the implant recipients, P3 latencies were significantly longer for the 500-1000 Hz signal contrasts than for 500-2000 and 500-3000 Hz signal contrasts. These results suggest that although implant recipients had more difficulty than hearing subjects in discriminating the 500-1000 and 500-2000 Hz contrasts, the implant recipients and hearing subjects discriminated the widest 500-3000 Hz frequency contrast equally well. The ERP appears to be a reliable index of signal detection and discrimination in cochlear implant recipients and consequently may be useful for device programming and for monitoring the progress of these individuals.",

Paradise (1994), this article addresses the public health tenets that need to be in place before screening programs, or in this case, a change in screening practice (use of a 2-step screening protocol) can be justified. Results: There are no data to suggest that a 2-step OAE/A-ABR screening protocol should be avoided. Conclusion: Research is needed before any change in public policy and practice surrounding current early hearing detection and intervention programs could be supported.",

Survey instruments measured families' satisfaction and anxiety associated with each stage of the EHDI process. Results Of the 4,138 families surveyed, 1,106 (27%) responded. Families reported satisfaction with screening services (Group 1 = 88%; Group 2 = 86%; Group 3 = 75%), and few reported anxiety prior to the hearing screening (Group 1= 4%; Group 2 = 15%; Group 3 = 19%). Among families requiring retesting services, 97% of Group 2 and 87% of Group 3 families were satisfied. Among Group 3 families, 94% reported satisfaction with the care their audiologist was providing, and 79% were satisfied with their early intervention services overall.

Neither of these models was based on data from peer-reviewed sources. Method This is a retrospective study that reviewed 178 records of children diagnosed with (C)APD, of which 48 were retained for analysis. Results More than 80% of the children could be classified into one of the Buffalo Model categories, while more than 90% remained unclassified under the Bellis/Ferre Model. This discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the classification of the Buffalo Model is based primarily on a single central auditory test (Staggered Spondaic Word), whereas the Bellis/Ferre Model classification uses a combination of auditory test results. Conclusion The 2 models provide a conceptual framework for (C)APD, but they must be further refined to be fully applicable in clinical settings.",

Method Fourteen adults reporting tinnitus were trained to use a standardized loudness scale, and then they used that response scale to assess loudness of nonstandard stimuli and of their tinnitus. We also measured tinnitus loudness and pitch using a computer-based matching procedure, and we measured the impact of tinnitus on daily living using the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI; C. W. Newman, G. P. Jacobson, &amp; J. B. Spitzer, 1996) for those 14 individuals and an additional 2 participants. Results and Conclusions Our 14 trained participants judged loudness similarly to normal hearing participants for pure tones at normal hearing, nontinnitus frequencies—implying that their judgments of tinnitus loudness were valid. Constrained scaling of tinnitus loudness yielded measurements that were substantially greater than the sensation level of sounds matched to tinnitus loudness. Our total of 16 participants fell into 2 groups on the basis of hearing loss, extent of abnormal loudness growth at the tinnitus frequency, and several aspects of tinnitus experience. Finally, as previously found, there was little correlation between tinnitus loudness, no matter how measured, and the impact of tinnitus on daily life as measured by the THI.",

Of considerable interest is that a directional decrement was observed in the absence of directional benefit when sources of interest were both in front of and behind the participants. In addition, limiting directional processing to the low frequencies eliminated both the directional deficit and the directional advantage. Conclusions Although these data support the use of directional hearing aids in some noisy school environments, they also suggest that use of the directional mode should be limited to situations in which all talkers of interest are located in the front hemisphere.

Results Nearly one third (31.5%) of children with HL had 1 or more CBDs. The presence of CBDs prolonged the time of the initial infant hearing screening, which contributed to further delays in the subsequent diagnosis of HL.

For only later-identified children, regression models were used to investigate relationships among predictor variables and dependent variables related to service delivery. Results Children who referred from the NHS received follow-up services at younger ages than later-identified children. Later-identified children had significantly longer delays from HL confirmation to entry into early intervention, compared to children who referred from the NHS. For later-identified children, degree of HL predicted ages at follow-up clinical services. Children with more severe HL received services at younger ages compared to children with milder HL. Gender predicted the length of the delay from confirmation to entry into early intervention, with girls demonstrating shorter delays. Conclusions The current results lend support to the need for ongoing hearing monitoring programs after the neonatal period, particularly when children enter early intervention programs because of language/developmental delays.",

The first 2 experiments were in the categorical perception paradigm: tone identification and tone discrimination for a series of stimuli, the F0 contour of which systematically varied from Tone 2 to Tone 3. In the third experiment, the just-noticeable differences of pitch contour discrimination were measured for both groups.In the measures of categorical perception, older listeners showed significantly shallower slopes in the tone identification function and significantly smaller peakedness in the tone discrimination function compared with younger listeners. Moreover, the thresholds of pitch contour discrimination were significantly higher for older listeners than for younger listeners.These results suggest that aging reduced the categoricality of Mandarin tone perception and worsened the psychoacoustic capacity to discriminate pitch contour changes, thereby possibly leading to older listeners' difficulty in identifying Tones 2 and 3.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Tinnitus is the perception of noise without a corresponding external stimulus. Current management typically aims to moderate associated psychosocial stressors and allow sufferers to retain an adequate quality of life. With the increasing recognition of the Internet as a repository for health advice, information, and support, the online support group has become a popular coping strategy for those living with chronic conditions such as tinnitus. Patients find that communicating with each other, providing encouragement, and sharing information in the absence of physical and temporal boundaries are invaluable ways of managing their condition. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential positive and negative consequences of participating in online support groups for tinnitus. Method Discussion forum threads were collated from across 4 public online support group websites. All threads were initiated between February and April 2016. Texts from these threads were coded by 3 separate analysts using both inductive and deductive thematic analysis, until data saturation was reached. Results Analysis of 75 threads (641 individual posts) found 9 independent themes pertaining to aspects of participation in tinnitus online support groups. The results revealed that using the forums allowed users to exchange knowledge and experiences, express complex emotions, profit from a network of support, and engage in everyday conversation away from the burden of their tinnitus. However, some experiences appeared to be compromised by negative messages, limited communication, and informational issues such as conflicting advice or information overload. Conclusions This study represents the 1st research into discussion forums in tinnitus online support groups. A nonintrusive (passive) analysis method was used, whereby messages comprising the dataset were retrieved without direct interaction with the discussion forum. Individuals and the community of tinnitus online support groups are deemed to be at low risk from potential harm in this study. Most tinnitus patients likely benefit from accessing online support groups, for example, they discover they are not alone, and they find new coping strategies. However, for those who are particularly vulnerable or prone to psychological stress, accessing these groups could be detrimental.",

The device was then used to test 34 infants in awake and asleep states. The advantages of the Kalman-weighted averaging method were modeled in terms of time saved for conducting an ABR evaluation.Kalman-weighted ABR threshold estimates were 6-7 dB lower than with conventional methods during induced motor noise. When used to obtain ABRs in infants who were awake, the number of sweeps required to obtain a result was significantly greater than that required for a sleeping infant but well within the range for clinical application.The use of Kalman-weighted averaging provides a measurable advantage over conventional methods and may reduce costs for the pediatric audiology practice.",

Of interest was the role of acoustic hearing for speech perception in a complex background, the role of listening experience for CI-alone conditions, and whether performance with electric-acoustic stimulation (EAS) was improved by a contralateral hearing aid (HA).Eleven subjects provided data on Consonant-Nucleus-Consonant (CNC; Peterson & Lehiste, 1962) words in quiet, City University of New York (CUNY; Boothroyd, Hanin, & Hnath, 1985) sentences in steady noise, and Bamford-Kowal-Bench (Bench, Kowal, & Bamford, 1979) sentences in multitalker babble. Listening conditions included: CI with a full-frequency map, CI with a truncated-frequency map, EAS, and EAS+HA (EAS plus contralateral HA). Sounds were presented at 0° azimuth.For CNC words and CUNY sentences, performance was better with the truncated-frequency than the full-frequency map, and performance with EAS was better than for either CI-alone condition. For Bench-Kowal-Bamford sentences, EAS+HA was better than EAS.As demonstrated previously, performance was better in the EAS condition than either CI-alone condition. Better performance in the truncated-frequency than full-frequency CI-alone condition suggests that listening experience may be important.

Analyses included >1,200 adults whose ages ranged from 40s to 90s, with >16,000 audiograms and speech recognition scores. A multivariable generalized linear repeated mixed model assessed changes in thresholds and speech recognition over time.Word recognition in quiet declined significantly while controlling for threshold increases, and declines appeared to accelerate near age 65-70. Scores for males were poorer than for females even after controlling for gender differences in thresholds, but rates of decline did not differ by gender. Smaller declines in key word recognition in babble were observed and declines appeared to accelerate near age 75-80.Additional evidence is needed from large-scale longitudinal cohort studies to determine rates of change of auditory function across the lifespan. These studies can identify associations with modifiable risk factors and potential mechanisms to reduce, prevent, or delay the onset of age-related hearing loss.",

TEOAEs were measured bilaterally with 80 dB peSPL nonlinear clicks and 60 dB peSPL linear clicks with and without a contralateral broadband noise elicitor at 65 dB SPL. Absolute TEOAE inhibition and normalized TEOAE inhibition (i.e., percentage of inhibition) were examined.With both 80 and 60 dB peSPL evoking stimuli, there were significant main effects of ear and sex (p < .05). TEOAE levels were larger in women and in the right ear. There were no statistically significant main effects of ear and sex on absolute TEOAE inhibition (p > .05). Significant main effects of ear and sex were, however, found with normalized TEOAE inhibition (p < .05; greater in men and in the left ear). Statistically significant negative correlations and significant linear predictive relations were found between TEOAE levels and normalized TEOAE inhibitions in both ears (p < .001). There is no evidence of the same with absolute inhibition of TEOAEs (p > .05).If one considers that efferent inhibition of TEOAEs is an absolute quantity, the significant effect of ear and sex on normalized inhibition and the negative association and linear predictive relationship between TEOAE level and inhibition can be viewed as spurious effects. As such, contralateral inhibition of TEOAEs does not suggest sex or ear laterality effects.",

Method Community workers underwent training to conduct video otoscopy using the ENTraview device. Community workers conducted video otoscopy on 160 individuals with cleft lip and palate between 3 and 35 years old in the community. Middle ear conditions were identified using store-and-forward telepractice. Diagnostic telehearing evaluation was conducted using synchronous pure tone audiometry and tympanometry for those who were identified with tympanic membrane (TM) and/or middle ear diseases (MEDs). A review of data collected over a 13-month period was carried out to assess coverage and follow-up intervention rates. Results The program was successful in achieving 80% coverage for identification of TM and MEDs within 13 months of program implementation. TM and/or MEDs were identified in 26% (82/320 ears) of those who underwent video otoscopy. Telehearing evaluations were completed on 42 ears of individuals with TM and/or MEDs; 52% (22/42 ears) of these individuals had a minimal, mild, or moderate degree of hearing loss. Regarding follow-up for intervention, 78% qualified for surgical intervention, and 31% qualified for medication. Conclusions This grassroots-level telemedicine approach was successful in achieving better coverage, and store-and-forward telepractice helped in providing remote diagnosis and recommendation by otolaryngologists to all individuals with TM/MEDs in the rural community. The follow-up for otological intervention significantly improved from that achieved in the previous years.",

We will also discuss challenges associated with pediatric CI programming that are unique to the use of distance technology, and we will describe ways to overcome those challenges. Last, we will review the results from 2 recent studies specifically targeted toward testing behavioral thresholds in young children with CIs.Conditioned play audiometry or visual reinforcement audiometry was used to measure behavioral thresholds (T levels) for 35 young children with CIs (n = 19 for conditioned play audiometry and n = 16 for visual reinforcement audiometry). Participants were tested in the traditional in-person condition and in the remote condition using an AB-BA study design over 2 visits.There was no significant difference in T levels between the in-person and remote conditions, indicating that it is feasible to test young children using conventional pediatric testing procedures via remote technology. The primary challenges encountered were in regard to proper camera and video monitor placement at the remote site and the timing of communication between the audiologist and test assistant.The results from studies to date suggest that distance technology can be used successfully to program CI sound processors for young children using standard, age-appropriate testing techniques. The alternative of remote testing has substantial implications for reducing time and travel burdens for families, potentially leading to the construction of appropriate maps for young children with CIs in a timelier manner.",

Many people who experience tinnitus often turn to the Internet and applications (apps) on their smartphones to acquire information on tinnitus and solutions to \"cure\" tinnitus. The aim of this study was to evaluate and summarize features offered by tinnitus-related apps on different mobile platforms. Method This study was conducted on 3 mobile platforms-Apple iOS, Google Android, and Windows. The key word tinnitus was searched, and all free and paid apps were downloaded. Relevant apps were reviewed in-depth and then classified into 4 categories based on their functionality-\"tinnitus education, awareness, and prevention,\" \"tinnitus assessment and measurement,\" \"tinnitus management,\" and \"misinformation.\" Results All mobile platforms yielded both free and paid tinnitus apps, allowing individuals to learn more about tinnitus, assess and measure their own tinnitus, gain access to different sounds to help manage their tinnitus, and find strategies to better cope with their tinnitus. The Google Android platform revealed the most number of tinnitus apps. The \"tinnitus management\" category consistently outperformed the other categories-containing the most number of apps and the most number of features. A small proportion of misinformation apps were detected across platforms. There were no significant differences in the total number of features between free and paid apps (except on the Windows platform). A cost-feature analysis revealed that more expensive apps did not necessarily offer more number of features. Conclusions This study reveals that a variety of tinnitus-related apps-both free and paid-are available on different mobile platforms. Clinicians should be aware that patients with tinnitus often rely on apps for additional help and should be prepared to direct them to valid apps. Implications for end users are discussed as well.

The secondary purpose was to evaluate the relationship between age at implantation and ratings on the CAP and SIR.Forty children with congenital sensorineural hearing loss participated. Preimplant parental ratings on the CAP and SIR were obtained, and all the children underwent cochlear implantation. Intracochlear EABRs were recorded postimplantation. Postimplant parental ratings on the CAP and SIR were obtained. The relationships between EABR parameters and auditory performance and speech intelligibility outcomes were studied. The effect of age at implantation on auditory performance and speech intelligibility outcomes was also investigated.A significant negative correlation was found between EABR wave V thresholds and SIR growth (r = -.415, p = .016). Children with better CAP growths tended to have lower wave V thresholds than those with poorer CAP growths. Age at implantation had an effect on the auditory performance as measured using the CAP.The present study provides evidence for the relationship between wave V thresholds of the intracochlear EABR and auditory performance and speech intelligibility outcomes measured using parental rating scales in pediatric cochlear implant recipients. Data also indicate that early intervention has a positive impact on auditory performance outcomes.",

Second, subjects were instructed to use 1 background sound each day on the wearable device, and they sequenced the selected background sounds during a 28-day trial. Patients were instructed to go to a website at the end of each day and rate the loudness and annoyance of the tinnitus as well as the acceptability of the background sound. Patients completed the Tinnitus Primary Function Questionnaire (Tyler, Stocking, Secor, &amp; Slattery, 2014) at the beginning of the trial. Results Results indicated that background sounds were very effective at suppressing tinnitus. There was considerable variability in sounds preferred by the subjects.

To be specific, the complexity and depth of processing were increased relative to a simple secondary task. Method Three dual-task paradigms were developed for school-age children. The primary task was word recognition. The secondary task was a physical response to a visual probe (simple task), a physical response to a complex probe (increased complexity), or word categorization (increased depth of processing). Sixteen adults (22–32 years, M = 25.4) and 22 children (9–17 years, M = 13.2) were tested using the 3 paradigms in quiet and noise. Results For both groups, manipulations of the secondary task did not affect word recognition performance. For adults, increasing depth of processing increased the calculated effect of noise; however, for children, results with the deep secondary task were the least stable. Conclusions Manipulations of the secondary task differentially affected adults and children. Consistent with previous findings, increased depth of processing enhanced paradigm sensitivity for adults. However, younger participants were more likely to demonstrate the expected effects of noise on listening effort using a secondary task that did not require deep processing.",

Method Sixty-two audiologist–patient dyads participated. Patient participants were aged 55 years or older. Hearing assessment appointments were audiovisually recorded and transcribed for analysis. Audiologists' language was profiled using two measures: general language complexity and use of jargon. A binomial, multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the associations between these language measures and hearing aid uptake. Results The logistic regression model revealed that the Flesch–Kincaid reading grade level of audiologists' language was significantly associated with hearing aid uptake. Patients were less likely to obtain hearing aids when audiologists' language was at a higher reading grade level. No associations were found between audiologists' use of jargon and hearing aid uptake. Conclusions Audiologists' use of complex language may present a barrier for patients to understand hearing rehabilitation recommendations. Reduced understanding may limit patient participation in the decision-making process and result in patients being less willing to trial hearing aids.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to report normative data and predict thresholds for a rapid test of spatial release from masking for speech perception. The test is easily administered and has good repeatability, with the potential to be used in clinics and laboratories. Normative functions were generated for adults varying in age and amounts of hearing loss.The test of spatial release presents a virtual auditory scene over headphones with 2 conditions: colocated (with target and maskers at 0°) and spatially separated (with target at 0° and maskers at ± 45°). Listener thresholds are determined as target-to-masker ratios, and spatial release from masking (SRM) is determined as the difference between the colocated condition and spatially separated condition. Multiple linear regression was used to fit the data from 82 adults 18-80 years of age with normal to moderate hearing loss (0-40 dB HL pure-tone average [PTA]). The regression equations were then used to generate normative functions that relate age (in years) and hearing thresholds (as PTA) to target-to-masker ratios and SRM.Normative functions were able to predict thresholds with an error of less than 3.5 dB in all conditions. In the colocated condition, the function included only age as a predictive parameter, whereas in the spatially separated condition, both age and PTA were included as parameters. For SRM, PTA was the only significant predictor. Different functions were generated for the 1st run, the 2nd run, and the average of the 2 runs. All 3 functions were largely similar in form, with the smallest error being associated with the function on the basis of the average of 2 runs.With the normative functions generated from this data set, it would be possible for a researcher or clinician to interpret data from a small number of participants or even a single patient without having to first collect data from a control group, substantially reducing the time and resources needed.https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.7080878.",

Design This was a service evaluation survey with a cross-sectional design. Study Sample The study population comprised 40 consecutive adult patients who received a full course of audiologist-delivered CBT for tinnitus and/or hyperacusis management at a Tinnitus and Hyperacusis Therapy Specialist Clinic in the United Kingdom over a 1-year period. Thirty-one of 40 patients who attended their final session as planned completed the survey questionnaire. Data Collection and Analysis As a part of their routine care, all patients completed a wide range of questionnaires before and after receiving audiologist-delivered CBT. These comprised Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (Newman, Sandridge, & Bolek, 2008); Hyperacusis Questionnaire (Khalfa et al., 2002); Insomnia Severity Index (Bastien, Vallieres, & Morin, 2001); Visual Analogue Scale (Maxwell, 1978) for tinnitus loudness, tinnitus annoyance, and effect of tinnitus on life; Generalized Anxiety Disorder (Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, & Lowe, 2006) questionnaire; and Patient Health Questionnaire (Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001). In addition, patients were asked to complete the survey questionnaire at their final session to provide feedback with regard to their therapy. Results The majority of patients reported that it was very acceptable to them to receive CBT focused on tinnitus and hyperacusis from a specialist audiologist; the median response was 10/10. The majority of patients felt that the CBT was very effective (median response 8/10) and that they were able to manage their tinnitus and/or hyperacusis well (median response 9/10). The effect sizes of treatment based on pre- and postintervention comparison of scores for the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, Visual Analogue Scale of tinnitus annoyance and effect on life, Hyperacusis Questionnaire, Insomnia Severity Index, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Patient Health Questionnaire were large. Conclusions Audiologist-delivered CBT is acceptable to patients and is effective in the management of tinnitus and/or hyperacusis from the patients' perspectives.",

Method A literature search was conducted between August 2018 and April 2019 in the databases CINAHL Complete, MEDLINE, and PsychInfo. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to shortlist studies. Data regarding quality, suitability, and readability were extracted from the included studies. Data were assessed qualitatively. Results There were 34 studies included in this review. Of those, eight examined quality, 33 assessed readability, and four investigated the suitability of materials. The range of materials assessed included diagnostic reports, patient education materials (PEMs), patient-reported outcome measures, and websites. Quality elements were examined in studies focusing on website information. Findings indicated that most websites were of poor quality. Suitability was examined in studies focusing on PEMs such as hearing aid user guides. Findings indicated that most of the existing materials were not suitable for the intended populations. The reading grade level of information across all four categories was found to be higher than the recommended fifth or sixth reading grade level for health-related materials. Revisions of some diagnostic reports and PEMs showed that improvements are possible. Conclusions This review suggests that ear- and hearing-related materials generally have lower quality and suitability with higher readability (more difficult to read). Development of materials that are suitable, of high quality, and at the appropriate readability levels is required to improve accessibility of ear- and hearing-related materials.",

    "abstract": "Purpose This study investigates the acoustic environment of children with cochlear implants (CIs) and the relationship between exposure to speech, in noise and in quiet, and the children's lexical production up to 1 year after CI activation, while controlling for the effect of early individual differences in receptive vocabulary growth. Method Eighteen children with CIs were observed at 3, 6, and 12 months after CI activation. Children's spontaneous word production during interaction with their mothers (types and tokens) and their expressive and receptive vocabulary size were considered. The characteristics of the acoustic environments in terms of acoustic scenes (speech in noise or in quiet, quiet, noise, music, and other) and of loudness ranges were assessed using data logging of the children's devices. Results Data analysis showed that both the number of tokens and the number of types produced 1 year after CI activation were affected by the children's exposure to speech in quiet with a loudness range between 40 and 69 dB. Expressive vocabulary size and types were affected by the receptive vocabulary knowledge that the children achieved over the first 3 months after CI activation. Conclusions Our data support the role of speech environment and individual differences in early comprehension on lexical production. The importance of exposure to speech with particular characteristics for the lexical development of children with CIs and the implications for clinical practice are discussed.",

Results Self-reported hearing loss, hearing handicap score, and health insurance status were the best predictors of an individual's willingness to use hearing aids to treat their hearing loss. The primary reasons cited for the non-use of hearing aids among Hispanics with hearing loss was the belief that their hearing impairment was not severe enough to warrant using a hearing aid and that hearing aids were unaffordable. Conclusions Greater public health education regarding the deleterious effects of untreated hearing loss and the positive impact of amplification on cognitive, social, and psychological health may be warranted to improve the usage rates of hearing aids in Hispanic adults.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of the present meta-analysis is to explore the potential effects of objective verification of hearing aid amplification on tinnitus-related outcomes. Method: Twenty-seven studies reporting tinnitus outcomes pre and post hearing aid fitting were identified through a systematic literature search. From these studies, data from 1,400 participants were included in the present meta-analysis. Studies were divided into subgroups based on whether they had reported performing objective verification of the participants' hearing aid amplification or not. Outcome measures were tinnitus distress and tinnitus loudness. Results: Meta-analyses of all included studies indicated verified amplification to result in significantly enhanced reduction of tinnitus loudness ( p &lt; .00001), while the enhanced reduction of tinnitus distress only approached statistical significance ( p = .07). However, when excluding an outlier from the subgroup of studies using unverified amplification, individuals receiving verified amplification showed significantly greater reduction of tinnitus distress ( p = .02). In addition, analyses of longitudinal effects revealed that the reductions of tinnitus distress decreased over time among individuals receiving unverified amplification but increased over time among individuals receiving verified amplification. Conclusions: The present meta-analysis indicates verified hearing aid amplification to be superior to unverified amplification in terms of reduction of tinnitus loudness and distress. The longitudinal increase of mitigation of tinnitus distress with verified amplification only may reflect improved neural reorganization and/or better adherence to hearing aid use, with verified compared to unverified amplification. Due to the low cost of hearing aid verification compared to the high societal cost of tinnitus, objective verification of hearing aid amplification for tinnitus patients is recommended.",

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate diagnostic timing of infants at risk for congenital hearing loss in consideration of known barriers. Understanding the specific barriers to early diagnosis can inform interventions to improve timeliness of diagnosis and subsequent habilitation. Method: A retrospective chart review was completed for infants referred for diagnostic audiologic testing at a tertiary urban-setting Children's Hospital from 2018 to 2021. After exclusion criteria were applied, 1,488 infants were included in the analysis. Various factors were recorded from electronic medical records including those specific to SDOH. Time to diagnosis was derived and compared across five factors of interest that have previously been shown to impact diagnostic timeline, including (a) insurance type, (b) race/ethnicity, (c) presence of middle ear dysfunction at first auditory brainstem response (ABR), (d) proximity to diagnostic center, and (e) diagnostic timing before and during/after the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Across the study time period, 77% of infants referred for diagnostic testing had confirmed diagnosis by the EHDI benchmark of 3 months. Analysis of time to diagnosis across factors of interest revealed no clinically significant differences for insurance type, race/ethnicity, proximity to diagnostic center, or timing in reference to the COVID-19 pandemic. Presence of middle ear dysfunction on first ABR was found to significantly protract final diagnostic timing. Conclusions: Although some known barriers for EHDI can be universal, other factors may have a differential impact on an infant's timeline to diagnosis based on their specific location, which can interact differently with additional known barriers. Understanding local challenges will serve to better guide programs in implementing facilitators that will address their specific needs for improved outcomes.",

Method: Audiological testing was completed prior to participant randomization in a controlled trial for misophonia treatment. Participants completed the Inventory of Hyperacusis Symptoms Survey (IHS), the Tinnitus and Hearing Survey (THS), the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ), and behavioral and objective audiometric measures. Results: Hearing thresholds were less than 25 dBHL for 97% of the participants. Loudness discomfort levels for tonal stimuli suggested hyperacusis in 25% of the sample. Total scores on the IHS indicated that 12% met the clinical cutoff for hyperacusis, and, on the THS, 27% experienced problems with tinnitus, 77% experienced problems with hearing, and 53% experienced problems with sound tolerance. On the MQ, 37% indicated mild levels of misophonia and 58% indicated moderate levels. For speech-in-noise testing, a mild signal-to-noise ratio loss was present for 15% of participants. Most of the participants had present distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). Conclusions: Audiological data on individuals with misophonia are lacking. In this article, we present results from audiological testing on 60 adults with self-reported misophonia.

    "abstract": "The behavioral evaluation of hearing in very young infants has been fraught with procedural and interpretive problems. Despite the introduction of current physiological techniques of estimating hearing sensitivity, such as otoacoustic emissions and auditory brainstem-evoked responses, behavioral hearing assessment of young infants remains of interest to researchers of infant behavior and to clinicians who need to use a battery of tests in their assessment of infant hearing. The objective of this study was to provide the first longitudinal investigation of infant auditory sensitivity, using a new procedure for behavioral testing of neonates and infants. Behavioral responses to speech noise stimuli were obtained monthly from birth to 12 months of age. During each trial, the signal increased from an inaudible level in 2-dB steps until the infant responded. Therefore, a threshold estimate was obtained on each trial, and the average threshold could be computed across trials within a test session. Threshold estimates were in good agreement with previously reported infant behavioral thresholds based on cross-sectional designs. The age-related changes in threshold were fit with exponential functions for individual infants and for the group data. There was good agreement in the shape of these functions across infants, with asymptotic threshold level approached around 6 months of age. Therefore, this longitudinal study confirms that the age trend previously reported from cross-sectional findings is also observed in the development of individual infants.",

    "abstract": "This article is the second of 2 that address the need for basic procedures that can be used commonly by audiologists to manage patients with clinically significant tinnitus, as well as hyperacusis. The method described is termed audiologic tinnitus management (ATM).ATM was developed specifically for use by audiologists. Although certain procedural components were adapted from the methods of tinnitus masking and tinnitus retraining therapy, ATM is uniquely and specifically defined. A detailed description of the ATM assessment procedures is provided in the companion article (J. A. Henry, T. L. Zaugg, & M. A. Schechter, 2005). The present article describes a specific clinical protocol for providing treatment with ATM.The treatment method described for ATM includes structured informational counseling and an individualized program of sound enhancement that can include the use of hearing aids, ear-level noise generators, combination instruments (noise generator and hearing aid combined), personal listening devices (wearable CD, tape, and MP3 players), and augmentative sound devices (e.g., tabletop sound generators). Ongoing treatment appointments involve primarily the structured counseling, evaluation, and adjustment of the use of sound devices, and assessment of treatment outcomes. The informational counseling protocol and an interview form for determining treatment outcomes are each described in step-by-step detail for direct clinical application.This article can serve as a practical clinical guide for audiologists to provide treatment for tinnitus in a uniform manner.",

Auditory thresholds, test—retest reliability, falsepositive responses, and listener preference were compared for both signals. Hearing thresholds and test—retest reliability were comparable for the 2 signals, and there were no significant differences in the number of false positives or the number of presentations required to reach threshold. Listener preference, however, indicated that pulsed tones were preferred over continuous tones by 67% of the listeners when listening to low-level or high-frequency tones. These findings, coupled with previous reports demonstrating the benefits of using automatically pulsed tones in threshold assessment for listeners with tinnitus, support the general use of pulsed tones in clinical audiometry.",

A second purpose was to determine the extent to which centers are applying selected new practices in cochlear implantation: younger age at implantation and bilateral implantation. Method A 23-question survey was sent to 445 cochlear implant centers in the United States. Of the 445 centers contacted, 188 (42%) were excluded as ineligible (nonpediatric), 257 (58%) were determined eligible, and 121 (47%) of these completed the survey. Survey topics included characteristics of PCI centers and teams; the role and importance of professionals/consultants; types of medical, educational, Deaf culture, and identity information and perspectives provided to parents; and current practices regarding age of implantation and bilateral implantation. Results All of the PCI teams completing the survey presented medical/surgical risks, audiologic information, and variability of communication/educational options; fewer than half (45%) presented Deaf culture and emerging autonomy/identity issues to parents. Most PCI centers felt the optimal age to implant a child was 10–15 months. The majority of PCI centers, regardless of affiliation with a teaching hospital, responded that they rarely or never implanted bilaterally, and few discussed bilateral implants with parents. Conclusions Audiologists are the only nonsurgical professionals always represented on the cochlear implant team. In order to best prepare audiologists for this role, graduate audiology programs need to address more extensively the Deaf culture and perspective, as well as genetics of hearing loss. Increased attention to educational audiology and evidence-based research regarding best age to implant and bilateral implantation needs to be included in the discussion with parents. Audiologists play a crucial role in informing parents and coordinating care, and should therefore carefully consider their role in the informed consent process.",

Method Eighteen children with NVLD ranging in age from 6 to 18 years received a central auditory processing test battery to determine incidence and subtype of APD. Psychological measures for assessment of NVLD included the Wechsler Scales, Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning, and Wechsler Individual Achievement Test. Neuropsychological measures included the Category Test, Trails A and B, the Tactual Performance Test, Grooved Pegs, and the Speech Sounds Perception Test. Neuropsychological test scores of the NVLD+APD and NVLD groups were compared using analysis of covariance procedures, with Verbal IQ and Performance IQ as covariates. Results Sixty-one percent of the children were diagnosed with APD, primarily in the tolerance-fading memory subtype. The group of children with APD and NVLD had significantly lower scores on Verbal IQ, Digit Span, Sentence Memory, Block Design, and Speech Sounds Perception than children without APD. An ancillary finding was that the incidence of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder was significantly higher in children with NVLD (with and without APD) than in the general population. Conclusion The results indicate that children with NVLD are at risk for APD and that there are several indicators on neuropsychological assessment suggestive of APD. Collaborative, interdisciplinary evaluation of children with learning disorders is needed in order to provide effective therapeutic interventions.",

One survey was completed per facility, and responses were anonymous.The return rate was 33% (356 surveys). The results revealed that the comprehensiveness of the test batteries used varied among facilities. Over half of the respondents, 146 (55%), reported using a limited test battery, 94 facilities reported using a comprehensive test battery but lacked at least 1 component recommended by the Joint Committee on Infant Hearing, and 25 facilities reported using a test battery that met Joint Committee on Infant Hearing recommendations. The wait time for an appointment varied between facilities (range = 3 days-5 months) and was affected by the test condition (i.e., natural sleep, sedation, or operating room).The results suggest that it is difficult for stakeholders to identify pediatric audiology facilities that serve infants less than 6 months of age and that there is variability among facilities in test batteries and wait times for an appointment.

Participants were asked to follow instructions provided within the booklets to complete common HA tasks (e.g., cleaning the HA and mold and changing the battery) and demonstrate understanding of information. Participants' views of the booklets were then obtained within a short individual interview. Results Participants experienced problems in completing all tasks while following instructions provided by the Danalogic and Unitron booklets. Individual interviews highlighted further issues regarding layout, diagrams, and content, including missing information. Conclusions Some HA instruction booklets contain information that some users may find difficult to find, understand, and follow. These limitations may negatively impact on HA satisfaction and use. It is recommended that written information for clients be evaluated prior to use. This study supports the premise that performance-based usability and literature testing are appropriate methods to use.",

After exclusions, the final sample included 1,082 NHANES participants ages 20–49 years. Maximum oxygen uptake (VO 2max ) was obtained from an established nonexercise prediction equation and through heart-rate extrapolation during a treadmill-based submaximal test. Audiometry data were objectively measured to obtain estimates of low (LPTA) and high (HPTA) pure-tone frequency average. Results VO 2max was not associated with hearing sensitivity when using the heart-rate extrapolation method but was significantly associated with hearing sensitivity (for women) when applying the nonexercise prediction equation for both LPTA and HPTA ( p &lt; .01). Women with higher predicted cardiorespiratory fitness were 6% more likely than women with lower predicted cardio-respiratory fitness to have good hearing compared to worse hearing. Conclusion Cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with hearing sensitivity when using the nonexercise prediction equation to measure VO 2max . Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Articles meeting the selection criteria were appraised by 2 reviewers and vetted by a 3rd for methodological quality.Ten studies were included and focused on participants with otosclerosis or otitis media. Two studies investigated 1000 Hz tympanometry, 7 examined MFT, and 2 addressed wideband reflectance (WBR). Methodological quality varied. Positive likelihood ratios (LR+) were predominantly uninformative for MFT and were mixed for 1000 Hz tympanometry. LR+ values for WBR ranged from diagnostically suggestive to informative. Negative likelihood ratios (LR-) for 1000 Hz tympanometry and WBR were at least diagnostically suggestive. LR- values for MFT were mixed, with half considered clinically uninformative and half considered diagnostically suggestive.Although some of the results are promising, limited evidence and methodological considerations restrict the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the diagnostic accuracy of these technologies. Additional investigations are needed to determine which tools can most accurately predict middle ear status.",

Performance was evaluated unaided, aided with a behind-the-ear (BTE) hearing aid with an omnidirectional microphone (Omni), and aided with the same hearing aid with the PC algorithm (Omni+PC). Localization performance was measured using 12 loudspeakers spaced 30° apart on a horizontal plane. Speech-in-noise performance was measured with speech presented from 0° or 180°. A single-blinded, repeated measures design was used. Results Significant improvement in localization accuracy was found when comparing the Omni+PC condition to the Omni condition. Also, the Omni+PC condition improved the signal-to-noise ratio by 2.4 dB when compared to the Omni condition when speech was presented from the front in a diffuse noise background. Conclusion Use of the PC algorithm improved localization on the horizontal plane and speech-in-noise performance. These results support use of the PC algorithm in BTE hearing aid fittings.",

Rate-altered Quick Speech-in-Noise Test (QuickSIN; Etymotic Research, 2001) stimuli were presented at 3 speech rates (slow, average, and fast), and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss was calculated for each.The older participants with HI had significantly higher SNR loss than the NH participants at all 3 speech rates. The NH participants showed improved speech perception in noise when a slow rate of speech was used. This benefit was not observed for the participants with HI. Both groups performed poorly with the fastest speech rate.Results suggest that older adults with HI who are not wearing hearing aids are not able to take advantage of additional processing time afforded by the use of slow speaking rates when speech (70-75 dB HL) is presented in competing noise. Additionally, the use of a fast speaking rate significantly reduces an individual's ability to perceive speech in noise, regardless of hearing status. Decreasing from a fast speaking rate to an average rate is beneficial and should be recommended by audiologists to increase the likelihood of older adults understanding speech in noise.",

Genetic studies were performed to investigate genetic causes for his hearing loss.History, physical examination, audiologic assessment, and imaging were performed according to usual practice. FMR1,GJB2,GJB6, and POU3F4 genes were sequenced. Chromosomal studies consisted of karyotyping and breakpoint analysis by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).Results from FMR1,GJB2,GJB6, and POU3F4 sequencing and echocardiography, electrocardiogram, and abdominal ultrasound were normal. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a large fundus of the internal auditory canals and absence of the bony partition between the fundus and the adjacent cochlear turns, with a widened modiolus bilaterally. FR's CT findings were consistent with those described in persons with X-linked deafness-2 (DFNX2) hereditary deafness. FR's karyotype was 46,inv(X)(q13q24),Y.ish inv(X)(XIST+)mat. FISH refined the breakpoints to inv(X)(q21.1q22.3). The Xq21.1 breakpoint was narrowed to a 25-kb region 450 kb centromeric to the DFNX2 gene, POU3F4. There are rare case reports of DFNX2 patients with chromosomal rearrangements positioned centromeric to POU3F4 and no mutations within the gene.Authors hypothesized that FR's hearing loss was caused by dysregulation of POU3F4 due to separation from regulatory elements affected by the inversion.",

Following 2 weeks of use in their everyday lives, participants completed self-report outcome measures. Results Relative to conventional hearing aids, self-reported use, benefit, and satisfaction were higher, and residual disability was lower for made-for-smartphone hearing aids. The converse was found for the other smartphone-connected listening devices trialed. Similarly, overall usability was judged to be “above average” for the made-for-smartphone hearing aids, but “below average” for the remaining devices.

Method A 1-group pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study design was used to assess self-ratings of confidence in knowledge and skills. The mean age for 50 graduate students participating in this study was 25.32 years ( SD = ±3.77, range: 22-37 years). Participants completed a pre- and postevent questionnaire in which they rated their level of confidence for specific knowledge and skills. Three case scenarios represented by standardized parents were developed, and 8 students volunteered to participate in implementing the 1-3-6 EHDI timeline, whereas others participated as observers. All participants participated in the briefing and debriefing sessions immediately before and after each scenario. Participants were asked to rate their readiness for interprofessional education/practice and their satisfaction of the educational experience after the last case scenario. Results Overall, the pre- and postsimulation event questionnaire revealed a significant improvement in the participants' self-rated confidence levels in knowledge and skills. The mean difference between pre- and postevent scores was 0.78 ( p < .01). The mean interprofessional learning was 2.13 (range: 1.16-2.57, SD = ±0.24) based on a Likert scale, where 1 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree. The mean satisfaction level was 4.37 (range: 3.94-4.72, SD = ±0.24) based on a Likert scale, where 1 = not satisfied and 5 = very satisfied. Conclusions The results demonstrated the value of using interprofessional simulation training among audiology and speech-language pathology students to improve their confidence in knowledge and skills.

Musicians are prone to fatigue because of long working hours and demanding profession. The research on assessing working memory abilities in musicians is heterogeneous, as none of the studies has controlled the effect of fatigue. This study was thus designed to assess the effect of fatigue on working memory and auditory perception in trained instrumental musicians. Method Twenty-six trained instrumental musicians and 25 nonmusicians participated in this study. The effect of fatigue was assessed by administering the working memory and auditory perception tests in prefatigue and postfatigue conditions. The fatigue was assessed using a 100-point visual analog scale. The working memory was assessed using Operation Span, Reading Span, and Digit Span (Forward and Backward) tests ( Knutson et al., 1991 ). Auditory perception was assessed using speech-perception-in-noise and temporal integration tests. Results Working memory and speech perception were affected due to fatigue. Musicians, despite having better working memory abilities than nonmusicians, are equally prone to fatigue-related distress. Conclusion The advantage of music training for the working memory abilities may be reduced due to fatigue; hence, measures to reduce fatigue should be employed by the musicians. Fatigue should also be treated as a variable in all future research related to assess cognitive processing in musicians.",

However, there are inconsistencies in the literature regarding performance of bilingual speakers who begin learning the target language early in life. The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate speech-in-noise and speech-in-speech recognition for highly proficient early bilingual listeners compared to monolingual and late bilingual listeners. Method Three groups of young adults participated: native monolingual English speakers, bilingual Mandarin-English speakers who learned English from birth (early bilinguals), and native Mandarin speakers who learned English later in life (late bilinguals). All participants had normal hearing and were full-time college students. Recognition was assessed for English sentences in speech-shaped noise and two-talker English speech. Participants provided linguistic and demographic information, and late bilinguals completed the Versant test of spoken English abilities. Results All listeners performed better in speech-shaped noise than two-talker speech. Performance was similar for monolingual and early bilinguals. Late bilinguals performed more poorly overall. There was evidence for a stronger association between masked speech recognition and English dominance for late bilinguals compared to early bilinguals. Conclusion These results support the conclusion that bilingualism itself does not necessarily result in a disadvantage when recognizing masked speech in noise and speech in speech. For populations similar to those studied here (highly proficient early bilinguals), it would be appropriate to evaluate masked speech recognition using the same simple stimuli and normative data used for monolingual speakers of English.",

These characteristics are commonly measured and reported; however, it has not been shown that they are associated with the impact, or bothersomeness, of tinnitus. This study addressed this question by determining correlations between measures of tinnitus loudness, tinnitus pitch, and functional effects of tinnitus. Method Tinnitus loudness matches, pitch matches, a numeric rating scale (NRS) of tinnitus loudness, and responses to the 25-item tinnitus functional index (TFI) were obtained from 223 participants who experienced tinnitus for at least 6 months. Estimates of tinnitus pitch were calculated by use of a Bayesian sequential analysis technique. Results The total TFI score, as well as each of its 8 subscales, had weak or no correlations with both loudness matches and pitch matches, but moderate correlations with the NRS. Conclusions Psychoacoustic measurements used to estimate aspects of tinnitus perception appear unrelated to the impact of tinnitus, as assessed by a subjective outcome instrument. These psychoacoustic measurements do not assess reactions to tinnitus. These reactions should be measured by validated questionnaires, such as the TFI, which are designed to measure tinnitus impact. The moderate correlations between the NRS and the TFI suggest that self-reported tinnitus loudness is more a measure of tinnitus reactions than perception.",

    "abstract": "Purpose This study intraoperatively measured the coupling efficiency of the Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB), with the aim of avoiding revision surgery due to insufficient outcome. This method can also be used to test the integrity of the implant at the end of the implantation surgery and to evaluate aided thresholds. In addition, this method makes it possible to objectively test how well the VSB has been fitted, provide assistance in fitting handicapped patients or children, evaluate hearing degradation, or test for a drop in coupling efficiency before revision surgeries. In order to analyze the feasibility of these new VSB-aided auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds, they were compared to behavioral thresholds from the Vibrogram and the preoperative bone conduction thresholds. Method The study included 30 patients with mild-to-severe hearing loss implanted with a VSB (VORP503). Intraoperative ABR thresholds during the VSB implantation were recorded using a VSB-optimized chirp stimulus. The new method is compared to the bone conduction threshold of the study sample and the aided Vibrogram thresholds. Speech intelligibility results up to 24 months after surgery are also presented. Results A reliable correlation between the bone conduction thresholds and the intraoperative ABRs was found and was higher in comparison to the Vibrogram. Furthermore, speech intelligibility outcomes were stable over time. Conclusion ABR measurements can be used intraoperatively to estimate the coupling efficiency of the VSB and test the integrity of the implant at the end of surgery.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The 1st point in the intervention process for the majority of children is the fitting of hearing devices. The objective of this review was to compile guidelines and recommendations for candidacy criteria for children with hearing loss. Method Electronic databases (e.g., MEDLINE, Embase, and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature) and websites were searched. Any document referring to children with hearing loss that discussed amplification guidelines or protocols was included. Documents specific to implantable devices or addressing only remote microphone systems were excluded. One reviewer screened all potentially relevant documents, and a subset was screened by a 2nd reviewer. Guidelines/recommendations referring to pediatric amplification candidacy were extracted. Results A total of 40 documents were included for data extraction. Studies were categorized according to hearing loss of any degree, with separate categories for documents providing specific criteria for mild bilateral, unilateral, and auditory neuropathy spectrum disorders. Guidelines ranged from generic statements about the need for amplification to criteria based on specific audiometric thresholds. In guidelines recommending audiometric cut-points, the majority considered > 25 dB HL as a criterion for consideration for amplification. Overall, guidelines for children with mild bilateral and unilateral loss remain more ambiguous, and there was some variation across the recommendations. Guidelines for auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder stressed the need to obtain results from behavioral audiometry before considering amplification. Conclusions Numerous organizations have established candidacy guidelines for pediatric amplification. Most guidelines specify criteria for amplification as audiometric threshold levels. There is considerable variation in the guidelines for mild bilateral and unilateral hearing loss with candidacy criteria ranging from 15 to 30 dB HL, and many guidelines recommend a case-by-case decision approach.",

    "abstract": "Objectives There has been a substantial increase in people with health conditions seeking health-related information online. The aim of this study was to examine the media usage by older adults with hearing loss. Method The study used a cross-sectional survey design. A total of 556 older adults with hearing loss (Hearing Tracker website users) completed the survey that was focused on (a) demographic information, (b) general electronic media usage, (c) sources of hearing health information, and (d) social media use for hearing health information. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square tests. Results When seeking hearing health care information, the majority of the participants turned to the Internet (54%) followed by health professionals (34%) as the first response to their symptoms. Both sources were also rated as the easiest means of obtaining hearing health information. The information from health care providers was rated as more reliable and important for decision making than that from the Internet. Facebook and YouTube were the most frequently used social media platforms with over 40% of the respondents using them “most of the time” or “sometimes.” All the social media platforms were rated less favorably than other sources for ease of finding information, reliability, and importance in decision making. Conclusion Older adults with hearing loss use various forms of electronic media for seeking hearing health information. They place the most trust on the information obtained from hearing health care professionals. These professionals need to be aware of the quality of information available on the Internet and social media sources in order to direct patients to credible sources.

A battery of cognitive tests was administered to participants during baseline (pre-hearing aid fitting), treatment (hearing aid use), and withdrawal (post-hearing aid use) study phases over a period of 6 months of hearing aid use.All participants showed significant improvements in performance on the cognitive test measures with hearing aid use.

Method The study included 48 final participants (40 children and eight young adults). The study design utilized a speech perception task in conjunction with a localization demand in auditory-only (AO) and auditory–visual (AV) conditions. Tasks were completed in simulated classroom acoustics in both a typical laboratory environment and in a virtual classroom environment accessed using an Oculus Rift head-mounted display. Results Speech perception scores were higher for AV conditions over AO conditions across age groups. In addition, interaction effects of environment (i.e., laboratory environment and VR classroom environment) and visual accessibility (i.e., AV vs. AO) indicated that children's performance on the speech perception task in the VR classroom was more similar to their performance in the laboratory environment for AV tasks than it was for AO tasks. AO tasks showed improvement in speech perception scores from the laboratory to the VR classroom environment, whereas AV conditions showed little significant change. Conclusion These results suggest that VR head-mounted displays are a viable research tool in AV tasks for children, increasing flexibility for audiovisual testing in a typical laboratory environment.",

Method A total of 20 participants (45–60 years of age) with clinically normal-hearing thresholds (&lt; 25 dB HL) were enrolled in this study. Ten self-reported difficulty hearing in background noise, and 10 did not self-report difficulty hearing in background noise. All participants were fit with mild-gain hearing aids, bilaterally, and were asked to wear them for 2 weeks. Hearing handicap, attitudes toward hearing aids and hearing loss, and motivation to address hearing problems were evaluated before and after participants wore the hearing aids. Participants were also asked if they would consider purchasing a hearing aid before and after 2 weeks of hearing aid use. Results After wearing the hearing aids for 2 weeks, hearing handicap scores decreased for the participants who self-reported difficulty hearing in background noise. No changes in hearing handicap scores were observed for the participants who did not self-report trouble hearing in background noise. The participants who self-reported difficulty hearing in background noise also reported greater personal distress from their hearing problems, were more motivated to address their hearing problems, and had higher levels of hearing handicap compared to the participants who did not self-report trouble hearing in background noise. Only 20% (2/10) of the participants who self-reported trouble hearing in background noise reported that they would consider purchasing a hearing aid after 2 weeks of hearing aid use. Conclusions The use of mild-gain hearing aids has the potential to reduce hearing handicap for normal-hearing, middle-age adults who self-report difficulty hearing in background noise. However, this may not be the most appropriate treatment option for their current hearing problems given that only 20% of these participants would consider purchasing a hearing aid after wearing hearing aids for 2 weeks.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Hyperacusis is a complex and poorly understood auditory disorder characterized by decreased tolerance to sound at levels that would not trouble most individuals. Recently, it has been suggested that individuals who experience otalgia in response to everyday sounds (termed pain hyperacusis) may differ clinically from those whose primary symptom is the perception of everyday sounds as excessively loud (termed loudness hyperacusis). Despite this theoretical distinction, there have been no empirical studies directly comparing these two populations of hyperacusis patients. Method Using data from a multinational patient registry (the Coordination of Rare Diseases at Sanford Registry), we examined self-reported demographics, symptoms, comorbidity, and response to treatment in a sample of 243 adults with hyperacusis, 152 of whom were classified as having pain hyperacusis based on reported symptoms. Bayesian statistical tests were used to investigate both the presence and absence of group differences between patients with loudness and pain hyperacusis. Results Individuals with pain hyperacusis presented with a more severe clinical phenotype, reporting a higher frequency of temporary symptom exacerbations (i.e., \"setbacks\"), less perceived symptom improvement over time, more severe comorbid headache disorders, and reduced benefit from sound therapy. However, the two hypothesized hyperacusis subtypes exhibited more similarities than differences, with the majority of symptoms and comorbidities being equally prevalent across groups. Multiple comorbidities were commonly observed, including tinnitus, primary headache disorders, psychiatric disorders, and functional somatic syndromes. Intolerance of sensory stimuli in other modalities was also frequently reported. Conclusion Although this study provides little evidence that loudness and pain hyperacusis are pathophysiologically distinct conditions, our findings indicate that a pain-predominant phenotype may be a meaningful prognostic marker in patients with hyperacusis.",

Results Twenty-four subthemes were identified across six themes: (1) awareness of psychosocial well-being, (2) the role of others, (3) identifying client's psychosocial needs, (4) managing client's psychosocial needs, (5) barriers to providing psychosocial support, and (6) broadening audiological services to include psychosocial support. Conclusions Participants reported an awareness of their clients' psychosocial challenges within the audiology setting, yet they described uncertainty in how best to respond in providing support and whether this was within their scope of practice.

Method Psychoacoustic tests implemented using the Portable Automated Rapid Testing system on a calibrated iPad were evaluated for nine young normal-hearing participants (Mage = 21.3, SD = 2.5) and seven hearing-impaired participants (Mage = 64.9, SD = 13.5). Participants completed 10 psychoacoustic subtests in a quiet room. Correlational analyses were used to compare performance on the psychoacoustic test battery with performance on a clinical speech-in-noise test and with the 4-frequency pure-tone average (4FreqPTA). Results Spectral processing ability was highly correlated with 4FreqPTA, and temporal processing ability showed minimal variability across the hearing-impaired group. Tests involving binaural processing captured variability across hearing-impaired listeners not associated with 4FreqPTA or speech-in-noise performance. Conclusions Tests that capture the ability to use binaural cues may add information to what current clinical protocols reveal about patients with auditory complaints. Further testing with a larger sample size is needed to confirm the need for binaural measurements and to develop normative data for clinical settings.",

This study is part of a larger project: The Lived Experience of the Audiologist, which seeks to develop a richer understanding of audiologists' lived experience via interview and survey research.Demographic and interview data related to occupational stress were examined from 28 virtual interviews of clinical audiologists in the United States. Qualitative data relative to workplace stressors were subjected to thematic analysis. Stress ratings were examined via descriptive statistics, correlation, and comparison with demographics.Self-ratings of average-day and worst-day stress were not related to work setting, years of experience, or U.S. region. Participant descriptions of workplace stressors yielded seven main themes: time, patients, administration, financial, lack of support, colleagues, and work-life balance. Some participants attributed stress response to personality traits.Audiologists' quotes illustrate the human impact of stressors in the workplace. The most commonly reported workplace stressors were lack of time, patient-related issues, administration, and financial issues. Time and administration as common causes of stress were consistent with prior studies conducted in other countries; however, patient-related and financial stressors were more prominent stressors for U.S. audiologists. Stress ratings were not related to work setting, location, or years of experience in the current study. Participants often linked their perception of stress to personality traits, a phenomenon that has been explored as a factor in the exploration of occupational stress in other fields, but not in audiology. Future research in stress and burnout should examine personality traits in addition to extensive demographics.",

It is a relatively newer test that helps assess the vestibulo-trigeminal pathway, thereby gaining more interest in brainstem pathologies like Parkinsonism, multiple sclerosis, and idiopathic random eye movement disorders. The purpose of the study was to compare the effect of zygomatic versus mandibular reference montage on the latency and amplitude of masseter VEMP (mVEMP) using a 500-Hz tone burst stimulus.Twenty healthy participants in the age range of 18-29 years, with no complaints of vestibular signs and symptoms, were recruited for the study. VEMP was recorded for all the participants using 500-Hz tone burst stimuli in zygomatic electrode montage and mandibular electrode montage. mVEMP was recorded in both ipsilateral and contralateral modes.The Wilcoxon signed-ranks test revealed no significant difference between the zygomatic and mandibular montage for both the latency and amplitude parameters (p > .05).This study revealed no significant difference in p11 and n21 latencies as well as p11-n21 rectified amplitude between zygomatic and mandibular montage using a 500-Hz tone burst stimulus in young adults. Hence, utilizing a 500-Hz tone burst, mVEMP can be recorded in zygomatic and mandibular electrode montage.",

Thresholds obtained with DuoTone were compared to those obtained with standard clinical audiometry for 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz in 13 subjects. Subsequently, test-retest reliability was analyzed using anonymized cloud-stored data from a large group of app users (1,641 subjects) who performed multiple hearing tests. Thresholds at minimum or maximum presentation level of the hearing test (10 dB HL, 85 dB HL) were excluded to avoid floor/ceiling effects. A subset (500 subjects) was created to exclude potentially unreliable data. Test-retest thresholds were compared at 12 test frequencies, from 125 Hz to 12 kHz.Thresholds determined by DuoTone and clinical audiometry did not differ significantly for each test frequency. Regarding test-retest analysis, the percentage of test-retest results within 5 dB ranged from 60% to 77% per test frequency. Results from the subset were not substantially different. Test-retest reliability for app users was comparable to results published in the literature regarding test-retest reliability of audiometry, performed in the clinic.Initial validation results suggest that thresholds obtained with DuoTone are comparable to clinical audiometry (four frequencies tested). The hearing app provides reliable hearing thresholds between 15 and 80 dB HL (12 frequencies tested) with a test-retest reliability comparable to clinical audiometry.",

    "abstract": "Directed attention and habituation are key concepts pertaining to clinical intervention for bothersome tinnitus. Directed attention is the strategy of distracting attention away from the tinnitus. Habituation is the process of learning to stop paying attention to stimuli that are irrelevant or meaningless. Although tinnitus may be intrusive, it usually does not reflect some underlying condition requiring medical attention. Tinnitus in most instances is therefore considered an irrelevant, meaningless stimulus that is best treated by facilitating habituation to the phantom sound. This tutorial describes directed attention and habituation and how they relate to major behavioral methods of tinnitus intervention.Arguably, the four major behavioral methods of tinnitus intervention with the strongest research evidence are cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT), tinnitus activities treatment (TAT), and progressive tinnitus management (PTM). Each of these four methods was evaluated to determine the role of directed attention as a treatment strategy and habituation as a treatment goal.All four of the methods (CBT, TRT, TAT, and PTM) utilize some form of directed attention as a component of their counseling. Habituation is the explicit or implicit goal of each of these methods.Directed attention and habituation are essential concepts for all of the major methods of behavioral intervention for tinnitus that were studied. It would therefore seem appropriate to include directed attention as a universal treatment strategy for bothersome tinnitus. Likewise, the commonality of habituation as the objective of treatment would suggest that habituation should be the universal goal of any method that is intended to mitigate the emotional and functional effects of tinnitus.",

    "abstract": "Measures of transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) reproducibility were obtained for 506 ears of 260 children and young adults. Frequency-specific and whole reproducibility (WR) data were obtained using ILO88 hardware and software and were analyzed with respect to pure-tone threshold and immittance data for the same ears. Reproducibility scores were most robust in the frequency region of 2,000 Hz. In addition, the 2,000-Hz reproducibility score was the most efficient of all measurements (0.85 to 0.91) in separating normal and hearing-impaired ears, regardless of the frequency or frequencies at which the hearing loss occurred. Conductive hearing loss precluded detection of emissions. The present findings suggest that TEOAEs provide useful information in routine clinical practice and that they may be employed to screen for the presence of hearing loss in children and young adults.",

    "abstract": "The effects of sound field FM amplification (SFA) on speech perception performance were investigated in this 2-year study. Kindergarten children with normal hearing were randomly assigned to a treatment group, which comprised 7 classrooms that had SFA systems installed in them, and to a control group, which comprised another 7 classrooms that did not have any amplification available. The children were followed from the beginning of kindergarten through the end of first grade. Improvements in speech perception performance were measured for both groups, with the treatment group demonstrating progress much sooner than the control group. However, this difference was not apparent by the end of the study. The only significant difference measured between the treatment and control groups was that the treatment group performed significantly better than the control group when the stimuli were presented with SFA for the treatment group and without SFA for the control group. The teachers who used SFA enjoyed using amplification in their classrooms and felt that their students enjoyed using it as well.",

Three subgroups were created based on the compression characteristics of each hearing aid. Minimum audibility was determined using aided thresholds for frequency-modulated tones and the SII calculated at 55 and 70 dB SPL using the simulated real-ear output of the hearing aid. The Lexical Neighborhood Test (LNT; K. I. Kirk, D. B. Pisoni, & M. J. Osberger, 1995) was presented at 50 and 70 dB SPL.LNT scores at 70 dB SPL were significantly higher than at 50 dB SPL. Average aided thresholds at 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 kHz were negatively correlated with LNT scores at 50 dB SPL, and SIIs at 55 and 70 dB SPL were positively correlated with LNT scores at 50 and 70 dB SPL.Results support using aided thresholds and speech test scores at soft to loud levels as part of the amplification fitting process.",

The intent of our program is to (a) detect hearing disorders early, as well as to establish their relation to psychosocial and acoustic factors; (b) devise a follow-up procedure to study relevant variables; (c) evaluate the relation between hearing disorders and genetic factors, and (d) raise the social awareness of the effects of noise and its consequences. Method This program, designed to be carried out over a 7-year period, focuses on participants from technical schools in the city of Cordoba, Argentina. Every student will be examined at age 14–15 years and will be reexamined at age 17–18. There will be a yearly follow-up in those cases in which disorders are detected. Results and Conclusions We discuss the organization and planning of this program, together with its launching in the first of the selected schools. We also describe the findings on the following topics: (a) the hearing data on adolescents (age 14–15 years); (b) their recreational habits, personality traits, and attitudes; and (c) the sound immision characteristics these individuals are exposed to during recreational activities.",

    "abstract": "Purpose This investigation is a follow-up to a national survey of hearing/balance screening and referrals in elderly patients by primary care physicians (PCPs). This local study focused on PCPs who actually treated elderly patients and could be contacted and followed in a single community. Method PCPs in Santa Barbara, CA, were surveyed with a 35-item questionnaire via mailings, phone calls, and hand delivery to determine their participation in, knowledge of, and attitudes toward hearing/balance screening and referrals for the elderly. Potential respondents were 154 PCPs obtained from WebMD, Google, and telephone and provider directories for Santa Barbara. Of the 154 surveys mailed/delivered, 33 were returned undeliverable or unusable, and 32 were returned usable, producing an overall response rate of 26.5%. Results Results were similar to those of the national study; PCPs were unlikely to screen for hearing/balance problems unless patients complained. The PCPs were unaware of patient self-report screening methods and probably would not use them in the future. Conclusions These PCPs acknowledged the importance of hearing/balance problems in the elderly, but their responses demonstrated insufficiencies in knowledge and potential attitudinal, time, and reimbursement obstacles that could interfere with their screening for hearing/balance problems. Audiologists should partner with PCPs to improve ways of meeting patients' needs but must consider resource/payoff implications for such endeavours.",

Method A randomized controlled trial with at least 16 participants per group was completed. A training-only group completed at least 5 hr of group speech perception training; a training plus psychosocial group completed at least 5 hr of group speech perception training and psychosocial exercises; and a control group did not receive training. Evaluations were conducted before and after training and included analytic and synthetic measures of speech perception, hearing loss–related and generic quality of life scales, and a class evaluation form. Results No significant group changes were measured on any of the analytic auditory-only or auditory-visual measures of speech perception, yet the majority of training participants (regardless of training group) reported improvement in auditory and auditory-visual speech perception. The training participants demonstrated a significant reduction on the emotional subscale of the hearing loss–related quality of life scale, while the control participants did not demonstrate a change on this subscale. Conclusions Benefits of group audiologic rehabilitation classes may not result from an actual improvement in auditory or visual speech perception abilities, but participants still perceive training in these areas as useful.",

However, limitations with respect to the head shake protocol were outlined, and usable data for assessing performance could not be established. The purpose of this study was to test a change in protocol for use of head shake SOT to address the noted limitations. Method Forty participants ranging in age from 20 to 79 years with no history of dizziness completed Conditions 2 and 5 of the SOT portion of computerized dynamic posturography on EquiTest equipment, while maintaining head still as well as 4 horizontal head movement velocity tasks. Results Slope of a linear regression fit to 6 performance points was used to characterize each participant. Spearman’s ranked correlation ( r ) indicated a significant relationship between the slope of the line representing a decline in performance with age ( r = −.52, p = .0006). Conclusions The head shake modification showed a trend in increasing the separation of normal individuals across age and eliminated the limitations addressed in earlier research. Future research will investigate the head shake modification for identifying vestibular peripheral system asymmetries.",

Method Sound levels during band rehearsals were recorded and audiometric hearing thresholds and transient otoacoustic emission were measured over a 3-year period. Musician's earplugs and information about hearing loss were provided to the students. The hearing thresholds of other college students were tested as a partial control. Results There were no significant differences in hearing thresholds between the two groups. During initial testing, more marching band members showed apparent high-frequency notches than control students. Follow-up hearing tests in a subsequent year for the marching band members showed that almost all notches disappeared. Persistent standard threshold shift (STS) across tests was not observed in the band members. Conclusion Band members showed no evidence of STS or persistent notched audiograms. Because accepted procedures for measuring hearing showed a lack of precision in reliably detecting early NIHL in marching band members, it is recommended that signs of NIHL be sought in repeated measurements compared to baseline audiograms rather than in a single measure (a single notch). A hearing conservation program for this population is still recommended because of lengthy rehearsal times with high sound-level exposure during rehearsals.",

Measured data were obtained by performing 2-cm3 coupler-simulated real-ear measurements using the DSL v5.0 implementation on the Audioscan VF-1 (Etymonic Design Inc., Dorchester, ON, Canada) for soft, average, and loud speech inputs and maximum hearing aid output levels.Fittings were within ± 5-dB root-mean-square (RMS) error of target for 77%, 80%, and 82% of fittings for the soft, medium, and loud speech test levels, respectively. Aided maximum power output measures were within ± 5-dB RMS error in 72% of cases. Degree of hearing loss, test frequency, and frequency by test level were significant factors in deviation from target. The range of aided speech intelligibility index values exhibited a strong correlation with the hearing levels of the children tested.This study provides evidence that typical hearing aid fittings for children can be achieved within ± 5-dB RMS error of the DSL v5.0 target.

The purpose of Part 2 was to present, in support of Part 1, preliminary data illustrating the interactive effects of an external factor (task demand) and an internal factor (evaluative threat) on autonomic nervous system measures. Method For Part 1, we provided a brief narrative review of motivation and stress as modulators of listening effort. For Part 2, we described preliminary data from a study using a repeated-measures (2 × 2) design involving manipulations of task demand (high, low) and evaluative threat (high, low). The low-demand task consisted of repetition of sentences from a narrative. The high-demand task consisted of answering questions about the narrative, requiring both comprehension and recall. During the high evaluative threat condition, participants were filmed and told that their video recordings would be evaluated by a panel of experts. During the low evaluative threat condition, no filming occurred; participants were instructed to “do your best.” Skin conductance (sympathetic nervous system activity) and heart rate variability (HRV, parasympathetic activity) were measured during the listening tasks. The HRV measure was the root mean square of successive differences of adjacent interbeat intervals. Twelve adults with hearing loss participated. Results Skin conductance increased and HRV decreased relative to baseline (no task) for all listening conditions. Skin conductance increased significantly with an increase in evaluative threat, but only for the more demanding task. There was no significant change in HRV in response to increasing evaluative threat or task demand. Conclusions Listening effort may be influenced by factors other than task difficulty, as reviewed in Part 1. This idea is supported by the preliminary data indicating that the sympathetic nervous system response to task demand is modulated by social evaluative threat. More work is needed to determine the relative contributions of motivation and emotional stress on physiological responses during listening tasks.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The introduction of connectivity technologies in hearing implants allows new ways to support cochlear implant (CI) users remotely. Some functionalities and services that are traditionally only available in an in-clinic care model can now also be accessed at home. This study explores the feasibility of a prototype of a tablet computer application (MyHearingApp [MHA]) in a group of senior experienced CI users at home, evaluating usability and user motivation. Method Based on user feedback, a tablet computer application (MHA) for the Cochlear Nucleus 6 CP910 sound processor was designed implementing six different functionalities: (a) My Hearing Tests, (b) My Environment, (c) My Hearing Journey, (d) Tip of the Day, (e) Recipient Portal, and (f) Program Use and Events. The clinical evaluation design was a prospective study of the MHA in 16 senior experienced CI users. During 4 weeks, participants could freely explore the functionalities. At the end, the usability and their motivation for uptake and adherence were measured using a baseline and follow-up questionnaire. Results Based on the System Usability Score (as part of the follow-up questionnaire), a good level of usability was indicated ( M = 75.6, range: 62.5–92.5, SD = 8.6). The ability to perform hearing tests at home is ranked as the most relevant functionality within the MHA. According to the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (Deci, Eghrari, Patrick, &amp; Leone, 1994) questionnaire (as part of the follow-up questionnaire), participants reported high levels of interest and enjoyment, found themselves competent, and did not experience pressure while working with the app. Conclusions This study evaluated a tablet computer application (MHA) for experienced senior CI users by means of a prospective design, which provided novel insights into delivering CI care into the home of the CI user. The user feedback from this small-scale study suggests that the participants are open to take more responsibility for and to become a more active actor in their own hearing care, if only this is facilitated with the right tools. This may foster the evolution from a clinic-led to a more patient-centered care model, where CI users feel more empowered in the self-management of their hearing implant device.",

Method Recent studies implicating sex hormones and other natural hormones in the modulation of hearing status in age-related hearing loss were reviewed. Results Progesterone, a sex hormone, has been shown to have negative effects on the hearing of older women and aging mice, whereas, in contrast, estrogen was found in some cases to have a positive influence. Aldosterone, used in studies of animal models of autoimmune hearing loss, slowed the progression of hearing loss. Follow-up studies in humans revealed that auditory measures varied as serum aldosterone levels shifted within the normal range, in otherwise healthy older subjects. This was true for simple as well as complex auditory tasks (i.e., sound spatial processing), suggesting benefits of aldosterone to postperipheral auditory processing as well. In addition, evidence suggests that this functional hearing improvement occurred in association with anatomical improvements to the stria vascularis—an important site of anatomical change in presbycusis. Conclusions Audiology is now at the point where the search for biomedical interventions to modulate or prevent age-related hearing loss can move forward. Such interventions would require multidisciplinary collaborative initiatives by researchers in such areas as drug development, anatomy, auditory physiological and perceptual testing, and drug microdelivery systems.",

The overall dichotic performance was significantly higher in the study group, and the main effect of auditory training was manifested in the scores of the dominant ear.Hearing aid use may improve auditory processing performance as tested in unaided conditions. Listening training has an additional beneficial effect on the dominant ear—that is, the ear with the lesser potential for improvement.

    "abstract": "Newborn hearing screening (NBHS) has become the norm in all states in the United States. However, parents receive limited information about it, usually at the hospital, and have low awareness about the process. Yet parents and professionals agree that communication about the NBHS process should begin before childbirth (Arnold et al., 2006). Having information about the screening process, simply by being present for the screening and knowing the results, has been shown to positively affect parental attitudes toward NBHS (Weichbold, Welzl-Mueller, & Mussbacher, 2001). Purpose The aim of this study was to assess whether providing expectant mothers with information related to the NBHS process in the 3rd trimester will increase their satisfaction with the NBHS program. Method Partnering with a local obstetrician, expectant mothers were provided with information regarding NBHS. A modified version of the Parent Satisfaction Questionnaire with Neonatal Hearing Screening Program (Mazlan, Hickson, & Driscoll, 2006) was administered to mothers who received information and mothers who did not receive any education. Results Quantitative results indicate significantly increased satisfaction with the NBHS program when early education was received. Qualitative comments from participants support the quantitative findings. Conclusion Results suggest that educating obstetricians and their nurses about NBHS and having them provide information to expectant mothers, as well as having mothers present for the screening, may increase parental satisfaction and therefore benefit early hearing detection and intervention programs.",

The current study investigated how relative proficiency predicted word recognition in noise. Method Forty-two monolingual and 168 bilingual normal-hearing listeners were included. Bilingual listeners rated their proficiency in listening, speaking, and reading in English and in the other language using an 11-point scale. Listeners were presented with 50 English monosyllabic words in quiet at 45 dB HL and in multitalker babble with a signal-to-noise ratio of +6 and 0 dB. Results Data in quiet confirmed Shi's (2013) finding that relative proficiency with or without dominance predicted well whether bilinguals performed on par with the monolingual norm. Predicting the outcome was difficult for the 2 noise conditions. To identify bilinguals whose performance fell below the normative range, dominance per se or a combination of dominance and average relative proficiency rating yielded the best sensitivity/specificity and summary measures, including Youden's index. Conclusion Bilinguals' word recognition is more difficult to predict in noise than in quiet; however, proficiency and dominance variables can predict reasonably well whether bilinguals may perform at a monolingual normative level.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Due to hazards in the contemporary operating environment, U.S. military service members are at increased risk for tinnitus. Previous research has characterized tinnitus prevalence in military veterans, but no population-based study of tinnitus has been conducted in active duty military service members. This study evaluated the incidence of tinnitus diagnoses in military electronic health records based on International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) codes for active duty service members between 2001 and 2015. Method Data on 85,438 active duty military service members who served between 2001 and 2015 were drawn from the Defense Medical Epidemiological Database and stratified by race, age, sex, marital status, service branch, and military pay grade. Results The incidence rate of tinnitus in U.S. military service members (per 1,000) rose consistently from 1.84 in 2001 to 6.33 in 2015. Service members most often diagnosed with tinnitus were White (72%), married (72%), males (88%), in the enlisted pay grade of E-5 to E-9 (55%), in the Army (37%), and were 35 years of age or older (50%). Statistically significant differences (p < .001) were found between observed and expected counts across all 6 demographic variables. Conclusions This is the first study to assess the incidence rates of tinnitus in active duty service members. Although there are many risk factors for auditory damage in the contemporary military operating environment, the extant literature on tinnitus in active duty military service members is limited. Future studies should consider the relationship between tinnitus-related psychological comorbidity and objective health-related quality of life, as it impacts operational readiness in active duty military service members.",

Audiology graduate programs, as a rule, do not provide comprehensive instruction in tinnitus clinical care. Training programs that do exist are inconsistent in their recommendations. Furthermore, no standards exist to prevent the delivery of unvetted audiologic services, which can be expensive for patients. Patients seeking professional services by an audiologist, therefore, have no basis upon which to be assured they will receive research-based care. The purpose of this article is to describe the current status of tinnitus management services that exist within the general field of audiology and to suggest specific approaches for improving those services. Conclusion Audiologists may be in the best position to serve as the primary health care providers for patients experiencing tinnitus. Tinnitus care services by audiologists, however, must achieve a level of evidence-based standardization.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The classroom acoustic standard ANSI/ASA S12.60-2010/Part 1 requires a reverberation time (RT) for children with hearing impairment of 0.3 s, shorter than its requirement of 0.6 s for children with typical hearing. While preliminary data from conference proceedings support this new RT requirement of 0.3 s, peer-reviewed data that support 0.3-s RT are not available on those wearing hearing aids. To help address this, this article compares speech perception performance by children with hearing aids in RTs, including those specified in the ANSI/ASA-2010 standard. A related clinical issue is whether assessments of speech perception conducted in near-anechoic sound booths, which may overestimate performance in reverberant classrooms, may now provide a more reliable estimate when the child is in a classroom with a short RT of 0.3 s. To address this, this study compared speech perception by children with hearing aids in a sound booth to listening in 0.3-s RT. Method Participants listened in classroom RTs of 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 s and in a near-anechoic sound booth. All conditions also included a 21-dB range of speech-to-noise ratios (SNRs) to further represent classroom listening environments. Performance measures using the Bamford–Kowal–Bench Speech-in-Noise (BKB-SIN) test were 50% correct word recognition across these acoustic conditions, with supplementary analyses of percent correct. Results Each reduction in RT from 0.9 to 0.6 to 0.3 s significantly benefited the children's perception of speech. Scores obtained in a sound booth were significantly better than those measured in 0.3-s RT. Conclusion These results support the acoustic standard of 0.3-s RT for children with hearing impairment in learning spaces ≤ 283 m 3 , as specified in ANSI/ASA S12.60-2010/Part 1. Additionally, speech perception testing in a sound booth did not predict accurately listening ability in a classroom with 0.3-s RT. Supplemental Material https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.11356487",

ASSRs were recorded at 7 repetition rates from 40 down to 0.75 Hz, elicited by trains of repeated tone burst stimuli.Temporal analysis of middle- and long-latency equivalent ASSRs revealed no appreciable changes in the magnitudes of the response across the age groups. Likewise, the spectral analysis revealed that advancing age did not substantially affect the spectral content of the response at each repetition rate. Furthermore, the harmonic sum was not significantly different across the 3 age groups, between the younger adults versus the combined Older Group Sample 1 and Sample 2, and between the two extreme age groups (i.e., 20-39 vs. 60-79) for the middle- and long-latency equivalent ASSRs.Advancing age has no effect on the long-latency equivalent ASSRs; however, aging does affect the middle-latency equivalent ASSRs when the mean age difference is ≥ 40 years.",

Cluster analyses (Wald's method) were used to identify audiometric patterns. Maximum allowable threshold values were defined for each cluster to create an ordered scale. Progression was defined as a two-step change. Results An eight-step scale was developed to capture audiogram shape and severity of hearing impairment. Of the 1,094 participants classified as having normal hearing based on a pure-tone average, only 25% ( n = 277) were classified as Level 1 (all thresholds ≤ 20 dB HL) on the new scale, whereas 17% ( n = 182) were Levels 4–6. During the 16-year follow-up, 64.9% of those at Level 1 progressed. There was little regression using this scale. Conclusions This is the first scale developed from population-based longitudinal cohort data to capture audiogram shape across time. This simple, standardized scale is easy to apply, reduces misclassification of normal hearing, and may be a useful method for identifying risk factors for early, preclinical, age-related changes in hearing.",

Qualitative analysis was performed on interview data from 21 people with NA-MHL and seven clinicians. Results Results revealed that noisy environments, such as restaurants, were where many people experienced listening difficulties. Most people with NA-MHL were not offered a treatment option at their audiology appointment, and their satisfaction with the appointment was diverse. Many clients reported frustration at being told that their hearing was “normal.” Data from clinicians showed that there is no standard test protocol for this population, and most felt that they did not have adequate training or resources to help NA-MHL clients.

Although these antibiotics are frequently used to treat pseudomonas and other bacterial infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), there are no formalized recommendations describing approaches to implementation of guideline adherent ototoxicity monitoring as part of CF clinical care. Method This consensus statement was developed by the International Ototoxicity Management Working Group (IOMG) Ad Hoc Committee on Aminoglycoside Antibiotics to address the clinical need for ototoxicity management in CF patients treated with known ototoxic medications. These clinical protocol considerations were created using consensus opinion from a community of international experts and available evidence specific to patients with CF, as well as published national and international guidelines on ototoxicity monitoring. Results The IOMG advocates four clinical recommendations for implementing routine and guideline adherent ototoxicity management in patients with CF. These are (a) including questions about hearing, tinnitus, and balance/vestibular problems as part of the routine CF case history for all patients; (b) utilizing timely point-of-care measures; (c) establishing a baseline and conducting posttreatment evaluations for each course of intravenous ototoxic drug treatment; and (d) repeating annual hearing and vestibular evaluations for all patients with a history of ototoxic antibiotic exposure. Conclusion Increased efforts for implementation of an ototoxicity management program in the CF care team model will improve identification of ototoxicity signs and symptoms, allow for timely therapeutic follow-up, and provide the clinician and patient an opportunity to make an informed decision about potential treatment modifications to minimize adverse events.

First, we surveyed audiologists regarding what elements of a best-practice, in-person delivery of a hearing intervention could be delivered via Internet-based appointments. Next, we piloted the feasibility and assessed outcomes of the procedures identified. Ten first-time hearing aid users aged 70 years and older were fit with Phonak Audeo M90-312T hearing aids. Two Internet-based follow-up appointments were completed using the myPhonak app. We administered the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly-Screening Version (HHIE-S), the Client Oriented Scale of Improvement (COSI), the Quick Speech-in-Noise Test (QuickSIN), and real-ear aided responses (REARs) to determine whether participants experienced improvements on hearing-related outcomes. The Telehealth Acceptance Questionnaire (TAQ) and the Visit-Specific Satisfaction Questionnaire (VSQ-9) were administered to gauge comfort with telehealth and satisfaction with Internet-based appointments.Survey results revealed that after an initial in-person appointment, nearly all follow-up hearing intervention components could be delivered remotely. We performed Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests to determine if the baseline and outcome results differed for outcomes. Baseline scores improved after 6 weeks (ps = .02 and. 005 for QuickSIN and HHIE-S) for speech-in-noise performance and self-perceived hearing difficulties. REARs from 500 to 4000 Hz measured after 6 weeks did not differ from baseline (ps = .612 and .398 for the right and left ears), suggesting no significant deviation from prescriptive targets because of remote fitting adjustments. All participants reported improvement in COSI goals after the intervention. TAQ results suggested that comfort with telehealth improved after attending Internet-based appointments (p = .005). VSQ-9 results revealed no differences in reported patient satisfaction between in-person and Internet-based appointments.We were able to develop a feasible hybrid audiology service delivery model for older adults. Our results enhance the evidence base for the implementation of telehealth audiology services.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed at comparing narrowband Claus Elberling level-specific chirp (NB CE-Chirp)-, click-, and tone burst-evoked masseteric vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (mVEMPs).Within-group study design and purposive sampling were performed. A total of 25 normal-hearing individuals participated in the study. The zygomatic electrode montage was used to elicit ipsilateral mVEMP responses using a 500-Hz NB CE-Chirp, a click of 100-μs duration, and a 500-Hz tone burst stimulus. Each of the responses was analyzed based on the absolute peak latency of P11 and N21, the electromyography-scaled peak-to-peak amplitude of the P11-N21 complex, and the interaural asymmetry ratio.A total of 50 ears were tested and had 100% mVEMP responses. The latencies of click-evoked and 500-Hz NB CE-Chirp-evoked mVEMPs were significantly shorter than those of 500-Hz tone burst-evoked mVEMPs (p < .05) for both ears. It revealed a significantly superior P11-N21 amplitude of the 500-Hz NB CE-Chirp and tone burst than clicks for both ears. Intraclass correlation coefficient revealed moderate to excellent test-retest reliability for mVEMP parameters across three different stimulations.The present study supports 500 Hz NB CE-Chirps as effective and reliable stimuli as tone bursts in eliciting mVEMP responses.",

    "abstract": "This study examined current auditory processing disorder (APD) protocols and audiologists' perspectives on the active debate seen in the literature regarding the status of APD as a unique disorder.This study used a cross-sectional, nonexperimental survey design. The participants were 134 U.S. audiologists, representing diversity across experience level and work setting.Popular APD tests from prior surveys remain popular, and a few new tests have emerged. Most audiologists use diverse strategies to identify potential comorbid disorders as part of their APD protocol, including multidisciplinary assessment and referral to other specialists. Most participants disagreed with the assertion that APD is not a unique disorder; however, many also pointed out that patients' struggles with listening need to be the primary focus of APD assessment and management, regardless of the label of the disorder. Qualitative analysis of participant comments on the controversy yielded six themes: Clinical Experience, Comorbidity, Listening Skills, Literature Support, Overdiagnosis, and More Information Needed.Most participants consider APD to be a unique disorder, citing clinical experience and the literature for support; however, many also indicated APD is complicated by comorbidity and APD may be overdiagnosed.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to identify and describe factors that influence hearing aid outcomes including social networks, self-reported mental health, and service delivery models.A prospective cross-sectional online survey was sent to hearing aid users recruited through an online platform (http://www.hearingtracker.com) between October and November 2021. The survey contained questions on patient demographics, audiological variables, general health and social factors, and self-reported hearing aid outcomes using the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA). Regression models evaluated potential contributing factors of hearing aid outcomes on the IOI-HA.Three hundred ninety-eight hearing aid users completed the survey with an average age of 66.6 (SD = 13.0) years, of which 59.3% were male. Positive contributing factors of hearing aid outcomes (IOI-HA total score) were social network of people with hearing loss with hearing aids (p < .010; Exp[B] = 0.03, 95% CI [0.01, 0.1]), self-reported mental health (p < .05; Exp[B] = 0.6, 95% CI [0.01, 1.2]), work situation (p < .001; Exp[B] = 1.9, 95% CI [0.7, 2.8]), quality of life (p < .005; Exp[B] = 1.2, 95% CI [0.3, 1.1]), and self-reported hearing difficulty (p < .02; Exp[B] = 0.8, 95% CI [0.2, 1.5]). Negative contributing factors of hearing aid outcomes included social networks of people with hearing loss without hearing aids (p < .001; Exp[B] = -0.1, 95% CI [-0.2, -0.2]) and service delivery model of private or university clinic compared to big-box retailers (p < .001; Exp[B] = -1.6, 95% CI [-2.7, -0.7]).Novel factors including social network of persons with hearing loss who use hearing aids, self-reported mental health, service delivery model, and work situation are significant contributors to hearing aid outcomes. These newly identified factors can inform public hearing health promotion and individualized audiological care to optimize hearing aid outcomes.https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.24060486.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Hyperacusis often leads to debilitating psychosocial consequences, but there is no standard protocol for its diagnosis and management in the United States. In this study, we surveyed U.S. clinical audiologists to understand their education and clinical practices surrounding the evaluation and treatment of hyperacusis. Method: An online survey was distributed to clinical audiologists across the United States. Survey responses were quantified using descriptive statistics and inductive content analysis. Results: Hyperacusis definitions and clinical practice patterns varied widely across the 102 respondents. Respondents cited a lack of education and training as the primary barrier to effective audiological diagnosis and management of hyperacusis, with most respondents reporting ≤ 5 hr of hyperacusis education. Other primary barriers to effective audiological management of hyperacusis included time constraints, reimbursement, poor sensitivity and specificity of available diagnostic tools, and poor efficacy of available treatments and management strategies. Most respondents (82.5%) agreed that audiologists are the primary professionals who are responsible for implementing hyperacusis interventions. However, 63.3% of respondents reported that their clinic does not have a hyperacusis management protocol, and 80.0% routinely recommend treatment that is outside their scope of practice to implement (cognitive behavioral therapy). Conclusions: Clinical audiologists in the United States do not receive uniform education on hyperacusis, and they report multiple barriers to its evidence-based diagnosis and management. Effective hyperacusis management necessitates a multidisciplinary approach. The information obtained via this survey will pave the way toward the refinement of interprofessional education programs and the development of systematic, evidence-based clinical protocols for hyperacusis.

    "abstract": "Clinical decision-making has become more complex as newer, more costly, hearing aid (HA) technologies become available. The expanding array of more expensive HAs demands that clinical researchers continue to justify the value of these instruments relative to the substantial increase in cost to both the provider and consumer. In the present report, 25 current conventional HA users with adult onset of sensorineural hearing loss were fitted with: (a) a one-channel linear HA; (b) a two-channel, nonlinear HA; and (c) a seven-band, two-channel digital signal processing (DSP) HA. All instruments were mini behind-the-ear units with identifying information removed from the cases. Subjects wore each HA for at least a 1-month period. A set of laboratory (Speech Perception in Noise [SPIN] test; audibility index calculated from real-ear measurements) and self-report (Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit; Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly/Adults; Knowles Hearing Aid Satisfaction Survey; preference ratings) outcome measures were used to evaluate the benefit from, satisfaction with, and cost-effectiveness of each test HA. As expected, there were statistically significant differences between unaided and aided conditions across HAs. Although the DSP instrument yielded significantly higher word recognition scores on the SPIN test, no differences were observed among the test HAs for the standardized self-report measures. In contrast, however, more than 75% of the subjects preferred the “higher end” instruments. Yet, 33% of the subjects changed their preference for the “higher end” instruments after being informed of costs. A cost-effectiveness model for evaluating the relationship between HA retail purchase price and improvements in performance/benefit is presented.",

    "abstract": "Differences in the performance of adults with normal hearing were evaluated on the English and Spanish versions of the Synthetic Sentence Identification (SSI) test in the ipsilateral competing message (ICM) format. Previous work has shown that bilingual subjects perform significantly better on the Spanish version of the SSI at a –30 dB message-to-competition ratio (MCR). The previous investigators attributed this difference in performance to the existence of a greater number of pauses in the competing message of the Spanish version compared to the English version. In the present study, seven bilingual speakers and ten monolingual speakers each of English and Spanish completed two conditions—the standard competing message (SC) and the competing message mixed with speech noise (SC+N)—in order to reduce or eliminate the effect of pauses on performance. Bilingual subjects’ scores in each language were not significantly different from monolingual subjects’ scores. Scores from bilinguals were significantly better in Spanish compared to English—even when speech noise was used to fill in the natural pauses present in the competing message at a –10 dB MCR. It is suggested that this performance difference may be a result of the unequal average number of syllables per stimulus sentence in the English and Spanish versions. However, further research will be needed to explore the impact that different language structures have on SSI performance.",

Frequency-lowering hearing aids using dynamic speech recoding (DSR) technology have been proposed as a possible means to achieve full speech audibility. The current study investigated 78 children from ages 1.3 to 21.6 years ( M = 10.6 years) who wore DSR hearing aids. These hearing aids provided significant improvements in pure-tone average (PTA; mean improvement for the aided versus unaided condition of 49 dB) and high-frequency PTA (mean improvement for the aided versus unaided condition of 56 dB). A subgroup of 19 children were previous users of conventional hearing aids. These participants demonstrated a mean improvement of 11 dB in PTA and 12.5% in word recognition scores for DSR versus conventional amplification. However, DSR hearing aids required repair 3 times as often as conventional hearing aids. The greatest benefit was observed in children whose word recognition scores were poorest using conventional hearing aids.",

A crucial feature of the model is the postulate that a number of systems in the brain are involved in the emergence of tinnitus. The cochlea and auditory periphery play only a secondary role. To facilitate the goal of habituation of the tinnitus signal, TRT implements both directive counseling to neutralize the negative emotional associations toward the tinnitus, and sound therapy to interfere with the signal. As an outgrowth of the work with tinnitus, the evaluation and treatment of hyperacusis has emerged as an increasingly important part of our program. This report describes the unique facility, staff, and services of the Center as we celebrate a decade of research and clinical management dedicated to the scientific understanding of tinnitus and hyperacusis.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness and utility of distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) and auditory brain stem response (ABR) testing as screening methodologies suitable for universal application at a large birthing hospital. Five hundred sixty-nine neonates (1184 ears) without risk indicators for hearing loss underwent DPOAE and ABR screening before hospital discharge at birth. All ears (100%) passed the ABR screening. DPOAE results were categorized on the basis of the number of frequencies at which emissions were obtained as well as presence versus absence of a replicated response at each test frequency. Pass and refer rates varied widely, on the basis of whether the presence of DPOAE response at 2000 Hz or replication were required. With the most stringent criteria, only 64.44% of ears passed, whereas with the least stringent criteria 88.94% passed. Given that 100% of ears passed according to the gold standard of the ABR screening, these results indicate false-positive rates ranging from 11% to 35% by DPOAE screening. This discrepancy in pass and refer rates when various criteria are applied indicates the need for standardization and further comparison of appropriate pass criteria for newborn hearing screening programs.",

    "abstract": "Neurofibromastosis type II (NF2) is a condition that may result in bilateral acoustic neuromas. The tumors and their removal may cause profound bilateral deafness. Because the auditory nerve is compromised, people with NF2 are unable to receive a cochlear implant to restore a sensation of hearing. Electrical stimulation of the auditory pathway can provide hearing in such people. This is possible by means of an auditory brainstem implant (ABI). This article focuses on the MED-EL high-rate multichannel ABI system. The system consists of the implanted and external components. Appropriate placement of the ABI is dependent on electrical auditory brainstem response testing performed intra-operatively. Data on a group of European patients implanted with the MED-EL ABI are presented. Results are promising and include some open-set speech ability.",

Participants were fit bilaterally and tested in 2 environments, an anechoic chamber and a moderately reverberant classroom, with the microphones in the fixed (cardioid) setting and the adaptive setting. Five speakers were placed between 110° and 250° azimuth around the listener. Speech-weighted noise was presented from those speakers at an overall level (OAL) of 65 dB (A). Noise was increased by 8 dB from 1 speaker at a time, using 2-s modulation and random assignment, while the output from the other speakers was reduced to maintain the constant OAL. Results of 2 speech perception tasks used as outcome measures indicated that the adaptive system was not able to follow the dominant noise source in the presence of lower level noise sources. Selfreport measures obtained after blinded home trials were consistent with laboratory findings that the participants did not perceive this adaptive microphone design to be more effective than the default fixed-microphone option.",

A total of 34,979 children, 3 to 5 years of age, were screened.Eighteen percent (6,337) of the children were referred for further hearing and/or medical ear evaluation. Of 1,421 follow-up responses received, 93% complied with the follow-up recommendations while 7% did not. Of 1,316 children in the follow-up group, outer and/or middle ear disorder in one or both ears was medically confirmed for 37%. Unilateral or bilateral hearing loss was diagnosed in 18% as conductive (12%), sensorineural (1%), mixed (0.4%), or unspecified (5%). Overall, hearing loss and/or otologic disorder was confirmed in 49% of the follow-up group, suggesting a prevalence of 1.8% in a preschool-age population. A small (n = 32) sample of unsolicited comments indicated that physicians most influenced noncompliance with hearing evaluation follow-up.The quantitative hearing and otologic follow-up outcome data affirm the importance of audiologic screening in the preschool population. Qualitative data suggest that some physicians may not be advocating appropriate screening follow-up services.",

Results MCL for listening to speech in quiet was significantly increased when the speech stimuli were low-pass filtered at 2.0 kHz relative to the unfiltered and 6.0-kHz conditions. Acceptance of background noise was significantly poorer when the speech and noise stimuli were low-pass filtered at 2.0 kHz relative to the 6.0-kHz condition. Listeners with impaired hearing sensitivity had significantly greater MCL values than listeners with normal hearing, but ANL values were not significantly affected by the hearing sensitivity of the listener. Conclusions Information beyond 2.0 kHz significantly affected MCL and ANL values in both listeners with normal hearing and impaired hearing; however, effects for both the MCL and ANL measurements were small and may not be significant clinically.",

Higher performance levels were obtained with Highland than Caribbean/Coastal listeners and with Spanish-dominant than English-dominant listeners. The dialectal difference was particularly evident in favorable listening conditions (i.e., quiet and +6 dB SNR) and could not be explained by listeners’ familiarity with the test words.Dialects significantly affect the clinical assessment of Spanish-speaking clients’ word recognition.

VOR gain was assessed with a commercially available rotary chair and was measured in dark both while the subject was tasked with mental alerting exercises and while not being tasked. VOR suppression was measured for the following conditions: (a) visual suppression, (b) auditory suppression, (c) somatosensory suppression, (d) imaginary visual target suppression, and (e) combined auditory and somatosensory suppression. Results Attention directed to visual source attenuated the VOR by approximately 85%. Attention directed toward auditory and somatosensory targets (both separately and combined) and attention directed toward an imaginary target suppressed the VOR between 28% and 44%. The extent of VOR suppression that occurred with attention directed toward various nonvisual stimuli was significantly less than the visual suppression of the VOR. The various nonvisual conditions were not statistically different from one another. Conclusion The data suggest that it is possible for typical adults to suppress the VOR in the absence of a visual target.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of hearing aid processing on the CAEP elicited with tone bursts that may have altered onsets. Method CAEPs to unprocessed and hearing aid–processed tone bursts were obtained from 16 individuals with normal audiometric thresholds when the onset time, level, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were matched between the 2 conditions. Tone bursts processed by the hearing aid were recorded in an anechoic box and were presented through insert receivers. Unprocessed tone bursts were superimposed with hearing aid noise floor to match the SNR of the hearing aid–processed tone bursts. Results Shortening of rise time and overshoot at the onset of the tone burst were evident in the hearing aid–processed stimuli. Statistical analysis of data showed no significant effects of hearing aid processing on the latency or amplitude of CAEP peaks ( p &gt; .05). Conclusion The changes in rise time occurring in the tone bursts due to hearing aid processing may not confound CAEP measures that are used to validate hearing aid fitting.",

The respondent sample was broken down into demographic subgroups, and statements were divided into subgroups reflecting 6 core reward areas that contribute to overall professional satisfaction. Results Mean group satisfaction was 3.9 ( n = 382; SD = 1.01), which has remained unchanged since 1997 ( p &lt; .05). Private practice audiologists' mean group satisfaction of 4.31 ( n = 80, SD = 0.78) was higher than for other practice settings ( p &lt; .05). AuD private practice owners' mean group satisfaction of 4.52 ( n = 46, SD = 0.66) was higher than for other degrees and practice settings ( p &lt; .05).

    "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this investigation was to identify the optimal recording parameters for evoking the ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential (oVEMP) using air-conduction stimuli. Method Subjects were 17 otologically and neurologically intact adults (age: M = 24.18 years, SD = 1.91 years). The oVEMP responses were elicited using a 500-Hz tone burst air-conduction stimulus presented at an intensity of 95 dB nHL. The setting was a balance function laboratory that was part of a large tertiary care otology clinic. Results The oVEMP electrode montage and body position that yielded the largest oVEMP amplitude was the belly-tendon montage (Sandhu, George, &amp; Rea, 2013), recorded with the subject in the sitting position. The N1 latency recorded with the belly-tendon montage was significantly shorter than that recorded for the infraorbital montage in both the sitting and supine positions. Conclusion The belly-tendon recording montage with the subject sitting yields significantly larger oVEMP amplitudes and shorter N1 latencies than do traditional bipolar infraorbital recordings.",

Although the test is objective, interpretation of the results is subjective.This review provides information about evidence-based criteria, suggested by the 2013 Newborn Hearing Screening Program guidelines, and the use of cross-check methods for making valid interpretations about hearing status from ABR recordings.The use of an appropriate display scale setting, templates of expected response properties, and objective criteria to estimate the residual noise, signal level, and signal-to-noise ratio will provide quality data for determining ABR thresholds. Cross-checks (e.g., immittance measures, otoacoustic emissions testing, functional indications of a child's hearing) are also needed to accurately interpret the ABR.Using evidence-based ABR signal detection criteria and considering the results within the context of other physiologic tests and assessments of hearing function will improve the clinician's accuracy for detecting hearing loss and, when present, the degree of hearing loss. Diagnostic accuracy will ensure that appropriate remediation is initiated and that children or infants with normal hearing are not subjected to unnecessary intervention.",

In the absence of a comprehensive clinical survey to identify these shortfalls in clinical training, the objective of this study was to develop and report the psychometric properties of the Hearing Aid Skills and Knowledge Inventory (HASKI: a self-administered version and a clinician-administered version). The HASKI evaluates the knowledge and skills required for hearing aid management. A secondary aim was to report the prevalence of hearing aid management difficulties in an Australian population. Method The development of the HASKI and the investigation of its psychometric properties in a prospective convenience cohort of 518 adult hearing aid owners, ranging in age from 18 to 97 years ( M = 71 years, SD = 14), 60% male, 38% female, and 2% undisclosed, recruited from 7 hearing clinics across Australia, were used. Results The HASKI (both the self-administered and clinician administered) demonstrated high internal consistency, interdimensional relationships, construct validity, test–retest reliability, interobserver reliability, and criterion validity. A range of aptitudes were observed from low to full competency, with 99% of participants indicating difficulty with at least 1 item on the survey. Conclusions The Hearing Aid Skills and Knowledge Inventories are valid and reliable measures of hearing aid handling and management skills with good potential for use in clinical settings. Hearing aid management is an area of difficulty for the majority of hearing aid owners, indicating the need for clinicians to improve the efficacy of hearing aid management training delivered.",

Method Fourteen children (5-14 years old) who are hard of hearing participated in this study. Participants wore laboratory hearing aids. Open-set word recognition thresholds were measured adaptively for 2 hearing aid settings: (a) omnidirectional (OMNI) and (b) fully adaptive directionality. Each hearing aid setting was evaluated in 3 listening conditions. Fourteen children with normal hearing served as age-matched controls. Results Children who are hard of hearing required a more advantageous signal-to-noise ratio than children with normal hearing to achieve comparable performance in all 3 conditions. For children who are hard of hearing, the average improvement in signal-to-noise ratio when comparing fully adaptive directionality to OMNI was 4.0 dB in noise, regardless of target location. Children performed similarly with fully adaptive directionality and OMNI settings in the presence of the speech maskers. Conclusions Compared to OMNI, fully adaptive directionality improved speech recognition in steady noise for children who are hard of hearing, even when they were not facing the target source. This algorithm did not affect speech recognition when the background noise was speech. Although the use of hearing aids with fully adaptive directionality is not proposed as a substitute for remote microphone systems, it appears to offer several advantages over fixed directionality, because it does not depend on children facing the target talker and provides access to multiple talkers within the environment. Additional experiments are required to further evaluate children's performance under a variety of spatial configurations in the presence of both noise and speech maskers.",

In Part 1, well-established neurophysiological models are discussed providing the framework of evidence that auditory brainstem nuclei play a role in generating tinnitus. In Part 2, ideas are presented explaining modulatory effects on tinnitus related to underlying pathways originating from or projecting to brainstem auditory and nonauditory nuclei. This section addresses multiple phenomena including somatic-related, attention-mediated, and emotion-mediated changes in the tinnitus percept. In Part 3, the role of the brainstem in common nonauditory comorbidities that occur in patients with tinnitus is discussed. Part 4 presents clinical implications of these new ideas related to the brainstem's involvement in generating and modulating tinnitus. Impact Knowledge of the brainstem's involvement in generating and modulating tinnitus provides a context for health care professionals to understand the temporal relationship between tinnitus and common nonauditory comorbid conditions.",

Phoneme scoring of words has been suggested as a method of reducing test time and variability. The purposes of this study were to establish a phoneme scoring rubric and use it in testing phoneme and word perception in noise in older individuals and individuals with hearing impairment. Method Words were presented to 3 participant groups at 80 dB in speech-shaped noise at 7 signal-to-noise ratios (−10 to 35 dB). Responses were scored for words and phonemes correct. Results It was not surprising to find that phoneme scores were up to about 30% better than word scores. Word scoring resulted in larger hearing loss effect sizes than phoneme scoring, whereas scoring method did not significantly modify age effect sizes. There were significant effects of hearing loss and some limited effects of age; age effect sizes of about 3 dB and hearing loss effect sizes of more than 10 dB were found. Conclusion Hearing loss is the major factor affecting word and phoneme recognition with a subtle contribution of age. Phoneme scoring may provide several advantages over word scoring. A set of recommended phoneme scoring guidelines is provided.",

The age of the children ranged from 6 to 10 years. Results With a cutoff criterion of 1 SD below the mean of the test scores, 8% of the children “at risk” for APD passed all the tests, whereas 28% passed with a criterion of 2 SD s below the mean scores. The tests most frequently failed by these children were Speech-in-Noise Test in Indian English and Dichotic Consonant–Vowel. Conclusions A cutoff criterion of 2 SD s below the mean scores of typically developing children is recommended to diagnose children as having APD if they performed poorly on only one test. For children who performed poorly on more than one test, a cutoff criterion of 1 SD below the mean scores of typically developing children is recommended.",

Method Quasi-experimental and repeated-measures study designs were used in this study. Twenty-six adults with normal hearing (17 females, 9 males) participated. ABRs were acquired from the study participants at 3 intensity levels (80, 60, and 40 dB nHL), 3 frequencies (500, 1000, and 2000 Hz), 2 electrode montages (ipsilateral and vertical), and 2 stimuli (NB LS CE-Chirp and tone-burst) using 2 stopping criteria (fixed averages at 4,000 sweeps and F test at multiple points = 3.1). Results Wave V amplitudes were only 19%–26% larger for the vertical recordings than the ipsilateral recordings in both the ABRs obtained from the NB LS CE-Chirp and tone-burst stimuli. The mean differences in the F test at multiple points values and the residual noise levels between the ABRs obtained from the vertical and ipsilateral montages were statistically not significant. In addition, the ABR elicited from the NB LS CE-Chirp was significantly larger (up to 69%) than those from the tone-burst, except at the lower intensity level. Conclusion Both the ipsilateral and vertical montages can be used to record ABR to the NB LS CE-Chirp because of the small enhancement in the wave V amplitude provided by the vertical montage.",

Policies define the course of action to reach specific goals such as optimal hearing health. The process of policy making can be divided into 4 steps: (a) problem identification and issue recognition, (b) policy formulation, (c) policy implementation, and (d) policy evaluation. Data and evidence, especially Big Data, can inform each of the steps of this process. Big Data can inform the macrolevel (policies that determine the general goals and actions), mesolevel (specific services and guidelines in organizations), and microlevel (clinical care) of hearing health care services. The research project EVOTION applies Big Data collection and analysis to form an evidence base for future hearing health care policies. Method The EVOTION research project collects heterogeneous data both from retrospective and prospective cohorts (clinical validation) of people with hearing impairment. Retrospective data from clinical repositories in the United Kingdom and Denmark will be combined. As part of a clinical validation, over 1,000 people with hearing impairment will receive smart EVOTION hearing aids and a mobile phone application from clinics located in the United Kingdom and Greece. These clients will also complete a battery of assessments, and a subsample will also receive a smartwatch including biosensors. Big Data analytics will identify associations between client characteristics, context, and hearing aid outcomes. Results The evidence EVOTION will generate is relevant especially for the first 2 steps of the policy-making process, namely, problem identification and issue recognition, as well as policy formulation. EVOTION will inform microlevel, mesolevel, and macrolevel of hearing health care services through evidence-informed policies, clinical guidelines, and clinical care. Conclusion In the future, Big Data can inform all steps of the hearing health policy-making process and all levels of hearing health care services.",

The objective was to extend what is known so far in the literature about children with LiD by using multiple measures and selective novel measures across the above areas. Design Twenty-six children who were reported by their parents as having LiD and 26 age-matched typically developing children completed clinical tests of auditory processing and multiple measures of language, attention, and memory. All children had normal-range pure-tone hearing thresholds bilaterally. Group differences were examined. Results In addition to significantly poorer speech-perception-in-noise scores, children with LiD had reduced speed and accuracy of word retrieval from long-term memory, poorer short-term memory, sentence recall, and inferencing ability. Statistically significant group differences were of moderate effect size; however, standard test scores of children with LiD were not clinically poor. No statistically significant group differences were observed in attention, working memory capacity, vocabulary, and nonverbal IQ. Conclusions Mild signal-to-noise ratio loss, as reflected by the group mean of children with LiD, supported the children's functional listening problems. In addition, children's relative weakness in select areas of language performance, short-term memory, and long-term memory lexical retrieval speed and accuracy added to previous research on evidence-based areas that need to be evaluated in children with LiD who almost always have heterogenous profiles. Importantly, the functional difficulties faced by children with LiD in relation to their test results indicated, to some extent, that commonly used assessments may not be adequately capturing the children's listening challenges.

    "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this research was to apply multiple perspectives as part of a systematic review to analyze literature regarding ethics in audiology. Audiologists are particularly vulnerable to the changing requirements of the discipline that compel them to straddle both professional obligations and business principles, creating a hybrid professional. Method The authors used a 2-phase mixed-method approach to analyze publications. Publications were sorted into categories, namely, ethics approach, author, decade, role of the audiologist, component of morality, and common themes. The sample consisted of peer-reviewed articles cited in MEDLINE, CINAHL, ERIC, MasterFILE Premier, E-Journals, Africa-Wide Information, and Academic Search Premier electronic databases and non-peer-reviewed articles in Seminars in Hearing . Results The publications were predominantly philosophical, focused on the rehabilitative role of the audiologist, and addressed the moral judgment component of moral behavior. Conclusions Despite the fact that knowledge of ethics grew between 1980 and 2010, this retrospective analysis identified gaps in current knowledge. Research is needed to address the unique ethical problems commonly encountered in all 8 roles of the audiologist; patient perspectives on ethics; ethical approaches; factors affecting moral judgment, sensitivity, motivation, and courage; and cultural dimensions of ethical practice in audiology.",

    "abstract": "Purpose This study investigated longitudinal hearing aid (HA) use in a cohort of children with moderate hearing loss (CHL), fitted with amplification before the age of 6 months. Additionally, the relationship of HA use and aided audibility on outcomes of parental questionnaires of auditory skills was examined, and these outcomes were compared to a group of children with normal hearing (CNH). Method Nine CHL and 29 CNH and their parents participated in the study. Measures were collected at initial fitting, 10, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months of age. Parents reported hours of HA use and situations the HAs were used. Datalogging and speech intelligibility index were also collected. Auditory skills were measured through parental questionnaires. Results The mean hours of HA use/day for this cohort increased from 7.55 at the ages of 10 months to 10.15 at 36 months according to datalogging. Parental estimations of hours of HA use and in which situations varied between subjects. Correlations between HA use from datalogging and speech intelligibility index to measures of auditory skills were weak. CHL showed similar results to CNH on auditory development at the ages of 10, 18, and 24 months but presented with significantly lower scores on auditory functional performance in noise at 30 and 36 months of age. Conclusions Longitudinal monitoring of HA use from fitting of amplification with the combination of objective and subjective tools may have a positive impact on HA use in CHL. The lower scores on listening in noise compared to CNH call for further attention.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The two primary purposes of this report are (a) to compare the results of three brief cognitive screens in older adults and (b) to examine associations between performance on each of the screens and auditory function measured either concurrently or 9 years earlier. Method This was a prospective longitudinal study of 98 adults (66 women) with baseline ages ranging from 40 to 85 years. The mean interval between T1 baseline and T2 follow-up measurements was 8.8 years with a range from 7 to 11 years. Measures of hearing threshold, gap detection, and auditory temporal-order identification were completed at T1 and T2. The Mini-Mental State Examination was completed at T1 and T2, whereas the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and A Quick Test were completed at T2 only. Results Higher scores and pass rates were obtained for the Mini-Mental State Examination than for the MoCA or the A Quick Test. The measures were moderately correlated among themselves and with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition. Significant associations emerged frequently between auditory and cognitive functions, most often for the auditory measure of temporal-order identification, including dichotic measures of this ability. Conclusions From this evaluation, the MoCA emerged as the preferred test for clinicians desiring a quick assessment of the cognitive function of their older patients. Auditory temporal-order identification is associated with cognitive function and explains about 10%-20% of the variation in cognitive function independent of age and hearing loss.

    "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study was to compare speech identification abilities of individuals of various ages and hearing abilities using traditional methods and Portable Automated Rapid Testing (PART) iPad app. Method Speech identification data were collected using three techniques: over headphones using a virtual speaker array, using PART iPad app (UCR Brain Game Center, 2018), and using loudspeaker presentation in a sound-attenuated room. For all three techniques, Coordinate Response Measure sentences were used as the stimuli and \"Charlie\" was used as the call sign. A progressive tracking procedure was used to estimate the speech identification thresholds for listeners with varying hearing thresholds. The target sentence was always presented at 0° azimuth angle, whereas the maskers were colocated (0°) with the target or symmetrically spatially separated by ±15°, ±30°, or ±45°. Results Data analysis revealed similar speech identification thresholds for the iPad and headphone conditions and slightly poorer thresholds for the loudspeaker array condition across participant groups. This was true for all spatial separations between the target and the maskers. Conclusion Strong correlation between the headphone and iPad data presented in this study indicated that the spatial release from masking module in the PART iPad app can be used as a clinical tool to assess spatial processing ability prior to audiologic evaluation in the clinic and can also be used to make recommendations for and to track progress with aural rehabilitation programs over time.",

The purpose of this study was to measure the 10-year incidence of hearing aid adoption in a sample of primarily middle-age adults with high-frequency HL and identify factors associated with hearing aid adoption. Method: This study included 579 adults (ages 34–80 years) with high-frequency pure-tone average &gt; 25 dB HL (3–8 kHz) enrolled in the Beaver Dam Offspring Study. Hearing aid adoption was measured at 5- and 10-year follow-up examinations. Cox discrete-time proportional hazards models were used to evaluate factors associated with hearing aid adoption (presented as hazards ratios [HRs] and 95% confidence intervals [95% CI]). Results: The 10-year cumulative incidence of hearing aid adoption was 14 per 1,000 person years. Factors significantly associated with adoption in a multivariable model were higher education (vs. 16+ years; 0–12: HR: 0.36, 95% CI [0.19, 0.69]; 13–15: HR: 0.52, 95% CI [0.27, 0.98]), worse high-frequency pure-tone average (per +1 dB; HR: 1.04, 95% CI [1.02, 1.06]), self-reported hearing handicap (screening versions of the Hearing Handicap Inventory score &gt; 8; HR: 1.85, 95% CI [1.02, 3.38]), answering yes to “Do friends and relatives think you have a hearing problem?” (HR: 3.18, 95% CI [1.60, 6.33]) and using closed captions (HR: 2.86, 95% CI [1.08, 7.57]). Effects of age and sex were not significant. Conclusions: Hearing aid adoption rates were low. Hearing sensitivity, socioeconomic status, and measures of the impact of HL on daily life were associated with adoption.

    "abstract": "Purpose Falls are considered a significant public health issue, and hearing loss has been shown to be an independent risk factor for falls. The primary objective of this study was to determine if hearing aid use modified (reduced) the association. We hypothesized that routine hearing aid use would reduce the impact of hearing loss on the odds of falling. If hearing aid users have reduced odds of falling, then that would have an important impact on falls prevention health care. Method Data from 8,091 individuals 40 years of age and older who completed National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycles 1999-2004 were used. NHANES comprises a series of cross-sectional studies, each of which is representative of the total civilian noninstitutionalized population of children and adults in the United States, enabling unbiased national estimates of health that can be independently reproduced. Self-reported hearing, hearing aid status, falls history, and comorbidities were extracted and analyzed using regression modeling. Results The 8,091 individuals were grouped based on a self-reported history of falls in the last year. Self-reported hearing loss was significantly associated with odds of falling. Categorizing individuals based on routine hearing aid use was included as an interaction term in the fully adjusted models and was not significant, suggesting no difference in falls based on hearing aid status. Conclusions The unique results of the current study show that when examining self-reported hearing in a nationally representative sample, hearing aid use does not appear to mitigate or modify the association between self-reported hearing and falls. Future research designs are highlighted to address limitations identified using NHANES data for this research and focus on the use of experimental designs to further understand the association between hearing loss and falls, including whether hearing loss may be a modifiable risk factor for falls.

    "abstract": "Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted normal operations of health care services, broad sectors of the economy, and the ability to socialize freely. For those with tinnitus, such changes can be factors in exacerbating tinnitus. The purpose of this study was to determine tinnitus help-seeking behavior, which resources individuals utilized to cope during the pandemic, and what additional support is desired. Method An exploratory cross-sectional study design including 1,522 adults with tinnitus living in North America (Canada and the United States) was used. Data were collected through an online survey distributed by the American Tinnitus Association via e-mail. Free text from open-ended questions was analyzed using the automated content analysis. The responses to the structured questionnaire were analyzed using descriptive and nonparametric statistics. Results Significantly less tinnitus support was sought during the pandemic, and very few respondents utilized tinnitus support networks during the pandemic at the time the survey was conducted. Nonetheless, seeking support during the pandemic was significantly associated with significantly less tinnitus distress. The most frequently utilized resources for coping during the pandemic were contacting family and friends, spending time outdoors or in nature, relaxation, and exercise. Such tools for coping were associated with significantly less tinnitus distress. The support requested and advice provided by participants to health care services had overlap. The main support needs related to managing tinnitus included addressing hearing loss, providing peer support, finding cures, and accessing trained and understanding health care providers to help. The advice for professionals related to tinnitus management included the need for cures, personalized support, addressing hearing loss, targeting the tinnitus percept, and providing more information about the condition. Conclusions These findings provide suggestions on how to better support those with tinnitus at a time when health care is undergoing rapid changes. Findings can be used by stakeholders, clinical practitioners, and tinnitus support services to devise ways to work more effectively together to improve access to patient-driven, suitable, accessible, and evidence-based support.

Individuals suffering a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or concussion may be prescribed bed rest, but for some, symptoms may persist and require different treatment options. The aim of this mini-systematic review was to synthesize the best available evidence regarding the effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) as a treatment option for adults with mTBIs.A systematic review of the literature was performed following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Search term concepts were VRT and mTBI. Records meeting the inclusion criteria were extracted from the following databases: PubMed and CINAHL. A manual search of reference lists identified additional studies. Inclusion criteria were (a) participants with mTBI/concussion characterized by dizziness, balance, and/or other vestibular symptoms; (b) VRT as the primary treatment; and (c) self-reported and/or performance-based outcome measures. Data were extracted using a standardized tool, and studies were critically appraised.Five studies were included in the systematic review: one randomized controlled trial, two retrospective chart reviews, one pre-/post-intervention study, and one case series. Four of the five studies found VRT to be effective at reducing postconcussion symptoms after head injury. Self-reported measures were included in all studies; performance-based measures were included in four out of five studies. None of the studies reported adverse effects of intervention.Results suggest VRT is an effective treatment option for patients with persistent/lingering symptoms after concussion/mTBI, as demonstrated by self-reported and performance-based outcome measures. Results of this study emphasize the need for audiologists to be thoroughly familiar with VRT as an effective treatment for patients with persistent symptoms following mTBI.",

In this study, we propose a questionnaire consisting of 24 listening situations based on the Common Sound Scenarios (CoSS) framework.Seventeen experienced hearing aid (HA) users filled out the Hearing-Related Lifestyle Questionnaire four times: Days 1, 2, 15, and 29. The questionnaire consisted of 24 listening situations that participants rated on frequency of occurrence, importance to hear well, difficulty to hear, and HA satisfaction. Four questionnaire outcomes were extracted from these ratings: richness of hearing-related lifestyle, hearing demand, hearing difficulty, and HA satisfaction. Additionally, the participants were asked whether any listening situations are not understandable or relatable, whether any situations are missing from the questionnaire, and whether the number of questions is acceptable. Test-retest reliability analyses were done to assess whether the questionnaire outcomes are reliable across the four reports. Correlation analyses were done to assess whether there is a relationship between the questionnaire outcomes.The questionnaire outcomes have excellent reliability. The listening situations in the questionnaire are generally complete and relatable, and the number of questions is acceptable. Correlation analyses revealed that the questionnaire outcomes are related to each other.Currently, there are no other hearing-related lifestyle questionnaires that purely assess listening situations. The proposed questionnaire has the potential to add to our understanding of hearing-related lifestyle of people needing or undergoing hearing care.https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.21514044.",

This study comprised a subsample (n = 125) selected from an unscreened cohort of 85-year-olds born in 1930, within the Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort Studies in Sweden.Test results were reported descriptively. Sensorineural hearing loss was present in one or both ears in almost all participants (98%), and the majority had absent DPOAEs. Only approximately 6% had additional conductive hearing loss, that is, mixed hearing loss. Approximately 20% of the participants with a pure-tone average at 0.5-4 kHz < 60 dB HL had worse word recognition scores compared with predicted scores by the Speech Intelligibility Index (SII), whereas only two participants were classified with neural dysfunction with the use of ABR.Sensorineural hearing loss, likely related to outer hair cell loss, was present in the vast majority of 85-year-olds. Conductive/mixed hearing loss appears to be relatively rare in advanced age. Poor word recognition scores in relation to SII-predicted scores were relatively common (20%) in 85-year-olds, whereas auditory neuropathy was only rarely identified (1.6%) by the use of ABR latencies. To explain abnormal word recognition and to identify the neural component of hearing loss among the older-old population, future research should consider factors such as listening effort and cognition among the older-old population.",

Method: Analyses were primarily descriptive and relied on prevalence estimates, supported by logistic-regression analyses, and distribution-free medians. Otoscopic examinations were performed by trained technicians with review and supervision by a clinical audiologist. Effects of age, sex, and race/ethnicity were also examined. Results: Overall, the prevalence of abnormal otoscopy was approximately 12%–15% with higher prevalence among males at most ages and for both sexes for age ≥ 60 years. Typically, 93% or more of the observed abnormalities were due to excessive or impacted cerumen, mainly the former. Logistic-regression analyses for the 6–19-year-olds found that only race/ethnicity affected the odds with non-Hispanic Blacks and Asians have higher odds for otoscopic abnormalities than non-Hispanic Whites. For 20- to 69-year-old adults, the odds of having abnormal otoscopic findings were about twice as high for males versus females, 60-year-olds versus 20-year-olds, and non-Hispanic Blacks versus non-Hispanic Whites. Overall, the effect of otoscopic abnormalities on the pure-tone averages for 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz and 3000, 4000, and 6000 Hz were negligible (&lt; 3 dB), and this did not vary substantially with sex, race/ethnicity, or age. Conclusion: Abnormal otoscopy, typically excessive cerumen, was observed in about 12%–15% of the individuals in this national sample, but the presence of such abnormalities had minimal effect on hearing sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The goal of this study was to observe sensory gating–related networks underlying cortical auditory evoked potential (CAEP) peak components in individuals with and without minimal tinnitus, as measured using the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI). This analysis was performed on previously published sensory gating responses in normal-hearing adults with and without minimal tinnitus. Method: Independent component analysis was performed for each individual CAEP gating component (Pa, P50, N1, and P2). Significant components were retained for source localization analyses within the following groups: no tinnitus, tinnitus with a THI score ≤ 6, and tinnitus with a THI score &gt; 6. Brain source localization was performed on the gating difference wave for each component using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography. Results: Gating-related networks were identified within each group. Different regional sources were observed between groups, with parietal sources underlying the Pa and P50 components as tinnitus severity increased. A larger prefrontal regional activation was also shown for the N1 gating component as tinnitus severity increased. These results expand upon the functional gating responses via CAEP waveforms in a previously published study. Conclusions: The auditory gating response, as measured via CAEPs, has previously been shown to significantly correlate with an increase in tinnitus severity in adults with normal hearing. The corresponding changes in the gating response appear to be supported by different cortical regions in those without tinnitus, those with a THI score ≤ 6, and those with a THI score &gt; 6. Next, functional differences between localized cortical regions should be tested.",

In contrast to standard tympanometry, which is generally measured at a single stiffness-dominated low frequency, WAI detects mechanical effects on both the mass and stiffness properties of the middle ear across a wide range of frequencies, resulting in a more comprehensive assessment of middle-ear mechanics in healthy and pathological ears. Despite a plethora of research demonstrating the clinical utility of this measure, clinical adoption of WAI is still limited. This work explores audiologists' use and perceptions of WAI, with the goal of identifying the barriers to its clinical adoption.",

Method: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search across databases including PubMed, WoS, EMBASE, and IEEE. Of the 5,981 records initially identified, 22 studies met our inclusion criteria after screening. Most of these studies (68%) focused on nonverbal communication modalities using tools such as sign language and visual cues, while the remainder focused on verbal communication. A descriptive synthesis was used due to the expected diversity in study characteristics. Results: Our assessment showed a substantial emphasis on educational impacts, speech perception, and cognitive skills development through AR and VR. The reviewed articles provide preliminary evidence on the efficacy of these technologies in teaching sign language, enhancing cognitive skills such as reasoning, and improving speech perception among the deaf or hard of hearing individuals. Conclusion: This review underscores the transformative potential of AR and VR in addressing communication challenges faced by individuals who are hard of hearing, emphasizing the need for further research with diverse, larger sample sizes to investigate these technologies for broader communication support.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Cochlear implant (CI) recipients who listen with a hearing aid (HA) in the contralateral ear, known as bimodal listeners, demonstrate individual variability in speech recognition in noise. This variability may be due in part to differences in the processing delays of the CI and HA devices. This study investigated the influence of matching the processing delays of CI and HA devices on masked speech recognition for bimodal listeners. Method: Twelve postlingually deafened adult CI recipients completed a task of masked speech recognition in two listening conditions: (a) independent default CI and HA processing delays (mismatched) and (b) with their HA-specific delay applied to the CI processing delay (matched). Speech recognition was evaluated with AzBio sentences presented in a 10-talker masker at a 0 dB SNR. The target was presented from the front loudspeaker at 0° azimuth, and the masker was co-located with the target, presented 90° toward the CI ear, or presented 90° toward the HA ear. Results: There was a significant main effect for target-to-masker configuration, with better performance when the masker was spatially separated from the target. Better masked speech recognition was observed in the matched condition as compared to the mismatched condition. Conclusion: Bimodal listeners may experience better masked speech recognition when the processing delay of the CI is individualized to match the processing delay of the contralateral HA.

As part of a course development evaluation of an audiology counseling course, a preliminary study was conducted to examine two student learning objectives: to learn how to differentiate between content messages and affective messages and to learn how to respond to each type of message appropriately. Pre- and postcourse data collected from two cohorts of audiology graduate students indicated that (a) before taking the course, students were likely to provide informational responses to personal adjustment comments (a type of \"communication mismatch\"), and (b) at the end of the class, they were much more likely to match or mirror affective statements with affective responses.",

A group of adult first-time hearing aid users with moderate, high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss was studied over a 5-month postfitting period. Half of the group served as a control group; half constituted the treatment group. Treatment consisted of making as many postfitting electroacoustic manipulations as the participants’ complaints/observations required. These adjustments were withheld from the control group individuals. Group performance differences were assessed using the COSI, two versions of the APHAB, a Satisfaction scale, a Sound Quality tool, and the SIN test. Analysis revealed no statistically significant differences in the control and treatment groups’ performances or perceived benefit at any of the five postfitting test sessions. These data suggested that there was no measurable advantage to be derived from making postfitting frequency-gain adjustments of 10 dB or less to hearing aids with wide dynamic range compression fitted in the manner described in this article. Definitive studies of the effects of postfitting electroacoustic fine tuning must be undertaken.",

Specifically, audiologists who regularly serve children were asked to complete a series of questions on their educational preparation and their hearing aid selection, fitting, and verification practices for children with multiple impairments. For purposes of this survey, multiple impairments included vision impairment, mental retardation, physical impairment, and autism spectrum disorders. Findings from this survey suggest that children with special needs in addition to hearing loss are typically fit in the same way and with the same type of amplification as those with hearing loss only.

    "abstract": "Otoacoustic emissions are low-intensity sounds that are produced in the cochlea and transmitted through the middle ear apparatus to the ear canal. They can be detected and extracted from the background noise in the ear canal through the use of a sensitive microphone and selective filtering or averaging techniques. The technical aspects of emission recording are very similar to those associated with the detection and capture of auditory evoked potentials. Emissions provide an acoustic link to a physiological window through which we can view the auditory periphery using frequency-specific stimuli that are presented at low and moderate intensities. The window provides an opportunity to examine cochlear activity that occurs prior to stimulation of the nervous system. Tonal emissions occur spontaneously in approximately 40% of people who have normal thresholds for pure-tone stimuli. SOAE and other types of emissions may be influenced by both ipsilateral and contralateral stimuli. One form of interaction results in suppression of the emission, and the tuning patterns associated with suppression of emissions by ipsilateral stimuli have characteristics that are similar to tuning patterns associated with single cochlear hair cells and individual neurons of the auditory nerve. These findings and other lines of evidence support the conclusion that an emission having tonal characteristics is produced from a very restricted region of the cochlear partition. Emissions may be evoked by brief click or tonal stimuli, and by continuous tonal stimuli, in virtually all individuals who have normal pure-tone thresholds and uncompromised middle ear systems. The EOAE are compromised by conditions that compromise the function of the cochlea, and they hold promise as tools that might be employed in screening for hearing loss. Preliminary findings suggest that screening employing TEOAE produces a yield that is similar to that produced by screening programs based on auditory brainstem responses. Emissions may offer advantages over current screening methods because of the ease with which they can be recorded and their apparent independence from neurological influence. Many questions regarding the origin and nature of emissions remain unanswered, but they appear to offer great sensitivity to the status of the auditory periphery. DPOAE provide an opportunity to scan the cochlear partition from base to apex with frequency-specific stimuli, and give the examiner a detailed view of the status of the end organ. The study of DPOAE holds great promise in refinement of site of lesion identification. It is exciting to witness the development of a tool to help clinical examiners probe the function of the previously inaccessible cochlea.",

Three- and 4-year-old children who attended Head Start centers in rural, traditionally medically underserved, eastern North Carolina participated ( n = 1,462). Screening procedures and pass/refer criteria were based on the Guidelines for Audiologic Screening (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association [ASHA], Panel on Audiologic Assessment, 1997). Only 54% ( n = 787) of children passed the initial screening (i.e., passed all three of the screening components, which included pure-tone audiometry, tympanometry, and otoscopy), and an additional 22% ( n = 323) passed the rescreening, for an overall pass rate of 76%. The initial pass rate was 90%, 71%, and 71% for otoscopy, tympanometry, and pure-tone audiometry, respectively. After the initial screening, 675 children were referred (i.e., 83%, 2%, and 15% for audiologic rescreening, medical evaluation, or both, respectively). About 71% ( n = 478) received the recommended evaluation. Follow-up assessment compliance after the rescreening was poor. Slightly more than 10% of children were evaluated. The hearing status of 267 (i.e., 18.3%) children was never determined. Six (i.e., 0.5%) of the 1,195 children who completed the audiologic screening and/or received diagnostic audiologic assessment were confirmed to have hearing loss. Methodological factors that may have contributed to this high refer rate include the use of all screening techniques (pure tones, tympanometry, and otoscopy), procedural considerations in testing protocol and pass/refer criteria, and the demographic characteristics of the children screened.",

Hearing aid outcome measures were obtained at both 1-month ( n = 53) and 6-month ( n = 34) postfit intervals with each device. Outcome measures included multiple measures of speech-recognition performance and self-report measures of hearing aid benefit, satisfaction, and usage.

Although both devices provided significant benefits to the wearers, there were no significant differences in the benefits provided by either device at the 1-month or 6-month postfit intervals.",

An ABR screen was combined with a multilevel ABR (40, 70, and 90 dB nHL) for referrals.Parents of 206 infants participated; 69% of the infants underwent diagnostic follow-up. Of those with follow-up, 37% had normal hearing, 38% had hearing loss, and parents were unsure of hearing test results for 25%. Follow-up by 6 months of age occurred for 13% in 1999, increasing to 31% by 2002. Infants who did not pass their screening in both ears had confirmed hearing loss in 56% vs. 25% in those who passed in 1 ear. Also, 67% of infants with bilateral pass levels of 90 dB nHL or more had confirmed hearing loss, vs. 32% in all others.Timely follow-up after NHS referral in our program has improved over time. Multilevel ABR may facilitate allocation of appropriate resources to track and ensure follow-up in infants at high risk for hearing loss.",

The guidelines outline options for implanting one ear only, implanting one ear plus use of a contralateral hearing aid, and implanting both ears. Method Our method for selecting the best cochlear implant or hearing aid outcome is derived from the amount of usable hearing of the patient. This approach requires the measurement of aided speech perception with each ear separately and then bilaterally. Guidelines are based on the following: (a) overall level of performance with hearing aids relative to what is expected from a cochlear implant, (b) the contributions from each ear, and (c) whether there is a binaural advantage. Conclusions Our general recommendation is to provide the patient with the best opportunity for binaural hearing. Since the guidelines put forth in this article are theoretically based, future efforts should be aimed at examining the validity of these guidelines.",

In the case reported here, a 29-year-old woman presented with sudden bilateral sensorineural hearing loss subsequent to reported heroin overdose. She was fitted with binaural amplification and monitored over 3 months. Method The Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults—Screening version (HHIA–S), Expected Consequences of Hearing Aid Ownership (ECHO), and Satisfaction With Amplification in Daily Life (SADL) were administered after hearing aid fitting. These measures assessed the patient’s perceptions of handicap as well as her expectations of and satisfaction with amplification. Results The patient’s responses on the HHIA–S were higher than normative values at the time of the incident, indicating perceptions of greater handicap. Her perceptions of handicap decreased after having been fit with hearing aids. Responses on the SADL and ECHO were within normative values. Conclusion This case provides a framework for managing the rehabilitation of this population. Audiologists need to understand their role in the careful monitoring of hearing rehabilitation and how they may help in determining complaints that may be hearing- or device-related versus those associated with the psychological symptoms experienced during the withdrawal period.",

Most participants also recorded their experiences during the FM-system trial period in a journal. Results The results suggested significantly improved speech recognition in noise with the neck-loop FM system before and after the trial period, with no changes in performance between test sessions. On average, the rating scale and journals revealed improvements with the FM system, relative to the CI alone, in noisy environments or situations at a distance from the primary talker or sound source.

Method We recruited 15 experienced hearing aid wearers who had ceased wearing their devices for > 1 year (i.e., \"In-the-Drawer\" group) and 15 individuals with self-reported hearing difficulties who had yet to adopt hearing aids (i.e., \"First-Time\" group). We obtained participant attitudes pre- and post-SHAA using 3 surveys and analyzed perceptible changes in attitude for each survey. Comparative findings were then generalized to the health belief model in the context of perceived benefits (i.e., efficacy of an action to reduce risk) and reduced perceived barriers (i.e., tangible and psychological costs that inhibit compliance and adoption). Results A short trial period with an SHAA appears to modify the psychological perception toward amplification and reduce listener perception with respect to hearing difficulties in both groups. Conclusion A short trial period with an SHAA improved the perceived benefits and reduced the perceived barriers in the average First-Time listener, who often delays adoption of traditional amplification. The same trial period was also found to improve perceived benefits and reduce perceived barriers for the average In-the-Drawer listener, but to a lesser degree than their First-Time counterparts.",

However, tinnitus loudness cannot be measured objectively. It is most commonly assessed by obtaining a loudness match (LM) with a pure tone and by using a numeric rating scale (NRS). Constrained loudness scaling (CLS) is a more recent measure of tinnitus loudness that utilizes auditory training of a fixed loudness scale to guide tinnitus loudness judgments. The purpose of this study was to compare results using these 3 measures of tinnitus loudness. Method This study obtained tinnitus loudness measures of LM, NRS, and CLS with 170 participants. These participants are part of a larger study obtaining repeated measures over 6 months. Only baseline data are presented. Results Correlations between all measures were weak to moderate: LM versus CLS ( r = .46), CLS versus NRS ( r = .49), and LM versus NRS ( r = .38). Conclusion Further systematic research is needed to more fully understand the relationships between these different measures and to establish a valid measure of tinnitus loudness.",

Little is known about the acoustic characteristics of contemporary general education classrooms that include CHH compared to classrooms of typical peers. We proposed the following research questions about the acoustic environment of general education classrooms including CHH: (a) How reliable are acoustic measurements collected using an iOS device, application, and external microphone? (b) What proportion of classrooms meet the American National Standards Institute's standards for unoccupied noise levels and reverberation? Method A smartphone application was used to measure sound levels, reverberation, and clarity for 164 general education classrooms including CHH. Linear mixed models were used to examine the following: (a) reliability of acoustic measures made using an application and external microphone and (b) predictors of sound levels, reverberation, and clarity for elementary classrooms including CHH. Results Results indicate the application reliably measures classroom acoustics. Classrooms exceeded the American National Standards Institute's recommended noise levels, but met reverberation time guidelines. Grade; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning status; and room volume predicted classroom acoustics. Conclusions As a screening tool, the application was shown to be effective in reliably measuring reverberation and classroom noise levels. The high levels of noise in unoccupied classrooms indicate a need for increased use of noise abatement strategies and the use of remote-microphone systems, especially in classrooms where noise levels cannot feasibly be reduced. Using an application may be a cost-effective method for monitoring important acoustic features that impact children's ability to understand speech in the classroom.",

Depending on the experimental condition, the spectra of the maskers relative to that of speech were set to be completely embedded with, partially overlapping, or completely separate from, the speech. The maskers were either steady or amplitude modulated and were presented at +10 dB signal-to-noise ratio.NH-Sim listeners experienced progressively more masking as the masker became more spectrally overlapping with speech, whereas CI listeners experienced masking even when the masker was spectrally remote from the speech signal. Both the NH-Sim and CI listeners experienced significant modulation interference when noise was modulated at a syllabic rate (4 Hz), suggesting that listeners may experience both modulation interference and masking release. Thus, modulated noise has mixed and counteracting effects on speech perception.When the NH-Sim and CI listeners with poor spectral resolution were tested using syllabic-like rates of modulated noise, they tended to integrate or confuse the noise with the speech, causing an increase in speech errors. Optional training programs might be useful for CI listeners who show more difficulty understanding speech in noise.",

Results The family pedigrees reveal characteristic X-linked inheritance patterns. Phenotypic features associated with the SMPX ( DFNX4 ) mutation include early onset in males with rapid progression from mild and flat to sloping sensorineural loss, with highly variable onset and hearing loss severity in females. In contrast, phenotypic features associated with the POU3F4 (DFNX2) mutation are characterized by an early onset, mixed hearing loss with fluctuation in males, and a normal hearing phenotype reported for females. Conclusions The study shows how this unique inheritance pattern and both gender and mutation-specific phenotype variations can alert audiologists to the presence of X-linked genetic etiologies in their clinical practice.

Children's loudness ratings for sounds above 72 dB SPL were lowest when fitted with the DSL v5 Noise prescription combined with directional microphones.

    "abstract": "Purpose The authors address 3 questions: (a) What is evidence-based practice (EBP), and why is it important for adults with hearing impairment? (b) What is the evidence about intervention options for adults who fail a hearing screening and are identified with hearing impairment? (c) What intervention options do adults choose when identified with hearing impairment for the first time? Method The 5 steps of the EBP process are discussed in relation to a clinical question about whether hearing aids and communication programs reduce activity limitations and participation restrictions compared with no treatment for adults who fail a hearing screening and are identified with hearing impairment. Results Systematic reviews of the evidence indicate that both hearing aids and communication programs reduce activity limitations and participation restrictions for this population and are therefore appropriate options. A study is then described in which these options were presented to 153 clients identified with hearing impairment for the first time: 43% chose hearing aids, 18% chose communication programs, and the remaining 39% chose not to take any action. Conclusion EBP supports the offer of intervention options to adults who fail a hearing screening and are identified with hearing impairment.",

    "abstract": "Purpose This study describes the effects and costs of hearing screening and rehabilitation in residential care homes for the elderly. It was hypothesized that offering an in-house hearing screening and rehabilitation program would be an effective strategy to increase hearing aid ownership among the residents. Method All 705 residents of 8 residential care homes in the Netherlands were invited to participate in a hearing screening (pure-tone audiometry) and rehabilitation (hearing aids) program. Resident participation was analyzed, and the costs were calculated. Results A total of 243 residents (34%) participated in the screening, 222 (91%) of whom had hearing loss. Ninety-one (41%) of the screening participants with hearing loss started rehabilitation, which was successful for 50 (55%) of them. Hearing aid ownership among the residents with hearing loss increased from 28% at the start of the program to 33% at the end. The costs were €1,896 (US $2,480) per successfully rehabilitated resident. Hearing aid trials and hearing aids together accounted for 83% of the total costs. Conclusion The effectiveness of the program was limited, as hearing aid ownership increased only slightly. Cost reduction measures should focus on decreasing the number of unsuccessful hearing aid trials.",

Method In Part 1, an HAUG was evaluated using the Suitability Assessment of Material (SAM) and readability formulas (Flesch Reading Ease [Flesch, 1943], Flesch-Kincaid Readability Formula [Kincaid, Fishburne, Rogers, &amp; Chissom, 1957], and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook [McLaughlin, 1969]). The HAUG was revised using results from the SAM and best practice guidelines. The revision included generating a video. In Part 2, 30 adults with hearing impairment were randomly assigned to use either the original guide ( N = 15) or the revised guide and video ( N = 15) to perform a utility task. Participants' self-efficacy was measured using the Basic and Advanced Handling subscales of the Measure of Audiologic Rehabilitation Self-Efficacy for Hearing Aids questionnaire. SAM and readability were compared between the original and revised guides (Doak, Doak, &amp; Root, 1996). Results SAM and readability were improved following the revision. Participants in the revised guide group performed significantly better on the utility task and on the Measure of Audiologic Rehabilitation Self-Efficacy for Hearing Aids subscales than participants in the original guide group. Conclusions These results are encouraging as they indicate that there is scope to influence self-efficacy and utility performance through the use of appropriate HAUGs.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Previous research suggests the existence of gap detection impairments because of tinnitus. The current study aimed to determine whether there was objective evidence of gap impairment in individuals with tinnitus by recording silent gap in white noise cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) in a chronic tinnitus group and a no-tinnitus group. The results were compared to previous gap-evoked potential and behavioral gap detection studies. Method Chronic tinnitus and no-tinnitus groups were formed by matching pairs of subjects ( n = 26) based on age, gender, and hearing thresholds. Behaviorally determined gap detection thresholds were used to define the electrophysiological gap duration conditions of subthreshold, threshold, and suprathreshold gaps in white noise. Amplitude, latency, and area of the CAEP were analyzed by group and condition using mixed-model analyses of variance. Results Across all participants, as the duration of the gap increased, amplitude and area of the CAEP increased. There were no significant differences by tinnitus status between groups for any outcome measures, except for a significant interaction between group and gap duration for P1 latency. Conclusions Silent gap-evoked CAEPs can be recorded in adults with and without tinnitus. Amplitude and area were sensitive to gap duration across groups; latency was not. Contrary to hypotheses, there was little evidence supporting differences in gap-evoked CAEPs between the tinnitus and control groups. Stimulus and other factors that may have contributed to the lack of a group difference in the current study are discussed, as well as implications for future studies of objective measures of tinnitus perception.

Method This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study. The data for 292 consecutive patients who attended a Tinnitus and Hyperacusis Therapy Specialist Clinic in the United Kingdom were included. Results Forty-six of 292 patients, or 15.75% of the patients, expressed that they have been bothered by suicidal and self-harm ideations within the last 2 weeks. Furthermore, 38.7% of the patients (113/292) reported that, while they were growing up during the first 18 years of life, their parent(s) were suffering from a mental illness. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant relationship between suicidal and self-harm ideations and the history of parental mental illness after adjusting the model for (a) tinnitus disability as measured via the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (Newman, Jacobson, & Spitzer, 1996), (b) hyperacusis as measured via the Hyperacusis Questionnaire (Khalfa et al., 2002), (c) anxiety as measured via the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, & Löwe, 2006), (d) depression as measured via the Patient Health Questionnaire (Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001), and (e) age and gender. Adjusted odds ratio was 2.5 (95% CI [1.14, 5.6], p = .022). The only other variable that was significantly related to the risk of suicidal and self-harm ideations was depression; adjusted odds ratio was 7.7 (95% CI [2.6, 26.3], p = .001). Conclusions Clinicians who offer tinnitus and hyperacusis rehabilitation should screen for suicidal and self-harm ideations among patients, especially for those with symptoms of depression and a childhood history of parental mental illness. Patients with suicidal and self-harm ideations should be referred to mental health services for further diagnosis and treatment.",

Method Twenty-five participants presented with an unaided hearing threshold of ≤ 80 dB HL at 125 Hz pre-operatively in the ear to be implanted. Participants were implanted with a long (31.5-mm) electrode array. The unaided hearing threshold at 125 Hz was compared between the preoperative and postoperative intervals (i.e., initial CI activation, and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after activation). Results Eight participants maintained an unaided hearing threshold of ≤ 80 dB HL at 125 Hz postoperatively. The majority ( n = 5) demonstrated aidable low-frequency hearing at initial activation, whereas 3 other participants experienced an improvement in unaided low-frequency hearing thresholds at subsequent intervals. Conclusions CI recipients can retain residual hearing sensitivity with fully inserted long electrode arrays, and low-frequency hearing thresholds may improve during the postoperative period. Therefore, unaided hearing thresholds obtained within the initial weeks after surgery may not reflect later hearing sensitivity. Routine measurement of postoperative unaided hearing thresholds—even for patients who did not demonstrate aidable hearing thresholds initially after cochlear implantation—will identify CI recipients who may benefit from electric–acoustic stimulation.",

Participants completed a forced-choice task, a perceived competence rating task, and a sociometric rating task. Results Children in this study perceived their peers who wore hearing aids as having less physical competence and less peer acceptance than peers without hearing aids, thus confirming a hearing aid effect in children as young as 6 years of age. Both younger and older children were more likely to choose pictures of children wearing hearing aids as having less peer acceptance than pictures of children who were not wearing hearing aids. Older children were also more likely to choose a picture of a child with hearing aids as having less physical competence than a picture of a child without hearing aids. Conclusion These findings should serve to alert professionals who work with children who have hearing loss that additional support and education might be warranted for these children and their peers with normal hearing.",

Method Adults were recruited via online methods to complete an online hearing screening test within the greater Durban area in South Africa. On submission of contact details after failing the screening, contact was made via telephone to assess readiness for further hearing care. If motivated and willing to continue, a face-to-face appointment for diagnostic hearing testing was confirmed, at which time an e-mail with an online mobile device and computer proficiency survey was sent. Hearing services were offered using combined online and face-to-face methods. Results Within 2 years (June 2017 to June 2019), 1,259 people from the target location submitted their details for the clinic audiologist to contact, of whom 931 participants (73.95%) failed the screening test. Of these participants, 5.69% (53/931, 57.41% men) attended a face-to-face diagnostic hearing evaluation. Mobile device and computer proficiency scores were not a predictor of acquiring hearing services. Age was the only significant predictor (p = .018) for those continuing with hearing care. Patients who continued with hearing care by acquiring hearing aids and support services were older (M = 73.63 years, SD = 11.62) and on average aware of their hearing loss for a longer time (M = 14.71 years, SD = 15.77), as compared to those who discontinued hearing health care who were younger (M = 59.21 years, SD = 14.42) and on average aware of their hearing loss for a shorter time (M = 6.37 years, SD = 9.26). Conclusions Digital proficiency is not a predictor for acquiring hearing services through a hybrid online and face-to-face hearing care model.

Method Sixty listeners (aged 23–80 years) with symmetrical hearing were tested. Binaural behavioral processing was measured by the Words-in-Noise Test, the 500-Hz masking level difference, and the Dichotic Digit Test. Electrophysiologic responses were assessed by the auditory middle latency response binaural interaction component. Results No correlations among binaural measures were found. Age accounted for the greatest amount of variability in speech-in-noise performance. Age was significantly correlated with the Words-in-Noise Test binaural advantage and dichotic ear advantage. Partial correlations, however, revealed that this was an effect of hearing status rather than age per se. Inspection of individual results revealed that 20% of listeners demonstrated reduced binaural performance for at least 2 of the binaural measures. Conclusions The lack of significant correlations among variables suggests that each is an important measurement of binaural abilities. For some listeners, binaural processing was abnormal, reflecting a binaural processing deficit not identified by monaural audiologic tests. The inclusion of a binaural test battery in the audiologic evaluation is supported given that these listeners may benefit from alternative forms of audiologic rehabilitation.",

Studies of FGFRs and their ligands, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), have revealed clues to the precise contribution of aberrant FGFR signaling to inner ear morphogenesis and the hearing loss encountered in craniosynostoses. The purpose of this article is to review basic studies of FGFRs with emphasis on their function and expression in the inner ear and surrounding structures.A Medline search was performed to find basic science articles regarding FGFR, their ligands, and their expression and relevant mouse models. Additional items searched included clinical descriptions and studies of individuals with FGFR-related craniosynostosis syndromes.The FGF signaling pathway is essential for the morphogensis and proper function of the inner ear and auditory sensory epithelium.The variable auditory phenotypes seen in individuals with Muenke syndrome may have a genetic basis, likely due to multiple interacting factors in the genetic environment or modifying factors. Further analysis and studies of mouse models of Muenke syndrome, in particular, may provide clues to the specific effects of the defining mutation in FGFR3 in the inner ear not only at birth but also into adulthood. In particular, investigations into these models may give insight into the variable expression and incomplete penetrance of this phenotype.",

In this article, the methods important for differentiating between a hearing threshold and minimum response level (MRL), important for an accurate diagnosis, are described.Operant conditioning procedures, used during visual reinforcement audiometry and conditioned play audiometry, are reviewed. Case examples are provided that demonstrate the importance of using evidence-based procedures, evaluating the success of such procedures, and using cross-check measures for interpreting responses as thresholds or MRLs.Behavioral-hearing thresholds can be obtained when operant conditioning procedures are successful and cross-check measures corroborate the audiometric results. When MRLs are obtained, cross-check measures are critical in determining the likelihood of hearing loss and making follow-up recommendations.Early diagnosis of hearing loss is important so that intervention can be initiated within critical periods during infant and childhood learning. Accurate diagnosis depends on the audiologist, who must adhere to evidence-based procedures, use cross-check measures, and evaluate the validity of each procedure. Future research and guidelines are needed to examine decision-making processes in pediatric audiology that ensure diagnostic accuracy and timely intervention for infants and children identified with hearing loss.",

The goal for this report is to describe the 1st author's observed barriers to PCPs' willingness to learn about hearing health care and the subsequent facilitators to learning. Method A team of PCPs and HHCPs created the “Communication: Hearing Loss in Elders” educational module. The module included (a) prereading developed from a combination of literature reviews and contextual factors and (b) a case study. Results The authors present the list of topics included in the module, and they reflect on why and how these topics were deemed important by the team. In particular, 2 topics were identified for motivating PCPs' behavior regarding hearing health care: (a) the overlap in symptoms and possible causation among depression, dementia, and hearing loss and (b) how hearing can affect efficiency of care regarding other health issues. Conclusions This personal reflective narrative gives the authors' opinions about what can make for a successful collaboration and presents some hypotheses regarding information that may motivate behavior change with regard to hearing care.",

All participants completed the 24-item SHQ. Also, a factor analysis and reliability tests were performed.Performance on the SHQ was high (87%) for the participants with normal hearing. Subjective ratings varied across different listening situations: Understanding speech in quiet (98%) was rated higher than sound localization (84%) and understanding speech in a background of noise (85%). Compared with previously published data (Tyler, Perreau, & Ji, 2009), listeners with normal hearing rated their spatial hearing ability significantly better than bilateral and unilateral CI users. Results confirmed that the SHQ is a reliable measure of spatial hearing ability for listeners with normal hearing.Overall, results indicated that the SHQ is able to capture expected differences between individuals with normal hearing and CI users.

A Wi-Fi router with background traffic and 2 affordable smartphones were used for debugging and technical validation comprising, among other things, multicasting capability, data packet loss, and battery consumption. Results MoBALS requires at least 2 smartphones connected to the same Wi-Fi router for signal transmission and reception. Subscriber identity module cards or Internet connections are not needed. MoBALS can be used alone or connected to a hearing aid or cochlear implant via direct audio input. Maximum data packet loss was 99.28%, and minimum battery life was 5 hr.

Method An interview was conducted with nine faculty members in the College of Health Professions at Towson University to discuss advantages and challenges of incorporating clinical simulation techniques into student learning. A thematic analysis was used to analyze the interview responses. Additionally, a web-based questionnaire was sent to all audiology graduate program directors nationwide, yielding a response rate of 63%. These data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results Interview responses revealed a number of benefits and barriers related to simulation use at the graduate level. Benefits included its use as a learning tool, a quality control measure, and an aid in professional development. It also increases students' confidence levels in clinical procedures and counseling skills and exposes them to a variety of clinical pathologies not routinely seen. Barriers included lack of training with simulators, lack of funding to purchase simulator technology, and lack of resources, such as time and space. At present, only 50% of audiology program directors reported using clinical simulation to train their students. Conclusions The field of audiology is embracing simulation techniques in training its preprofessional work force. To date, there has been limited guidance from professional organizations regarding the role of simulation in audiology. Additional assistance focusing on best practices for these techniques is warranted.",

In the current viewpoint, we first lay out the main issues that are central to the controversy surrounding APD, and then suggest a framework toward their resolution. Method The current viewpoint is informed by reviewing existing studies in the field of APD to better understand the issues contributing to the controversies in APD. Results We found that, within the current definition of APD, the two main issues that make the APD diagnosis controversial are (a) comorbidity with other disorders and (b) the lack of domain specificity. These issues remain unresolved, especially with the use of the existing behavioral APD test batteries. In this viewpoint, we shed light on how they can be mitigated by implementing the administration of an objective, physiological test battery. Conclusions By administering an objective test battery, as proposed in this viewpoint, we believe that it will be possible to achieve a higher degree of specificity to the auditory domain that will not only contribute towards clinical practice but also contribute towards strengthening APD as a theoretical construct.",

    "abstract": "Objectives The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of different types of maskers on speech understanding as a function of cognitive status in older adults. The hypothesis tested was that individuals with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia would perform like their age- and hearing status-matched control counterparts in modulated noise but would perform more poorly in the presence of competing speech. Design Participants (n = 39; age range: 55-77 years old) performed a speech-in-noise task and completed two cognitive screening tests and a measure of working memory. Sentences were presented in the presence of two types of maskers (i.e., speech envelope-modulated noise and two-talker, same-sex competing speech). Two analyses were undertaken: (a) a between-groups comparison of individuals diagnosed with MCI/dementia, individuals who failed both cognitive screeners (possible MCI), and age- and hearing status-matched neurologically healthy control individuals and (b) a mixed-model analysis of variance of speech perception performance as a function of working memory capacity. Results The between-groups comparison yielded significant group differences for speech understanding in both masking conditions, with the MCI/dementia group performing more poorly than the neurologically healthy controls and possible MCI groups. A single measure of working memory (Size Comparison Span [SICSPAN]) was correlated with performance on the speech perception task in the competing speech conditions. Conclusions Adults with a diagnosis of MCI or mild dementia performed more poorly on a speech perception task than their age- and hearing status-matched control counterparts in the presence of both maskers, with larger group mean differences when the target speech was presented in a two-talker masker. This suggests increased difficulty understanding speech in the presence of distracting backgrounds for people with MCI/dementia. Future studies should consider how to target this potentially vulnerable population as they may be experiencing increased difficulty communicating in challenging environments.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of any and chronic tinnitus among female and male individuals from varied Hispanic/Latino backgrounds and to estimate associations between risk factors for chronic tinnitus. Method: Our analysis used cross-sectional baseline data collected from 2008 to 2011 from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). Prevalence estimates and multivariable logistic regression were conducted using survey methodology. Participants included 15,768 adults (8,229 women and 7,539 men) aged 18–76 years. The primary outcome of interest was chronic tinnitus, defined as self-reported tinnitus lasting ≥ 5 min at a time and at least once per week. We hypothesized that after adjusting for covariates, the risk factors of depressed and anxious symptoms, smoking history, hypertension, and noise exposure history would be associated with higher odds of chronic tinnitus. Results: Unstratified prevalence for any tinnitus was 32.9%, and for chronic tinnitus, it was 12.1%. Sex-stratified results demonstrated that 2,995 female individuals (36.4%) and 2,187 male individuals (29.0%) reported any tinnitus, and of these, 1,043 female individuals (12.7%) and 870 male individuals (11.5%) reported chronic tinnitus. In the fully adjusted model, depressed and anxious symptoms as well as recreational noise exposure were associated with higher odds of chronic tinnitus in female individuals (odds ratios [ ORs ] = 1.06, confidence interval [CI; 1.04, 1.07]; 1.02, CI [1.01, 1.04]; and 1.40, CI [1.20, 1.62]) and in male individuals ( OR s = 1.06, CI [1.03, 1.08]; 1.05, CI [1.02, 1.08]; and 1.30, CI [1.05, 1.65]). Current smoking was a risk factor for chronic tinnitus in male individuals ( OR = 1.53, CI [1.16, 2.02]). Conclusions: Prevalence of any and chronic tinnitus in the HCHS/SOL baseline cohort is higher than that reported in previous studies, particularly among female individuals. Understanding risk factors associated with tinnitus is important for the development of culturally and linguistically appropriate public health programs that consider sex differences and promote lifestyle modifications known to lower the odds of experiencing tinnitus.",

The purpose of this study is to describe how hearing aid features are utilized in clinically fit devices and to evaluate the relationship between the fitted hearing aid feature and the Quick Speech-in-Noise Test (QuickSIN).Data from two laboratories were evaluated retrospectively, resulting in 107 bilateral hearing aid participants who obtained their hearing aids at clinics in their communities. Ages ranged from 60 to 93 years. Degree of speech-in-noise difficulty was evaluated using the QuickSIN (mild, moderate, or severe). Settings for directionality, digital noise reduction (DNR), and hearing assistive technology (HAT) use were documented. Directionality was categorized as omnidirectional, fixed (full-time directional), or adaptive (adjusts automatically based on noise source). DNR was recorded as either on or off. HAT use was recorded as either yes or no.QuickSIN scores ranged from -1.5 to 25 dB SNR loss (M = 7). A moderate correlation was determined for QuickSIN scores and pure-tone averages. Adaptive directionality was used most often, most participants had DNR turned on, and HAT use was low. The biggest contributions to the Chi-square test for directionality and degrees of speech-in-noise difficulty together were fixed/severe, fixed/moderate, and adaptive/mild.In this clinical sample, there was limited HAT use and advanced features are not set in a way that is consistent with speech-in-noise abilities. It is likely that patients fit with noise management that is not suited to their listening abilities are experiencing increased difficulties in challenging listening environments that could potentially be mitigated with alternative management. Evidence-based research on prefitting measures of speech in noise to help inform patient-centered clinical decisions is needed.",

In the study group, there were 62 unilateral and 68 bilateral cochlear implant (CI) users. The age at implantation ranged from 1 to 10 years, as they have substantial auditory skills. The participants' parents completed the ABEL individually, and 73 parents (28, study group; 45, control group) completed the ABEL again for test-retest reliability. Construct validity was tested using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and internal consistency was tested using Cronbach's alpha. Spearman's correlation test was used to assess the external validity of the total and all subscales of the ABEL and the Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (MAIS). Test-retest reliability was measured using the intraclass correlation coefficient.The Cronbach's α values for subscales ranged from .67 to .89, and the value was .93 (excellent) for the overall scale. External validity analyses showed moderate to strong correlations between the total and subscale scores of the ABEL and the MAIS, indicating high external validity. According to the CFA findings, the construct validity of the Turkish version of the ABEL was satisfactory. For the three-factor structure, the goodness-of-fit indices revealed a good fit, and only the normed fit index revealed an acceptable fit.The Turkish version of the ABEL is a reliable and valid assessment tool for children with CIs.",

There has also been considerable interest from researchers and clinicians in understanding how social media is used by the general public, patients, and health professionals to gather health-related information. Interest in the use of social media for audiovestibular disorders has also received attention, although published evidence synthesis of this use is lacking. The objective of this review article was to synthesize existing research studies related to social media use concerning hearing loss, tinnitus, and vestibular disorders.Comprehensive searches were performed in multiple databases between October and November 2020 and again in June 2021 and March 2022, with additional reports identified from article citations and unpublished literature. This review article was presented using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.A total of 1,512 articles were identified. Of these, 16 publications met the inclusion criteria. Overall, social media offered people the platform to learn about hearing loss, tinnitus, and vestibular disorders via advice and support seeking, personal experience sharing, general information sharing, and relationship building. Research studies were more common on information and user activities seen on Facebook Pages, Twitter, and YouTube videos. Misinformation was identified across all social media platforms for each of these conditions.Online discussions about audiovestibular disorders are evident, although inconsistencies in study procedures make it difficult to compare these discussion groups. Misinformation is a concern needing to be addressed during clinical consultations as well as via other public health means. Uniform guidelines are needed for research regarding the use of social media so that outcomes are comparable. Moreover, clinical studies examining how exposure to and engagement with social media information may impact outcomes (e.g., help seeking, rehabilitation uptake, rehabilitation use, and satisfaction) require exploration.https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.20667672.",

This research note presents an exploratory analysis of sound exposure dose from earphone use among college-aged adults using real-ear measures to estimate exposure level and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to estimate use time. Earphone levels were measured at the ear drum of 53 college students using their own devices, earphones, and preferred music and speech stimuli at their normal listening volume. Participants completed 1 week of EMA, where they reported on their minutes of earphone use every 2 hr. Based on the EMAs and their measured earphone levels, sound exposure doses from earphone use were calculated. Compliance on EMA was 73%, comparable to most studies using this method in audiology research. Earphone levels were lower than those reported by most prior literature. The average listening level across music and speech, with A-weighting and diffuse-field corrections, was 60 dBA. Earphone use time was also lower than most prior work. Most participants had doses under 1%. Using EMA to track earphone use is a potentially simple way to facilitate measurements of sound exposure from earphone use without relying on retrospective questionnaires or limiting the sample to specific devices, earphones, or apps. Evidence was also found for potentially lower sound levels and sound exposure doses from earphone use among college-aged adults than previously reported. https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.28205072.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The majority of college-level musicians exceed the daily recommended noise dose level during instrumental practices and performances, although less than one third report wearing hearing protection while playing their instruments. Although the hazardous effects of music on the auditory system have been established, even in young adult musicians still early in their musical careers, the effects of music on the vestibular system are still unclear. The purpose of the present study was to examine vestibular/balance differences between young adult musicians and nonmusicians to determine the effects of music exposure on the vestibular system. Method: Young adult participants aged 18–27 years without any history of hearing loss, vestibular/balance disorder, otologic disorder, or nervous system disorder were included in this study. Participants were divided into musician ( n = 19) and nonmusician ( n = 18) groups. Vestibular function was assessed and compared via the cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP), ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential (oVEMP), video head impulse test (vHIT), and modified clinical test of sensory interaction in balance (mCTSIB). Results: Musicians were found to produce significantly more saccades in the left horizontal semicircular canal during vHIT assessment compared to nonmusicians. Group differences were not found in the cVEMP, oVEMP, or mCTSIB. Conclusions: This study shows the effects of music exposure on the vestibular system in young adult musicians who show early-onset, subclinical findings on the vHIT that could develop into abnormal results on vestibular assessments if hearing protection use is not increased.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Experiencing difficulty with activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental ADLs (IADLs) and/or the consequences of unmet ADL/IADL-related needs is associated with adverse health-related outcomes. The association of hearing loss (HL) with experiencing the consequences of unmet ADL/IADL-related needs is not well understood. We investigated the associations of HL with experiencing ADL/IADL difficulties and the consequences of unmet ADL/IADL-related needs in older adults. Method: We investigated cross-sectional associations between audiometric HL, the number of ADL and IADL difficulties, and the number of consequences of unmet ADL/IADL-related needs among adults aged 65 years and older in the National Health and Aging Trends Study. Results: In 4,724 older adults, 30.5% ( n = 1,736) and 30.9% ( n = 1,727) had self-reported difficulty with ADLs and IADLs, respectively. Of the 2,289 participants who reported difficulty with at least one ADL/IADL, 14.0% ( n = 741) reported experience of at least one consequence of an unmet ADL/IADL-related need. In multivariable ordinal regression analyses, mild ( OR = 1.38, 95% CI [1.1, 1.73]) and moderate or greater ( OR = 1.57, 95% CI [1.17, 2.1]) HL were associated with higher odds of difficulties with additional ADLs. Moderate or greater HL was associated with higher odds of reporting difficulties with additional IADLs ( OR = 1.59, 95% CI [1.19, 2.12]). There was no significant association between HL and higher odds of having additional consequences of unmet needs. Conclusions: Our results show an association between HL and a higher number of ADL and IADL difficulties. Adults with HL may require increased support to address difficulties with daily activities and prevent experiencing related consequences.

    "abstract": "Purpose: This mixed-methods design (a) quantitatively describes the symptom cluster assignments of patients with chronic dizziness who completed a dizziness triage questionnaire and (b) qualitatively explains patient-reported themes associated with the most frequently assigned symptom cluster. Method: A retrospective hybrid explanatory mixed-methods design was implemented to examine an artificial intelligence dizziness triage questionnaire posted online in a vestibular disorders support group from June 2021 to November 2022. Symptom cluster assignments are described in 791 participants. In the qualitative analysis, emerging codes were identified in the dominant symptom cluster in 50 participants. Results: Quantitative analysis identified a total of 301 symptom cluster combinations. The analysis from 791 participants revealed that females exhibited more symptom clusters than males, age impacted symptoms inversely, and longer duration of symptom history exhibited more symptom clusters. “Positional” was the most common symptom cluster among 50 participants. Of those 50, six major themes emerged from the data: (a) physical symptoms, (b) cognitive symptoms, (c) triggers, (d) temporal information, (e) management, and (f) emotions. Conclusions: The results from this study emphasize the complexity and variability of chronic dizziness. Comprehensive patient assessments that combine questionnaires with clinical expertise and patient dialogue are needed to improve diagnosis and management.",

    "abstract": "Objective: This report documents the effects of hearing treatment in an adult with a history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and normal peripheral hearing acuity. Design: This report details a case study of a 26-year-old female with a history of mTBI. Study Sample: A 26-year-old female with a history of mTBI presented with auditory symptoms including tinnitus, hyperacusis, listening fatigue, and speech-in-noise (SIN) difficulties despite diagnostic audiological findings showing normal peripheral auditory function and suprathreshold SIN performance within the normal range. The patient was fit with premium-level receiver-in-the-canal (RIC) hearing aids (HAs) using several different mild-gain fitting approaches involving wide dynamic range compression (WDRC) or linearized gain. A combination of objective and subjective methods was utilized to guide clinical decision making on the fitting approach and to verify/validate treatment outcomes. Results: Despite no difference in acutely aided SIN performance between the WDRC or linearized fitting approaches, the patient expressed a clear preference for the HA fitting approach involving application of 2–10 dB of shaped linearized gain &gt; 1.5 kHz for soft, medium, and loud input levels (with greatest gain applied at 3–4 kHz). These settings were preferred in terms of loudness and sound quality even compared to the WDRC fitting approaches previously reported in literature. This fitting approach was verified and validated by SIN testing showing improved performance in the aided condition, as well as high levels of self-reported benefit and satisfaction, reduction in self-reported hearing handicap, reduction in sound sensitivity, and enhanced quality of life with HAs. Conclusions: Results add to the growing body of evidence supporting the benefits of mild-gain HAs for adults with mTBI and self-reported SIN deficits despite normal hearing acuity. Results also support the importance of using a combination of measures (e.g., SIN testing, patient report, outcome questionnaires) to guide the HA fitting process and to verify/validate treatment outcomes. Although findings were derived from a single case study and should be interpreted with caution, the patient's preference for a shaped linearized mild-gain approach is noteworthy. There exists a lack of clinical guidelines and prescriptive fitting methodology for fitting HAs in mTBI adults with SIN difficulty despite normal peripheral hearing acuity. Future research should systematically compare WDRC versus linearized gain approaches of fitting in this population to develop a clinical methodology for HA fitting and optimize outcomes in this special subpopulation.",

Neurosyphilis is a subtype of syphilis that may occur at any stage of syphilis presentation. However, there is a substantial lack of literature on the presentation of hearing loss in this disease. The purpose of this case report is to discuss the presentation and outcomes related to a case of neurosyphilis. Method: This case report describes sudden aural fullness, tinnitus, and perceived hearing loss in a 30-year-old patient who was diagnosed with late-stage neurosyphilis. An initial audiometric evaluation identified a bilateral mild to moderately severe hearing loss that was found to be secondary to neurosyphilis. Following treatment of 2.4 million units of benzathine penicillin administered in three weekly shots, his hearing improved to normal levels. Results: This case details the audiometric assessment and subsequent follow-up of this patient's care. Behavioral hearing thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emissions recovered substantially following treatment. Conclusions: Hearing assessment may be a beneficial tool when considering patients with neurosyphilis. Additionally, continuous audiologic monitoring in this population would prove beneficial when considering treatment.",

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Hearing loss is relatively common in older individuals, and individuals with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are no exception; this can exacerbate communication difficulties stemming from speech-language impairments. The co-occurrence of these symptoms can contribute to increased frustration and isolation for patients and their communication partners. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of self-administered hearing testing. Ultimately, this could be administered remotely, which would increase access to assessment and inform management for this population. Method: Seventeen patients with underlying FTLD, clinically presenting with progressive apraxia of speech with and without agrammatic aphasia, independently completed the Home Hearing Test supervised while in office. Results: Three patients self-reported hearing loss, but results for 100% recommended formal evaluation. Eleven patients demonstrated good test accuracy. Six patients had “poor” or not computable accuracy; among them, five had evidence of cognitive impairment and/or behavioral changes, and one had known severe hearing loss, although differences between those with good and poor test accuracy were not significant. Patients with poor test accuracy had more difficulty with limb praxis. Conclusions: Most participants independently completed the test, though some had reduced test accuracy that may have been associated with cognitive impairment and/or limb apraxia. This study supports the need for hearing screenings in all patients with progressive apraxia of speech and aphasia and highlights both the feasibility and caution required in implementing self-administered testing protocols. Further work should evaluate the feasibility of in-home hearing screenings in a broader range of FTLD phenotypes and directly compare sensitivity and specificity of hearing loss detection with in-clinic administration.

    "abstract": "Purpose: The aim was to compare cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP) findings between pilots who are susceptible to airsickness and those who are not and to determine whether the physiopathology arising from the sacculo-collic reflex pathway occurs during episodes of airsickness in pilots. Method: The patient group included 32 male pilots susceptible to airsickness, and the control group included 30 male pilots with no airsickness susceptibility. Participants with hearing loss and neuromuscular pathology were excluded. The Graybiel scale and cVEMP test were administered to the participants. The cVEMP thresholds, wave latencies and amplitudes, and interaural amplitude asymmetry ratios (IAARs) were compared between the groups. In addition, correlation analysis was performed between IAAR and susceptibility to airsickness severity in the airsickness susceptible (AS) group. Results: The right-ear cVEMP threshold in the AS group (85.62 ± 6.05) was lower than that of the control group (91.16 ± 4.85; p &lt; .001). In the right ears of the AS group, the P1 and N1 latencies at 100, 95, and 90 dB nHL levels were found to be shorter than those of the control group ( p &lt; .05 for all). Again, the P1N1 wave amplitudes at 100 dB nHL in the right ears of the AS group were higher than those of the control group ( p = .009). The IAAR was higher in the AS group than in the control group ( p &lt; .001). There was a positive correlation between IAAR and airsickness susceptibility severity in the AS group (ρ = .742, .650, .535 at 100, 95, 90 dB nHL, respectively). Conclusions: The susceptibility of pilots to airsickness may be related to changes in normative cVEMP latencies and amplitudes. The present study demonstrated a correlation between asymmetry in the integrity of the saccular reflex pathway and the severity of pilots' susceptibility to airsickness. A higher IAAR was observed in subjects with a greater susceptibility to airsickness, indicating a potential correlation between the two variables.

Method: Sixteen CI users (15 bilateral) were evaluated in quiet and in noise (5 dB SNR) under three CI conditions: CI only, streaming with CI microphones attenuated by 6 dB, and streaming with CI microphones muted. The audiovisual Connected Speech Test served as the signal, and the ipsilateral competing message from the SSI-ICM served as the noise. Measures of speech understanding, satisfaction with sound quality and clarity, and preference were obtained. Results: In quiet, speech understanding and speech clarity ratings were significantly better for the streaming with CI microphones muted condition than the CI only and streaming with CI microphones attenuated conditions; however, sound quality ratings were significantly better for streaming with CI microphones muted than the CI microphones attenuated condition. In noise, speech understanding, speech clarity ratings, and sound quality ratings were significantly different across all conditions with CI only being the poorest, followed by streaming with CI microphones attenuated then by CI microphones muted being the best. In quiet, streaming with CI microphones muted was preferred over CI only. In noise, both streaming options were preferred to CI only. Overall, streaming with CI microphones attenuated was preferred to CI only. Conclusions: CI users benefited from TV streaming in both quiet and in noise. CI users should be counseled on the benefits of adjusting CI microphone settings when using a TV streamer.",

Method: A questionnaire was designed where HCPs were asked to rate their patients' perception of natural sounds before and after receiving an HA. The online survey was conducted with 301 HCPs in France. Results: According to respondents, the incidence of hearing natural sounds increased substantially at the end of the trial period relative to the start, especially for patients living in remote rural areas. Respondents also indicated an increase in listening accuracy, pleasantness, and importance of natural sounds at the end of the trial period. The majority of respondents indicated (a) that their patients find it important to listen to natural sounds and (b) that they are satisfied with their HAs in that respect. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the importance of natural sounds for most people with hearing loss. It highlights the effects of HA on patients' awareness of natural sounds and suggests that future research should consider the patients' place of residence.",

Method: Archival data from 226 clinical electronic medical records at one university clinic were analyzed for this retrospective exploratory study. Audiometric test findings and results from the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire–Adult Hearing Loss (AAQ-AHL) were extracted for adult patients seen between June 1, 2022, and February 29, 2024. Results: The majority had a bilateral hearing loss (64%), 10% had a unilateral hearing loss, and 26% had bilateral pure-tone averages better than 25 dB HL. The AAQ-AHL total scores ranged from 0 to 51, and 8% had a high likelihood of distress from internal struggles related to their difficulty hearing. On individual items, up to one third of the sample expressed internal challenges. The AAQ-AHL total scores were moderately correlated with word recognition in noise, weakly correlated with better ear pure-tone average and word recognition in quiet, and were not correlated with age. Conclusions: The current study adds to the previous research describing psychosocial challenges that can be experienced by people with hearing difficulties. Our research demonstrates that psychological inflexibility for hearing loss can be experienced by individuals of all ages and hearing status. Based on the present findings, we recommend that audiologists intentionally assess for psychosocial challenges for people seeking hearing help.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess whether using the International Speech Test Signal (ISTS) as a nonmeaningful target signal changes listener outcomes on the Tracking of Noise Tolerance (TNT) test and their relationship to hearing loss and neuroelectrophysiological indices of central inhibition. Single-blind mixed design conducted in 23 normal-hearing (NH) and 16 hearing-impaired (HI) older adults with moderate-to-severe degrees of sensorineural hearing loss. Participants performed a modified version of the TNT test where they were asked to react to a dynamic background noise while listening to the ISTS target stimulus. Test performance was characterized by average TNT test noise acceptance (TNTAve) and by the average difference between peaks and valleys in tracked noise level tracings (excursion). All listeners had previously performed the TNT test using English speech passages as target signals. Cortical sensory gating magnitudes were also measured from these listeners as electrophysiological indices of central inhibition. Whereas NH listeners tolerated significantly less noise when performing the TNT test with ISTS relative to English speech targets, type of target signal had no effect on TNTAve scores in HI listeners. Conversely, HI listeners exhibited significantly greater excursion in their tracked noise levels when tested with the ISTS compared to English passages, but target type did not affect excursion in NH listeners. Regardless of target type or hearing group, TNT excursion was strongly predicted by listeners' bilateral four-frequency pure-tone averages. As previously observed for the English TNT, sensory gating magnitudes of the N1-P2 component negatively predicted TNT excursion scores measured using the ISTS target after accounting for listener age and hearing thresholds. In addition, noise acceptance (TNTAve) outcomes for ISTS targets were positively predicted by cortical gating magnitudes of the P1 component. Replacing meaningful English speech with ISTS targets affected listener performance on the TNT test differently in NH and HI listeners. Comparing TNT outcomes for nonmeaningful and meaningful speech signals may be useful for gaining insight into the acoustic and nonacoustic (e.g., central/contextual) factors that affect listeners' dynamic reactivity to changing levels of background noise.",

Therefore, the purpose of the study was to investigate the relation between auditory working memory and self-reported hearing difficulties in older adults with varying degrees of pure-tone hearing loss. Method: Twenty-four older adults with varying degrees of sensorineural hearing loss participated. Self-reported hearing difficulties were assessed using the Adult Auditory Performance Scale (AAPS). Auditory working memory was measured using the Word Auditory Recognition and Recall Measure (WARRM). Results: Results revealed significant negative correlations between the WARRM recall score and the AAPS global, easy listening, noise, and complex listening scores. Pure-tone hearing was significantly correlated with self-reported hearing difficulty in easy listening environments (e.g., quiet and ideal listening) but was not for noise or complex listening. Regression analyses revealed that pure-tone hearing accounted for a significant amount of variability associated with the AAPS easy listening, whereas WARRM recall scores accounted for a significant amount of variability associated with AAPS noise and complex listening scores. Conclusions: Findings suggest that cognitive factors, such as auditory working memory, contribute to the self-perception of hearing difficulty among older adults. Routine clinical measurement of self-reported hearing difficulties and auditory working memory may provide a more global assessment of the hearing challenges faced by older adults with pure-tone hearing loss.",

Method: Thirty-five USH patients were included, categorized into three genetic-based groups: USH1 ( n = 11), USH2 ( n = 22), and USH4 ( n = 2). The functional and emotional impact of dizziness and equilibrium was assessed using the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale. Participants underwent pure-tone threshold testing, bithermal caloric testing, rotary chair testing (RCT), video head impulse test (vHIT), ocular (oVEMP) and cervical (cVEMP) vestibular evoked myogenic potentials, and posturography. Genotype–phenotype associations were analyzed. Results: Total DHI could only distinguish USH1 (25.71 ± 21.04) from USH2 (50.13 ± 22.54, p = .024) but not between the three groups ( p = .084). ABC and HADS could not also distinguish between the three USH subgroups ( p = .286 and .180). Hearing loss in USH1 was significantly greater than in USH2 and USH4 ( p &lt; .001).

Fifty-two healthy children, aged 6 months to 5 years, and 23 healthy adults, aged 22 to 39 years, participated. To assess the effect of light illuminance on the corneoretinal potential, adults completed SHA at 0.16 Hz immediately, 5 and 10 min after the rotary chair door was closed, and then again after 10 s of light illumination. To assess the effect of position and calibration strategy, adults completed SHA using default and standard calibration in a standard seat and in a forward seat position. In children, SHA was completed at 0.01, 0.04., and 0.16 Hz in a car seat or booster seat and in a parent's lap, if tolerated. Gain decreased with darkness adaptation and significantly increased in response to using a light wand. In the adults, gain was higher regardless of test position using default calibration and significantly lower in forward seat position using standard calibration; however, in the pediatric group, there were no significant differences in outcomes relative to age or position. Overall, children had significantly higher gain, phase, and symmetry when compared to the adults. SHA testing is feasible using a combination of conditions without significantly affecting interpretation. Pediatric SHA test outcomes were higher compared to those of adults, supporting the need for pediatric normative data.",

Innovation in the early 2000s resulted in a cutting-edge customized telemedicine solution that created a network of specialty care access across the Tribal Health System in Alaska and was one of the largest telemedicine programs in the world. A shift in focus away from telemedicine to electronic health records stalled innovation, and reduced investment in funding, equipment, and research. This created a lack of clarity around system integration and functionality that eroded the utilization and effectiveness of telemedicine solutions. Today, there is much we can learn from renewed research efforts in innovative applications of telemedicine that can be used to inform policymakers and drive adoption. Conclusions: If hearing health care professionals are to address the public health crisis of a lack of access to care for the majority of the one in five individuals with hearing loss today, technology solutions such as telemedicine will need to be leveraged. This will require provider training and education; implementation of integrated telemedicine services; continued generation of evidence; and advocacy for regulatory, reimbursement, and payment reform.",

    "abstract": "Cochlear implants (CIs) are an effective strategy for managing patients with hearing loss who derive limited benefit from other treatment options. Although the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has made a strong effort to expand access to CI technology and onboard new CI sites across the country, access to consistent CI services can still be challenging. This is especially true for Veterans who reside in more rural and remote areas. The purpose of this tutorial is to describe various models of care and provide solutions that are replicable throughout the VHA for meeting the needs of our most severely hard of hearing Veterans. Routine availability of CI programming using telehealth options, such as clinical video telehealth (CVT) or VA video connect (VVC), significantly improve access to CI care. Other benefits of remote programming may include decreased wait times, less travel time and cost, and improved adherence to treatment plans. Additionally, aural rehabilitation for CI recipients can be performed remotely to improve outcomes. This innovative model for delivering audiology services will be described. Remote care teleaudiology CI services available for Veterans in the VHA have the potential to improve outcomes in a cost-effective manner that is patient-centered and replicable across the enterprise. Implementing these strategies addresses the critical need to standardize telehealth practices for CI programming and rehabilitative interventions across the VHA. This program can give all Veterans access to CI care in an efficient manner, with reduced costs, result in fewer travel barriers, and allow for a more positive outcome for the VHA, its patients, and their families.",

    "abstract": "The Connected Speech Test (CST) assesses an individual's ability to understand everyday contextualized running speech amidst competing background babble. To minimize accent effects on speech perception scores and reduce the noise floor of the original recordings, an updated version was developed by Saleh et al. (2020). The updated recordings feature a speaker with a General American accent to replace the Southern U.S. accent in the original test, and modern recording equipment was used to achieve a lower noise floor. The aim of this study was to collect normative data, characterizing performance on the updated CST. Self-reported speech intelligibility and listening effort ratings were collected to examine how subjective perceptions of the task vary across test conditions. To evaluate normative performance on this updated test, 40 native English-speaking adults (36 females and four males) with normal hearing were recruited from The University of Western Ontario. Multitalker babble was presented at a fixed level, and speech was presented at fixed signal-to-babble ratios (SBRs) to participants in both co-located and separated loudspeaker conditions. At each SBR, participants were scored based on key words correctly identified. Subjective speech intelligibility and listening effort were evaluated using self-report scales. For each measure, data were fitted with transfer functions to characterize performance on the task. Participants demonstrated significantly better performance in the separated loudspeaker condition, indicating a spatial release from masking. For both conditions, increased SBR was associated with increased performance and subjective speech intelligibility, and decreased listening effort. The study provides normative data to characterize expected performance for the updated version of the CST.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to explore the presence of contralateral suppression of otoacoustic emissions (CS-OAEs) in unilateral cochlear implant (CI) users with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD). We enrolled three unilateral CI users with bilateral ANSD and stable otoacoustic emissions in the nonimplanted ear, exhibiting diverse postsynaptic ANSD backgrounds including cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, sensorineural hearing loss syndrome, Optic Atrophy Plus Syndrome, and Spinocerebellar Ataxia. Measurements of transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) were conducted both with and without contralateral electrical stimulation (CES) across five frequency bands. CES was delivered via a CI using a direct audio input cable connected to a computer. In order to elicit a response, broad-band noise is applied and presented at a comfortable level. Minor amplitude reductions (between 0.2 and 0.6 dB SPL) were observed in TEOAEs with CES across different frequencies for each subject. Despite these changes, there was no prominent suppression effect observed, which emphasizes the differences in CS-OAE responses among individuals with postsynaptic ANSD. The absence of significant CS-OAE suppression suggests that direct electrical stimulation through CES may not consistently engage the efferent auditory system in patients with postsynaptic ANSD characteristics. It is essential to broaden the study population to encompass a more diverse range of ANSD presentations in order to confirm the effectiveness of CES in stimulating efferent pathways.",

As a conservative first step, patients are often referred to VR for evaluation and management and from there patients may be referred for VTB when patients are not meeting therapy goals or VR evaluation is unclear of the diagnosis. This research aimed to investigate the referral patterns from VR to VTB and VTB to VR. Method: Retrospective chart review was completed at a large Midwestern tertiary hospital. This study included 149 patients aged 18 years and older with history of dizziness, vertigo, or imbalance concerns who received VR and VTB. Patients were divided into two groups: (a) VR-first group and (b) VTB-first group. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify the total number of VR sessions for total cohort and common vestibular diagnoses and determine differences in sessions between VR-first and VTB-first groups. Results: Statistically significant differences in number of VR sessions were observed between the VR-first and VTB-first groups, with less sessions overall in the VTB- first group ( p &lt; .05), except for the BPPV group ( p = .12).

    "abstract": "Sentences are encoded with sematic context, which facilitates audiologic ability to navigate background noise, or speech-in-noise (SIN), conditions. To examine how semantic context contributes to performance on one commonly used SIN test, the Quick Speech-in-Noise Test (QuickSIN) by Etymotic Research, Inc. (henceforth \"QuickSIN\"), we use a novel experimental paradigm that isolates semantic information. Ten college-aged monolingual participants with typical hearing listened to 72 sentences delivered in 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, or 25 dB SNR followed by a choice between two visual words. One word was related to the overall sentence meaning, and the other word was unrelated. The reaction time (RT) to correctly select related targets was measured to index usage of semantic information. Participant's RTs to select a correct response were compared across different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We found that less favorable noise conditions (0, +5 dB SNR) elicited a greater usage of semantic information than more favorable noise conditions (20, 25 dB SNR). Transformed RT data were analyzed with nonparametric tests that assessed the homogeneity of variance within responses to each SNR condition. Results indicated that participants' RTs were consistently varied within each SNR condition, except to sentences in +20 dB SNR, indicating an imbalance in the degree of semantic context used in the sentences in that SNR level. Respondents to the QuickSIN use semantic context to facilitate processing especially at less favorable SNR levels, which is consistent with research supporting a greater role of semantic information during suboptimal listening conditions. Differences in context use across noise conditions means test performance also reflects language processing and should be considered for updated tests of speech-in-noise performance. Critically, responses to sentences at the +20 dB SNR used in the QuickSIN are so inconsistently varied in their degree of semantic usage as to prohibit a clinical interpretation alongside the other conditions. These findings warrant the development of a quick-to-administer SIN test with stimuli that are balanced for semantic expectancy to avoid language effects.",

    "abstract": "The masseter acoustic/vestibular evoked myogenic potential (mVEMP) is a recently developed electrophysiological tool used to assess otolithic function. The mVEMP assesses brainstem integrity and is sensitive in detecting brainstem lesions. The masseter muscles are supplied by the mandibular branch of the fifth cranial nerve and help stabilize the jaw in response to high-intensity sound. The temporalis and masseter muscles function together to stabilize the mandible. Both muscles are supplied by the trigeminal nerve. Hence, the study hypothesized that mVEMP could also be recorded from the temporalis muscle. Twenty healthy adults (13 males and seven females; age range: 18-28 years) were recruited for the study. mVEMPs were recorded using a 500-Hz tone burst with 125 dB peSPL for all individuals. Vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) were then recorded in the temporalis muscle of the same individuals. VEMPs from the masseter and temporalis muscles were recorded ipsilaterally, contralaterally, and bilaterally, respectively. A within-subject design was adopted, and purposive sampling was used to assign the subjects. Both VEMPs from the masseter and temporalis muscles elicited a 100% response rate. A paired t test revealed no significant difference (p > .05) in the p11 and n21 latencies for unilateral and bilateral stimulation between masseter and temporalis VEMPs. In addition, a paired t test revealed a significant difference (p < .05) in the p11-n21 rectified amplitude between the masseter and temporalis VEMPs. The rectified amplitude for the temporalis muscle was reduced than masseter muscle. The study found that VEMPs recorded from the temporalis muscle are similar to mVEMPs. This preliminary finding supports that the temporalis serves as an alternate muscle to record mVEMP.",

A survey was dispersed to examine clinicians' understanding and adoption of the new protocol and gain clinical insights on its implementation. Method: A link to a 32-question survey was distributed to audiologists via e-mail and social media platforms, collecting responses from 307 participants practicing in various settings. The survey assessed respondents' understanding of MSTB-3 materials, participation in training sessions, and integration of MSTB-3 recommendations into clinical care. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze data and identify trends. Results: Results indicated that 89% of audiologists were familiar with the MSTB-3, with 60% having participated in one or more training sessions. Of the respondents, 85% reported incorporating parts or all of the MSTB-3 recommendations into their practices and 75% believed it improved standardization of CI evaluations. Clinicians reported using Consonant–Nucleus–Consonant (CNC) word scores for CI candidacy decisions, consistent with MSTB-3 recommendations, but varied in the score criteria used to determine candidacy. Results show a trend toward more streamlined and efficient patient care delivery recommendations. Conclusions: The MSTB-3 has facilitated greater consistency in CI evaluation and follow-up care, addressing historical variability in clinical practices. Its evidence-based approach, including streamlined test protocols and user-friendly tools, offers a framework for improved CI access and standardization. Further training and dissemination efforts are recommended to enhance clinicians' understanding and to address implementation challenges, ultimately advancing the quality of CI services and reducing disparities in care.",

Participants completed an OTC HA skills assessment, scored on a 4-point Likert scale (3 = independent with no difficulty, 0 = unable to complete). Steps included downloading the application (app), inserting the HAs, and cleaning them with a brush. Scores were averaged to calculate an overall mean; higher scores indicated better OTC HA skills. Each independent variable was analyzed in separate linear regression models, and geometric mean ratios (GMRs) were calculated for significant factors. OTC HA skills were also examined dichotomously, with unsuccessful performance defined as any unresolved error. Eighty-two adults participated in the study, 66% (n = 54) of whom were new HA users. After adjusting for covariates, education remained a strong predictor of OTC HA skills: Individuals with less than a college degree demonstrated 45% lower performance compared to those with a master's degree or higher (GMR = 0.55, 95% confidence interval [0.34, 0.89]). Overall, 68% (n = 56) of participants were unsuccessful in completing the OTC HA assessment. The most challenging tasks across all participants were manually adjusting the volume, pairing the HAs with a smartphone, and replacing the wax guard. New HA users performed significantly worse than experienced users on the task of putting the HAs on, t(52) = -2.58, p = .013, with a moderate effect size (Cohen's d = -0.44). Education emerged as a strong predictor of OTC HA skills, underscoring the need to address disparities in device usability. These findings highlight the importance of developing tailored devices and educational materials to support users with lower educational attainment. Such efforts may help promote more equitable access and prevent the exacerbation of existing hearing health disparities in the era of OTC HAs. https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.29847827.",

Method: A cross-sectional observational study among community-dwelling adults aged 60 years and older receiving care at an academic health care system outpatient audiology or otolaryngology clinics was conducted. Eligible participants completed and returned a mail-in self-reported packet including the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (Screener Version; HHIE-S) and the 10-item Vanderbilt Fatigue Scale for Adults (VFS-A-10). Face masks were institutionally required during the COVID-19 pandemic, with options including (a) standard surgical face mask, (b) clear face mask, or (c) standard surgical face mask with face shield. General linear models assessed differences in VFS-A-10 by HHIE-S score. Results: Among the 104 participants, the HHIE-S mean was 15.3 ( SD = 10.4); 34.3% experienced no hearing handicap, 45.5% experienced mild to moderate handicap, and 20.2% experienced severe handicap. Higher hearing handicap scores correlated with increased listening-related fatigue (β = 0.66, SE = 0.06, p ≤ .0001). Clear masks were linked to less listening-related fatigue, especially for individuals with higher degrees of hearing handicap, compared to standard surgical masks (β = −0.30, SE = 0.10, p ≤ .01). Conclusions: Findings from this exploratory study underscore the need for tailored communication strategies and accommodations to enhance the health care experience for individuals with hearing handicap.

Method: A retrospective study of all adult patients with a single diagnosis of VNL who visited a multiprovider tertiary ENT clinic ( n = 168) was conducted. Demographic information, treatment recommendations, and baseline vestibular rehabilitation performance information were extracted from ENT clinical notes and initial VRT notes. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were performed to evaluate sociodemographic differences, and p ≤ .003 was considered statistically significant. Results: VRT was the most popular treatment recommendation made by ENT providers, and VRT referral rates did not vary according to sociodemographic factors. 68.8% of referred patients initiated VRT. The number of patients with abnormal baseline VRT assessments did not differ by sex or race. More public insurance holders had abnormal Dynamic Gait Index assessment scores ( p = .001) and gait speeds than did private insurance holders ( p &lt; .001). Conclusions: VRT was the most frequent clinical management strategy recommended to VNL patients by ENT providers, and referral rates did not vary by sex, race, or insurance status. Most VRT patients had vestibular dysfunction on baseline assessments, suggesting appropriate referral of VRT by ENT. VNL patients' baseline vestibular function did not vary by sex or race but did vary by insurance status.

    "abstract": "During the verification phase of a hearing aid fitting, clinicians often want to assess the extent to which loudness perceptions for amplified sounds are similar to those typical of normal hearers. This type of verification calls for a criterion for \"normal\" loudness perception of sounds presented in a sound field. This research sought to answer several questions about the parameters of a valid \"normal\" criterion for a verification procedure using the Contour test of loudness perception. Loudness data were obtained from 30 listeners with normal hearing. Results indicated that a loudness growth function obtained with earphone listening is not an appropriate normative reference for hearing aid fitting verification. Instead, the normative data should be based on sound field listening. Results also indicated that the same normative function could be used to assess both unilateral and bilateral fittings. Further, it is likely that the same normative function can be used for most frequency responses that are likely to be used in feasible fittings. Finally, it was found that a previously published normative function obtained using an automated test procedure was not faithfully replicated using a carefully executed fully manual test procedure. We concluded that, until a replicable normative function is established, practitioners will need to generate their own local norms to perform postfitting verification of loudness normalization.",

Method: A total of 973 infants who failed OAE but passed A-ABR, in one or both ears, during newborn screening were tested with a VRA protocol, supplemented by tympanometry and OAE screening at age 8–12 months. Results: VRA audiograms (1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 kHz) were obtained for 1,184 (82.7%) of the 1,432 study ears. Hearing loss was ruled out in another 100 ears by VRA in combination with OAE, for a total of 88.7% of the study sample. Permanent hearing loss was identified in 30 ears of 21 infants. Sites differed in their success with the VRA protocol. Conclusions: Continued monitoring of hearing beyond the newborn period is an important component of early detection of hearing loss. Using a structured protocol, VRA is an appropriate test method for most, but not all, infants. A battery of test procedures is often needed to adequately delineate hearing loss in infants. Examiner experience appears to be a factor in successful VRA.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The primary purpose of this investigation was to determine the relative frequency representation of binaural function in the brainstem and cortex of adults. The secondary purpose was to compare adult responses to previously reported infant responses. Methods Simultaneous auditory brainstem responses and auditory middle responses were recorded monaurally and binaurally in 20 young women. The binaural (BIN) response was subtracted from the summed monaural waves (L+R) to obtain the binaural interaction components (BIC) from waves V (peak A) and Pa (BIC-Pa). Amplitude ratios were calculated as BIC/L+R. Repeated-measures analyses of variance evaluated responses to frequency (500 Hz vs. 4000 Hz), wave condition (L+R vs. BIN), and wave class (auditory brainstem response vs. auditory middle response). Results Waveforms were present for all conditions. The L+R responses were larger than the BIN responses, 500 Hz produced larger amplitudes than 4000 Hz, and Pa was larger than wave V. The largest response, overall, was the Pa(L+R) response to 500 Hz. For amplitude ratios, BIC-Pa/Pa(L+R) was larger than Peak A/[V(L+R)]. Conclusion More neural resources are devoted to binaural function in the cortex than in the brainstem, and more resources are devoted to lower frequencies than to higher frequencies. The adult data confirm that previously recorded infant data reveal binaural immaturity. Longitudinal data should characterize developmental characteristics of binaural function.",

In this article, the authors refer to WG as “WG/GPA” to indicate the old and new names of this condition. WG/GPA is a systemic necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis that can affect, in particular, the lungs, sinuses, and kidneys. The authors report 2 cases with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (c-ANCA) positive WG/GPA whose initial presentations were in the form of both conductive and sensorineural hearing loss without systemic features. The authors contrast the reversal of hearing loss and prevention of disease progression with early recognition and treatment. Method The authors present 2 contrasting cases of WG/GPA. Changes in hearing were measured through use of a GSI 61 audiometer as well as guidelines from the British Society of Audiology. Serum ANCA were detected by indirect immunofluorescence and formalin fixed neutrophils. Proteinase 3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase antibodies were measured through use of a fluoroenzyme immunoassay. Results Persistent deafness and systemic disease are more likely, and more aggressive therapy was required when the diagnosis of WG/GPA was delayed. Conclusion WG/GPA should be considered in acute or subacute deafness presenting over days to weeks and even in the absence of systemic symptoms. A negative or weak ANCA with absent antibodies to serine PR3 and myeloperoxidase should not exclude the possible diagnosis of WG/GPA, and a high index of suspicion should be maintained.",

Method An online survey was sent to audiologists at CI centers across the United States. Questions addressed demographics, candidacy, programming, outcomes assessment, rehabilitation, and professional development. Results Responses were obtained from 47 audiologists who provided CI services to older adults. The majority of these audiologists did not report modifying CI practice patterns on the basis of age. Counseling appeared to be an exception: Audiologists reported that both the content and delivery of information were modified for older adults. Specific to CI candidacy with older adults, under half of the respondents indicated that assessing an older adult’s cognitive status was part of their clinical protocol. Conclusion The audiologists who responded to the survey acknowledged issues related to aging when providing CI services to older adults. Despite this acknowledgment, the results of the survey suggest a gap in how age-related issues are incorporated into CI service provision.

It is unclear, however, whether some older listeners with hearing loss benefit from strengthened dynamic pitch cues for recognizing speech in certain noise scenarios and how this relative benefit may be associated with individual factors. We first examined older individuals' relative benefit between natural and strong dynamic pitches for better speech recognition in noise. Further, we reported the individual factors of the 2 groups of listeners who benefit differently from natural and strong dynamic pitches.Speech reception thresholds of 13 older listeners with mild-moderate hearing loss were measured using target speech with 3 levels of dynamic pitch strength. Individuals' ability to benefit from dynamic pitch was defined as the speech reception threshold difference between speeches with and without dynamic pitch cues.The relative benefit of natural versus strong dynamic pitch varied across individuals. However, this relative benefit remained consistent for the same individuals across those background noises with temporal modulation. Those listeners who benefited more from strong dynamic pitch reported better subjective speech perception abilities.Strong dynamic pitch may be more beneficial than natural dynamic pitch for some older listeners to recognize speech better in noise, particularly when the noise has temporal modulation.",

To date, audiology students reportedly felt ill-prepared when counseling patients about their hearing impairment, yet there is a paucity of studies exploring how clinical communication is taught and learned in audiology programs. Thus, the aims of the study were (a) to explore final year audiology students' perspectives of their own clinical communication skills during an in-house university clinical placement and (b) to explore students' perceptions of their clinical communication education.Using a qualitative description approach, students were asked to coview their filmed clinical encounter using video reflexivity during a semistructured interview on clinical communication education. Fifteen final year graduate audiology students from The University of Melbourne, Australia, participated in the study. The interviews were audio-recorded and analyzed thematically.The overarching themes of striving to be patient-centered, assessment shapes behavior, and power relations emerged from students' reflection of their own clinical encounter. In addition, the theme what students want described the perceived teaching methods that assisted students' clinical communication practices.The findings of this study highlight the challenges that students perceived during their clinical placement as they strive to enact a patient-centered interaction. An assessment rubric that incorporates communication skills can provide greater opportunities for feedback and self-reflection. Additionally, clinical communication education that adopts experiential learning and is longitudinally integrated into the curriculum can further reinforce students' communication learning needs.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The aim of this study was to test the viability of a novel method for automated characterization of mobile health apps. Method In this exploratory study, we developed the basic modules of an automated method, based on text analytics, able to characterize the apps' medical specialties by extracting information from the web. We analyzed apps in the Medical and Health &amp; Fitness categories on the U.S. iTunes store. Results We automatically crawled 42,007 Medical and 79,557 Health &amp; Fitness apps' webpages. After removing duplicates and non-English apps, the database included 80,490 apps. We tested the accuracy of the automated method on a subset of 400 apps. We observed 91% accuracy for the identification of apps related to health or medicine, 95% accuracy for sensory systems apps, and an average of 82% accuracy for classification into medical specialties. Conclusions These preliminary results suggested the viability of automated characterization of apps based on text analytics and highlighted directions for improvement in terms of classification rules and vocabularies, analysis of semantic types, and extraction of key features (promoters, services, and users). The availability of automated tools for app characterization is important as it may support health care professionals in informed, aware selection of health apps to recommend to their patients.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss is a clinical emergency with an increased incidence of occurrence in recent years. Hyperbaric oxygen has been widely used in the clinical treatment of sudden hearing loss. However, prognostic factors related to its curative effects are still not clear, which hinders its clinical application. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and prognostic factors of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) plus drug therapies in the treatment of sudden hearing loss. Method Patients with sudden hearing loss who were treated with hyperbaric oxygen from April to October 2017 were retrospectively included. Clinical information was collected, including pure-tone audiometry data before and after hyperbaric oxygen treatment, age, gender, hearing curve classification, concomitant symptoms, history of diseases (diabetes and hypertension), history of hormone therapy, start time of hyperbaric oxygen treatment, and total number of hyperbaric oxygen treatments. The prognostic factors were analyzed with univariate and multivariate analyses. Results Sixty-four patients with sudden hearing loss were enrolled, including 7 cases of low-frequency loss, 4 cases of high-frequency loss, 32 cases of flat loss, and 21 cases of complete hearing loss. After HBOT, there were 16 cases (25%) of complete recovery, 15 cases (23.43%) of partial recovery, 7 cases (10.93%) of slight improvement, and 26 cases (40.63%) of no improvement. The total effective rate was 59.37%. Twelve of 21 cases (57.14%) of complete hearing loss showed recovery. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the start time of HBOT ≤ 7 days from disease onset was independently associated with hearing recovery ( OR = 27.763, 95% CI [4.209, 183.115], p = .001). Conclusion Combined HBOT can improve the hearing impairment of sudden hearing loss. The early HBOT showed the most promising therapeutic effects, especially among patients with complete hearing loss.",

Method Modifications at both sites were classified according to an evidence-based framework set forth by Stirman, Miller, Toder, and Calloway (2013) . The Iowa City VA PTM program clinicians made 2 modifications and the Asheville, North Carolina, VA PTM program clinicians made 6 modifications to the standard PTM protocol. Pre–post outcome measures were analyzed for 20 veterans who completed the Iowa City program and for 200 veterans who completed the Asheville program. Results Veterans who completed the Iowa City program showed a statistically significant decrease in the average Tinnitus Handicap Inventory score ( Newman, Jacobson, &amp; Spitzer, 1996 ). Veterans who completed the Asheville PTM program showed a statistically significant decrease in the average Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) score. Outcomes in Asheville were compared to outcomes of a clinical trial of PTM conducted by the developers of PTM. The clinical work in Asheville resulted in a greater mean reduction on the TFI and a larger effect size using the TFI as compared to the results of the PTM clinical trial. Conclusions Clinician-directed modifications to PTM that are made to address the unique needs and circumstances of an individual clinic have potential to result in positive outcomes for patients. Clinicians providing care for patients with tinnitus using PTM who modify the protocol to meet the needs of their local setting are encouraged to collect and report the outcomes of their modifications to improve understanding of the impact of various types of modifications to PTM and other evidence-based practices.",

Due to overlapping symptoms between hearing loss and ASD, children who are suspected of having ASD require an audiological evaluation to determine their hearing status for the purpose of differential diagnosis. The purpose of this article is twofold: (a) to increase audiologists' knowledge of ASD by discussing the challenges associated with testing and interpreting clinical data for children with ASD or suspected ASD and (b) to provide visual supports that can be used to facilitate audiological assessment. Method Eight children (ages 4–12 years) were recruited as video model participants. Videos were filmed using scripts that used concise and concrete language while portraying common clinical procedures. Using the video models, corresponding visual schedules were also created. Conclusion Although obtaining reliable hearing data from children with ASD is challenging, incorporating visual supports may facilitate testing. Video models and visual schedules have been created and made freely available for download online under a Creative Commons License (Creative Commons–Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License). Incorporating visual supports during clinical testing has the potential to reduce the child's and family's stress, as well as to increase the probability of obtaining a reliable and comprehensive audiological evaluation. Future research is warranted to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of implementing these tools in audiology clinics. Supplemental Material https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.10086434",

Method A literature search of peer-reviewed journal articles published in English was conducted in online bibliographic databases using multiple variations of the keywords \"general practitioner\" and \"hearing.\" Results The search strategy identified 3,255 articles. The abstracts of all articles were screened with 124 full-text records subsequently assessed for eligibility. Forty-nine articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Conclusions For people with hearing loss, the GP can play an instrumental role in guiding appropriate and timely choices for addressing hearing concerns. There are a range of quick, easy, and sensitive methods available to GPs to assist the objective evaluation of hearing. The evidence suggests that implementing hearing screening programs targeting older adults will increase rates of hearing loss detection and subsequently increase the number of patients receiving hearing loss intervention. Education and training appear key to improving GPs' screening, management, and referral of patients with hearing loss in the primary health care setting.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Conflicts among video head impulse testing (vHIT) and rotary chair have occurred; therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between rotary chair and vHIT outcome parameters to understand when these two tests disagree and determine if one or both test outcomes are needed in children. Method Data from 141 child and young adult subjects (73 males, 68 females, M age = 15 years, range: 6–35) were retrospectively reviewed. Of those, 56 had a cochlear implant and 85 were normal controls. All subjects completed rotary chair and vHIT, which were categorized as (a) normal vestibular function, (b) unilateral vestibular loss, or (c) bilateral vestibular loss. vHIT tracings were analyzed to determine if gain and corrective saccade velocity, frequency, or latency were helpful parameters for determining vestibular loss. Results Of the 141 subjects, the misclassification rate was 13/141 (9%). All normal control subjects were classified as having normal rotary chair and normal vHIT. In subjects with a cochlear implant ( n = 56), the misclassification rate was 13/56 (23%). There were four misclassification patterns. Using rotary chair as the gold standard, receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed optimal cut-points for vHIT gain (&lt; 0.84), corrective saccade frequency (≥ 50%), amplitude (≥ 75°/s), and latency (≤ 320 ms). Using these vHIT cut-points improved the agreement between rotary chair and vHIT, resulting in an overall misclassification rate of 10/141 (7%) and 9/56 (16%) in subjects with a cochlear implant. Conclusions When testing children, caloric testing is often not an option due to tolerability or time. However, discordant results occur between rotary chair and vHIT. These data suggest vHIT is a sufficient first-tier assessment. If abnormal, rotary chair is not necessary. If normal, rotary chair can be helpful for uncovering other indicators of vestibular loss. When interpreting vHIT, including gain and all corrective saccade outcomes may improve sensitivity.",

Self-reports on usefulness and compliance were elicited after the first and second months of hearing aid use. In addition, the number of hours the hearing aids were used was extracted from the data loggings of each device. Results Simultaneous fitting resulted in high levels of compliance and consistent usage throughout the study period. Sequential fitting resulted in abrupt reduction in compliance and hours of use once the second hearing aid was added, both in the clinical scoring and in the data loggings. Conclusions Simultaneous fitting of bilateral hearing aids results in better compliance compared to sequential fitting.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of melatonin as compared to pentobarbital in children with associated disorders. Method This was a retrospective study that took place in a tertiary care center. Eighty-three children (34 girls and 49 boys) had performed ABR under pentobarbital (GPent) or melatonin (GMel) between 2013 and 2014 and were included. All children had associated neurological or behavioral disorders or had failed a previous ABR using another technique. Success rate, defined as completed binaural investigation, delay, and duration of sleep (minutes), as well as side effects, were compared between GPent and GMel. Results There were 56 patients in GMel and 27 in GPent, with a mean age at test of 3 years and 10 months (1–13 years) and 4 years and 1 month (1–14.5 years), respectively. Success rate was 76.8% and 88.8%, respectively ( p &gt; .05), sleep duration was 23 and 153 min ( p &lt; .0001), and mean delay was 35 and 54 min. No side effects have been reported. Conclusions Melatonin is a drug widely used, particularly for electroencephalogram in children. S leep duration allowed a success rate that was comparable to pentobarbital. Melatonin seems to be an efficient alternative to pentobarbital for pediatric ABR.",

It may be possible to avoid these limitations by using electroencephalography. The present study explored this possibility using the N400.Eleven adults with typical hearing heard high-constraint sentences with congruent and incongruent terminal words in the presence of speech-shaped noise. Participants ignored all auditory stimulation and watched a video. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was varied around each participant's behavioral threshold during electroencephalography recording. Speech was also heard in quiet.The amplitude of the N400 effect exhibited a nonlinear relationship with SNR. In the presence of background noise, amplitude decreased from high (+4 dB) to low (+1 dB) SNR but increased dramatically at threshold before decreasing again at subthreshold SNR (-2 dB).The SNR of speech in noise modulates the amplitude of the N400 effect to semantic anomalies in a nonlinear fashion. These results are the first to demonstrate modulation of the passively evoked N400 by SNR in speech-shaped noise and represent a first step toward the end goal of developing an N400-based physiological metric for speech-in-noise testing.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The goal of this study was to evaluate differences in the electrode–neuron interface as a function of hearing loss etiology in pediatric cochlear implant (CI) listeners with enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) syndrome and in those with autosomal recessive connexin-26 mutations (DFNB1). Method Fifteen implanted ears (9 participants, 5 ears with EVA, 10 ears with DFNB1) were assessed. Single-channel auditory detection thresholds were measured using broad and spatially focused electrode configurations (steered quadrupolar; focusing coefficients = 0 and 0.9). Cochlear resistivity estimates were obtained via electrode impedances and electrical field imaging. Between-group differences were evaluated using linear mixed-effects models. Results Children with EVA had significantly higher auditory detection thresholds than children with DFNB1, irrespective of electrode configuration. Between-group differences in thresholds were more pronounced on apical electrodes than on basal electrodes. In the apex, electrode impedances and electrical field imaging values were higher for children with EVA than for those with DFNB1. Conclusions The electrode–neuron interface differs between pediatric CI listeners with DFNB1 and those with EVA. It is possible that optimal clinical interventions may depend, in part, on hearing loss etiology. Future investigations with large samples should investigate individualized CI programming strategies for listeners with EVA and DFNB1.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Misophonia is a sound tolerance disorder condition in certain sounds that trigger intense emotional or physiological responses. While some persons may experience misophonia, a few patients suffer from misophonia. However, there is a dearth of literature on audiological assessment and management of persons with misophonia. The purpose of this report is to discuss the assessment of misophonia and highlight the management option that helped a patient with misophonia. Method A case study of a 26-year-old woman with the complaint of decreased tolerance to specific sounds affecting quality of life is reported. Audiological assessment differentiated misophonia from hyperacusis. Management included retraining counseling as well as desensitization and habituation therapy based on the principles described by P. J. Jastreboff and Jastreboff (2014). A misophonia questionnaire was administered at regular intervals to monitor the effectiveness of therapy. Results A detailed case history and audiological evaluations including pure-tone audiogram and Johnson Hyperacusis Index revealed the presence of misophonia. The patient benefitted from intervention, and the scores of the misophonia questionnaire indicated a decrease in the severity of the problem. Conclusions It is important to differentially diagnose misophonia and hyperacusis in persons with sound tolerance disorders. Retraining counseling as well as desensitization and habituation therapy can help patients who suffer from misophonia.",

Method A repeated-measure study design was used on 13 normal-hearing adults. ABRs were acquired from the study participants using LS CE-Chirp and click stimuli at four stimulus repetition rates (19.1, 33.3, 61.1, and 81.1 Hz) and four intensity levels (80, 60, 40, and 20 dB nHL). The ABR test was stopped at 40-nV residual noise level. Results High-stimulus repetition rates caused the ABR latencies to be longer and have reduced amplitudes in both ABR to LS CE-Chirp and click stimuli. The ABR to LS CE-Chirp Wave I, III, and V amplitudes were larger than ABR to click in almost all the stimulus repetition rates. However, there were no differences in the number of averages required to reach the stopping criterion between ABR to LS CE-Chirp and click stimulus, and between high-stimulus repetition rates and low-stimulus repetition rates. Conclusion The LS CE-Chirp at standard low-stimulus repetition rates can be used to elicit ABR for both neurodiagnostic and threshold seeking procedure.",

Method Studies were identified with electronic databases and through manual search of the literature. In the primary analyses, effect sizes between pre- and postoperative scores for each age group were calculated using a formula appropriate for repeated-measures designs. Using the effect sizes, two separate meta-analyses using a random-effects restricted maximum likelihood model were conducted for experiments using word and sentence recognition stimuli in quiet. Secondary meta-analyses were conducted to examine average postimplant, percent correct word recognition, sentence recognition, and speech recognition in noise in studies that included both older and younger age groups. Traditional Hedges's g effect sizes were calculated between the two groups. Results For the primary analyses, experiments using word and sentence recognition stimuli yielded significant, large effect sizes for the younger and older adult cochlear implant recipients with no significant differences between the older and younger age groups. However, the secondary meta-analyses of postoperative scores suggested significant differences between age groups for stimuli in quiet and noise. Conclusions Although older and younger adults with implants achieve the same magnitude of pre- to postimplant speech recognition benefit in quiet, the overall postoperative speech recognition outcomes in quiet and noise are superior in younger over older adults. Strategies to mitigate these group differences are critical for ensuring optimal outcomes in elderly individuals who are candidates for cochlear implants.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Several military occupations, particularly those within the U.S. Air Force, require working with or around jet fuels. Jet fuels contain components that are known to affect central nervous function, yet effects of these fuels on auditory function, specifically auditory processing of sound, are not well understood at this time. Animal studies have demonstrated that exposure to jet fuels prior to noise exposure can exacerbate the noise exposure's effects, and service members exposed to jet fuels are at risk of noise exposure within their work environments. The purpose of this article was to give a brief synopsis of the evidence on the ototoxic effects due to jet fuel exposure to aid audiologists in their decision making when providing care for populations who are occupationally exposed to fuels or while during military service. Conclusions Exposure to jet fuels impacts central nervous function and, in combination with noise exposure, may have detrimental auditory effects that research has yet to fully explain. Additional longitudinal research is needed to explain the relationships, which have clinical implications for service members and others exposed to jet fuels. In the meantime, audiologists can gain useful information by screening for chemical exposures when obtaining patient case histories. If jet fuel exposure is suspected, the Lifetime Exposure to Noise and Solvents Questionnaire can be used to estimate a noise exposure ranking and identify other potentiating agents such as jet fuel and industrial chemicals. A history of jet fuel exposure should inform the selection of hearing tests in the audiometric evaluation and when devising the treatment plan.",

Vestibular diagnosis, demographic variables, comorbidities, falls status, and Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) were extracted from the medical record for analysis. Associations between vestibular diagnosis and falls history or DHI were evaluated using multivariate logistic and linear regression, respectively.A total of 283 patients met our inclusion criteria with the following diagnoses: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV; n = 55), acoustic neuroma (n = 30), Ménière's disease (n = 28), multiple vestibular diagnoses (n = 15), vestibular migraine (n = 135), or vestibular neuritis (n = 20). After adjusting for age, sex, race, medications, and comorbidities, the odds of falling was 2.47 times greater (95% CI [1.08, 6.06], p = .039) and the DHI score was 11.66 points higher (95% CI [4.99, 18.33], p < .001) in those with vestibular migraine compared to those with BPPV. Other diagnoses were comparable to BPPV with respect to odds of falling and dizziness handicap.Patients with vestibular migraine may suffer an increased risk of falls and dizziness handicap compared to patients with BPPV. Our findings highlight the need for timely evaluation and treatment of all patients with vestibular disease.",

The purpose of the study was (a) to validate the Chinese translation of the Spatial Hearing Questionnaire (C-SHQ) among Chinese participants and (b) to provide a shortened version for the purpose of clinical screening. Method This was a cross-sectional study. The C-SHQ was developed from the process of translation and back-translation of the original 24-item, English version (Tyler, Perreau, &amp; Ji, 2009). The C-SHQ was administered to 146 patients at the Department of Otolaryngology Clinic of Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital between October 2013 and May 2014 at Sichuan, China. Exploratory factor analysis and reliability tests were performed for the full version, and confirmatory factor analysis was applied for the shortened version of the C-SHQ. Results The exploratory factor analysis revealed scores loaded on 3 similar factors compared with the original SHQ. The internal consistency reliability was high (Cronbach's α = 0.99). The confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a shortened version of 12 items is sufficient to measure spatial hearing abilities. Conclusions The C-SHQ and its short form are both reliable and valid questionnaires, which are suitable for both research and clinical settings to measure spatial hearing ability in the Chinese population.",

One thousand three hundred seventy-eight online consumer hearing aid reviews (open-text responses) were extracted and analyzed.Three domains emerged within the data set, containing 11 themes and 136 subthemes. Domain one (Clinical Processes) contained two themes: Hearing Assessment and Hearing Aid Acquisition. Domain two (The Device) contained five themes: Function, Performance, Physical, Device Management, and Maintenance. Domain three (The Person) contained four themes: Satisfaction, Quality of Life, Personal Adjustment, and Knowledge. The themes gave an understanding that there were a contribution of factors that formed part of a consumers hearing aid user experience.Hearing aid users described a range of positive, negative, and neutral descriptions online about their hearing aid user experience and gave advice to fellow hearing aid users helping clinicians improve their hearing aid fitting skills in practice.

    "abstract": "The Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) active middle ear implant can be used to treat adults and children with hearing loss. Intraoperative measurements based on auditory brainstem response (ABR) allow the determination of the implant's performance. Two methods for stimulus presentation during ABR measurements via VSB will be compared.ABRs were measured in patients implanted with a VSB using a standard ABR system. The stimulus was transmitted directly to the VSB using a new transmission unit (AcoustiAP, MED-EL) and for comparison via a standard audio processor coupled to a wireless streaming device. The study included 10 subjects with mild-to-profound sensorineural, conductive, or mixed hearing loss.As opposed to the wireless method, the AcoustiAP transmits the ABR stimulus without additional signal processing. Therefore, only minor distortions of the transmitted signal are to be expected. There was no significant difference between the performance of the two methods (mean wave V amplitudes 313 [75.2] vs. 301 [88.2] nVpp). In addition, the new system allowed for a more stable connection to the implant system.The AcoustiAP is a valuable tool for performing ABR measurements in patients during VSB implantation using standard equipment, as it allows for easier and more controlled measurements of the coupling efficiency of the implant.",

Online auditory testing can potentially provide a cost-effective alternative to in-person visits. However, even for bilinguals with high English proficiency, age of English acquisition may affect speech perception accuracy. This study used a comprehensive test battery to assess speech perception and spectrotemporal processing abilities in Spanish-English bilinguals and to evaluate susceptibility of different tests to effects of native language.The online battery comprised three tests of speech in quiet (vowel and consonant identification and words in sentences), four tests of speech perception in noise (two for intelligibility and two for comprehension), and three tests of spectrotemporal processing (two tests of stochastically modulated pattern discrimination and one test of spectral resolution). Participants were 28 adult Spanish-English bilinguals whose English acquisition began either early (≤ 6 years old) or late (≥ 7 years old) and 18 English monolingual speakers.Significant differences were found in six of the 10 tests. The differences were most pronounced for vowel perception in quiet, speech-in-noise test, and two tests of speech comprehension in noise. Late bilinguals consistently scored lower than native English speakers or early bilinguals. In contrast, no differences between groups were observed for digits-in-noise or three tests of spectrotemporal processing abilities.The findings suggest initial feasibility of online assessment in this population and can inform selection of tests for auditory assessment of Spanish-English bilinguals.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: There is growing evidence supporting the use of third-wave psychological therapies, such as mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), for people with long-term or chronic physical health conditions. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to critically evaluate the effectiveness of third-wave interventions for improving hearing-related distress and psychological well-being in people with audiological problems. Method: We searched online bibliographic databases and assessed study quality. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses if at least two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examined hearing-related distress, depression, anxiety, or quality of life in people with audiological problems. Findings of pre–post studies were summarized narratively. Results: We identified 15 studies: six RCTs and nine pre–post studies. The methodological quality of studies was mostly poor to moderate, and sample sizes were typically small (overall n = 750). Most studies focused on tinnitus ( n = 12), MBIs ( n = 8), and ACT ( n = 6). Statistically significant improvements in hearing-related distress were found with ACT and MBIs versus controls and other treatments at post-intervention in people with tinnitus, while improvements in depression and anxiety were only found for ACT versus controls at post-intervention. However, gains were either not maintained or not examined at follow-up, and there was no evidence for improvements in quality of life. Conclusions: At present, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of third-wave interventions for improving hearing-related distress or psychological well-being in people with audiological problems. There is some evidence that ACT and MBIs may be useful in addressing hearing-related distress in people with tinnitus, but only in the short term. However, findings should be interpreted with caution given the small number of studies with generally small sample sizes and mostly poor-to-moderate methodological quality. More high-quality, adequately powered, double-blind RCTs, particularly in audiological problems other than tinnitus, are needed to draw firm conclusions and meaningful clinical recommendations.

Those living in rural areas have limited health care resources and experience higher levels of poverty compared to those living in urban regions. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of interprofessional collaboration among physicians and audiologists and pharmacists and audiologists to improve access and affordability of hearing health care in rural communities. Method: Sixteen family physicians and medicine residents and 15 community pharmacists participated in the study. Physicians and residents completed an online survey to assess education regarding hearing health care and their understanding of hearing loss intervention. They also participated in small virtual focus group discussions. Pharmacists participated in virtual discussions based on guided questions. Results: The discussions with both physicians and pharmacists highlighted the need for more education, resources, and awareness of the negative impact of hearing loss on overall quality of life. Comments from these discussions were placed within the socio-ecological model of health behavior to increase understanding of hearing health behavior. Conclusions: Increased collaboration among medical professionals has the potential to improve access to hearing health care for those living in audiologically underserved regions of the country.

Each of these three groups was subdivided into two, one comprising 10 musicians (vocalists practicing South-Indian classical music) and the other comprising 10 nonmusicians.Multivariate analyses of variance revealed that musicians performed significantly better (p < .001) than nonmusicians in all the tests. Analyses of variance showed that whereas age had no effect (p > .05) on performance in any of the tests in musicians, age affected the performance of nonmusicians significantly in terms of ITD (p = .02) and ILD (p = .01) thresholds.Musical training appears to have the potential to slow down age-related decline in binaural, temporal, and spatial processing.",

Errors of the ASR system were analyzed to show possible effects on measurement outcome Results: Measured SRTs showed a highly significant correlation (r = .93) between the fully automatic and \"laboratory\" conditions, with a constant bias of about 1 dB indicating a linear shift of the data without affecting the distribution around the mean. The individual impact of the different system degradations on SRTs could be quantified Conclusions: This study provides a proof of concept for automated ASR-based SRT measurements over VoIP systems for speech audiometric testing in real communication systems, as it produced results comparable to traditional laboratory settings for this group of 16 normal-hearing subjects. This makes VoIP services a promising candidate for speech audiometric testing in real communication systems.",

    "abstract": "The remote delivery of health care services (i.e., telehealth) has steadily increased across the health care landscape over the past decade with a dramatic increase following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Remote audiology delivery (i.e., teleaudiology), by contrast, has traditionally been characterized by relatively low utilization. While teleaudiology services increased during the COVID-19 lockdown period, most of those services were generally limited to follow-up care and postfitting consultations to existing patients. Furthermore, there is reason to believe that, despite the benefits that remote care provides, the use of teleaudiology services has decreased as in-person care has increased following the lifting of mandatory COVID-related lockdowns. The purpose of this viewpoint article is to posit that existing theories of health behavior, usually applied to patient-specific behaviors (e.g., hearing aid uptake) may explain the reluctance of audiologists to \"uptake\" a teleaudiology model of care. We also explore the potential of motivational engagement strategies as a means to allow audiologists to examine their sources of ambivalence as they consider adopting a remote service-delivery model.Health behavior models such as the Health Belief, Transtheoretical, and capability, opportunity, motivation, and behavior (COM-B) models represent theories that may help to explain audiologists' resistance to adopting remote delivery services. Motivational engagement strategies, such as decisional balance, can provide useful tools for audiologists to examine their attitudes toward the adoption of teleaudiology.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of an Internet delivered Mindfulness Based Tinnitus Stress Reduction (i-MBTSR) program during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tinnitus, often a chronic condition, is experienced by 15% of the population. For those with severe, bothersome tinnitus, quality of life is reduced and the treatment options are limited. We evaluated an approach intended to decrease tinnitus-related distress. Method: This study examined the data collected for an online i-MBTSR course using a retrospective design. The intervention included an 8-week self-paced i-MBTSR course, including didactic information about mindfulness and tinnitus, as well as meditation practices. Outcome measures included the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), which were measured at four time periods. These time points included pretreatment, midtreatment at 3 weeks, immediately posttreatment, and at 6-month follow-up. Results: Forty-three participants completed the intervention. The mean preintervention tinnitus severity rating was 59.96 (“severe tinnitus”) as measured by the TFI. Mean TFI scores dropped to 44.16 ( p &lt; .001) at midtreatment and to 34.23 ( p = .001) at posttreatment. Repeated-measures analysis of variance and multivariate analysis of variance tests were conducted to determine changes in the two scales at the four time periods. There were significant differences in perceived stress and tinnitus self-function found in all measures and submeasures between the pre-, mid-, and posttreatment time points with the exception of the TFI Auditory subtest. These gains remained significant for those who completed the 6-month follow-up. Conclusions: The i-MBTSR course appears to be a viable and effective treatment modality. A shorter 3-week course may be effective. Case-control studies to more systematically investigate the effectiveness of i-MBTSR for tinnitus are required.",

Participants were screened for cognitive impairment using the Short Chilean Mini-Mental State Examination and hearing levels were assessed with tonal audiometry (hearTest). Data on demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical characteristics were collected.A total of 538 persons completed the assessment. The prevalence of cognitive impairment in the 50+ population was 9.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] [5.8, 14.7]). Cognitive impairment was significantly higher in individuals with any level of hearing loss (odds ratio [OR] = 2.19, 95% CI [1.00, 4.80], adjusted for age, sex, education, socioeconomic position [SEP], and head trauma). Subjects with hearing loss and who reported any use of hearing aids (16% of the sample) had a lower risk of cognitive impairment (OR of nonusers 3.64, 95% CI [1.00, 13.28], adjusted for age, sex, education, SEP, and head trauma).Strategies for addressing cognitive impairment should further explore the integration of early diagnosis of hearing loss and the regular use of hearing aids.",

    "abstract": "The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for speech presented in background noise may vary after being processed by digital hearing aids with nonlinear signal processing algorithms, such as wide dynamic range compression (WDRC). A phase inversion technique has been previously developed to assess the output SNR of hearing aids. However, systematic validations of this technique have not been conducted. This study aims to validate the phase inversion technique.A simulated hearing aid with multichannel WDRC was implemented, from which the output SNRs, computed via shadow filtering, for connected speech in background noise were directly computed. The agreement between the shadow filter output SNRs and those estimated using the phase inversion technique for the same stimuli was utilized to validate the phase inversion technique. The background noise was 2- or 20-talker babble noise, and the speech stimuli were presented at SNRs of -10 to +10 dB at the input of the simulated hearing aid. The simulated hearing aid was configured to provide amplification for four representative audiograms, and the WDRC was set to be fast or slow acting. To investigate the effects of additive noise, independent of the presented noise stimulus, on the phase inversion estimated output SNR, the same simulated hearing aid was implemented with an additive Gaussian noise at its input (45 and 60 dB SPL).Results showed that the phase inversion technique could either overestimate or underestimate output SNR, depending on the test condition; the estimation errors tended to coincide with temporal landmarks, such as natural pauses between consecutive sentences or fricatives; and increasing the simulated noise led to poorer estimates of output SNR.Results imply that the accuracy of the phase inversion technique is dependent on the test conditions. Thus, the phase inversion technique should be used with caution, and its validity should be evaluated further.",

    "abstract": "Tinnitus is a symptom of auditory dysfunction or injury and can be a precursor to permanent hearing loss. Tinnitus can interfere with communication, sleep, concentration, and mood; when this occurs, it is referred to as bothersome tinnitus. Annual hearing surveillance in the U.S. Army includes screening for bothersome tinnitus. Estimating the prevalence of self-reported bothersome tinnitus can facilitate prioritization of prevention and education efforts. The objective of this study was to examine Army hearing conservation data to estimate the prevalence of self-reported bothersome tinnitus as a function of age, hearing, sex, service component, and pay grade.The study employed a cross-sectional, retrospective design. Records from 1,485,059 U.S. Army Soldiers retrieved from the Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System-Hearing Conservation were analyzed. Descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression analysis were used to estimate the prevalence of bothersome tinnitus and its associations with Soldiers' demographic characteristics.The estimated prevalence of self-reported bothersome tinnitus was 17.1% between January 1, 2015, and September 30, 2019; 13.6% of the Soldiers reported \"bothered a little\" and 3.5% reported \"bothered a lot.\" Proportionally, the prevalence of self-reported bothersome tinnitus was higher for males, older Soldiers, and Reserve Component Soldiers. For every 1-year increase in age, the odds of self-reporting \"bothered a little\" tinnitus relative to \"bothered not at all tinnitus\" would be expected to increase by 2.2% (2.1%, 2.3%), and the odds of self-reporting \"bothered a lot\" tinnitus relative to \"bothered not at all\" tinnitus would be expected to increase by 3.6% (3.5%, 3.7%).The self-reported prevalence of bothersome tinnitus in the U.S. Army (17.1%) is substantially higher than that of the general population, where prevalence of bothersome tinnitus is estimated at 6.6%. Examination of bothersome tinnitus among Soldiers is an important step toward optimizing prevention, education, and intervention efforts.",

    "abstract": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration finalized regulations for over-the-counter hearing aids (OTC-HAs) on August 17, 2022. Little is known about the comparative performance of OTC-HAs and prescription HAs. This study compared amplification accuracy of prescription HAs and direct-to-consumer devices (DTCDs, including personal sound amplification products [PSAPs] and OTC-HAs).Eleven devices were programmed to meet prescriptive targets in an acoustic manikin for three degrees of hearing loss. Devices consisted of high- and low-end HAs, PSAPS, and OTC-HAs. Each was tested, and deviations from target measured with an HA analyzer at every combination of 10 frequencies and low-, average-, and high-level inputs. Accuracy was compared using a multilevel Poisson model with device-specific intercepts controlling for input level, frequency, and device type.For mild-moderate hearing loss, deviations from targets were not statistically different between high- and low-end HAs, but PSAPs (5.50 dB, SE = 0.92 dB) and OTC-HAs (8.83 dB, SE = 1.10 dB) had larger differentials. For flat moderate hearing loss, compared to high-end HAs, average differentials were larger for all device types at all input levels and frequencies (Low HA: 3.82 dB, SE = 1.10 dB; PSAP: 9.24 dB, SE = 1.22 dB; OTC-HA: 8.61 dB, SE = 1.19 dB). For mild sloping to severe hearing loss, compared to high-end HAs, OTC-HAs (9.72 dB, SE = 1.20 dB) and PSAPs (7.34 dB, SE = 1.07 dB) had larger differentials and significant variability at the highest and lowest frequencies. Half (three) of the PSAPs and OTC-HAs met most targets within ±5 dB.DTCDs were unable to meet prescriptive targets for severe types of hearing loss but could meet them for mild hearing loss. This study provides an examination of current hearing devices. More research is needed to determine whether meeting prescriptive targets provides any benefit in the outcomes and performance with DTCD devices.",

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of early hearing detection for infants with a history of NICU admission. The secondary aim was to determine if diagnostic audiology services within the NICU setting accelerated diagnosis and intervention. A retrospective chart review was completed for infants referred for diagnostic audiologic testing from 2018 to 2021 at a tertiary urban-setting children's hospital. After exclusion criteria were applied, 367 infants with NICU history were included in the analysis. Various factors were recorded from electronic medical records. Time to diagnosis was derived and compared across (a) NICU location, (b) insurance type, and (c) race/ethnicity. Analysis of infants with NICU history revealed that 70% of infants had a diagnosis by 3 months corrected age. The level of in-NICU audiologic care did not significantly impact corrected age at diagnosis; however, loss to follow-up (LTFU) rates were higher for NICUs that did not provide in-hospital diagnostic services (10.0%) when compared to the NICU setting with inpatient audiology services (6.8%). In-NICU testing occurred on average 5.7 weeks prior to discharge, expediting diagnosis of hearing status compared to having to wait for an outpatient evaluation after discharge. Timely hearing detection is feasible in the medically complex NICU population. Inpatient audiology diagnostic testing may help reduce LTFU and facilitate early hearing detection and intervention.",

The disorder is characterized by motor symptoms due in large part to the loss of dopamine-producing neurons. The vestibular system, crucial for maintaining balance, may be impacted in PD, contributing to balance issues through dysfunction in the vestibulo-ocular reflex. In this study, we aim to describe differences in vestibular responses before and after use of levodopa (L-DOPA) in patients with PD. The study evaluated nine PD patients who underwent videonystagmography, video head impulse testing, and rotational chair testing both on and off their dopaminergic medications. Effect sizes of the mean difference was measured using Cohen's d. The results revealed a general trend of increase in vestibular responses from the off stage to the on stage across all the vestibular testing mechanisms. The p values were all > .05, and the Cohen's d 95% confidence interval (CI) ranged from small to moderate effects with wide CIs consistent with the small sample. In this case series of nine patients with PD, we identified a general trend of a small increase in vestibular responses in the on state of L-DOPA compared with the off state of L-DOPA. The significance and clinical implications of such differences should be evaluated in larger samples.",

Research has demonstrated the importance of a combination of self-report and performance-based tools in predicting falls. Using this approach, the purpose of this study was to examine the association between the degree of hearing loss and fall risk. Method: Community-dwelling older adults with hearing loss, aged 60 years and above, completed a history form, the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale and the modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction in Balance. Average pure-tone audiometry of the better hearing ear was calculated. Fall risk was determined for each participant. Binomial logistic regression and Cohen's kappa were performed. Results: Fifty-eight participants, with mild ( n = 12), moderate ( n = 27), moderately severe ( n = 14), and severe ( n = 5) hearing losses were included in the analysis. Overall fall risk incidence was 46.6%. No significant association was found between the degree of hearing loss and fall risk, while age, gender, and diabetes were revealed to be significant fall risk factors. A key finding was the tendency to overestimate balance confidence using self-report measures. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study in Asia employing self-report and performance-based measures to examine hearing loss and fall risk. Our findings provide insight into region-specific factor(s) affecting fall risk and serves to pave the way for future fall risk research. Future studies should include a combination of self-report and performance-based measures, as well as account for protective fall risk factors.",

Method: Twenty-one college students completed the repeated-measures design. Pure-tone audiometry and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) were completed pre- and postmethods to determine the presence of a temporary threshold shift (TTS). The external auditory meatus sound pressure level (EAM SPL) was measured as participants listened to the researchers' and their songs via their personal device and the researchers' computer using in-the-ear, over-the-ear, in-the-canal, and their personal transducers. Paired t tests were completed on pure-tone thresholds and DPOAE amplitude. A four-factor multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA; p = .05) investigated the presence of an EAM SPL difference between songs, transducers, and devices. A second four-factor MANOVA investigated a difference between the participants' and matched researchers' transducers by ear, song, and device. Results: No TTS was identified. The computer produced significantly lower EAM SPL compared to the participants' device. Over-the-ear transducers produced significantly lower EAM SPLs compared to in-the-ear, in-the-canal, and the participants' transducers. The participants' transducers produced significantly lower EAM SPLs compared to in-the-canal style. Conclusions: Preferred listening levels are inconsistent across devices. Over-the-ear transducers and the computer present the lowest hearing loss risk as they produced the lowest EAM SPLs.

Early detection of cognitive decline and dementias is a strategy for delaying the progression of these clinical conditions. Method: This scoping review was conducted using various online databases and gray literature sources, including the Latin American and Caribbean Literature in Health Sciences, PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses. Studies were included if they assessed individuals who underwent behavioral tests for CAP evaluation and had completed at least one cognitive test. Results: A total of 1,190 references were retrieved from the databases, with 151 identified as duplicates. After screening 1,039 articles by title and abstract, eight studies were selected for full-text review, and five were included in the final synthesis. The behavioral tests for CAP evaluation used to investigate preclinical manifestations of cognitive decline and dementia were: Synthetic Sentence Identification With Ipsilateral Competing Message, Staggered Spondaic Word test, Dichotic Sentence Identification, and Dichotic Digits Test. Among these, dichotic tests were identified as having the strongest association with cognitive decline, probable Alzheimer's disease, or dementia. Conclusions: The findings indicate that dichotic tests are the most frequently utilized behavioral tests for CAP evaluation and serve as valuable tools for detecting early manifestations of cognitive decline and dementias. These tests could play a significant role in the early diagnosis and management of cognitive impairments.",

Method: This study utilized data from the Millennium Cohort Study, the largest and longest running longitudinal health study of service members and veterans, to ascertain self-reported and medical diagnoses of tinnitus. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to identify factors associated with new-onset tinnitus. Results: New-onset tinnitus was self-reported by 10.7% ( n = 2,527) of participants while 3.5% ( n = 511) had a medical record tinnitus diagnosis. Tinnitus risk was associated with multiple characteristics, including active duty service, being a member of the Army or Marine Corps, combat deployment experience, combat specialist occupation, prior history of mild traumatic brain injury, panic/anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) alone, and PTSD comorbid with depression. Conclusions: This may be the first study to determine new-onset tinnitus utilizing both self-reported and medical record data in a large prospective cohort of service members and veterans. Additional prospective studies are needed to corroborate our findings and further describe the temporal relationships of military occupational and mental health characteristics with service-related new-onset tinnitus.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Speech-in-noise performance of cochlear implant (CI) users varies considerably, and understanding speech in a complex auditory environment remains challenging. It is still unclear which auditory skill is causing this difficulty. This study aimed to evaluate spectral resolution, temporal resolution, and melodic contour identification (MCI) skills to determine which of these skills is most closely related to speech understanding in noise and to investigate whether these three skills differ among CI users with varying performances in speech-in-noise tasks. Method: The three-syllable word identification test (in quiet), the Turkish Matrix Test (in quiet, at fixed +8 dB SNR, and adaptively in noise) were administered to evaluate speech perception to 24 adult CI users (18–55 years old). To evaluate auditory abilities, tests involving spectral-temporally modulated ripple, gap detection, and MCI were administered. CI recipients were separated into two groups (good and low performers) based on their adaptive matrix speech reception threshold (SRT) in noise. Results: The abilities of temporal and spectral resolution were correlated with speech understanding at +8 dB SNR. However, the effect of spectral resolution on understanding at +8 dB SN was not significant. The skill most associated with the Matrix SRT in noise was spectral resolution. The groups differed significantly in both the speech tests and spectral resolution skills. Conclusions: Varying spectral resolution skills among CI users may affect their speech perception performance in noise. The effects of spectral and temporal resolution on speech perception in noise varied across noise conditions. Thus, there may be an increased requirement for spectral resolution in more adverse listening environments.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study examined the lived experiences of former audiologists to examine career journeys within and after audiology. The long-term goal of this research is to help academic audiologists create optimal ways to recruit future audiologists who will thrive in the profession and help the profession improve the lived experience of audiologists in the workplace, to improve retention. Method: A qualitative (grounded theory) approach was used. Virtual interviews were completed by 28 participants (25 former audiologists, three in the departure planning stage). Results: The theoretical model developed from audiologists' career stories includes Origin Story, Audiology Career Story, and Post-Audiology Story. Three main themes are described as part of the Audiology Career Story: Link Between Family &amp; Career, Confluence of Experiences, and Self-Evolution &amp; Pondering Change. The Confluence of Experiences subthemes were as follows: Wanting More, Bad Management, Compensation, Lack of Desirable Jobs, Burnout &amp; Workload, Desire for Flexibility, and Sales Emphasis. This model suggests there are complex and interconnected reasons why audiologists change jobs within audiology and leave the profession. The most common post-audiology position was that of full-time, at-home caregiver ( n = 5). For those employed in the workforce, most stayed in health care–related professions and 73% reported post-audiology compensation was equal to or greater than compensation as an audiologist. Conclusions: Personal and professional factors, and connections among these factors, influence the lived experiences of former audiologists. Awareness of former audiologists' career stories provide insights that may help the profession improve recruitment and retention. Supplemental Material: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.29089475",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Numerous individuals in the United States are bothered enough by tinnitus that it affects normal daily activities, including sleep and concentration. There is a high prevalence of self-reported bothersome tinnitus in the U.S. military, and therefore, it is important to assess the impact of tinnitus on functional performance. The primary aim of this study was to examine the effects of tinnitus on a range of subjective, objective, auditory, and cognitive measures. A secondary aim was to determine which factors best predict whether individuals ever self-reported tinnitus. A prospective study was conducted to address the primary aim, and an exploratory machine learning approach was used to address the second. Method: The study included 463 active duty U.S. Service members being seen for annual hearing surveillance. Participants completed several auditory and cognitive tests, along with questionnaires regarding tinnitus, depression, anxiety, and sleep difficulty. Results: The primary aim found no significant performance differences on tasks of selective attention, short-term memory, or speech in noise between the tinnitus groups. However, there were significant group differences in extended high-frequency hearing. A machine learning algorithm was used to predict whether an individual self-reported experiencing tinnitus. The model had approximately 80% accuracy, excellent sensitivity, and modest specificity. Conclusions: Study findings corroborated other evidence that extended high-frequency thresholds are poorer in those who reported ever experiencing tinnitus, regardless of tinnitus bother. Our results suggest that combining results from audiometric testing, high-frequency hearing, and subjective assessment of sleep achieved 80% accuracy in predicting tinnitus presence.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Auditory processing (AP) disorder is underdiagnosed in Australian children due to reduced access to assessments. Mobile health technology (mHealth) tools such as the AP assessment application Feather Squadron (FS) may be a way to overcome barriers of clinical assessments. This study aimed to consider the validity of FS as a remote assessment tool when compared to current Australian clinical assessments of speech recognition in noise, dichotic listening, temporal processing, and auditory short-term memory. Method: This study employed a within-subject, comparative design. Thirty-five normal-hearing children aged between 6.8 and 13.1 years ( M = 9.1, SD = 1.8) were tested on the following AP skills: dichotic listening, temporal sequencing, speech recognition in noise, and auditory short-term memory. Participants were tested using traditional clinical tests administered by a qualified audiologist and then completed an mHealth delivered counterpart via the FS application. Results of both clinical and FS tests were converted into age-related z scores or scaled scores for comparison. Results: Significant, positive interclass correlations were found on assessments of dichotic listening in the worse ear and temporal sequencing. However, poor agreement was noted between these assessments using Bland–Altman analysis, which found substantial bias and wide limits of agreement. A moderate significant Pearson correlation was noted when comparing performance on the clinical and FS auditory short-term memory task. Conclusions: mHealth tools like FS may be useful for identifying children at risk of AP disorder and increasing referrals for assessment. The poor limits of agreement and bias recognize that FS assessments cannot directly replace clinical tests of AP skills and that despite significant relations between tasks, clinical assessments of AP skills delivered by specialists in a controlled environment remains preferable.",

Method: A retrospective chart review analyzed children, under 18 years of age, who underwent sedated ABR evaluation in an operating room at a single tertiary academic center from January 1, 2013, to January 1, 2023. The following information was collected: sex, age, family history of hearing loss, newborn hearing screen status, and presence or absence of known risk factors for childhood hearing loss (neurodegenerative disorders, syndromes, congenital cytomegalovirus infection, other congenital infections, craniofacial anomalies, Apgar score at 5 min, neonatal intensive care unit stay of &gt; 5 days, ototoxic medication treatment, low birth weight, assisted ventilation, and history of outer or middle ear pathology). Data were collected and stored using Research Electronic Data Capture software. Results: The mean age of children undergoing sedated hearing assessment was 23.12 months. Roughly half the children who underwent sedated testing passed newborn hearing screening, while the other half referred. Findings show statistically significant difference in age of children undergoing sedated assessment that passed (30.57 months) versus referred (16.10 months) newborn hearing screening. While majority of children who passed newborn hearing screening were found to have normal hearing with sedated evaluation, 24% had sensorineural or mixed hearing loss and 18% conductive hearing loss. Findings showed a higher proportion of children subsequently identified with conductive hearing loss had sedated assessment completed in conjunction with another procedure. Overall, nearly 60% of children undergoing sedated ABR had another procedure in conjunction. Conclusions: This study highlights the need for continued vigilance in hearing assessments to prevent delays in diagnosis. Both children who passed and referred newborn hearing screening subsequently underwent sedated ABR testing. We recommend whenever possible, children needing sedated hearing assessment do so in conjunction with another procedure to limit the need for multiple sedation events.",

The VertiGuard RT vibrotactile neurofeedback balance training system records body sway (direction, amplitude, and acceleration) via a wearable sensor and provides feedback to the wearer in real time via vibrotactile sensory feedback. This study aimed to explore the feasibility and usability of VertiGuard RT vibrotactile neurofeedback balance training in older adults with hearing loss and describe the participants' overall perspectives of the device and training. Design: A mixed-methods design was used, including qualitative semistructured interviews analyzed using thematic analysis and the System Usability Scale for quantitative analysis. Study Sample: A subset of participants from a larger trial of the VertiGuard RT device ( N = 14) of older adults with mild-to-profound hearing loss was recruited. Results: Participants found the VertiGuard RT training feasible; however, usability varied, with a number of challenges, including technical issues, challenge level of the exercises, and degree of feedback.

The increase in gun violence has also led to an increase in gunshot wounds on the temporal bone. The most common major complaint in conscious patients with temporal bone trauma is hearing loss. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explain the need for successful management of penetrating head injuries, demonstrate the role of the audiologist in determining cochlear function after gunshot injury to the temporal bone, and discuss the importance of interdisciplinary approach involving audiologists and physicians. We hypothesized that early and accurate audiological assessment is critical for effective surgical intervention and patient outcomes. Research Design: We present three unique cases of temporal bone trauma due to gunshot injuries, with quite different audiological results, in this exploratory case report. Conclusions: The variability in assessment protocols used and audiological outcomes demonstrate the need for successful management of penetrating head injuries, the role of the audiologist in determining cochlear function after gunshot injury to the temporal bone, and the importance of interdisciplinary approach. Collaboration between the surgeon and audiologist, coupled with prompt and accurate audiologic results, can lead to the most successful outcome for the patient, thus improving the quality of health care.",

Method: A sequential, explanatory mixed-methods design was employed. Phase 1 comprised a survey with audiologists who were recruited via professional associations and social media platforms. Phase 2 comprised two focus group interviews with NHS program experts who provided further insights into the reported informed consent practices. Results: Although practices varied between private and public health care sectors, there was general agreement among participants on the best timing and format for delivering information, the timing of the consent process, and the consistency of consent procedures for both high-risk and well babies. However, the information provided to these two groups of babies varied. The focus group interviews highlighted subtle details of obtaining true informed consent, distinguishing it from implied consent and informed choice, emphasizing its complexity and significance for clinical practice. The importance of providing accessible, culturally sensitive information to ensure parental autonomy and informed decision making was also highlighted by the findings. Conclusions: Findings highlight the critical role of informed consent in NHS. Effective informed consent in NHS programs requires timely, clear, and culturally appropriate communication. This study underscores the need for standardized practices in informed consent to enhance parental understanding and support for NHS programs in South Africa, and proposes strategies to improve informed consent processes, particularly in contexts where universal NHS is not mandated.",

Method: The study involved 81 older HA users with moderate-to-severe hearing loss. Participants underwent the iDIN, along with two sentence-in-noise tests (Mandarin Hearing in Noise Test [MHINT] and Mandarin Chinese Matrix Sentence Test [CMNmatrix]) and two working memory (WM) tests (reading span test and digit span test). Correlation analysis and hierarchical multiple regression were employed to relate iDIN outcomes to conventional sentence-in-noise test results. Results: Among 56 participants who completed all tests, high correlations (ranging from .66 to .73) were observed between speech recognition thresholds (SRTs) measured using sentence-in-noise tests and SRTs measured with two-, three-, four-, and five-digit sequences on the iDIN. Reading span and two-digit SRT were significant predictors for SRTs measured using the CMNmatrix test. The two-digit SRT and the difference between five-digit and two-digit SRTs accounted for 57.9% and 61.3% of the variance in MHINT and CMNmatrix SRTs, respectively. When using 0.5 as the cutoffs for the two-digit SRT, among the 81 participants, the two-digit SRT (sensitivity: 0.818; specificity: 0.895) effectively differentiated those who could successfully complete sentence-in-noise tests. Conclusions: The findings highlight the potential of the iDIN as a simple, quick, and reliable tool for measuring speech recognition that correlates well with performance on conventional sentence-in-noise tests and for those who could not be tested using these conventional measures. While results on short digit sequences primarily reflect auditory function, longer digit sequences involve the contribution of WM function, providing additional information regarding an individual's ability to understand speech in noise.",

Accordingly, hearing care practitioners (HCPs) may have a responsibility to address health domains beyond hearing. The current study compared client and HCP attitudes toward the role of HCPs in addressing such domains. Method: One thousand four hundred one clients and 94 HCPs were recruited from Connect Hearing, a network of audiology clinics across North America. Clients and HCPs completed questionnaires focused on five health domains associated with HL (cognitive health, socioemotional health, physical health, mobility and balance, and overall wellness). Prior to their hearing care appointment, clients indicated their expectations of HCPs to address such domains. Concurrently, HCPs indicated their perceived ability to address the domains. Results: HCP ability was significantly greater than client expectations within the domains of cognitive and socioemotional health, while client expectations were greater than HCP ability within the domains of physical health and mobility and balance. Conclusions: HCPs report that they are generally capable of fulfilling their role and meeting their clients' expectations across health domains beyond hearing. Potential strategies to enhance alignment between client expectations and HCP ability are discussed. Such strategies include holistic and integrated care.

    "abstract": "Purpose: Understanding speech in challenging environments can be fatiguing for individuals with and without hearing loss. Empirical research examining interventions to reduce such fatigue, however, is limited. Our study investigated the effects of imperfect captions, such as those created using automated speech recognition systems, on listening-related fatigue during a challenging speech task. Method: Twenty-two adults (aged 18–63 years) with essentially normal hearing completed a sustained dual task designed to induce listening-related fatigue. The primary task was audiovisual sentence recognition in quiet, with speech levels individually adjusted for ~70% correct performance (without captions). The secondary task was response time (RT) to topic words presented during the speech task. Participants completed the dual task with or without captions. Subjective fatigue ratings were obtained before, during, and after the dual task. Vigilant attention was measured via the secondary task and before and after the dual task using visual stimuli (RTs to a visual marker presented at random intervals). Results: Subjective fatigue ratings increased significantly over the course of the dual task. However, this increase was larger for the group who had captions, even though they had better sentence recognition overall. Evidence of behavioral fatigue (slowed RTs over time) was also present but only for those in the Caption group. Anecdotal reports from study participants suggest that the increased fatigue for the Caption group was related to the cognitive challenge of combining information from the time-locked audiovisual cues and the time-delayed, and imperfect, text captions. Conclusions: Even though they were time-delayed and contained inaccuracies, captions improved speech recognition. However, this benefit was accompanied by greater increases in subjective and behavioral fatigue. Therefore, in some conditions imperfect captions can have negative consequences for listening-related fatigue. Further research is needed to determine whether this pattern holds in different circumstances, such as with audio-only stimuli. Supplemental Material: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.29646482",

    "abstract": "Given emerging evidence suggesting a correlation between hearing and cognitive performance, hearing loss may be a modifiable risk factor for future cognitive decline or dementia in older adults. However, more evidence is needed to determine how hearing loss and hearing aid (HA) treatment affect cognition and self-perceived listening abilities in this population. The current study used a repeated-measures design to explore changes in cognitive performance, self-reported hearing difficulties, and noise acceptance in older adults at baseline and at 2 and 4 months after receiving their first pair of bilateral HAs. The results of this study suggest a significant average improvement for all three test measures after 2 and 4 months of HA use. Results on the individual cognition measures indicated that the significant average improvement on working memory tasks in a low-cognition group drove the overall significant improvement in fluid cognition. The principal components analysis found associations between test measures and patient variables, including better ear pure-tone average (PTA) and hours of HA use. Most notable were associations among baseline listening difficulty ratings, noise acceptance, and PTA as well as associations between cognitive performance and average hours of HA use. Significant average improvements in cognitive performance, self-reported hearing difficulties, and noise acceptance were found after 2 and 4 months of HA use in older adults. Participants with lower baseline fluid cognition showed greater gains on working memory measures. Average performance on test measures was associated with hearing thresholds and hours of HA use.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study developed and translated the Chinese version of the Listening Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (C-LSEQ), tested its reliability and validity, and explored listening self-efficacy characteristics among older adults with age-related hearing loss (ARHL). Method: One hundred seventy-two patients with ARHL aged ≥ 60 years completed the C-LSEQ by the direct interview method, as well as the pure-tone hearing threshold test, the speech recognition threshold test in noise, and the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Elderly–Screening. Using the random number table method, the C-LSEQ was resurveyed to 20 of the 172 study participants 2 weeks after the initial evaluation. The validity of C-LSEQ was further determined by comparing the scores of three groups: the young adults with normal-hearing group ( n = 50), the older adults with normal-hearing group ( n = 20), and the older adults with ARHL with no hearing aid use history. Analysis of variance and post hoc tests analyzed sex, education, and hearing loss's impact on listening self-efficacy in ARHL. Results: (a) Reliability: The Cronbach's α coefficients were &gt; .8, and the retest reliability was &gt; 0.9 ( p &lt; .001). (b) Validity test: The composite reliability of the two subscales and the summary questionnaire were all &gt; 0.7, and the average variance extracted was all &gt; 0.5. The level of efficacy was higher with two normal-hearing groups compared to ARHL ( p &lt; .001). At a cutoff &gt; 80, C-LSEQ distinguished ARHL from normal hearing with 100% sensitivity and 92.85% specificity. Conclusion: The structure of the C-LSEQ was stable, with good reliability and validity, and it could be used to assess the listening self-efficacy of older adults.

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of different hearing devices on sound localization and speech perception in individuals with single-sided deafness (SSD). Specifically, the study sought to assess the performance of softband bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHAs) and contralateral routing of signals hearing aids (CROS HA) in various conditions to determine their effectiveness in improving auditory outcomes for SSD patients. Method: Eighteen participants (aged between 20 and 50 years) with SSD underwent tests using softband BAHA, CROS HA, and unaided conditions in a counterbalanced design. Sound localization tests, speech perception in noise assessments, and subjective satisfaction ratings were conducted to measure the effectiveness of the hearing devices. The study employed a single-subject, repeated-measures experimental design to compare the performance of the different devices. Results: The results revealed that softband BAHA significantly improved sound localization, particularly in low-frequency stimulus localization, compared to CROS HA and unaided conditions ( p = .03). Subjective satisfaction scores aligned with objective test outcomes, indicating a preference for softband BAHA. Speech perception in noise performance varied across conditions, with both hearing devices showing benefits in certain scenarios. Conclusions: The findings of this study have important clinical implications for selecting appropriate hearing device options for SSD patients. Softband BAHA demonstrated superior performance in sound localization tasks, as evidenced by the significant improvement observed in the Azimuth Localization Test results. This test measures a central auditory skill—sound localization—by evaluating participants' ability to accurately identify the direction of sound sources. The enhanced performance with softband BAHA in this task suggests that the BAHA device provides the brain with more robust cues for localization when compared with the CROS device. Using suitable hearing devices during rehabilitation for SSD patients is crucial for enhancing auditory outcomes and quality of life in this population. Further research is warranted to address the limitations identified and optimize rehabilitation strategies for individuals with SSD.",

The main objective of the present study was to examine resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and graph theory-based network efficiency metrics in 49 adults categorized by age and hearing thresholds to identify the neural mechanisms of age-related hearing decline. Forty-nine adults with self-reported normal hearing underwent pure-tone audiometry and rs-fMRI. RSFC within key brain networks and auditory-related brain regions, including the default mode network, salience network, dorsal attention network, and primary auditory cortices, was assessed using region-of-interest-based and graph theory approaches. Functional metrics, such as RSFC strength and global and local efficiency, were compared across age groups (middle age vs. older age) and hearing profile groups (negative screening vs. positive screening and negative high-frequency [HF] screening vs. positive HF screening). Older adults demonstrated significantly weaker RSFC between the left primary auditory cortex and the left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate cortex within the salience network than middle-aged adults. Participants without age-related hearing decline exhibited weaker internetwork connectivity within the dorsal attention network and bilateral auditory regions, highlighting the impact of hearing sensitivity on network functionality. Graph theory metrics indicated greater local efficiency in nodes within the salience network among individuals without age-related hearing decline, suggesting preserved cognitive control and attentional processing. Age and hearing thresholds significantly affected the functional connectivity and network efficiency of the brain. These results emphasize the importance of neuroimaging techniques like rs-fMRI in studying neural mechanisms of age-related hearing loss. https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.29945021.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: High rates of hearing loss are observed for individuals with Down syndrome, and regular hearing assessment is recommended for children and adults. Unknown variability of threshold estimates for repeated auditory assessments for individuals with diverse intellectual abilities, such as individuals with Down syndrome, confounds the ability to determine true threshold changes between assessments. This study evaluated variability of pure-tone thresholds measured within and across test sessions for individuals with Down syndrome. Method: Participants included 27 individuals with Down syndrome, ages 5.1–46.5 years (average = 22.7, SD = 11.8). A group of 11 neurotypical individuals, ages 15.9–48.6 years (average = 24.5, SD = 10.3) was included in intrasession variability assessment. Pure-tone thresholds in quiet were measured at 1, 4, 8, and 11.2 kHz during a single session or during repeated audiograms separated by 2.7–11.2 months (average = 5.8, SD = 2.4) and 3.0–3.9 years (average = 3.4, SD = 0.4). Results: Intrasession variability was ≤ 10 dB for 94.3%–100% of thresholds for participants with Down syndrome, with similar variability observed for neurotypical participants. Threshold differences were ≤ 10 dB for 63.2%–85% of responses from audiograms separated by an average of 5.8 months and 37.5%–62.5% of responses separated by an average of 3.4 years. Conclusions: Intrasession variability for participants with Down syndrome aligns with current clinical standards accepting variability of ≤ 10 dB between repeated threshold estimates. Differences in repeated audiometric thresholds greater than 10 dB likely reflect true changes in hearing sensitivity. Supplemental Material: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.30052885",

This is particularly important for those in rural and medically underserved areas, where there may be a lack of specialty medical care, and terrain, weather, or transportation options may make travel to a health care facility difficult. Purpose: The purpose of this clinical focus article is to provide an overview of the history, current state, and future direction of telehealth within the Department of Veterans Affairs. Conclusions: A variety of tools and technology with which telehealth can be delivered exist. This enables health care organizations to leverage their clinical networks to match supply and demand across their enterprise and offer additional choices for how patients receive their care. The COVID-19 pandemic was an opportune time for expansion of telehealth. Postpandemic, in many health care systems, it has become a core part of clinical operations. To realize the full potential of telehealth and to ensure equity across populations, addressing gaps in broadband access and digital skills will be critical.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Effective communication is essential to optimize medical care, but patients and providers are poor at recognizing hearing difficulty. While hearing loss is managed in outpatient clinics at the Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Healthcare System, audiologic care for inpatients is typically reactive or not provided. Method: An audiology inpatient management (AIM) program was developed to improve communication between inpatients with hearing loss and their medical providers during a hospitalization. AIM uses chart review to proactively identify inpatients that may have difficulty communicating with medical providers and provides bedside audiologic care. AIM was piloted on one inpatient unit before expanding to the entire medical center. Results: Fifty-two percent (52%) of the pilot unit's new admissions had previously documented hearing loss. Although 83% of inpatients with hearing loss were fitted with hearing aids before their hospitalization, only 31% brought them to the hospital upon admission. Since expanding AIM to every inpatient unit, 28% of all new hospital admissions received audiologic care at bedside. Conclusions: This article describes AIM's design, implementation, and evaluation with the intent of serving as a resource for other audiologists creating a similar program. Audiologists must guide recommendations on how to ensure that inpatients with hearing loss can effectively participate in their health care.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Hearing aids are the primary treatment for age-related hearing loss but are vastly underutilized. We explored cross-sectional associations between predisposing, enabling, and need factors and hours of daily hearing aid use. Method: In the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, 764 participants at Visit 6 (2016–2017) reported hearing aid use. Self-reported hours of daily hearing aid use were modeled continuously (hours) and categorically (&lt; 6, 6–12, and &gt; 12 hr). Covariates included predisposing (age, sex, race–center), enabling (education, marital status, years of prior hearing aid use, global cognitive factor score, depressive symptoms, access to health care, health literacy), and need factors (pure-tone average [PTA], Quick Speech-in-Noise Test [QuickSIN] score). Multivariable-adjusted linear and ordinal logistic models were used to examine associations between these factors and daily hearing aid use. Results: Every 1-year increase in prior hearing aid use was associated with 0.08-hr increase in daily hearing aid use (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.04, 0.13]); every 10-dB increase in PTA was associated with 0.63-hr increase in daily hearing aid use (95% CI [0.18, 1.08]); every 5-point increase in QuickSIN score was associated with 0.53-hr decrease in daily hearing aid use (95% CI [−0.99, −0.06]). Longer duration of prior hearing aid use and poor PTA and QuickSIN performance were associated with higher odds of being in a higher hearing aid use category. Conclusions: Hours of daily hearing aid use is driven primarily by audiometric hearing, SIN performance, and years of prior hearing aid use. Further research into determinants of hours of use can improve precision of hearing care. Supplemental Material: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.30192826",

Method: Participants were 16 Mandarin-speaking adults (13 men, 3 women; M age = 58 years) with symmetrical severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss. They had at least 1 year of hearing aid experience. A within-subject experimental design compared two hearing aid conditions: with the Speech Enhancer algorithm activated and deactivated. Speech intelligibility was assessed using the Mandarin Chinese matrix sentence test at individual speech reception thresholds. Subjective listening effort was measured using a categorical rating scale for speech presented at three distances (2, 4, and 8 m). Sound quality ratings were collected for loudness, speech understanding, and overall impression using a visual analog scale. Results: Activation of the speech enhancement algorithm led to a notable increase in speech intelligibility from 45% to 67%. Subjective listening effort decreased significantly with the algorithm activated at all distances, with greater benefits observed at farther distances. Similarly, sound quality ratings were significantly higher with the algorithm on for all attributes across all distances, with the largest improvements in overall impression ratings at greater distances. Conclusions: The soft speech enhancement algorithm significantly improved speech intelligibility, reduced listening effort, and enhanced sound quality for distant speech perception in Mandarin-speaking adults with SPHL. These findings suggest that targeted signal processing for soft speech can provide substantial benefits for individuals with SPHL, including speakers of tonal languages, potentially improving communication in challenging listening situations.",

The present study characterizes the Head Impulse Paradigm (HIMP) and the Suppression Head Impulse Paradigm (SHIMP) among normal-hearing individuals with tinnitus. Method: Forty-five normal-hearing individuals with unilateral tinnitus and 45 normal-hearing individuals without tinnitus underwent both the HIMP and the SHIMP. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gains in the HIMP and SHIMP, interaural VOR gain asymmetry, and the presence/absence of compensatory saccades in the HIMP and anticompensatory saccades in the SHIMP were measured for all participants. Results: Significant reductions in both HIMP and SHIMP VOR gains were recorded among the normal-hearing individuals with tinnitus, exclusively in the ears presenting with tinnitus compared with their nontinnitus ears ( p &lt; .05) and their healthy counterparts ( p &lt; .05). The interaural gain asymmetry in both the HIMP and the SHIMP was significantly higher among the normal-hearing individuals with tinnitus ( p &lt; .05). Moreover, individuals with tinnitus exhibited various patterns of anticompensatory saccades that were distinct from those of healthy individuals. The study also found a negative correlation between the duration of tinnitus and the VOR gain values in both the HIMP and the SHIMP ( p &lt; .05). Conclusions: The findings indicate that the VOR and its suppression mechanism are affected among normal-hearing individuals with tinnitus. Reduced VOR gains and altered saccadic patterns on the HIMP and SHIMP suggest subtle peripheral vestibular involvement in these individuals. The results of the study highlight the potential utility of video head impulse test paradigms in identifying subclinical vestibular deficits in normal-hearing individuals with tinnitus.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study examined maturational differences in basic auditory processing between children and young adults using the Portable Automated Rapid Testing (PART) battery. A secondary aim was to assess whether auditory processing performance was associated with cognitive abilities across development. Method: Children aged 8–13 years ( n = 36) and young adults aged 18–25 years ( n = 37) completed a battery of PART subtests measuring temporal fine structure (TFS), spectrotemporal sensitivity (STS), and spatial release from masking (SRM). Participants also completed six subtests from the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognition Battery. Group differences in auditory and cognitive performance were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. Principal components analysis was used to derive a unified index of auditory proficiency, and correlations with cognitive measures were assessed. Results: Significant maturational differences were observed in TFS and SRM, with children showing elevated thresholds and reduced spatial unmasking compared to adults. No group differences were found in STS. An exploratory subgroup analysis in children (8–10 vs. 11–13 years) revealed significant differences in SRM and STS, suggesting continued development within the pediatric age range. The composite auditory index significantly differentiated children from adults but was largely uncorrelated with cognitive measures in either group. Conclusions: These findings suggest that core auditory processing abilities, particularly those related to fine temporal cues and spatial hearing, continue to mature into adolescence. Exploratory analyses further highlight developmental changes even within the 8–13 years age range. When assessed using basic auditory processing tasks such as those in the PART battery, auditory performance showed limited association with cognitive abilities. This has important clinical implications, as it supports the use of developmentally appropriate, low-burden tools such PART in pediatric auditory processing evaluations. Ongoing efforts to establish normative data across narrower age bands will further enhance its clinical utility. Supplemental Material: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.30266848",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Individual older adults with hearing loss often have unique communication needs that vary across different listening conditions. The current study examined whether user-directed fine-tuning of hearing aid programs specifically for different sound scenes would improve perceived speech quality. Method: Thirty older adult participants were recruited based on self-reported hearing challenges or pure-tone audiometry indicating a hearing loss. Participants self-tuned the hearing aid frequency-gain characteristics while listening to continuous speech embedded in background noise, presented as simulated real-world sound scenes. The self-tuning procedure was conducted in two sound scenes, “Noisy Indoor” and “Noisy Outdoor,” with an average speech level at 60 dB(A) and signal-to-noise ratios of +5 dB and +10 dB, respectively. Speech quality ratings were collected for each scene using an interface inspired by the Multiple Stimuli with Hidden Reference and Anchor method. In each sound scene, participants rated four programs: two self-tuned, one standard prescription based, and one poor-quality anchor. The order of presentation was randomized and blinded. Results: Results showed that participants rated their self-tuned programs tailored to specific scenes significantly higher compared to both the prescription-based program and their self-tuned program for the other scene. Conclusion: User-driven self-tuning procedures can be useful to capture scene-specific preferences for hearing aid settings and improve the perceived speech quality.

    "abstract": "Various auditory and language tasks are considered to reflect children's auditory processing abilities. It has been suggested that these measures may be assessing language, rather than auditory, processing. In addition, recent studies have suggested that tasks used in the assessment of auditory processing may, in fact, be assessing attention. Of the auditory paradigms, the most frequently used measure is the Staggered Spondaic Word test (SSW; Katz, 1962). This study investigated the correlation of impaired SSW performance with other auditory measures, cognitive ability, language functioning, and behavioral ratings specific to inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity in a group of 38 children who demonstrated impairment on the SSW. Results indicate that the SSW correlates most with measures of cognitive ability, expressive language, and those relating to auditory memory. As children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been found to demonstrate impaired performance on the SSW, the likelihood that children with ADHD would demonstrate impairment bilaterally as opposed to a single-ear effect was also investigated. Results did not support a consistent pattern of impaired SSW performance for children with ADHD, suggesting that CAPD and ADHD are, in fact, not the same entity.",

    "abstract": "Hearing loss classification scales are commonly used to explain audiometric findings to the parents of children with hearing loss. These scales, however, have little or no scientific basis. In this study, filtered auditory recordings were used to simulate three levels of childhood hearing loss, as defined by the commonly used terms—slight, mild, and moderate. Parents, after listening to each simulation, were asked to provide their impressions. Results demonstrated that: parents defined each simulated loss with terminology representing substantially greater magnitude than the commonly used terms; parents anticipated significantly greater difficulty ( p &lt; .05) for each of nine hearing-related tasks when hearing loss was defined by the simulations rather than the classification terms; and parents selected more aggressive management procedures in response to the simulations than to the classification terms. In an additional task, parents estimated degree of simulated hearing loss with percentage values, indicating about 40% greater hearing loss for the three levels of loss compared to values produced by the conventional American Academy of Otolaryngology-American Council of Otolaryngology (1979) percentage formula. The findings indicate that standard methods of classifying hearing loss in audiologic and medical clinics may undermine parents' understanding of their child's hearing loss, causing them to underestimate substantially the magnitude of the loss.",

    "abstract": "In health care, an increasing interest in accountability for outcomes, proof of quality care, and cost effectiveness is forcing many practitioners, including audiologists, in the direction of using outcomes analysis to provide proof of performance in their practices. Critical to the conduct of outcomes analysis are the selection of valid outcomes metrics and application of appropriate statistical processes. Modeling of clinical protocols is a useful exercise for developing outcomes data and data management standards. The authors describe the implications for wider use of outcomes modeling once the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) administrative simplification law is implemented. This legislation will set up a wholly new administrative data set that has strong potential to provide outcomes metrics to a variety of Audiology practices. The modeling exercise described here was originally intended to derive assessment outcomes for evaluating hearing conservation program effectiveness in military populations from an administrative database implemented within the Military Health System starting in 1997. The outcomes modelers, however, soon realized the broader applicability of modeling techniques for other special populations and Audiology practices, particularly with the oncoming startup of HIPAA legislative mandates. The modeling exercise demonstrates a process of structuring standard health-care codes to produce outcomes data for epidemiologic and cost analyses, thereby providing better information to guide health-care practices toward improving quality and cost effectiveness. This information in time series should also provide a record of continuous quality improvement. The authors present a general hearing surveillance protocol for evaluating occupational hearing loss. The protocol is used as a specific instance to demonstrate the shaping of an outcomes metrics model. This same process can be applied more generally when used to model outcomes data from other audiology practices. Implementation of the administrative data model described here began at more than 400 Department of Defense (DOD) medical treatment facilities worldwide as of October 1, 1999. The exercise of developing similar outcomes metrics for newborn hearing screening programs, school hearing conservation programs, and other clinical and rehabilitative audiology practices in the civilian sector remains to be done.",

Like the audiogram formed by the vibrotactile response region, these psychophysical tuning curves represent fundamental limits in audiometry since they are the worst possible thresholds expected, even if no other cells are functioning. These examples can be put to many uses, but the most important lesson of the hypothetical tuning curve audiogram is that whereas each cell gives rise to thresholds across many frequencies, it cannot be expected to transmit more than one cell’s worth of speech information. In the clinic, this means that even when many frequencies respond on the audiogram, there may be a much more restricted set of actual cells remaining in the cochlea, and only these remaining cells will respond, for example, to hearing aids.",

Depending on the ABR findings, additional test options included distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), high-frequency tympanometry, and/or otologic examination.In 88% of the 2-hr test sessions, at least 4 ABR threshold estimates were obtained (i.e., bilateral clicks and either a 500- or 1000-Hz tone burst and a 4000-Hz frequency tone burst for the better ear). The incidence of hearing loss was significantly different across nursery levels: 18% for Level I (well baby), 29% for Level II (special care), and 52% for Level III (neonatal intensive care unit). Hearing loss type was defined at the initial assessment for 35 of the 51 infants with bilateral hearing loss based on bone-conduction ABR, latency measures, DPOAEs, high-frequency tympanometry, and/or otologic examination.Our findings indicate that a 2-hr test appointment is appropriate for all nursery levels to diagnose severity and type of hearing loss in the majority of infants referred from UNHS.

Repeated measures analysis of variance and Bonferroni adjusted pairwise t tests were utilized to evaluate significant main effects and interactions between the 2 noise reduction techniques.ABRs recorded during the quiet behavioral condition resulted in minimal differences in wave V amplitude and noise reduction improvement, suggesting that the 2 techniques were equally effective under ideal recording situations. During the active behavioral condition, however, the techniques differed significantly in the ability to preserve the evoked potential and reduce noise. Consequently, strict artifact rejection levels resulted in an inherent underestimation of wave V amplitudes when compared with the Bayesian approach.Artifact rejection had a detrimental effect on waveform morphology of the ABR. This could lead to difficulty in ABR interpretation when patients are active and ultimately result in diagnostic errors.",

However, by the fourth training day, the mean GDTs of the 2 groups were similar, and both groups showed the same rate of improvement in the following sessions. Data of the controls confirmed that the better GDTs of the trained groups resulted from their training.

Method Twenty-six young normal-hearing adults participated in the study. Contralateral suppression of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) was measured for 3 levels of suppressor (40, 50, and 60 dB SPL). Speech identification score (SIS) was measured at 5 ipsilateral SNR conditions (quiet, 0, -5, -10, and -15 dB), with and without contralateral broadband noise at 3 levels (40, 50, and 60 dB SPL). Furthermore, SNR-50 was measured with and without the same 3 levels of contralateral broadband noise. Results The results showed that the suppression magnitude of TEOAE increased with an increase in suppressor level. However, neither SIS nor SNR-50 was influenced by the contralateral noise. In addition, SIS and SNR-50 did not show significant correlation with contralateral suppression of TEOAEs. This was true at all the SNRs and contralateral noise levels used in the study. Conclusions The findings suggest that the intensity of noise directly influences medial olivocochlear bundle-mediated efferent inhibition. However, the role of the medial olivocochlear bundle in regulating speech perception in noise needs to be revisited. Supplemental Material https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.9336353.",

Participants also completed tests of hearing acuity, vocabulary knowledge, nonverbal intelligence, processing speed, and working memory. Results Vocabulary knowledge and working memory demonstrated independent effects on word recognition accuracy when controlling for hearing acuity, nonverbal intelligence, and processing speed. These effects were strongest at the same moderate level of signal degradation. Although listener variables were statistically significant, their effects were subtle in comparison to the influence of word frequency and phonological content. These language-based factors had large effects on word recognition at all signal-to-noise ratios.

    "abstract": "Purpose The main purpose of the study is to explore the auditory selective attention abilities (using event-related potentials) and the neuronal oscillatory activity in the default mode network sites (using electroencephalogram [EEG]) in individuals with tinnitus. Method Auditory selective attention was measured using P300, and the resting state EEG was assessed using the default mode function analysis. Ten individuals with continuous and bothersome tinnitus along with 10 age- and gender-matched control participants underwent event-related potential testing and 5 min of EEG recording (at wakeful rest). Results Individuals with tinnitus were observed to have larger N1 and P3 amplitudes along with prolonged P3 latency. The default mode function analysis revealed no significant oscillatory differences between the groups. Conclusion The current study shows changes in both the early sensory and late cognitive components of auditory processing. The change in the P3 component is suggestive of selective auditory attention deficit, and the sensory component (N1) suggests an altered bottom-up processing in individuals with tinnitus.",

In each RCT, the effects of the online programs were compared with the effects measured in a control group.The results from the first RCT showed a significant increase in activity and participation for both groups with participants in the intervention group improving more than those in the control group. At the 6-month follow-up, after the study, the significant increase was maintained; however, amounts of increase in the two groups were no longer significantly different. The results from the second RCT showed significant increase in activity and participation for the intervention group, although the control group did not improve.The results from the RCTs provide evidence that the Internet can be used to deliver rehabilitation to hearing-aid users and that their problems are reduced by the intervention; however, the content of the online rehabilitation program requires further investigation.",

Method High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) data were measured retrospectively for 100 patients who had received a cochlear implant. In order to visualize the anatomy of the auditory canal, its length, radius, and the angle at which it runs were determined for the patients' right and left ears. The canal's volume was calculated, and a radius function was created. Results The determined length of the auditory canal averaged 23.6 mm for the right ear and 23.5 mm for the left ear. The calculated auditory canal volume ( V total ) was 0.7 ml for the right ear and 0.69 ml for the left ear. The auditory canal was found to be significantly longer in men than in women, and the volume greater. Conclusion The values obtained can be employed to develop a method that represents the shape of the auditory canal as accurately as possible to allow the best possible outcomes for hearing aid fitting.",

Method One hundred and twenty-four participants in Shi (2011) and an additional set of 145 participants were included (Groups 1 and 2, respectively) in this study. All listeners rated their proficiency in listening, speaking, and reading (English and first language) on an 11-point scale and listened to a list of words from the Northwestern University Auditory Tests No. 6 (Tillman &amp; Carhart, 1966) at 45 dB HL in quiet. Results English proficiency ratings by Group 2 yielded sensitivity/specificity values comparable to those of Group 1 (Shi, 2011) in predicting word recognition. A cutoff of 8 or 9 in minimum English proficiency rating across listening, speaking, and reading resulted in the best combination of prediction sensitivity/specificity. When relative proficiency was used, prediction of Group 1 performance significantly improved as compared to English proficiency. Improvement was slight for Group 2, mainly due to low specificity. Conclusion Self-rated English proficiency provides clinically acceptable sensitivity/specificity values as a predictor of bilinguals' English word recognition. Relative proficiency has the potential to further improve predictive power, but the size of improvement depends on the characteristics of the test population.",

Method Two pairs of hearing aids, 1 pair each from Siemens and Unitron, were programmed for 17 hearing impaired individuals after a hearing evaluation. Intelligibility was measured for each participant for sentences presented in quiet, with 2 types of transient noise, multitalker babble, and in a combination of each type of transient noise and multitalker babble. Each condition was tested with TNR activated and TNR deactivated in a counterbalanced, single-blinded format. Subjective ratings of overall speech understanding, comfort, and sound quality were obtained for each condition. Results A significant improvement in speech intelligibility was measured with the TNR activated when speech was presented in multitalker babble, in the presence of chair clang transient noises, and when combining these noises. Activation of the TNR algorithm did not result in significant improvements for any of the subjective ratings. Conclusions While improvements were limited to certain conditions, specifically those with the chair clang transient and/or multitalker babble, TNR appears to offer an incremental step in improving the listening experience for hearing aid users.",

This study aimed to assess the development of binaural integration ability using a newly developed dichotic digit test in French.Twenty-eight children with normal hearing sensitivity and binaural integration capacity, assessed with a dichotic listening word test, participated in the study. The children were divided into 3 groups: nine 6-year-olds, nine 9-year-olds, and ten 12-year-olds. They completed 4 subtests with earphones at normal conversational level. Three subtests consisted of 1, 2, and 3 different digit pairs, respectively, between 1 and 9 that were sent dichotically to the ears. The fourth subtest consisted of 4 digits, but only the 2 middle digits were sent dichotically.Performance improved significantly as a function of age and decreased with increasing number of digits to be repeated. All groups performed significantly better on digits presented in the right ear than the left ear, and on the digit rather than the word test.The new French dichotic digit test would be useful in assessing binaural integration in children. The 4 subtests make it suitable for inclusion in a test battery to assess central auditory processing in children and are an alternative, especially the fourth subtest, to the French version of the Staggered Spondaic Word Test (Rudmin & Normandin, 1983).",

Item response theory, which provides a methodology for assessing patient-reported outcomes, is examined here to demonstrate its usefulness in hearing screens and interventions. Method The graded response model is applied to a scale of 11 items assessing perceived hearing functioning and 10 items assessing experienced social limitations completed by a sample of 212 persons age 55+ years. Fixed and variable slope models are compared. Discrimination and threshold parameters are estimated and information functions evaluated. Results Variable slope models for both scales provided the best fit. The estimated discrimination parameters for all items except for one in each scale were good if not excellent (1.5–3.4). Threshold values varied, demonstrating the complementary and supplementary value of items within a scale. The information provided by each item varies relative to trait values so that each scale of items provides information over a wider range of trait values. Conclusion Item response theory methodology facilitates the comparison of items relative to their discriminative ability and information provided and thus provides a basis for the selection of items for application in a screening setting.",

A modified survey, which included questions about awareness of the profession of audiology as well as podiatry and optometry, was distributed in 2012.Survey data suggest that, overall, students were more accurate in describing the profession of optometry compared to audiology, but no difference existed between their awareness of podiatry and audiology. However, students with self-reported awareness of the three professions were more accurate in describing the professions of podiatry and optometry as compared to audiology.Results of this distribution suggest an upward trend in audiology awareness among students. However, the awareness of audiology as a potential career path is low relative to that of the professions of optometry and podiatry for those with self-reported knowledge.

    "abstract": "The Spatial Hearing Questionnaire (SHQ) was developed to address how to measure spatial-hearing ability in complex listening situations (Tyler, Perreau, & Ji, 2009). It has been translated and validated into various languages, including Chinese, Dutch, French, and Persian. Although the SHQ contains only 24 items, it could be time-consuming in a busy clinic to administer. The purposes of this study were to develop and validate a shortened version of the SHQ (SHQ-S) and to compare self-perceived spatial-hearing ability across adults with normal hearing (NH), hearing loss (HL), and cochlear implants (CIs).This was a retrospective study. The full version of the SHQ was administered to measure self-perceived spatial-hearing ability for 51 adults with NH at Augustana College, 47 adults with essentially mild to moderately severe sensorineural HL at Illinois State University, and 72 adult CI users at the University of Iowa. Exploratory factor analysis was performed for the full version for the data collected from adults with NH and HL. Appropriate items were chosen to develop the SHQ-S from the results of the exploratory factor analysis. Confirmatory factor analysis was then applied to test the factor structure of the SHQ-S for all participants. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare the self-perceived spatial-hearing performance scores between the 3 groups.The exploratory factor analysis revealed scores loaded on 2 factors. Six items from the full version were chosen accordingly. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis indicated that that a shortened version of 6 items is sufficient to measure spatial-hearing ability. The internal consistency reliability of the SHQ-S was high. The main effect of the one-way analysis of variance was significant for the groups, F(2, 167) = 36.0, p < .0001. The comparisons with the Tukey adjustment indicated that the NH group reported significantly better spatial-hearing ability than either the HL or the CI group (both adjusted p values < .05). There was no significant difference between the participants with HL and CI users.The psychometric characteristics of the 6-item SHQ-S were similar to those of the full version of the SHQ. We conclude that the SHQ-S is a reliable and valid tool for measuring spatial-hearing ability and screening for spatial-hearing difficulties. Participants with NH reported better spatial-hearing ability than those with HL or with CIs, whereas the CI users and participants with HL perceived similar spatial-hearing ability in the present study.",

Participants rated the appeal and difficulty of each tone type on a 1-5 scale and selected a preferred type.For all groups, thresholds were lower for warble than for pulsed and steady tones, with the largest effects above 4 kHz. Appeal ratings did not differ across tone type, but the steady tone was rated as more difficult than the warble and pulsed tones. Participants generally preferred pulsed and warble tones.Pulsed tones provide advantages over steady and warble tones for patients regardless of hearing or tinnitus status.

Nonetheless, an individual's susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss can be estimated by monitoring changes in hearing status in relation to the level of ambient noise exposure. The purpose of this study was to validate an approach that could improve workplace hearing conservation practices. The approach was developed using a portable and robust system designed for noisy environments and consisted of taking continuous measurements with high temporal resolution of the health status of the inner ear using otoacoustic emissions (OAEs).A pilot study was conducted in a laboratory, exposing human subjects to industrial noise recordings at realistic levels. In parallel, OAEs were measured periodically using the designed OAE system as well as with a commercially available OAE system, used as a reference.Variations in OAE levels were analyzed and discussed along with the limitations of the reference and designed systems.This study demonstrates that the monitoring of an individual's OAEs could be useful in monitoring temporary changes in hearing status induced by exposure to ambient noise and could be considered as a new tool for effective hearing conservation programs in the workplace.",

Method A total of 171 ears from 171 Caucasian children and 87 ears from 87 Aboriginal children who passed a test battery consisting of 226-Hz tympanometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions, and pure tone audiometry were included in the study. WAI measures were obtained under pressurized conditions using wideband tympanometry. Data for WBA0, WBATPP, YM, and YA were averaged in one-third octave frequencies from 0.25 to 8 kHz. Results There was no significant ear effect on all of the 7 measures for both groups of children. Similarly, there was no significant gender effect on all measures except for WBATPP in Aboriginal children. Aboriginal boys had significantly higher WBATPP than girls at 1.5 and 2 kHz. A significant effect of ethnicity was also noted for WBATPP at 3, 4, and 8 kHz, with Caucasian children demonstrating higher WBATPP than Aboriginal children. However, the effect size and observed power of the analyses were small for both effects. Conclusion This study developed normative data for 7 WAI measures, namely, WBA0, WBATPP, TPP, Veq, RF, YM, and YA, for Caucasian and Aboriginal children. In view of the high similarity of the normative data between Caucasian and Aboriginal children, it was concluded that separate ethnic-specific norms are not required for diagnostic purposes.",

Design The Spanish Pediatric Speech Recognition Threshold (SPSRT) test was developed and validated in this study. Test construction steps included (a) stimulus selection, (b) assessment of familiarity, (c) digital recording, (d) creation of pictures that accurately depicted the target word from the stimulus set, and (e) validation of the test and recordings. SRTs were obtained from 24 Spanish-speaking children whose 1st language was Spanish. Results Normative data are presented that validate the SPSRT and establish the baseline relationship between the pure-tone average and the SRT obtained with the SPSRT. Results indicated that the SPSRT obtained using this test should be within 2–12 dB of an individual's pure-tone average for Spanish-speaking children with normal hearing and minimal hearing loss. Conclusions The SPSRT was developed and validated as a picture-pointing Spanish SRT test to be used with Spanish-speaking children. The 2-channel recording contains an English translation track, making this test easy to administer and interpret for clinicians without knowledge of Spanish.",

One example is the Tinnitus E-Programme, which, although freely available online, has not yet been formally evaluated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate past, current, and new users' reactions and interactions with the Tinnitus E-Programme. Method Study 1 used an online survey to gather past and current users' reactions to, and interactions with, the intervention (n = 27). Study 2 used interviews and a relaxation log to assess how new users implemented the skills they learned into their everyday lives (n = 13). Results Generally, users expressed positive views on the intervention content and design features. Users particularly valued the education about tinnitus and its management and the relaxation skills training, and use of these components was high. In contrast, user reactions to self-monitoring tools, an online support forum, and therapist support were mixed, and use was lower. Implementation was limited by instances of poor usability and accessibility, user engagement, and adherence to relaxation goals. Users' perceptions of the intervention's credibility and relevance and beliefs regarding a negative impact on their tinnitus influenced engagement. Users in both studies identified several benefits gained, including functional and emotional management, self-efficacy for managing and coping with tinnitus, understanding tinnitus and its management, social support, and acceptance of tinnitus. Conclusion Findings suggest that the intervention was acceptable to its target group but also highlighted some areas for improvement. These findings will be used to inform further optimization work.",

Method The study used cross-sectional analysis of data generated from Twitter data. Twitter content, language, reach, users, accounts, temporal trends, and social networks were examined. Results Around 70,000 tweets were identified and analyzed from May to October 2018. Of the 100 most active Twitter accounts, organizations owned 52%, individuals owned 44%, and 4% of the accounts were unknown. Commercial/for-profit and nonprofit organizations were the most common organization account owners (i.e., 26% and 16%, respectively). Seven unique tweets were identified with a reach of over 400 Twitter users. The greatest reach exceeded 2,000 users. Temporal analysis identified retweet outliers (&gt; 200 retweets per hour) that corresponded to a widely publicized event involving the response of a Twitter user to another user's joke. Content analysis indicated that Twitter is a platform that primarily functions to advocate, share personal experiences, or share information about management of tinnitus rather than to provide social support and build relationships. Conclusions Twitter accounts owned by organizations outnumbered individual accounts, and commercial/for-profit user accounts were the most frequently active organization account type. Analyses of social media use can be helpful in discovering issues of interest to the tinnitus community as well as determining which users and organizations are dominating social network conversations.",

This study investigated this relationship by determining how well DPOAE levels can predict the audiogram among individuals with clinically normal hearing. Additionally, the impacts of age, noise exposure, and the perception of tinnitus on the ability of DPOAE levels to predict the audiogram were evaluated.

The interpretation of the audiogram, namely, where normal hearing ends and hearing loss begins, impacts all areas of audiology: research, clinical, and medicolegal. Where to define normal hearing was the subject of great debate during the early decades of audiology. Revisiting this history reveals how the 25-dB HL cutoff came to be; a decision concerned more with the legal consequences than the scientific persuasiveness of the definition of normal hearing. Since the 1970s, the 25-dB HL cutoff has defined normal-hearing control groups in research and informed treatment recommendations in the clinic. Conclusions Today, in 2020, closer evaluation of this so-called normal-hearing group reveals a variety of deficits not captured by the audiogram. The history of how normal hearing came to be defined in conjunction with this growing body of research serves as a good reminder to look beyond the audiogram. This is especially important as the field of audiology looks ahead toward improved diagnostics, earlier detection, and new technologies/treatments.",

Method Nine thousand six hundred twenty-two consumer reviews of hearing health care services, including an open-ended question (i.e., free text response to the prompt “share details of your own experience at this place”) and an overall rating (on a 5-point scale ranging from “very good” to “very poor”) were extracted from Google.com from 40 different cities across the United States. In addition, some metadata about the cities (i.e., region, population size, median age, percentage of older adults) were also recorded. Text responses were analyzed using the automated Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software for selected language dimensions. The language dimensions of online hearing health care reviews were descriptively compared with language dimensions observed in the natural language of typical bloggers. Language dimensions from free text responses were correlated with quantitative overall experience ratings. Results Automated linguistic analysis showed that consumer reviews on hearing health care services had higher social processes, positive emotions, hearing, health, money, and work, and lower negative emotions and time-awareness when compared to typical bloggers. Examining the association between overall experience rating and the language dimensions revealed two broad findings. First, higher engagement of consumers in terms of social processes, positive emotions, hearing, and work dimensions was related to higher experience ratings. Second, higher engagement of consumers in terms of negative emotions, time awareness, and money was related to lower experience ratings. Conclusions Online reviews contain information about various dimensions (i.e., social and emotional dimensions as well as personal concerns) that have bearing toward the way in that they rate their health care experiences. Automated linguistic analysis of consumer reviews appears helpful in identifying gaps in service delivery that may influence consumer experience.",

Method Two types of noise served as the masker, namely, six-talker babble and babble-modulated noise, at two signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of −4 and −8 dB. Fourteen listeners from both age groups were recruited, and three sets of data analyses were conducted: the identification of vowel plus tone, the identification of vowel, and the identification of tone. Results Younger listeners outperformed older listeners in all listening conditions, whereas the younger–older listener difference became greater in noise than in quiet, indicating a more detrimental effect of noise for older listeners than for younger listeners. In addition, vowel identification showed slightly better scores than tone identification in noise, suggesting that noise appeared to affect tone perception more negatively than vowel perception in Mandarin Chinese. At −4 dB SNR, there was a significantly greater amount of informational masking (IM) and a greater amount of energetic masking (EM) for older listeners than for younger listeners. At −8 dB SNR, there was a greater amount of EM for older listeners than for younger listeners but with no group difference in the amount of IM. Conclusion These results suggest that older listeners received a more negative impact of noise for Mandarin Chinese phonemic and tone recognition and had a larger amount of IM or EM from competing speech noise than younger listeners, depending on the SNR.",

Forty-four children had mild to moderately severe hearing loss in at least one ear.

Method Participants were patients (n = 46, mean age 64.7 years; range: 30-78 years) receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy at the Department of Veterans Affairs Portland Health Care System. A randomized controlled trial contrasted A-OM and UC at up to three program evaluations (PEs) conducted by the study audiologist who was blinded to arm through PE1. PE1 occurred before randomization or oncology treatment; PE2 and PE3 occurred during and/or after treatment at 35 and 365 days postrandomization. The A-OM group (n = 24) used Oto-ID to screen their hearing before each cisplatin dose. Oto-ID results were sent to the study audiologist for interpretation, follow-up, and care coordination. The UC group (n = 22) received a consult for OM services through the audiology clinic. Outcomes included hearing shift near each patient's high-frequency hearing limit, revised hearing-handicap inventory score, and survival time from the start of treatment. Adherence to OM protocols, patients' use of aural rehabilitation services, and oncologists' treatment decisions were also examined. Results Ototoxicity was identified at a high overall rate (46% and 76% at 35 and 365 days, respectively, postrandomization). Adherence to monitoring prior to each cisplatin dose was 83.3% for those randomized to A-OM compared with 4.5% for UC. Randomization to A-OM was not associated with reduced ototoxic hearing shifts or self-reported hearing handicap relative to UC; neither did it compromise participants' survival. Half of participants in each arm accessed aural rehabilitation services. One in each arm had a documented ototoxicity-related cisplatin dose reduction. Conclusions Auditory impairment was an actionable concern for the participants and their oncology providers. A dedicated surveillance program using the Oto-ID's automated protocols improved adherence to OM recommendations over a traditional UC service delivery model.

First, participants discussed the role of audiology clinic staff in detecting psychological difficulties in adults with hearing loss, including current practices and needs for improving practices. Second, participants discussed the appropriateness, acceptability, and usability of nine standardized mental health screening tools commonly used in wider health care settings.Audiology clinic staff described their role in being aware of, and detecting, psychological difficulties, as well as their part in promoting an understanding of the link between hearing loss and mental health. Participants described the need to provide support following detection, and highlighted barriers to fulfilling these roles. The use of mental health screening tools was considered to be client and context specific.

Hearing sensitivity was objectively measured using a modified Hughson Westlake procedure.Among the 1,482 participants, 152 died during the follow-up period (10.26%, unweighted); the unweighted median follow-up period was 89 months (interquartile range = 74-98 months). For those with normal hearing and after adjustments, for every 60-min increase in physical activity, adults had a 19% (HR [Hazard Ratio] = 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.48-1.35]; p = .40) reduced risk of all-cause mortality; however, this association was not statistically significant. In a similar manner, physical activity was not associated with all-cause mortality among those with mild hearing loss (HR = 0.76; 95% CI [0.51-1.13]; p = .17). However, after adjustments, and for every 60-min increase in physical activity for those with moderate or greater hearing loss, there was a 20% (HR = 0.20; 95% CI [0.67-0.95]; p = .01) reduced risk of all-cause mortality.Physical activity may help to prolong survival among those with greater hearing impairment.",

Methodological issues in the design of online data collection, and advantages and disadvantages of different data collection methods are discussed. Method A survey was compiled that included 9 full or partial clinical questionnaires designed to measure different components relevant to tinnitus distress. It was completed once by 342 members of the public with tinnitus. Respondents could choose whether to complete the survey online or on paper . Results Ninety-five percent of participants chose to complete the survey online. The advantages of an online self-administered questionnaire include low numbers of unanswered questions, convenience (particularly in a longer survey such as this), a fast return rate, and reduced expense. Age emerged as an important variable, with those opting to complete the paper-based version of the survey being older. Conclusions Online data collection has several advantages to both participants and researchers. However, cross-sectional studies such as that presented here should also offer paper questionnaires to avoid excluding certain subgroups of the population. Ethics and reporting guidelines for Internet-delivered questionnaire studies are available. These can usefully inform study design and guide high-quality reporting.",

Specifically, it proposes to join forces toward interoperability and standardization of Internet and audiology. Method A summary of why such a collaborative effort is required is provided from historical and scientific perspectives. A roadmap toward interoperability and standardization is proposed. Results Information and communication technologies improve the flow of health care data and pave the way to better health care. However, hearing-related products, features, and services are notoriously heterogeneous and incompatible with other health care systems (no interoperability). Standardization is the process of developing and implementing technical standards (e.g., Noah hearing database). All parties involved in interoperability and standardization realize mutual gains by making mutually consistent decisions. De jure (officially endorsed) standards can be developed in collaboration with large national health care systems as well as spokespeople for hearing care professionals and hearing device users. The roadmap covers mutual collaboration; data privacy, security, and ownership; compliance with current regulations; scalability and modularity; and the scope of interoperability and standards. Conclusions We propose to join forces to pave the way to the interoperable Internet and audiology products, features, and services that the world needs.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential contribution of limited English proficiency on daily hearing aid wear time for children with hearing loss. Method: A retrospective chart review was completed to evaluate hearing aid wear time based on data logging information available at the time of a follow-up visit following an initial hearing aid fitting. Children were included in the study if they had permanent bilateral hearing loss and were less than 60 months of age at the time of their first follow-up visit. Wear time was compared between children who attended an interpreter-mediated appointment and those who did not have an interpreter present. The presence of an interpreter at the appointment was the study indicator that the family had limited English proficiency. Results: Children from families with limited English proficiency exhibited significantly shorter daily wear time ( M = 1.3 hr) than their peers whose families were English-proficient speakers, thus, having a shared language with their audiologists ( M = 5.2 hr). Conclusions: Results of this study suggest that family–clinician language discordance might put children at greater risk of shorter hearing aid wear time than children whose caregivers share a common language with their child's audiologist. There can be many linguistic, cultural, and educational factors that contribute to hearing aid wear time in children whose families have limited English proficiency as well as different approaches to improving that wear time. Efforts should ensure that hearing and hearing aid–related information is accessible to all families, especially those with clinician–family language discordance. Such efforts can include, among others, training that improves clinicians' cultural and linguistic responsiveness to the diverse families they serve.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: So far, there have been no in-depth analyses of the connection between tinnitus sensation–level loudness and sleep quality. Accordingly, the present study was formulated as a mediation analysis focused on exploring this relationship. Method: Overall, 1,255 adults with consecutive subjective tinnitus who had sought outpatient treatment were enrolled in the present study. Results: Direct effects of tinnitus sensation–level loudness on sleep quality were not statistically significant (95% confidence intervals [CI] include zero), as measured by the point estimate, −0.016. However, the 95% CI for indirect effects did not include zero when assessing the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) scores, the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) scores, the visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, and self-reported tinnitus annoyance. Conclusions: These results suggest that tinnitus sensation–level loudness does not directly have an effect on sleep quality. However, it indirectly impacts sleep quality, mediated by SAS scores, SDS scores, the impact of tinnitus on life measured using the VAS, and self-reported tinnitus annoyance. As such, alleviating anxiety and depression in patients with tinnitus may result in reductions in their insomnia even if there is no reduction in tinnitus loudness. Importantly, otolaryngologists and other clinicians treating tinnitus should refer patients with tinnitus suffering from insomnia with comorbid depression or anxiety for appropriate psychological and/or psychiatric treatment.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The aim of the study was to evaluate whether behavioral speech-in-noise (SiN) benefits of hearing aid directivity based on multistream architecture (MSA) might result in reduced electroencephalographic activity in the alpha-band, as is often associated with task difficulty. Method: A single-blind within-subject design was used in this study. Thirteen older adults ( M age = 73.5 years, range: 62–82 years, six women) with sensorineural hearing loss participated in the study. Participants wearing study hearing aids first performed an adaptive sentence-level SiN test in an MSA-enabled condition (i.e., MSA-ON) to determine the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) corresponding to speech reception thresholds for 50% correct performance (i.e., SRT-50s). Participants were then tested at their individualized SNRs with target sentences alternating on each trial between two loudspeakers positioned in the front at 0° and −30° azimuth, such as to simulate turn-taking between two talkers seated across from the listener. Electroencephalographic activity was recorded as participants performed this SiN test in two hearing aid conditions: MSA-OFF and MSA-ON. Results: Neural oscillations in the alpha-band were significantly reduced over centroparietal electrode sites when listeners performed SiN testing in MSA-ON versus MSA-OFF conditions. Alpha-band power was also observed to increase significantly over the course of 60 test trials, possibly indicative of listener fatigue. Reductions in alpha-band power were not significantly related to likewise improvements in SiN performance. Conclusions: Hearing aid directivity based on the MSA algorithm resulted in significantly lower neural activity associated with listening task difficulty in a simulated multitalker situation. Although these results align with the behavioral SiN improvements associated with MSA, magnitudes of change in alpha-band power did not correlate with the degree of behavioral benefit at the level of individual listeners. Measuring neural oscillations in the alpha-band might be useful for evaluating and gaining greater insight into the impact of hearing aid processing on listening effort in challenging acoustic environments.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Children and young adults diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often report and exhibit significant auditory processing difficulties, particularly in background noise. This study extends our previous work by examining the potential benefits of a 12-week auditory processing training (APT) program designed to address the auditory processing difficulties in individuals with ASD via auditory training and the use of remote-microphone technology. Effect sizes of training benefits also were calculated, and principal component analysis (PCA) was used to consolidate performance across various tests into fewer meaningful constructs related to auditory processing in this population. Method: Twenty-eight children and young adults with ASD participated in a 12-week APT program that included one-on-one speech-in-noise training, computerized dichotic training, and use of remote-microphone technology at home and at school. Before and after training, each participant completed tests of speech recognition in noise, spatial processing, binaural integration, and general auditory processing skills. Results: Significant performance improvements and medium-to-large effect sizes were found across most test measures after the participants completed the APT program and when using the remote-microphone system. PCA identified strong relationships among all test measures as well as documented the relationships between behavioral performance, training duration, and training improvements. Conclusions: The APT program significantly improved spatial processing, binaural integration, phonological processing, auditory memory, auditory cohesion, and speech recognition in noise in individuals with ASD when the remote-microphone system was used. PCA analysis of pre- and posttraining data showed a strong relationship among all test measures, suggesting an abbreviated auditory processing test battery may be feasible for individuals with ASD. Training duration (minutes) and training improvements were associated with performance outcomes measured by the test battery.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability among adults in the United States. There is evidence to suggest the peripheral vestibular system is vulnerable to damage in individuals with TBI. However, there are limited prospective studies that describe the type and frequency of vestibular impairment in individuals with chronic moderate–severe TBI (&gt; 6 months postinjury). Method: Cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) and video head impulse test (vHIT) were used to assess the function of otolith organ and horizontal semicircular canal (hSCC) pathways in adults with chronic moderate–severe TBI and in noninjured comparison (NC) participants. Self-report questionnaires were administered to participants with TBI to determine prevalence of vestibular symptoms and quality of life associated with those symptoms. Results: Chronic moderate–severe TBI was associated with a greater degree of impairment in otolith organ, rather than hSCC, pathways. About 63% of participants with TBI had abnormal VEMP responses, compared to only ~10% with abnormal vHIT responses. The NC group had significantly less abnormal VEMP responses (~7%), while none of the NC participants had abnormal vHIT responses. As many as 80% of participants with TBI reported vestibular symptoms, and up to 36% reported that these symptoms negatively affected their quality of life. Conclusions: Adults with TBI reported vestibular symptoms and decreased quality of life related to those symptoms and had objective evidence of peripheral vestibular impairment. Vestibular testing for adults with chronic TBI who report persistent dizziness and imbalance may serve as a guide for treatment and rehabilitation in these individuals.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study is to describe the effects of diabetes mellitus (DM) on vestibular and balance system functions in humans. Because Type 2 diabetes (T2D) represents the majority of individuals affected by this condition, this subgroup is the main focus of this tutorial. Method: Evidence of dysfunction is based on epidemiological, anatomical, physiological, neuroimaging, and clinical findings. Preventative measures, therapeutic interventions, and other mitigating factors are also given consideration. Results: Experimental and clinical findings support the notion that T2D damages vestibular and balance systems to the extent that these effects are more prevalent in patients with higher blood glucose levels and longer duration of the disease. Evidence indicates that T2D increases the occurrence and re-occurrence rates of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, particularly when it occurs in conjunction with hypertension, osteoarthritis, and otologic disorders like Ménière's disease. Type 2 diabetes also impairs vestibular compensation, which is exacerbated by disease duration. Investigational and clinical studies suggest that galvanic stimulation of the vestibular system can be effective in reducing blood glucose levels and improving rehabilitation outcomes. Conclusion: Because DM is a chronic metabolic condition affecting cochlear, vestibular, and balance system functions, lowering blood glucose levels through diet, pharmacological interventions, and exercise can be effective in mitigating dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "It has been argued that there is a need to adopt a uniform core set of dependent measures and test conditions for use in manufacturer-sponsored clinical trials to substantiate hearing device user-benefit claims in FDA applications. A framework for developing a model protocol was presented, and a core set of dependent measures and test conditions was suggested that may serve as a springboard for discussion. Given the state of the art, designing a protocol to evaluate hearing aid benefit requires that certain assumptions and compromises be made in defining this benefit and selecting test materials. The limitations of our knowledge and testing methods make it inevitable that the results of our efforts will not be perfect. The problems created by limited knowledge and methodology certainly are not unique to our discipline or to this endeavor. Although perfect prediction of everyday performance should be our goal, currently it cannot be our expectation. However, this should not deter us from our best attempt to reach our goal. The clinical-trials protocol described in this paper has been used in two manufacturer-sponsored clinical trials conducted at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Although there has been general satisfaction with this protocol on the part of both the manufacturer and the researchers who have conducted these trials, the potential to improve this protocol certainly exists. The laboratory measures included in the Walter Reed protocol depend on traditional \"objective\" measures of speech recognition. There are other potentially useful methodologies (e.g., subjective ratings of intelligibility, paired-comparison techniques), and other dimensions of user performance (e.g., sound quality, loudness growth) that are ignored. Although the involvement of hearing researchers in manufacturer-sponsored clinical trials to substantiate user-benefit claims is relatively new, valuable experience has been gained in several clinical research laboratories. A collective effort on the part of manufacturers, researchers involved in this research activity, and government regulators, could lead to a model protocol that would benefit both hearing-impaired consumers and hearing instrument manufacturers.",

    "abstract": "Although the incidence of medical and neurological problems resulting from congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is relatively low, the widespread and indiscriminate nature of this infection and the severity of these conditions when they do occur are such that it warrants the close attention of medical specialists, audiologists, and educators. The identification of congenital CMV is especially difficult because of its largely nonsymptomatic character, and because conditions associated with it, including hearing impairment, can be either progressive in nature or occur only later in life. Data reviewed in this study resemble those reported for children with impaired hearing from the 1964-65 maternal rubella epidemic: hearing loss in the severe to profound range, often accompanied by serious additional disabilities, especially mental retardation and cerebral palsy. Depressed achievement test results of children with CMV-induced hearing loss are further indications of the serious nature of this disease.The presence of any symptoms of CMV infection in infants or of risk factors associated with it-e.g., purplish skin rash, severe asphyxia, jaundice, low birth weight, swollen lymph glands, and other mononucleosis-like symptoms-signals the need for immediate testing, including audiological evaluation, and, if results are positive, the initiation of early medical and educational intervention.",

    "abstract": "Visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA) is a test procedure routinely used to evaluate hearing in infants and young children (6 months to 2 years). Most research and current clinical practice uses flashing lights and/or animated toys to provide reinforcement to a child during VRA. New technology capable of generating a moving video image is now available for providing visual reinforcement to infants during VRA testing. It is reasonable to expect that video images, with presumed greater novelty and complexity, would be more interesting and rewarding to children than conventional, animated mechanical toy reinforcers. On the other hand, in today’s society, children are frequently exposed to video images in the home and elsewhere. Therefore, three-dimensional animated toys may present with greater novelty than video images. The purpose of this study was to compare auditory localization behavior, as defined by the number of head turn responses until habituation, during VRA with 2-year-old children using two types of reinforcers: (a) moving images generated by a digital video disc player/monitor and (b) a conventional, animated mechanical toy. Twenty children were selected randomly from a total group of 40 and tested using conventional reinforcement. The remaining 20 children were tested using video reinforcement. The average number of head turn responses prior to habituation was approximately 15 for the video-reinforced group and approximately 11 for the conventional toy-reinforced group, suggesting that during VRA a video image may be more reinforcing than a conventional animated toy.",

Twenty-two newborns were seen once a month during their first year of life for the purpose of obtaining RECD measurements. Two methods for obtaining the RECD were examined: the commonly used constant insertion depth method and the acoustic method. Differences between the results of the two methods were examined as well as test-retest reliability for each. Findings suggest that no compelling evidence exists to support the use of one of these methods over the other. Use of either method resulted in good test-retest reliability in the midfrequency range of the RECD, with poorer reliability on both ends of the frequency spectrum. Test-retest reliability decreased with increasing age for both methods. In addition, reliability of between-ear RECD values was examined. Between-ear measurements were most reliable in the midfrequency range, and reliability decreased slightly with increasing age.",

Although rapidly presented stimuli appear louder as the rate is increased, it is inappropriate to compensate for this when calibrating the stimulus level of ABR systems.Users of ABR systems should, if possible, use the stimulus reference levels now available in an international standard rather than establish local values. No adjustment of level should be made to account for different stimulus repetition rates.

Pediatricians need current, accurate knowledge about diagnostics and treatments including cochlear implants (CIs). This study assessed pediatricians’ knowledge about, experience with, and comfort levels for CIs in children. Method Questionnaires were mailed to a total of 220 pediatricians in 9 cities in Alabama. Results Nine questionnaires were undeliverable; of the remaining 211 surveys, 29 were returned (for a response rate of 13.7%), and 26 of those were usable. The results were consistent with other studies. All respondents focused on pediatrics; most were medical homes experienced with children having sensorineural hearing loss. Less than half had counseled families about CIs but had patients using them. Over half had not recommended CIs in 5 years. Several were unsure about current EHDIP goals and CIs in children. Over half were completely uncomfortable determining children’s CI candidacy but were comfortable referring them to specialists. About a third were completely uncomfortable discussing CIs with and counseling families about them; most were comfortable with CIs being used in children over other habilitative options. Conclusions These pediatricians demonstrated deficits in current, accurate knowledge about EHDIPs and CIs in children. Audiologists should help them obtain needed information.",

Results Pass/fail results showed that most individuals failed at 30 dB HL, followed by DPOAEs, the 40-dB HL protocols, the HHIE–S alone, and the combined pure-tone/HHIE–S protocol. All screening results were associated except the HHIE–S and 30 dB HL and the HHIE–S and DPOAEs. A McNemar analysis revealed that the differences between the correlated pass/fail results were significant except for the HHIE–S and 40 dB at 1 and 2 kHz.

The importance of hearing aid management skills and knowledge is evidenced by their association with hearing aid outcomes. However, the nature of this association and the influence of participant factors on this association are unknown. Accordingly, the aims of the current study were to (a) investigate participant factors that influence hearing aid management skills and knowledge and (b) investigate the impact of hearing aid management skills and knowledge on hearing aid outcomes.Factors associated with hearing aid management skills and knowledge were investigated through an e-mail- and paper-based self-report survey, including the Hearing Aid Skills and Knowledge Inventory (Bennett, Meyer, Eikelboom, & Atlas, 2018b) and the International Outcomes Inventory for Hearing Aids (Cox & Alexander, 2002). The study sample included 518 adult hearing aid owners, ranging in age from 18 to 97 years (M = 71 years, SD = 14 years), 61% male and 39% female, recruited from seven hearing clinics across Australia.Participant factors found to be associated with hearing aid skills and knowledge included participants' age, gender, style of hearing aid, age of current hearing aid, and total years of hearing aid ownership. Higher levels of hearing aid management skills and knowledge were found to be associated with better hearing aid outcomes, specifically higher self-reported satisfaction with hearing aids, perceived benefit from hearing aids, and overall outcome of the hearing aid fitting as evaluated by the International Outcomes Inventory for Hearing Aids.Hearing aid management difficulties were greatest for older people, women, and owners of behind-the-ear style of hearing aids, suggesting that clinicians need to be cognizant of the additional needs for these three groups. The positive association between hearing aid outcomes and hearing aid skills and knowledge emphasizes the importance of education and training on hearing aid management for successful aural rehabilitation.",

Method DPOAEs were measured twice in both ears in 5 groups of participants: young adults with normal hearing, middle-age adults with normal hearing, adults with high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, age-matched adults with similar hearing loss and tinnitus, and adults with normal hearing and chronic tinnitus. Results Multivariate analysis revealed a main effect of hearing loss and age, but no effect of tinnitus, across all 5 groups. Separate tests revealed significant effects of age and tinnitus in the normal-hearing groups and hearing loss in adults with or without tinnitus, but no effect of tinnitus in those with hearing loss. Conclusion DPOAE levels in the group of adults with hearing loss and tinnitus were diminished, but those in the group with normal hearing and tinnitus were enhanced, relative to DPOAE levels in the controls. Outer hair cell function, as indexed by DPOAEs, exhibits a complex association with tinnitus, and this has implications in the use of DPOAEs as a tool both for testing for tinnitus presence and for creating a model of neural mechanisms underlying tinnitus.",

The program works interactively, utilizes collaboration with significant others, and enhances positive thinking. Participants took part in an Internet-based self-help program. Data were collected interactively using open-ended and structured questionnaires on various disease-specific and general health aspects. The pilot outcome of 41 patients with MD was evaluated. Results The analysis of the pilot data showed statistically significant improvement in their general health-related quality of life ( p &lt; .001). Also, the outcome of the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (Cann et al., 2010) showed small to moderate change as a result of the intervention.

BCI users were also tested at +8- and +4-dB SNR. A 3-word phrase was presented at 70 dB SPL from 9 simulated locations in the frontal horizontal plane (±90°), with the noise source at 0°.BCIs users had significantly poorer localization than listeners with NH in all conditions. BCI users' performance started to decrease at a higher SNR (+4 dB) and shorter RT60 (0.2 s) than listeners with NH (-4 dB and 0.6 s). The combination of noise and reverberation began to degrade localization of BCI users at a higher SNR and a shorter RT60 than listeners with NH.The clear effect of noise and reverberation on the performance of BCI users provides information that should be useful for refining cochlear implant processing strategies and developing cochlear implant rehabilitation plans to optimize binaural benefit for BCI users in everyday listening situations.",

The parameters of interest included unilateral weakness, directional preponderance, total response from the right ear, and total response from the left ear.Order effects were analyzed using 2 methods. The first analysis was done looking at the 8 possible orders. We also had an a priori established hypothesis that the first irrigation tested would influence the calculation of unilateral weakness more than the other 3 irrigations. To test this hypothesis, the 8 orders were condensed into 4 order conditions based on the first irrigation. The effect of order was determined using analysis of variance tests. Although the first irrigation tended to be the largest, no significant effects were observed.This experiment demonstrated that while there is great inter-individual and intra-individual variability in caloric test results, the order of irrigations had no significant effect in the test. Future studies may explore the effects of nonphysiological factors on test results.",

It is established that treatment for rheumatoid arthritis can exacerbate latent viral issues, but this has not specifically been reported for vestibular neuritis. There are reports in the literature in which patients successfully used viral suppressant medication to decrease viral activity while they were able to continue benefiting from immunosuppressive therapy. We hypothesized that, if the current patient's vestibular neuritis events were related to her treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, she may also benefit from use of viral suppressant medication while continuing her otherwise successful immunosuppressive intervention.Patients treated with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are more susceptible to viral issues, and this may include vestibular neuritis. For the current case, identifying this possibility and recommending viral suppressant medication allowed her to continue with successful treatment of rheumatoid arthritis while avoiding additional vertigo events.",

    "abstract": "Purpose This article introduces concepts and a general taxonomy used by the educational data mining (EDM) community, as well as examples of their applications, with the aims of providing audiology educators with a referential basis for developing this area. Method A narrative review was carried out to present an overview of EDM and its main methods. Some of these methods were exemplified with analysis of real data from an Internet-based specialization course on pediatric auditory rehabilitation. Results The review introduced EDM main concepts and applications and described methods from its area. Real data examples illustrated EDM use to predict interpersonal help-seeking, model interpersonal interaction, analyze students' trajectories within a course's module, and understand how students approached group assignments. Some of the insights provided by EDM to support teaching and learning processes were also described. Conclusions EDM methods offer new tools to discover knowledge from digital traces (i.e., logs) and support key stakeholders (students, instructors, or course administrators) to raise awareness about course dynamics. This approach has the potential to foster a better understanding and management of educational processes in audiology distance education.",

Method We enrolled 301 patients (302 ears) with ISSNHL (average hearing level at 250-4000 Hz ≥ 40 dB; time from onset to treatment ≤ 30 days). From August 2002 to March 2009, 174 patients (174 ears) received systemic steroid plus HBO therapy (HBO group), and from June 2015 to January 2018, 127 patients (128 ears) received systemic plus intratympanic steroid (IT group). Hearing outcomes were evaluated by 6 indices: cure rate, marked-recovery rate (percent of patients with hearing gain ≥ 30 dB), recovery rate (percent of patients with hearing gain ≥ 10 dB), hearing gain, hearing level after treatment, and percent hearing improvement compared to the unaffected contralateral ear. Results The recovery rate was significantly higher in the IT group than in the HBO group (80.5% vs. 68.4%, p = .019). The IT group showed a higher recovery rate than the HBO group in patients aged ≥ 60 years ( p = .010), patients with early (≤ 7 days from onset) treatment ( p = .005), patients with initial hearing levels ≥ 90 dB ( p = .037), and patients with vertigo/dizziness ( p = .040). The IT group also showed higher hearing gain and percent hearing improvement than the HBO group in patients with vertigo/dizziness ( p = .046 and p = .026, respectively). Conclusions Systemic plus intratympanic steroid is more effective for ISSNHL than systemic steroid plus HBO, particularly in patients with negative prognostic factors, such as old age, profound hearing loss, and/or presence of vertigo/dizziness.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Audiologists should be treating hyperacusis patients. However, it can be difficult to know where to begin because treatment protocols and evidence-based treatment studies are lacking. A good place to start in any tinnitus and hyperacusis clinic is to incorporate a group educational session. Method Here, we outline our approach to establishing a hyperacusis group educational session that includes specific aspects of getting to know each patient to best meet their needs, understanding the problems associated with hyperacusis, explaining the auditory system and the relationship of hyperacusis to hearing loss and tinnitus, describing the influence of hyperacusis on daily life, and introducing treatment options. Subjective responses from 11 adults with hyperacusis, who participated in a recent clinical group education session, were discussed to illustrate examples from actual patients. Conclusions Due to the devastating nature of hyperacusis, patients need to be reassured that they are not alone and that they can rely on audiologists to provide support and guidance. A group approach can facilitate the therapeutic process by connecting patients with others who are also affected by hyperacusis, and by educating patients and significant others on hyperacusis and its treatment options.

    "abstract": "Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate listening self-efficacy ratings between aided and unaided conditions in different communication environments and to determine what patient- and device-centered variables were associated with individual differences. Method An observational, cross-sectional study design was used to evaluate 165 older adults with mild to moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss who wore hearing aids at least 8 hr per week. Listening self-efficacy for both unaided and aided listening was measured using the Listening Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (LSEQ; Smith, Pichora-Fuller, Watts, &amp; La More, 2011 ), consisting of a global score and subscales of Dialogue in Quiet, Directed Listening, and Complex Listening. Metrics to explain variability in the degree of improvement in LSEQ ratings with aided listening included patient-centered variables of age, pure-tone average, and personality and device-centered variables of hearing aid use, speech intelligibility index, directionality, and noise reduction. The NEO Five-Factor Inventory ( Costa &amp; McCrae, 1985 ) was used to measure 5 personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness). Associations were evaluated between LSEQ ratings and patient- and device-centered variables using a linear mixed-model analysis. Results Statistically significant improvements in LSEQ ratings were found for aided conditions (relative to unaided conditions), easier listening environments, lower pure-tone averages, and lower levels of neuroticism. Furthermore, the improvement in listening self-efficacy with hearing aids did not depend on the listening environment but did alter with severity of hearing loss, length of hearing aid use, and levels of conscientiousness. Conclusions Results of this study suggest that wearing hearing aids is associated with improved listening self-efficacy in a variety of communication environments. Aural rehabilitation and counseling may focus on improving listening self-efficacy to address the challenges of consistent hearing aid use and reduced quality of life related to hearing loss.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Tinnitus is a chronic medical condition that can result in distress, concentration difficulties, and clinical depression. An effective, objective measure of tinnitus distress does not currently exist. Endocrinal studies into the condition have been few, with those investigating the cortisol awakening response limited in scope. It was hypothesized that distressed individuals with tinnitus would awaken and be unable to effectively prepare for the day ahead due to a blunted cortisol response. Method Twenty individuals with varying tinnitus distress were compared with a control group (n = 10) in a pilot study, which measured salivary cortisol concentrations on awakening. Multiple exclusion variables were applied. Results In line with previous studies, total cortisol volume (as measured by area under the curve) was not found to be significantly different in the most distressed individuals with tinnitus, F(2, 26) = 0.254, p = .777ns. However, a separate measure of changing cortisol levels-the area under the curve with respect to increase (or AUCi)-was found to be significantly less robust in those individuals reporting the most severe tinnitus distress, F(2, 26) = 7.671, p = .002. This indicates that fewer resources would be available to cope with the demands of the day ahead. Additionally, the AUCi correlated negatively with tinnitus distress later the same day. Conclusions Relationships between proposed objective and self-reported components of self-reported tinnitus distress are considered, with some aspects of tinnitus distress more closely related to physiological mechanisms than others. It is suggested that, with further research, the cortisol awakening response (AUCi) may be put forward as a credible objective biomarker of tinnitus distress.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate the emotional tone and verbal behavior of social media users who self-identified as having tinnitus and/or hyperacusis that caused self-described negative consequences on daily life or health. Research Design and Method An explanatory mixed-methods design was utilized. Two hundred “initial” and 200 “reply” Facebook posts were collected from members of a tinnitus group and a hyperacusis group. Data were analyzed via the LIWC 2015 software program and compared to typical bloggers. As this was an explanatory mixed-methods study, we used qualitative thematic analyses to explain, interpret, and illustrate the quantitative results. Results Overall, quantitative results indicated lower overall emotional tone for all categories (tinnitus and hyperacusis, initial and reply), which was mostly influenced by higher negative emotion. Higher levels of authenticity or truth were found in the hyperacusis sample but not in the tinnitus sample. Lower levels of clout (social standing) were indicated in all groups, and a lower level of analytical thinking style (concepts and complex categories rather than narratives) was found in the hyperacusis sample. Additional analysis of the language indicated higher levels of sadness and anxiety in all groups and lower levels of anger, particularly for initial replies. These data support prior findings indicating higher levels of anxiety and depression in this patient population based on the actual words in blog posts and not from self-report questionnaires. Qualitative results identified 3 major themes from both the tinnitus and hyperacusis texts: suffering, negative emotional tone, and coping strategies. Conclusions Results from this study suggest support for the predominant clinical view that patients with tinnitus and hyperacusis have higher levels of anxiety and depression than the general population. The extent of the suffering described and patterns of coping strategies suggest clinical practice patterns and the need for research in implementing improved practice plans.",

Method Contralateral suppression of TEOAEs was measured in 14 adults and 14 children using 3 methods with and without contralateral acoustic stimulus (CAS). Method-I having “2 s on-off” and Method-II having “10 s on-off” interleaved presentation of white noise. Method-III used “continuous presentation of white noise”. Test–retest reliability was checked in adults without removing the probe (same-probe recording) and reinserting the probe (different-probe recording) and in children using a different-probe recording. Results The absolute suppression amplitude of TEOAEs was higher for “continuous noise,” followed by “10 s on-off” and “2 s on-off” CAS. There was no significant effect of age across the 2 probe recordings, 3 methods of TEOAEs with and without CAS, and for the absolute suppression amplitude. Also, in adults, there was no significant difference between same-probe and different-probe recordings across the 3 methods. High internal consistency was observed on Cronbach's alpha (α &gt; .9) for the 3 methods and 2 probe recordings. High agreement and correlation between the recordings for all 3 methods were seen using Bland–Altman plots and Pearson product–moment correlation coefficient. Conclusion The study demonstrated that highly reliable contralateral suppression of TEOAE can be measured using the 3 methods in adults and children. However, continuous presentation of CAS resulted in greater TEOAE suppression amplitude compared to interleaved presentation of CAS; hence, the former is recommended.",

Method Participants were 131 predominantly older (77% 65+ years) Hispanic/Latinx adults (98%). A structured Spanish-language interview and pure-tone threshold test data were analyzed for each participant. The sensitivities and specificities of three single questions and the Hearing Handicap Index for the Elderly–Screening (HHIE-S; Ventry &amp; Weinstein, 1983 ) in Spanish, as well as three audiometric screening criteria, were evaluated in relation to the pure-tone threshold test for detecting hearing loss. Results Sensitivity and specificity of audiometric screening criteria varied, but the highest sensitivity was found for the criterion of &gt; 25 dB HL at 1–4 kHz in either ear. The single self-perception question, “ ¿Cree usted que tiene pérdida de audición? ( Do you think you have a hearing loss?),” was shown to be the most sensitive self-report screening compared to other single-item questions and the HHIE-S. This single question was as sensitive as an audiometric screening to detect a moderate hearing loss (&gt; 40 dB HL in either ear). Results from the Spanish HHIE-S indicated poor performance to detect hearing loss in this population, consistent with previous research. Conclusions Among older Spanish-speaking adults, self-reported hearing status had varying sensitivities depending on the question asked. However, of the tools evaluated, the self-perception question proved to be a more sensitive and specific tool than a multi-item screen. Objective audiometric testing (&gt; 25 dB HL) resulted in the highest sensitivity to detect a mild hearing loss.",

Testing children with DS can be challenging, and outcomes may be unreliable due to their different cognitive demands and delays. The aim of this study was to assess optimal audiologic testing procedures for specific age groups of children with DS. Method This study used a retrospective investigation of 273 children with DS (145 boys, 128 girls; average age at evaluation = 5.92 ± 4.74 years) who received an audiologic evaluation during 2013 as part of their medical care at a large pediatric hospital (satellite facilities included). Results Age ranges for the completion of audiometry procedures in children with DS are provided. Average age to reliably complete behavioral testing in children with DS was delayed by up to 30 months compared to typically developing children. The majority of children with DS achieved at least good-to-fair reliability for audiologic results starting at 16 months (85.7%) and two ear results at 6–10 years (76.1%). Though not statistically significant, the use of a two-tester assistant compared to a single tester appeared to be helpful in obtaining reliable results. Conclusion The results provide a guide to optimal audiologic test procedures for children with DS, as the standard audiologic guidelines for typically developing infants and children do not apply.",

Effective communication is vital to ensure that information about the hearing impairment, recommendations, and/or management options is appropriately provided and understood by patients and that patient needs and expectations from the session are met. This research note reports on an exploratory study that sought to describe communication in follow-up audiological consultations within a context where ototoxicity monitoring is routine practice. Method Six interactions between patients and audiologists were video-recorded at an in-patient treatment facility for drug-resistant tuberculosis in Johannesburg and analyzed using a sociolinguistic approach.

Results These interactions differed considerably to other audiology consultations we have analyzed in terms of aspects such as the length of the interaction and the type of information given to patients. We observed a substantial amount of mitigative, vague, and exaggerated language in these interactions. Conclusions In this research note, we offer some reflections on this data set using a lens of uncertainty management theory and explore factors within the broader context that may contribute to the interactional features observed in the current study.

In the HEAR-aware project, it is hypothesized that self-management can be facilitated via a smartphone app if its educational content is tailored to a person's dynamic stage of readiness to take action on their hearing (stage of change) and to a person's dynamic acoustical situations (as measured via a wearable microphone) and associated challenges (as captured via ecological momentary assessment). As such, the HEAR-aware app would be an ecological momentary intervention. This research note describes the rationale and theoretical underpinnings of the app, as well as the rationale for planning a series of studies to develop and evaluate it. Study Designs After a preparatory phase, Study 1 includes qualitative group interviews to assess user needs. Next, a creative session will be held, in which all stakeholders involved will work toward a specified version of the app. Subsequently, prototypes of the app will be developed and pilot-tested (Pilot Studies 2A and 2B). Users' usage and ratings (usability and quality indicators) of the app's elements will be examined and processed in the app. Lastly, the effectiveness of the app's final version will be examined in a randomized controlled trial (Study 3).

Method Adults with hearing impairment (HI, n = 9) and with normal hearing (NH, n = 10) participated in a study using a smartphone-based EMA system to measure their auditory lifestyles. A 14-item survey was scheduled to deliver every 45 min by an EMA app. After a 1-week trial, participants were interviewed regarding their study experiences. The app log files were analyzed to understand how the participants interacted with the app. Results Across the two groups, 1,295 surveys were completed (compliance rate 74.4%). On average, HI participants completed 10.0 and NH participants completed 9.1 surveys per day. The mean survey completion time for HI and NH groups were 72 s and 51 s, respectively. For both groups, about 90% of the participants reported the app as easy to use; about 60% of the participants reported that repetitive surveys interrupted or somewhat interrupted their activities. Participants reported surveys disrupting situations, for example, working, driving, and social events, and that they were more likely to skip surveys in these situations. Additionally, 50% of NH and 30% of HI participants indicated that the survey was not delivered too frequently and none indicated that the survey was too long.

The objective of this study was to evaluate audiologists and speech-language pathologists (SLPs) on awareness and knowledge of cCMV. Method A multiple-choice survey assessing awareness, knowledge, and practice patterns was sent electronically to audiologists and SLPs of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. Results were compared between audiologists and SLPs and within stratified groups of audiologists. Data were collected, and descriptive analysis was performed. Results Ninety-four audiologists and 317 SLPs responded. Most audiologists were somewhat or very familiar with cCMV (85.9%), while only 26% of SLPs responded that they were at least somewhat familiar with cCMV ( p &lt; .0001). When comparing audiologists' and SLPs' knowledge of symptoms, transmission, and diagnostic age for cCMV, audiologists had higher scores in all categories ( p &lt; .0001). Audiologists were then stratified into subgroups to evaluate the association of the given subgroup with their overall knowledge. The more advanced audiology training, the more knowledgeable the respondent was regarding HL progression ( p = .002). Audiologists who were more familiar with cCMV scored better in most categories compared to those reporting somewhat or less familiar; these findings were only significant for knowledge of symptoms ( p &lt; .0001). Audiologists who were sometimes or frequently evaluating children less than 5 years of age had a better understanding of HL presentation among cCMV patients than those who rarely saw this patient population. Those who were in practice for &lt; 20 years frequently knew the time-sensitive age of diagnosis than respondents in practice longer. Conclusions As a leading environmental cause of pediatric HL, cCMV is frequently encountered by audiologists and SLPs. This study highlights knowledge gaps and areas where targeted education is needed for both groups.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) are often treated with intravenous (IV) aminoglycoside (AG) antibiotics to manage life-threatening bacterial infections. Preclinical animal data suggest that, in addition to damaging cochlear hair cells, this class of antibiotics may cause cochlear synaptopathy and/or damage to higher auditory structures. The acoustic reflex growth function (ARGF) is a noninvasive, objective measure of neural function in the auditory system. A shallow ARGF (small reflex-induced changes in middle ear function with increasing elicitor level) has been associated with synaptopathy due to noise exposure in rodent and human studies. In this study, the ARGF was obtained in CF patients with normal hearing, some of whom have been treated with IV AGs, and a control group without CF. The hypothesis was that patients with IV-AG exposure would have a shallow ARGF due to cochlear synaptopathy caused by ototoxicity. Method Wideband ARGFs were examined in four groups of normal-hearing participants: a control group of 29 individuals without CF; and in 57 individuals with CF grouped by lifetime IV-AG exposure: 15 participants with no exposure, 21 with low exposure, and 21 with high exposure. Procedures included pure-tone audiometry, clinical immittance, wideband acoustic immittance battery, including ARGFs, and transient evoked otoacoustic emissions. Results CF subjects with normal pure-tone thresholds and either high or low lifetime IV-AG exposure had enhanced ARGFs compared to controls and CF participants without IV-AG exposure. The groups did not differ in transient evoked otoacoustic emission signal-to-noise ratio. Conclusion These results diverge from the shallow ARGF pattern observed in studies of noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy and are suggestive of a central mechanism of auditory dysfunction in patients with AG-induced ototoxicity.",

This study aims to explore modified brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) scores based on the pattern of BAEP abnormalities and relate with brainstem symptoms, brainstem functional system scores (BFSS), brainstem lesions, and disability. Method Forty-five participants with relapsing–remitting MS and 45 age- and gender-matched healthy controls underwent case history assessment, otoscopic examination, pure-tone audiometry, and BAEP testing. Also, neurological examination (Expanded Disability Status Scale, FSS scales) and magnetic resonance imaging were carried out on MS participants. Patterns of BAEP abnormalities were categorized and converted to BAEP scores. Results Out of 45 participants' brainstem symptoms, BFSS &gt; 1, brainstem lesions (magnetic resonance imaging), and BAEP abnormalities were observed in 75.6%, 42.2%, 62.2%, and 55.56% of participants, respectively. Waves V and III abnormalities were more common among MS participants and showed a significant difference from the control group in the Mann–Whitney U test. Chi-square test did not show a significant association of BAEP abnormalities with brainstem symptoms and lesions but showed significant association with BFSS. The mean and standard deviation of BAEP scores in MS participants were 1.73 + 2.37. All healthy controls showed BAEP scores of 0. BAEP scores in MS participants showed significant correlation with BFSS scores and predict Expanded Disability Status Scale scores. Conclusion BAEP scores based on the pattern of BAEP abnormality can be a valid and useful measure in evaluating brainstem functions and predicting disability in MS.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Auditory training is known to improve the speech-perception-in-noise (SPIN) skills in children with auditory processing disorders (APDs); however, conventional non–computer-based trainings are dreary and nonmotivating. This study intended to develop a computer-based noise desensitization training module in Indian English and test the efficacy of the same in children with APD having SPIN deficits. There are no such modules available at present to be used in Indian children. Method The module incorporated words-in-noise training, with monosyllables and trisyllables as target words in the presence of speech-shaped noise as well as multitalker babble at different signal-to-noise ratios ranging from +20 to −4 dB SNR. The study included 20 children with SPIN deficits diagnosed with APD and who were recruited randomly to the experimental group who received the training ( n = 10; M age = 11.1 years) and to the control group who did not receive any training ( n = 10; M age = 11.4 years). The outcome measures included behavioral measures and electrophysiological measures (auditory long latency responses for speech in quiet and noise). Results Compared to children in the control group, children in the experimental group exhibited improvements in the SPIN scores as well as temporal processing measures after training. Dichotic consonant–vowel tests and auditory memory and sequencing tests did not yield significant improvement post training. Also, auditory long latency responses in quiet and noise revealed significant reduction in the amplitudes after training. No significant difference was noted in the latencies of auditory long latency responses post training. Control group participants did not show any significant difference in any of the measures between the initial and follow-up evaluations. Conclusions The developed training module was successful in fetching improvements in behavioral and electrophysiological measures. It would be a great addition to the evidence-based rehabilitation support inventory for children with SPIN deficits in India. Supplemental Material https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.14551041",

    "abstract": "This investigation aims to provide outcomes from a clinical perspective on the validity and efficacy of a wireless automated audiometer system that could be used in multiple settings when a sound booth is not accessible. Testing was conducted in a clinical setting under modified protocols meeting safety precautions during the COVID-19 pandemic.Four doctoral students in audiology served as examiners. Participants were 69 adults between the ages of 20 and 69 years, with normal hearing (≤ 25 dB HL; n = 110 ears) or hearing loss (> 25 dB HL; n = 25 ears). Two versions of a pure-tone air-conduction threshold test following a modified Hughson-Westlake approach were performed and compared at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz (a) in a sound-treated test booth using standard manual audiometry and (b) in a quiet, nonsound-treated clinical room (sound booth free) using automated KUDUwave audiometry. Participants were asked to complete a five-item feedback questionnaire, and examiners were interviewed to report on their experience.Clinical validity to within ±10 dB of standard audiometry was demonstrated for 94.5% of the total thresholds (n = 937) measured with the sound booth-free approach. Less accuracy (73.3%) was observed using a ±5 dB comparison. When comparing the mean thresholds, there were significant differences (p < .01) between the mean thresholds at most frequencies, with mean sound booth thresholds being higher than the sound booth-free mean thresholds. A strong threshold correlation (.91-.98) was found between the methods across frequencies. Participant and examiner feedback supported the efficacy of the sound booth-free technology.Findings support sound booth-free, automated software-controlled audiometry with active noise monitoring as a valid and efficient procedure for pure-tone hearing threshold assessment. This method offers an effective alternative when circumstances require more transportable hearing assessment technology or do not allow for standard manual audiometry in a sound booth.",

The aim of this review article is to describe the history of Internet treatments for tinnitus and to comment on the evidence base. Challenges for future research and implementations will be mentioned.A narrative historical review was conducted.There are now several studies including controlled trials on Internet interventions based on cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) for tinnitus. Effects in controlled trials are moderate to large with regard to tinnitus annoyance. While the treatment format now exists in four languages, there is a large treatment versus demand gap as very few clients with tinnitus receive ICBT. There is a lack of research on related conditions with the exception of hearing loss. However, there is substantial support for Internet interventions for comorbid conditions such as insomnia and depression but not specifically in association with tinnitus.ICBT is a promising treatment approach for tinnitus and will hopefully increase access to evidence-based treatment to reduce tinnitus distress. More research is needed for related conditions such as hyperacusis and larger trials on tinnitus.",

After cleaning the data for duplications and posts without any text information, the sample was reduced to 101,905 posts, which was subjected to cluster analysis using the open-source IRaMuTeQ software to identify main topics based on the co-occurrence of texts. These clusters were named by a panel of tinnitus experts (n = 9) by reading typical text segments within each cluster.The cluster analysis identified 16 unique clusters that belong to two topics, which were named \"tinnitus causes and consequences\" and \"tinnitus management and coping.\" Based on their characteristics, the clusters were named: tinnitus timeline (10%), tinnitus perception (9.7%), medical triggers and modulators (8.8%), hearing research (8.8%), attention and silence (8.6%), social media posts about tinnitus (7.4%), hearing protection (7.3%), interaction with hearing health care providers (6.7%), mental health and coping (5.8%), music listening (5.7%), hope for a cure (5.6%), interactions with people without tinnitus (5.4%), dietary supplements and alternative therapies (3.2%), sleep (3.9%), dietary effects (1.7%), and writing about tinnitus and being thankful to online community (1.4%).Despite some limitations, tinnitus posts on Reddit provide rich real-world data to identify various issues and complaints that tinnitus patients and their significant others discuss in online communities. Some of the clusters identified here are novel (e.g., tinnitus timeline, interactions with people without tinnitus) and have not been much discussed in the tinnitus literature. The results suggest that individuals with tinnitus relay on social media for support and highlight the service delivery needs in providing social support through other means (e.g., support groups).",

The study population consisted of 335 physicians working in Jordan, with different specialties. The data were collected through site visits to a variety of health care facilities, as well as an online version of the survey to facilitate data collection and ensure participants' comfort.The majority of physicians (30.7%) were general practitioners or family doctors, followed by pediatricians (12.8%). Most of the physicians (88.7%) had experience ranging from 1 to 10 years; the majority of physicians (60.3%) were younger than 30 years of age. Most of the physicians identified the importance of newborn hearing screening. Physicians showed limited knowledge about the management and intervention of infants with permanent hearing loss. Only 11.5% of respondents would refer a child with confirmed hearing loss to an audiologist, and 1.9% of them would refer to a speech therapist. Even though the majority of the physicians (69.0%) reported not receiving any training to deal with deaf and hard of hearing children, they felt confident in talking with parents about hearing loss and its management.This study revealed that physicians have limited knowledge regarding hearing loss in children as well as its management and intervention. Furthermore, this study illustrates the need for more ongoing medical education programs regarding hearing loss in children.",

Negative correlations were found between resilience and BOS, BOS and CS, CS and overall occupational stress, and resilience and overall occupational stress. Resilience (p = .015), CS (p < .001), and overall occupational stress (p < .001) were identified as being significant predictors of BOS. The top five occupational stressors for audiologists were reported as being staff shortages, administration duties, paperwork and patient reports, patient or family expectations to fix a client's hearing, and the amount time available with each patient. The differences in occupational stress experienced by private versus public audiologists were minimal, always being below 1 Likert point.Although audiologists do not report high levels of BOS, they report stress in their workplace. As stress was a significant predictor of BOS, audiologists could benefit from interventions aimed at reducing workplace stress.",

Age-related hearing loss is the third leading cause of global years lived with disability after lower back pain and migraine. Among other sensory disorders, hearing loss is ranked first. To help mitigate these health concerns, access to affordable hearing health care across rural and urban communities will be necessary. Method: For this study, the needs of rural communities and their residents with hearing loss were explored. Individual interviews and focus group discussions with 26 adults with hearing loss, 14 friends and family of those with hearing loss, and 25 community members who worked and lived in rural communities were conducted. Results: Collectively, four themes emerged from qualitative analysis of the comments from all three groups, including Communication and Other Related Hearing Loss Issues, Social and Emotional Issues, Dealing with Hearing Loss, and Addressing Hearing Loss in the Community. Factors associated with the themes were mapped onto the Meikirch Model of Health to determine potential areas of intervention within the individual, society, and environment components of the model. Conclusion: Future care mitigating health concerns for adults with hearing loss living in rural communities will involve interprofessional collaboration and increased access to hearing health care.",

Bilateral tone burst evoked mVEMPs were obtained using the zygomatic montage at 250-, 500-, 750-, 1000-, 1500-, and 2000-Hz stimulation frequencies. Self-monitoring biofeedback was given during the procedure to confirm the tension of the masseter muscle between 49.9 and 150.6 rms. Furthermore, the electromyography (EMG) scaling was done to avoid any muscle-related irregularities.Tone burst evoked mVEMPs were found to be 100% present at the stimulation frequencies of 250, 500, 750, and 1000 Hz. There were no ear and gender effects seen for any of the frequencies. Significant shortening of the P1 and N1 latencies with increasing stimulation frequencies was observed. The peak-to-peak amplitude was the highest at 500 Hz and lowest at 2000 Hz tone bursts under both EMG scaled and unscaled conditions.The present revealed higher response rates and larger amplitudes study of mVEMP at lower frequencies, and, therefore, the frequency tuning was seen for the stimulation frequency at 500 Hz.",

In all, 191 women in three age groups, ranging from 35 to 85 years old, participated. None reported hearing problems. Participants completed a demographic data form and were given a standard audiometric evaluation to confirm age-normal hearing. Each completed assessments of speech understanding in quiet and noise, auditory signal duration discrimination, and binaural processing. Measures of hearing knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes; health-related locus of control; ego strength; and, social support were administered. Results revealed that although some variables deteriorate among subsequent age groups (i.e., hearing thresholds, central auditory processing, and ego strength), the reverse is true for others (i.e., social interaction and satisfaction with income). Age-specific sociodemographic burdens that may interfere with hearing loss management were noted. New psychosocial data are revealed against which women and men with impaired hearing may be compared.",

This could be the result of limitations in methodology, a lack of observable auditory responsiveness, or both. In the current study, 2- and 4-month old infants were tested under enhanced conditions for obtaining behavioral responses (i.e., salient auditory stimuli, reduced visual distractions, reinforced correct responses). A two-interval, forced-choice task with four intensity levels was used. Although a behavioral threshold was obtained for the 4-month-olds, threshold determination for the 2-month-olds remained elusive. In light of the current findings and previous studies of visual acuity of infants, these results suggest a lack of behavioral responsiveness to auditory stimuli for the younger infants rather than methodological limitations. With infants in the 2-month-old age range, clinical audiologists should expect few behavioral responses to auditory stimuli at intensity levels below those that elicit startle responses.",

Univariate and repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) failed to reveal any significant differences between the groups when clustered by ethnicity and SES. The Latino American participants' scores were analyzed for dialectal variations, and the ANOVA analyses were repeated using the corrected scores. No significant interactions were observed. Classification analyses revealed that 10% more Latino American children than Anglo American children fell into the borderline-to-disordered category based on SCAN-C composite scores; these classification differences were most apparent on the Filtered Words subtest (with a difference of 25%). When scores with dialectal rescoring were considered, the classification distribution for the Latino American children more closely matched that of the Anglo American children. Given the increased likelihood of Latino American children scoring in the borderline-to-disordered category, caution should be used in interpreting SCAN-C results for Latino American children.

Data included final examination grades, ratings for overall course content, amount learned, clarity of responsibility, workload, relevance, and course comments. Student journals from the SL group and mentor surveys also were reviewed. Results The majority of student outcomes were comparable for pre-SL and SL cohorts. Clarity of responsibility and workload were rated lower for SL courses than for pre-SL classes, with medium and small to medium effect sizes, respectively. Mentors rated the projects and process of high value and benefit, and several projects remain in use beyond the end of the course.

In recent years, several preclinical trials and case reports in humans have been published on their potential for chronic tinnitus. However, studies to obtain insight into patients' willingness to undergo these treatments are scarce. The aim of this survey study was to find out whether tinnitus patients are willing to undergo invasive neuromodulation when taking its risks, costs, and potential benefits into account.A Visual Analog Scale (VAS, 0-10) was used to measure the outcome. Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficients were computed to determine the correlation between patient characteristics and acceptance rates.Around one fifth of the patients were reasonably willing to undergo invasive treatment (VAS 5-7), and around one fifth were fully willing to do so (VAS 8-10). Hearing aids, used as a control, were accepted most, followed by cochlear implantation, deep brain stimulation, and cortical stimulation. Acceptance rates were slightly higher when the chance of cure was higher. Patients with a history of attempted treatments were more eager than others to find a new treatment for tinnitus.A considerable proportion of patients with tinnitus would accept a variety of invasive treatments despite the associated risks or costs. When clinical neuromodulatory studies for tinnitus are to be performed, particular attention should be given to obtaining informed consent, including explaining the potential risks and providing a realistic outcome expectation.",

We attempted to gain an understanding of the knowledge and misconceptions of sufferers and their partners about tinnitus. Method Two different websites were created with surveys, 1 for tinnitus sufferers and the other for their partners. A mass e-mail was sent to employees and students at The University of Iowa inviting people with tinnitus and their significant others to fill out the online surveys. Those with tinnitus were asked to rate how their tinnitus affected their thoughts and emotions, sleep, concentration, and hearing. They were also invited to fill out the Iowa Tinnitus Primary Function Questionnaire (12-item version; Tyler et al., 2014 ). Partners completed a similar survey that asked how tinnitus affected the sufferer in these domains. Open-ended questions were also included to obtain more specific feedback from the participants regarding their experiences and how tinnitus affects their lifestyle and relationships. Results Two hundred twenty-two replies were obtained from 197 tinnitus sufferers and 25 partners of those with tinnitus. Partners and sufferers were not completely in agreement regarding their knowledge about tinnitus or familiar with the impact that this symptom may have on the sufferers. Sufferers showed more confidence in their hearing ability, regardless of tinnitus, than their partners. Furthermore, sufferers and partners do not generally talk about tinnitus to each other. Conclusion We conclude that both sufferers and partners would benefit from receiving counseling to address many misunderstandings regarding tinnitus and its consequences in their everyday life activities.",

A question that has not been raised in prior research is whether slight variability, even within the range of clinically normal hearing, may have a detrimental effect on comprehension of spoken sentences, especially when attempting to understand the meaning of sentences that offer an additional cognitive challenge. The purpose of this study was to address this question. Method An exploratory analysis was conducted on data from 3 published studies that included young adults, ages 18 to 29 years, with audiometrically normal hearing acuity (pure-tone average < 15 dB HL) tested for comprehension of sentences that conveyed the sentence meaning with simpler or more complex linguistic structures. A product-moment correlation was conducted between individuals' hearing acuity and their comprehension accuracy. Results A significant correlation appeared between hearing acuity and comprehension accuracy for syntactically complex sentences, but not for sentences with a simpler syntactic structure. Partial correlations confirmed this relationship to hold independent of participant age within this relatively narrow age range. Conclusion These findings suggest that slight elevations in hearing thresholds, even among young adults who pass a screen for normal hearing, can affect comprehension accuracy for spoken sentences when combined with cognitive demands imposed by sentences that convey their meaning with a complex linguistic structure. These findings support limited resource models of attentional allocation and argue for routine baseline hearing evaluations of young adults with current age-normal hearing acuity.",

Benefits have also been documented for the use of bilateral CIs for speech perception in quiet, localization, and speech perception in noise. This study attempted to quantify speech perception results for bimodal and bilateral CIs in adults and provide a guide for those considering a 2nd CI. Method Speech perception outcomes were reviewed for 1,394 adults with acquired hearing loss who received a CI at the Melbourne Cochlear Implant Clinic between 2000 and 2015. Results Bimodal and bilateral users significantly outperformed unilateral CI users on consonant–vowel–consonant word recognition in quiet. For the bilateral group, word recognition scores with the 1st CI were predictive of 2nd CI word scores. The analysis suggested that bimodal users who were gaining less than 19% benefit from the nonimplanted ear were likely to perform better with a 2nd implant. Conclusions CI users who score less than 19% on consonant–vowel–consonant words in the nonimplanted ear have a good chance of benefiting from a 2nd implant. Consideration of many other factors including age, hearing goals, medical factors, and the risk to residual hearing also needs to play a part in recommending a 2nd CI.",

Seventy patients (95.8%) had at least a 2-year follow-up, whereas 50 (68.4%) had a 5-year follow-up. Results Two- and 5-year recurrence rates were 5.60% and 10.34%, respectively. Mean time lapse between 1st episode and recurrence was 29.33 ± 26.60 months. About 70% of patients had a partial recovery at recurrence. The same ear was affected in 42.8% of patients, the contralateral ear was affected in 42.8% of patients, and recurrence was bilateral in 14.4% of cases. Recurrence correlated only with the presence of tinnitus during follow-up. However, the small number of participants with recurrence represented a limiting factor of our study. Conclusions Recurrences of SSNHL are rare events that can involve ipsilateral or contralateral ear. Further studies are necessary to identify predictors of recurrence.",

The questionnaire-based screening tools used were the Children's Auditory Performance Scale, Fisher's Auditory Problems Checklist, and Buffalo Model Questionnaire-Revised. The performance-based screening tools were from the SCAN-3 screening tests, that is, Auditory Figure Ground, Competing Words Free Recall (CW-FR), and Gap Detection Test. Predictability was ascertained by comparing the scores from screening tools with those from diagnostic APD tests and with the final diagnosis of APD. Research Design This study is a retrospective single-observation study. Method The screening and diagnostic test results were retrospectively analyzed from the medical records of 85 individuals (female = 39) aged 7-23 years who were seen for APD assessment at Bloomsburg University's Clinic for Hearing and Balance. Each participant was assessed with at least two questionnaire-based and at least two performance-based screening tools. Results Spearman correlation coefficient analysis showed a moderate relationship within questionnaire-based screening tools, whereas there was no relationship between questionnaire- and performance-based tools. Notably, the performance-based CW-FR screening tool showed a significant relationship with five diagnostic tests. The questionnaire-based screening tools did not predict APD diagnosis. The performance-based tool CW-FR (φ = 0.33) and the SCAN-3 screening battery (φ = 0.44) predicted the diagnosis of APD. Conclusion A performance-based screening tool or battery can be used to determine whether additional diagnostic APD evaluation is warranted. Referral for diagnostic assessment should not be based solely on questionnaire-based screening tools.",

Method Data were taken from a cross-sectional study, which was conducted between 2015 and 2017. The study included children aged ≤ 18 years, recruited from special schools for children with hearing loss and from hearing rehabilitation centers in Shandong province of China. Children were screened for bilateral SNHL through audiological testing. Clinical examination, genetic testing, and structured interviews were conducted for those children who were identified as having hearing loss to identify the potential cause. Results The etiology of bilateral SNHL in our sample was genetic in 874 (39.3%), acquired in 650 (29.3%), and unknown in 697 (31.4%) children. Among children with acquired SNHL, the cause was maternal viral infection in 75 (11.5%); perinatal factors in 238 (36.6%); meningitis, measles, and mumps in 146 (22.5%); and ototoxic exposure in 117 (18%) children. Among the children with genetic SNHL, only 44 (4.9%) were identified as having syndromic hearing loss, and the remainder (95.1%) were classified as nonsyndromic hearing loss. Conclusion The findings indicated that nearly 30% of bilateral SNHL in Shandong province could be preventable through immunization, early prenatal diagnosis, proper treatment of infections, and avoidance of prescription of ototoxic drugs. This finding emphasizes the need for programs aimed at improving the health services at primary and secondary levels of health care, which will in turn prevent childhood hearing loss.",

Those with pre-existing hearing loss are at particular risk of clinically important hearing loss with aminoglycoside-containing treatment than those with normal hearing at baseline. This study aimed to identify factors associated with pre-existing hearing loss among patients being treated for DR-TB in South Africa. Method Cross-sectional analysis nested within a cluster-randomized trial data across 10 South African TB hospitals. Patients ≥ 13 years old received clinical and audiological evaluations before DR-TB treatment initiation. Results Of 936 patients, average age was 35 years. One hundred forty-two (15%) reported pre-existing auditory symptoms. Of 482 patients tested by audiometry, 290 (60%) had pre-existing hearing loss. The prevalence of pre-existing hearing loss was highest among patients ≥ 50 years (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPrR] for symptoms 5.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) [3.63, 8.42]; aPrR for audiometric hearing loss 1.63, 95% CI [1.31, 2.03] compared to age 13–18 years) and among those with a prior history of second-line TB treatment (aPrR for symptoms 1.73, 95% CI [1.66, 1.80]; PrR for audiometric hearing loss 1.33, 95% CI [1.03, 1.73]). Having HIV with cluster of differentiation 4 cell count &lt; 200 cells/mm 3 and malnutrition were risk factors but did not reach statistical significance in adjusted analyses. Conclusion Pre-existing hearing loss is common among patients presenting for DR-TB treatment in South Africa, and those older than the age of 50 years or who had prior second-line TB treatment history were at highest risk.",

A posttest survey determining follow-up (verb) actions was sent to listeners who failed the test ( n = 1,007), of which 59 responded. Results The majority of listeners were in the precontemplation stage (75.5%). Age and stage of change were significant ( p &lt; .05) predictors of the digits-in-noise speech recognition threshold (DIN SRT). Listeners in the precontemplation stage were significantly younger than in other stages ( p &lt; .05). Posttest survey response rate was low (5.9%). Of those, most (82.4%) did not think they had a hearing loss. Only 13.6% followed up with an audiologist. Conclusion Older people presented with poorer DIN SRTs and were typically in a more advanced stage of change. The majority of those who did not follow up after failing the screening test did not believe they had a hearing loss. A combination of factors, including poor DIN SRT, older age, and a more advanced stage of change inclined participants to follow up with audiological care.",

In addition, the understandability and actionability of each video were evaluated using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Audiovisual Materials rating scale. Results Of the 100 most viewed videos, 16 were created by consumers, 62 were professional created, and 22 were media based. Symptoms, causes, and treatment or management of hearing loss were the most frequently discussed content categories, with over 60% of all videos commenting on these areas. The overall understandability and actionability scores for the 100 videos included were 77% and 31%, respectively, indicating adequate understandability and poor actionability. Conclusions The YouTube videos on hearing loss focus on a range of issues. The poor actionability of these videos was a concern, as these videos may not lead to appropriate consumer actions in addressing their hearing loss. Efforts are needed to improve the quality and content of these videos to promote appropriate behavior change.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of the current investigation was to determine the interrelations among vestibular disorders from a data set generated from the patient perspective as compared to previous data generated from the physician's perspective. Method The data for the current investigation originated from a previously published study describing the development of the Dizziness Symptom Profile (DSP; Jacobson et al., 2019 ). The DSP is a 31-item patient self-report tool designed to help primary care physicians in the development of a differential diagnosis using the patient's level of agreement with each dizziness and symptom-related statement. Responses to these items converge on common vestibular diagnoses and were previously found to agree with ear specialist differential diagnoses 70.3% of the time. Data were collected for 131 subjects ( M age = 56.7 years, 72 women) seen for evaluation in a tertiary dizziness specialty clinic. For this study, the data were analyzed using descriptive statistics to determine the frequency of single diagnoses, multiple diagnoses, co-occurring diagnoses, and patterns of co-occurrence. Results Results indicated that 52.7% of patients endorsed a single vestibular diagnosis and 47.3% endorsed two or more vestibular diagnoses. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and vestibular migraine were the most common single diagnoses and also the most common co-occurring diagnoses. As the number of diagnoses endorsed on the DSP increased, so did the percentage of time that BPPV and vestibular migraine would occur. Conclusions Results support and extend the work of others but using data generated from the perspective of the patient. A slight majority of patients endorsed a single disorder, but almost as many patients endorsed more than one vestibular diagnosis. BPPV and vestibular migraine were the most common single vestibular diagnoses and also the most common co-occurring vestibular diagnoses; vestibular migraine was more common when multiple diagnoses were endorsed. Results suggest it is common for patients to volunteer symptoms that cannot be explained by a single vestibular diagnosis. This finding is in agreement with physician-generated diagnosis data. Clinicians should consider the possibility of co-occurring diagnoses in complicated patients or in patients who are not responding optimally to management of a single vestibular disorder. The DSP is a tool that encourages clinicians to consider multiple co-occurring vestibular disorders as the source of patient complaints.",

Method A mixed-method approach was undertaken consisting of an online quantitative survey and qualitative structured telephone interviews. Survey data were analyzed using descriptives and chi-square analyses. The interview data were transcribed and analyzed using inductive content analysis. Results In total, 154 HCPs completed the survey, of whom 10 also completed an interview. Survey data showed that most HCPs use datalogging for conventional applications, such as counseling and fine-tuning during a hearing aid trial. Interview data highlighted four additional desirable datalogging features: (a) data about the sound environment, (b) details about operational aspects of hearing aid use, (c) data about use and nonuse, and (d) automated diagnosis of a hearing aid malfunction. HCPs also envisaged using datalogging in novel ways, such as for demonstrating hearing aid value and supporting decision making. Conclusions Today, datalogging is primarily used as a tool for counseling clients about hours and patterns of hearing aid use and for troubleshooting and fine-tuning. However, HCPs suggested novel and more ambitious uses of datalogging such as for sending alerts about nonuse, for automated diagnosis of a hearing aid malfunction, and for helping the client in their decision making. It remains to be seen whether in the future these will be implemented into clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Over the last two decades, the number of Americans misusing opioids has reached epidemic levels. With such drastic increases in opioid misuse, audiologists are more likely to have patients with opioid-induced hearing loss or neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) than in previous years. More attention is needed on how these increases might influence clinical practice and such a discussion could be useful for audiologists. The goal of this article, therefore, is to summarize what is currently known regarding the relationship between opioid misuse and audiology to help guide hearing health care providers (with a particular focus on opioid-induced hearing loss and NAS). This article (a) summarizes the overlap in opioid misuse and hearing loss populations, (b) describes the evidence linking opioid misuse to hearing loss, (c) discusses clinical implications that opioid-induced hearing loss and NAS have for practicing audiologists, and (d) recommends directions for future audiological research on opioid-induced hearing loss and NAS. Conclusions There is considerable overlap between populations at-risk for hearing loss and opioid misuse. Additionally, compelling evidence exists linking opioid misuse to hearing loss, but the specific causal mechanisms remain unclear, indicating a need for additional research. This article attempts to fill a gap in the audiological literature and has the potential to serve as a guide for hearing health care providers to make more informed clinical decisions regarding patients with opioid-induced hearing loss and NAS. Clinicians may wish to consider the concerns raised in this article before intervening with such concerns, especially in the absence of best practice protocols.",

    "abstract": "Objective The aim of this study was to examine experiences of hearing health care services as described in online consumer reviews. Design This study used a cross-sectional design. Online consumer reviews about hearing health care services generated from Google.com to an open-ended question “Share details of your own experience at this place” and perceived overall experience (indicated on a 5-point rating scale: “very good” to “very poor”) were extracted from 40 different cities across the United States. The open text contributed a text corpus of 9,622 unique consumer reviews. These responses were analyzed with the cluster analysis approach using an open-source automated text analysis software program, IRaMuTeQ, to identify key themes. Association between clusters and consumer experience ratings as well as consumer metadata (percentage of older adults in the city, region) were examined using the chi-square analysis. Results The majority of consumers appeared satisfied with their hearing health care services, with nearly 95% of consumers reporting “very good” and “good” on the global experience scale. The analysis of text responses resulted in seven clusters within two domains. Domain 1 (Clinical Processes) included the three clusters: administration processes, perceived benefits, and device acquisition. Domain 2 (Staff and Service Interactions) included the four clusters: clinician communications, staff professionalism , customer service, and provider satisfaction . Content relating to administration processes was associated with overall rating regarding the hearing health care service experience. Consumer's reviews relating to administration processes mostly described negative experiences, and these participants were more inclined to provide poorer overall experience ratings. In addition, city characteristics (i.e., percentage of older adults, region) had bearing toward what elements of hearing health care services are highlighted more in the consumer reviews. Conclusions Consumers comment on a variety of elements when describing their experiences with hearing health care services. Experiences reported in most clusters were generally positive, although some concerns in the “clinical process” are associated with lower satisfaction. Employing patient-centered strategies and ensuring patients have good experiences in the areas of concern may help improve both patient experience and their satisfaction.

    "abstract": "Purpose The dichotic digits test (DDT) is commonly administered in clinical and research settings, but it is not well understood how performance changes in aging. The purpose of this study is to determine the 5-year change on the free recall task and right ear advantage (REA) in a population-based cohort and factors associated with change. Method Participants in the population-based Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study, who completed the DDT during the fourth (2009-2010) and fifth (2013-2016) examination periods were included (n = 865, Mage = 72.8 years at baseline). Free recall DDT was administered using 25 sets of triple-digit pairs presented at 70 dB HL. The REA was calculated by subtracting the score in the left ear from the score in the right ear. Results In 5 years, most participants (62.4%) declined on free recall performance (mean decline = 3.0% [4.5 digits], p < .01). In age-sex-adjusted models, higher baseline scores, hearing impairment, and lower education were significantly associated with increased risk of decline. An REA at baseline (76.8%) and follow-up (77.9%) was common. Half of participants (50.6%) had a 5-year REA widening (M = 1.9% [1.4 digits], p = .01). Older age, but not hearing impairment, was associated with increased risk of REA widening. Conclusions The 5-year decline on free recall recognition performance was not associated with age but was associated with hearing impairment, whereas the 5-year widening of REA was associated with age but not hearing impairment. These results indicate that the REA may be a more sensitive measure of aging of the central auditory system than free recall performance.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Studies point to low help-seeking after a failed hearing screening. This research forum article presents the research protocol for a randomized controlled trial of motivational interviewing via the Internet to promote help-seeking in people who have failed an online hearing screening. Method Adults who fail a Swedish online hearing screening, including a speech-in-noise recognition test, will be randomized to either an intervention group (participating in motivational interviewing) or an active control group (reading a book on history of hearing aids). Both of the conditions will be delivered via the Internet. The primary outcome is experience with seeking health care and using hearing aids 9 months after the intervention. Secondary outcomes are changes in before and after measures of self-reported hearing difficulties, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Stages of change and self-efficacy in hearing help-seeking are measured immediately after intervention and at a 9-month follow-up for the purpose of mediation analysis. Results The results of this randomized controlled trial may help bridge the gap between hearing screening and successful hearing rehabilitation. Conclusion Although no large instantaneous benefits are expected, a slow change toward healthy behaviors—seeking health care and using hearing aids—would shed light on how to use the Internet to assist people with hearing impairment.",

Participants attended a presentation titled Hearing Health in Older Adults, which was delivered by a trained presenter in a peer-teaching-peer format. Following each presentation, a focus group discussion took place. Digital audio recordings, field notes, and memos of the discussions were used to create verbatim transcripts. Data were analyzed using qualitative description and thematic analysis techniques.Five central themes emerged when older adult focus groups discussed the presentation and hearing health change: recognizing and admitting, understanding the options, sharing stories and experiences, barriers and facilitators, and the presentation.Facilitators to hearing health change identified by participants include widespread education about hearing health; clarification about roles, professional motivation, and cost in hearing care; and opportunities to learn from and share personal stories with peers.",

What is more, these biological effects can be seen as early as middle age. The accruing evidence has implications for hearing aid use because effective communication relies not only on sufficient detection of sound but also on the individual's ability to learn to make use of these sounds in ever-changing listening environments.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which validated online screening measures of cognitive impairment, psychosocial well-being, and cardiovascular health are associated with a validated hearing screener in a sample of adults based in the United Kingdom. Method: Sixty-one adults (43 female; M age = 44.7 years) participated in a cross-sectional study delivered remotely. Participants completed the hearWHO smartphone application, a digits-in-noise hearing screener, and the Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS-M), a screening tool for cognitive impairment. Psychosocial well-being (social isolation and loneliness) and cardiovascular health were assessed through self-report. Results: Separate independent analyses of variance, with age, gender, and education as covariates, demonstrated participants who failed the hearWHO screener had poorer scores on the TICS-M, engaged in less physical activity, and reported more sedentary behavior and greater social isolation. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that lower TICS-M scores, having obtained less education, identifying as female, and reporting greater sedentary behavior and social isolation were the strongest predictors of lower hearWHO scores. Conclusions: The results from this study suggest that poorer hearing, as measured by the hearWHO screener, is independently associated with having worse cognitive function, more time spent being sedentary, and greater social isolation. Thus, this study demonstrates the potential of online screening measures to identify additional health conditions that confer risk to chronic disease as hearing loss manifests. This could help to inform the development of tailored treatment and support to improve an individual's readiness to seek help for and manage both their general and hearing health.

    "abstract": "Hearing loss (HL) is associated with cognitive performance in older adults, including performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a brief cognitive screening test. Yet, despite well-established sex-related differences in both hearing and cognition, very few studies have tested whether there are sex-related differences in auditory-cognitive associations.In the current cross-sectional retrospective analysis, we examined sex-related differences in hearing and cognition in 193 healthy older adults (M = 69 years, 60% women). Hearing was measured using audiometry (pure-tone average [PTA] of thresholds at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz in the worse ear). Cognition was assessed using the MoCA. Additionally, we calculated MoCA scores with hearing-dependent subtests excluded from scoring (MoCA-Modified).Men and women did not differ in age, education, or history of depression. Women had better hearing than men. Women with normal hearing were more likely to pass the MoCA compared with their counterparts with HL. In contrast, the likelihood of passing the MoCA did not depend on hearing status in men. Linear regression analysis showed an interaction between sex and PTA in the worse ear. PTAs were significantly correlated with both MoCA and MoCA-Modified scores in women, whereas this was not observed in the men.This study is one of the first to demonstrate significant sex-related differences in auditory-cognitive associations even when hearing-related cognitive test items are omitted. Potential mechanisms underlying these female-specific effects are discussed.https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.19233297.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) has been found to be effective for tinnitus management, although there is limited understanding about who will benefit the most from ICBT. Traditional statistical models have largely failed to identify the nonlinear associations and hence find strong predictors of success with ICBT. This study aimed at examining the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) to identify variables associated with treatment success in ICBT for tinnitus. Method: The study involved a secondary analysis of data from 228 individuals who had completed ICBT in previous intervention studies. A 13-point reduction in Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) was defined as a successful outcome. There were 33 predictor variables, including demographic, tinnitus, hearing-related and treatment-related variables, and clinical factors (anxiety, depression, insomnia, hyperacusis, hearing disability, cognitive function, and life satisfaction). Predictive models using ANN and SVM were developed and evaluated for classification accuracy. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was used to identify the relative predictor variable importance using the best predictive model for a successful treatment outcome. Results: The best predictive model was achieved with the ANN with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic value of 0.73 ± 0.03. The SHAP analysis revealed that having a higher education level and a greater baseline tinnitus severity were the most critical factors that influence treatment outcome positively. Conclusions: Predictive models such as ANN and SVM help predict ICBT treatment outcomes and identify predictors of outcome. However, further work is needed to examine predictors that were not considered in this study as well as to improve the predictive power of these models.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether different release times, as implemented in a commercial two-channel AGC hearing aid, would result in differing speech intelligibility performance, user preference, or use time. In experiment one, 14 subjects were fitted with a two-channel multi-memory AGC hearing aid. Four memories were programmed to have identical frequency responses and output limitation characteristics. Only the release times were varied, with the low channel/high channel set as follows (in ms): 20/35, 20/150, 100/35, 500/7. Results obtained from the NST (+5 S/N), magnitude estimations of intelligibility, and data-logging of use time did not show any release-time pair to be superior to any other. In experiment two, 10 subjects participated in a forced-choice, paired-comparison procedure using the same release-time pairs from experiment one. Auditory stimuli consisted of three input levels, consisting of speech, speech in noise, and music. Results indicated no release-time pair to be superior in any listening condition. Results may be explained, in part, by the use of a curvilinear compression circuit and the milder hearing loss exhibited by the subjects. Future investigation of the effect of release-time variation should be carried out on circuits with adjustable compression parameters (and fixed compression ratios) with listeners exhibiting different degrees of hearing loss.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) and outer/middle ear status in 12 African American children with normal hearing and homozygous sickle cell disease (SCD) and age-, gender-, and ear-matched African American controls. C. R. Downs, A. Stuart, &amp; D. Holbert (2000) reported that DPOAE amplitudes were significantly larger for children with SCD. Because the integrity of the middle ear system directly influences OAE characteristics, it was felt that concurrent investigation of DPOAE amplitudes and outer/middle ear function in children with SCD was warranted. DPOAEs were evoked by 13 primary-tone pairs with f 2 frequencies ranging from 1000 to 4500 Hz. Outer/middle ear status was assessed with tympanometry through indices of peak compensated static acoustic admittance, tympanometric width, tympanometric peak pressure, ear canal volume, and middle ear resonance frequency. Tympanograms were recorded with probe-tone frequencies of 226 and 678 Hz. DPOAE amplitudes were significantly larger for children with SCD ( p &lt; .05). There were no group differences in any of the middle ear indices ( p &gt; .05). These findings suggest that increased DPOAE amplitudes for children with SCD cannot be attributed to differences in outer/middle ear function as assessed with tympanometry.",

This study describes a survey approach to help audiologists partner with otolaryngologists and pediatricians in EHDIPs.We developed and mailed a 19-item questionnaire to all 12 otolaryngologists and 66 pediatricians potentially involved in a community-based EHDIP. The questionnaire assessed respondents' demographic data and knowledge of, experiences with, and attitudes toward the service-delivery continuum of UNHSPs.The overall response rate was 45%; all 12 otolaryngologists responded (100%; data from 7 were analyzed), and 23 pediatricians responded (34.8%; all were analyzed). Generally, they were positive toward and knowledgeable about UNHSPs and believed that (a) parent/infant bonding is unaffected by screening, (b) hearing reevaluations following medical services are important, (c) audiologists perform their role adequately, (d) it is important that hearing losses be identified and interventions begun before infants reach 6 months of age, (e) UNHSPs deserve funding, and (f) their role is important, but the physicians also wanted improvements in parent education and referral/follow-ups.The survey method was effective in identifying participating physicians' informational needs and attitudes toward UNHSPs, and in designing outreach programs for them.",

This article addresses the audiologist’s important role in the genetic testing referral and follow-up processes. Method Twenty-four parents whose children were referred to genetic testing for hearing loss were interviewed in depth. Parents were selected to include a diverse range of races, ethnicities, and socioeconomic levels. Interviews were coded and analyzed using qualitative methods. Results Parental associations with genetic testing included feeling personally responsible, feeling relief, and considering metaphysical attributions for their child’s hearing loss. Parental attitudes were related to perceptions and experiences with deafness. Many misconceptions about genetics were also found. Conclusions Audiologists need to be sensitized to parents' personal and sociocultural contexts when discussing genetic testing and should tailor informational and emotional support to parents' requirements when confronting the possibility of their child having a genetic hearing loss.",

Children were assigned in a counterbalanced manner to either the AVRA or VVRA group. Results Significantly more threshold estimates were obtained with AVRA ( M = 5.52) than with VVRA ( M = 3.47). There were no significant differences in performance based on age, hearing status, or gender. Conclusions Number and relative strength of the visual reinforcers used are posited as the main reasons for the disparate outcomes.

Method Previously created SRT and WR materials were presented to 32 Mandarin listeners with normal hearing: 16 speakers of Mainland Mandarin and 16 speakers of Taiwan Mandarin. Hearing abilities were examined using SRT and WR materials created for speakers from 2 different regional dialects. Presentation of the materials occurred during 2 test sessions, counterbalanced across material and listener dialect. Listener responses were evaluated by 2 judges; 1 spoke Mainland Mandarin, and the other spoke Taiwan Mandarin. Results For the SRT and WR results, differences in listener performance were statistically significant across material and listener dialect, with threshold differences of less than 2 dB HL when collapsed across session. The interscorer percentage of agreement was 99.5% for SRT and 99.1% for WR testing. Conclusion Testing with materials in a different regional dialect does have a measurable impact on SRT and WR performance. However, this difference, though reliable, is small enough to have a negligible impact on clinical findings.",

    "abstract": "Linguistic variables alone cannot fully account for bilingual listeners' perception of English-running speech. In the present study, the authors investigated how linguistic and attitudinal factors, in combination, affect bilingual processing of temporally degraded English passages in quiet and in noise.Thirty-six bilinguals with various linguistic and attitudinal characteristics participated in the study. Bilingual individuals completed questionnaires that assessed their language background, willingness to communicate (WTC), and self-perceived communication competency (SPCC) in English. Participants listened to English passage pairs from the Connected Speech Test, presented at 45 dB HL at 3 rates (unprocessed, expanded, compressed), in quiet and in noise.Language proficiency measures were the most significant linguistic variables, accounting for the largest amount of variance in performance across most conditions. Both WTC and SPCC were associated with performance and contributed to regression models. Subscales assessing listeners' WTC and SPCC in a group were more predictive of performance than communication in an interpersonal or public setting. Performance in noise was more difficult to predict than in quiet. Performance with compression was more difficult to predict than with expansion.To fully understand bilingual clients' perception of English speech, hearing professionals should consider their attitudinal characteristics in addition to language background.",

Method Thresholds of vowel formant discrimination were examined for the F2 frequencies of 3 American English vowels for listeners with and without normal hearing. Spectral contrasts of the F2 were enhanced by 3, 6, and 9 dB. Vowel stimuli were presented at 70 and 90 dB SPL. Results The thresholds of listeners with hearing impairment were reduced significantly after spectral enhancement was implemented, especially at 90 dB SPL, whereas normal-hearing listeners did not benefit from spectral enhancement. Conclusion These results indicate that a combination of spectral enhancement of F2 and high speech level is most beneficial to improve vowel formant discrimination for listeners with hearing impairment.",

Adults 30-85 years (N = 1,070) constituted the analytic sample.Physical activity was negatively associated with triglycerides (β = -0.11, p < .05) and insulin (β = -0.27, p < .05); triglycerides (β = 0.01, p < .05), and insulin (β = 0.05, p < .05) were positively associated with high-frequency pure-tone average (HPTA). The direct path from physical activity to HPTA was nonsignificant (β = 0.01, p = .99).Physical activity was associated with select cardiovascular disease risk factors. Several cardiovascular disease risk factors were associated with hearing function.",

    "abstract": "Background The Mountain Home Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center has been diagnosing and treating veterans with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) for almost 2 decades. The clinic protocol includes a 2-week follow-up visit to determine the treatment outcome of the canalith repositioning treatment (CRT). To date, the characteristics of BPPV and treatment efficacy have not been reported in a cohort of veterans with BPPV. Purpose To determine the prevalence and characteristics of veterans diagnosed with BPPV in a Veterans Affairs Medical Center Audiology Clinic and to examine treatment outcomes. Research Design Retrospective chart review. Study Sample A total of 102 veterans who tested positive for BPPV in the Vestibular Clinic at the Mountain Home VA Medical Center from March 2010 to August 2011. Results In 102 veterans who were diagnosed with BPPV, the posterior semicircular canal was most often involved (75%), motion-provoked vertigo was the most common symptom (84%), and the majority (43%) were diagnosed with BPPV in their sixth decade. The prevalence of BPPV in the Audiology Vestibular Clinic was 15.6%. Forty-one percent of veterans reported a symptom onset within 12 months of treatment for BPPV; however, 36% reported their symptoms began &gt; 36 months prior to treatment. CRT was effective (negative Dix–Hallpike/roll test) in most veterans (86%) following 1 treatment appointment ( M = 1.6), but more than half reported incomplete symptom resolution (residual dizziness) at the follow-up appointment. Eighteen percent of veterans experienced a recurrence ( M = 1.8 years; SD = 1.7 years). Conclusions The characteristics and treatment outcomes of BPPV in our veteran cohort was similar to what has been reported in the general population. Future work should focus on improving the timeliness of evaluation and treatment of BPPV and examining the time course and management of residual dizziness.",

A blinded crossover design, including posttrial withdrawal testing, was used to assess aided phoneme perception. The hearing aid conditions included adaptive nonlinear frequency compression (NFC), static NFC, and conventional processing.Enabling either adaptive NFC or static NFC improved group-level detection and recognition results for some high-frequency phonemes, when compared with conventional processing. Mean results for the distinction component of the Phoneme Perception Test (Schmitt, Winkler, Boretzki, & Holube, 2016) were similar to those obtained with conventional processing.Findings suggest that both types of NFC tested in this study provided a similar amount of speech perception benefit, when compared with group-level performance with conventional hearing aid technology. Individual-level results are presented with discussion around patterns of results that differ from the group average.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate whether bilateral cochlear implant (CI) listeners who are fitted with clinical processors are able to benefit from binaural advantages under reverberant conditions. Another aim of this contribution was to determine whether the magnitude of each binaural advantage observed inside a highly reverberant environment differs significantly from the magnitude measured in a near-anechoic environment. Method Ten adults with postlingual deafness who are bilateral CI users fitted with either Nucleus 5 or Nucleus 6 clinical sound processors (Cochlear Corporation) participated in this study. Speech reception thresholds were measured in sound field and 2 different reverberation conditions (0.06 and 0.6 s) as a function of the listening condition (left, right, both) and the noise spatial location (left, front, right). Results The presence of the binaural effects of head-shadow, squelch, summation, and spatial release from masking in the 2 different reverberation conditions tested was determined using nonparametric statistical analysis. In the bilateral population tested, when the ambient reverberation time was equal to 0.6 s, results indicated strong positive effects of head-shadow and a weaker spatial release from masking advantage, whereas binaural squelch and summation contributed no statistically significant benefit to bilateral performance under this acoustic condition. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies, which have demonstrated that head-shadow yields the most pronounced advantage in noise. The finding that spatial release from masking produced little to almost no benefit in bilateral listeners is consistent with the hypothesis that additive reverberation degrades spatial cues and negatively affects binaural performance. Conclusions The magnitude of 4 different binaural advantages was measured on the same group of bilateral CI subjects fitted with clinical processors in 2 different reverberation conditions. The results of this work demonstrate the impeding properties of reverberation on binaural speech understanding. In addition, results indicate that CI recipients who struggle in everyday listening environments are also more likely to benefit less in highly reverberant environments from their bilateral processors.",

Evidence of test-retest reliability was found for 5 tests and demonstrated moderate to good correlation between results on repeated administration (r = .59-.92).

No evidence was found to either support or dispute claims of usefulness or value.A medical diagnostic framework is useful for evaluating dichotic tests. Although dichotic procedures show moderate reliability, the absence of a widely accepted gold standard reference test limits our ability to assess their value.

The primary objective of the present experiment was to determine if an SOT learning effect is present in individuals with a unilateral vestibular impairment (UVI), and if so, whether it is different from healthy controls. The secondary objective was to determine if the learning effect is dependent on the time frame of repeated SOT assessments.Eleven individuals diagnosed with a UVI and 11 controls underwent 6 repetitions of the SOT over 2 visits (3 per visit all within 1 week). A second control group underwent 3 SOT repetitions, with each repetition separated by 1 week, to evaluate the time course of the SOT learning effect.No statistically significant differences were found between the UVI group and the control group. In addition, the magnitude of the learning effect was found to be similar regardless of the length of time that separated the repetitions.If the SOT is to be used as a measure of improvement, the learning effect should be exhausted (which typically occurs following the third administration) prior to the introduction of therapy.

The test was administered during their 30-day hearing aid check or yearly hearing evaluation appointment. Participants were also administered the Digit Span Test of memory function ( Wechsler, 1997 ) and the Nine-Hole Peg Test of manual dexterity ( Mathiowetz, Weber, Kashman, & Volland,1985 ). Results Participants with poorer memory span function performed significantly poorer on the PHAST-R than participants with better memory span. However, no significant relationship between manual dexterity and PHAST-R performance was observed. Experienced hearing aid users who were recently reoriented on how to use and care for their hearing aids performed significantly better on the PHAST-R compared to new hearing aid users and experienced hearing aid users who had not received a hearing aid orientation within the last year. Cleaning the hearing aid and telephone use were the 2 PHAST-R tasks that all hearing aid clients needed the most recounseling on.

Specifically, auditory performance and speech intelligibility ratings were compared across children based on their mode of bilateral stimulation (simultaneous or sequential implantation). Method A retrospective chart review design was used in this study. A total of 46 congenitally deaf children were included. Children ranged in age between 2 and 8 years, with a mean of 3 years 7 months. Participants were divided into 2 groups: those who received their bilateral implant simultaneously and those who received them sequentially. Categories of Auditory Performance (CAP; Archbold, Lutman, & Marshall, 1995 ) scores and Speech Intelligibility Rating (SIR; M. C. Allen, Nikolopoulos, & O'Donoghue, 1998 ) scores were used to measure their performance. Results Children scored an average of 4.1 (±1.6) on the CAP Scale and 1.6 (±1) on the SIR Scale. Results showed that children who received their implants simultaneously scored relatively higher on the CAP Scale than those with sequential implants. However, there were no differences between the 2 groups in SIR scores. These 2 outcome measures were not correlated with age at implantation. Conclusion The current study demonstrated that simultaneous implantation could potentially improve audiologic outcome.",

Method Online reviews of 21 popular PSAPs were collected from the Amazon.com website. The reviews for each product were exported to compile individual product-specific text files. A sentiment mining analysis was completed to aggregate the number of positive and negative comments for each product. In addition, the effect of value for money, available features, perceived benefit, and overall perception of PSAPs was evaluated. A correlational analysis was completed to examine the relationship between different PSAP features and the number of positive and negative comments. Results Mixed-model analysis of variance showed a significantly higher number of positive comments for high- and mid-cost products in terms of overall perception and perceived benefit compared to low-cost products. For feature attribute, high-cost products had significantly higher positive comments compared to mid- and low-cost products. There was a strong correlation between price and positive comments and a moderate correlation between price and negative comments. Also, there was a significant moderate correlation between presence of compression and feedback suppression PSAP features and positive comments. Conclusions Positive sentiments expressed toward PSAPs were found to favor high- and mid-level products. However, there was a considerably high number of negative sentiments reported across all the PSAPs investigated. The noticeable thing is that the negative comments do not change significantly across price ranges. However, the positive comments significantly increase with an increase in product price range. This indicates a possible increase in benefit with high-cost products. However, this claim requires further empirical evidence through controlled studies.",

Frequency of practice, access to PMM system, practiced protocols, barriers, and perception toward the benefits of PMM were identified through a survey. Method A questionnaire was distributed to and filled in by the audiologists who provided pediatric amplification service in Klang Valley, Malaysia. One hundred eight (N = 108) audiologists, composed of 90.3% women and 9.7% men (age range: 23-48 years), participated in the survey. Results PMM was not a clinical routine practiced by a majority of the audiologists, despite its recognition as the best clinical practice that should be incorporated into protocols for fitting hearing aids in children. Variations in practice existed warranting further steps to improve the current practice for children with hearing impairment. The lack of access to PMM equipment was 1 major barrier for the audiologists to practice real-ear verification. Practitioners' characteristics such as time constraints, low confidence, and knowledge levels were also identified as barriers that impede the uptake of the evidence-based practice. Conclusions The implementation of PMM in clinical practice remains a challenge to the audiology profession. A knowledge-transfer approach that takes into consideration the barriers and involves effective collaboration or engagement between the knowledge providers and potential stakeholders is required to promote the clinical application of evidence-based best practice.",

Method Adolescents (N = 152) from ethnically diverse backgrounds responded to a survey investigating their awareness about Audiology. Thereafter, they participated in an educational program on the profession of Audiology. One third of the participants were invited to respond to the survey immediately after the educational program. Six months after the educational program, 120 of the original sample of 152 participants responded again to the survey in order to assess if the gains from the educational program were retained. Results The results from the baseline survey indicated that approximately 25% of participants were aware about the profession of Audiology. None of the participants reported that balance assessment or management was within the scope of practice of audiologists in the baseline survey. The chi-square test indicated that the educational program resulted in significant enhancement in awareness about the profession of Audiology immediately after education. Results also indicated that the gains in knowledge were retained 6 months after education. Conclusion In light of the existing literature, it is clear that there is a need to recruit an ethnically diverse talent pool of individuals who will choose a career in Audiology in the forthcoming decades. Preliminary results from this study could be helpful in strategizing efforts to improve the visibility of Audiology to younger college aspirants.

The purpose of this study was to assess whether similar working memory benefits are observed following provision of cochlear implants (CIs). Method Fifteen adults with postlingually acquired severe bilateral sensorineural hearing loss completed the prospective longitudinal study. Participants were candidates for bilateral cochlear implantation with some aidable hearing in each ear. Implantation surgeries were carried out sequentially, approximately 1 year apart. Working memory was measured with the visual Reading Span Test (Daneman & Carpenter, 1980) at 5 time points: pre-operatively following a 6-month bilateral hearing aid trial, after 6 and 12 months of bimodal (CI plus contralateral hearing aid) listening experience following the 1st CI surgery and activation, and again after 6 and 12 months of bilateral CI listening experience following the 2nd CI surgery and activation. Results Compared to the preoperative baseline, CI listening experience yielded significant improvements in participants' ability to recall test words in the correct serial order after 12 months in the bimodal condition. Individual performance outcomes were variable, but almost all participants showed increases in task performance over the course of the study. Conclusions These results suggest that, similar to appropriate interventions with hearing aids, treatment of hearing loss with CIs can yield working memory benefits. A likely mechanism is the freeing of cognitive resources previously devoted to effortful listening.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Difficulties in speech-in-noise understanding are often reported in individuals with tinnitus. Building on our previous findings that speech-in-noise performance is correlated with subjective loudness of tinnitus, this study aimed to investigate the effect of tinnitus pitch on consonant recognition in noise. Method Pure-tone audiometry and the Quick Speech-in-Noise Test were conducted on 66 participants categorized into four groups by their hearing sensitivity and self-report of tinnitus. Consonant recognition scores at various frequency ranges were obtained at the 5 dB SNR condition of the Quick Speech-in-Noise Test. Participants with tinnitus also completed a tinnitus pitch-matching procedure. Correlation analyses were conducted between tinnitus pitch and the frequency of the worst consonant recognition, and the error rates based on word and sentence position were compared. Results Regardless of hearing sensitivity, tinnitus pitch did not correlate with the frequency of the worst consonant recognition. Sentence-initial word recognition was affected by hearing loss, whereas sentence-final word recognition was not affected by hearing loss or tinnitus. In contrast to individuals with normal hearing, participants with hearing loss varied in full-sentence recognition, with those reporting tinnitus exhibiting significantly higher error rates. Conclusions The findings suggest that the effect of tinnitus on consonant recognition in noise may involve higher level functions more than perceptual characteristics of tinnitus. Furthermore, for individuals with speech-in-noise concerns, clinical evaluation should address both hearing sensitivity and the presence of tinnitus. Future speech-in-noise studies should incorporate cognitive tests and, possibly, brain imaging to parse out the contribution of cognitive factors, such as cognitive control, in speech-in-noise in tinnitus.",

Pure-tone thresholds were also measured under the supraaural earphone.FRESH noise thresholds were similar to pure-tone and warbled-tone thresholds regardless of audiometric configuration. For the group with gradually sloping hearing loss, thresholds obtained with narrowband noise were approximately 4 dB better than those obtained with the other test stimuli. For the group with steeply sloping hearing loss, narrowband noise significantly underestimated hearing thresholds-the steeper the hearing loss, the greater the underestimation.When hearing loss is suspected, FRESH noise is appropriate for accurately determining audiometric thresholds in sound field and under earphones. A wider band, attention-getting stimulus such as narrowband noise can result in thresholds that are inaccurate. Clinical decision making regarding choice of test stimulus is discussed.",

    "abstract": "This study examined reception thresholds for sentences (RTSs) as a function of test session (N = 5) and noise (continuous and interrupted) in normal-hearing adults. It was hypothesized that RTSs would be superior in interrupted noise and would be stable across repeated testing.Twenty-five normal-hearing adults participated. RTSs were determined with Hearing in Noise Test sentences in continuous and interrupted noise presented at 65 dBA. An adaptive technique was used where sentences varied in intensity to converge on a level of 50% of correct performance. Sentence lists were counterbalanced with 5 unique lists in both continuous and interrupted noise.RTS signal-to-noise ratios were significantly better in the interrupted noise (p < .0001). There was no effect of test session (p = .12) or a Test Session × Noise interaction (p = .13).Stable RTS signal-to-noise ratios across test sessions in both noises are consistent with the notion that a learning effect was not present in noise. Further, one may conclude that Hearing in Noise Test sentences provide stable measures of sentence recognition thresholds in normal-hearing adults over time so long as sentences are unique or are not repeated.",

The purpose of the current study was to assist monolingual English-speaking audiologists working with Spanish-speaking Hispanic patients by developing appropriate cultural and language instruction materials.Test descriptions and instructions for hearing and balance tests were developed in English and Spanish. A cultural training module was also created. The first draft of these resources was reviewed by nonaudiologists (bilingual and Spanish monolingual) and audiologists (bilingual and English monolingual). Videos were recorded of the Spanish test instructions read aloud.Overall, ratings from audiologists and nonaudiologists indicated the translations were easy to understand, and the wording/dialect was appropriate for the region. Audiologists generally reported the information was consistent with what they use clinically, although variability existed in specific wording used. Reviewers rated the cultural training module as easy to understand, relevant to Spanish-speaking patients, and relevant to audiologists. The materials were revised and edited based on feedback from reviewers.The current study developed materials for monolingual English-speaking audiologists working with Spanish-speaking Hispanic patients.

Male subjects and subjects with developmental delay were less likely to avoid testing with anesthesia. None of the subjects with a comorbidity of developmental delay completed a pediatric hearing evaluation successfully.

No significant outcome differences were measured as a function of referral source.Processes implemented in this study resulted in elimination of the need to use anesthesia to evaluate hearing in a large portion of patients referred. Success rates for avoiding anesthesia may vary depending on available resources, physician education, and population tested.

The current study compared the performance of older adults on 2 tests of temporal resolution, one with random gaps and the other with gaps in the center of a noise signal. The study also determined which of the 2 tests was able to detect more temporal resolution deficits in older individuals.Two tests of temporal resolution, the Gap Detection Test (GDT; Shivaprakash, 2003) and the Gaps-In-Noise test (GIN; Musiek et al., 2005), were administered to 31 older adults with near normal hearing, aged 55 to 70 years. The order in which the tests were administered was randomized.The gap-detection thresholds obtained using GIN were significantly higher than those obtained using GDT. The difference in thresholds was ascribed to the randomness with which gaps were interspersed within noise segments in the 2 tests. More individuals failed on GIN than GDT. The older adults with high-frequency hearing loss obtained poorer gap thresholds than those with normal hearing.The results indicated that older individuals failed GIN more often compared to GDT. This was attributed to the differences in stimuli and procedure used in the 2 tests.",

This study aimed to determine the accuracy of 40-Hz sinusoidal auditory steady-state response (sASSR) compared with tone burst auditory brainstem response (TB-ABR) to detect mild, low-frequency hearing loss in children with otitis media with effusion and to measure postoperative thresholds. Methods Thresholds at 500 and 4000 Hz were measured behaviorally and electrophysiologically using TB-ABR and 40-Hz sASSR with a Kalman filter in 26 children with otitis media with effusion. Recording was conducted preoperatively and postoperatively while children were actively awake. Repeated measures mixed analyses of variance were conducted to determine effects among measures and the two test frequencies. Results Both 40-Hz sASSR and TB-ABR accurately detected preoperative and postoperative thresholds and were within 5–10 dB of the behavioral thresholds at 4000 Hz. At 500 Hz, the mean 40-Hz sASSR threshold was only 5 dB above the behavioral thresholds and 18 dB better than the 500-Hz ABR threshold. Positive correlations were found but not between 40-sASSR and TB-ABR at 500 Hz. Also, the interrater judgment of the response was better for sASSR (89%) than TB-ABR (83%). Conclusion The 40-Hz sASSR is more accurate than TB-ABR in determining a mild, low-frequency threshold.",

Method College-age students ( N = 523) completed a paper-and-pencil survey tapping their behaviors, knowledge, and motivation regarding listening to music or media at high volume using PLDs. Participants rated their motivation to listen to PLDs at lower volume levels following each of three information sets: text only, behind-the-ear hearing aid image with text, and inner ear hair cell damage image with text.

The majority of clients reported hearing loss and low vision that interfered with their communication. Otoscopic examination revealed that nearly a third of the ears contained excessive cerumen. Visual perception results indicated that nearly all clients could see the clinician's head movements, but that some clients could not see mouth or eye movements. Fewer than half of the clients owned hearing aids, but not all owners used them. Common problems related to non-use of hearing aids included blocked earmolds and dead batteries. Sentence identification and conversational fluency were improved by the use of amplification, but positive results often depended on application of communication strategies by the partner.

Data were collected in reverberant and anechoic environments in quiet and noise, at sensation levels of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 dB. Results indicated a significant effect of reverberation on LBTs for both participant groups. LBTs increased with sensation level in the reverberant environment and decreased with increasing sensation level in the anechoic environment. There was no effect of hearing loss on LBTs. When the change in LBT due to noise was compared, the effect of noise depended on group and environment, with a greater effect of noise on the performance of listeners with impaired hearing. It is likely that the ability to fuse direct sounds and early reflections is degraded in listeners with impaired hearing and that this contributes to the difficulties experienced by these listeners in reverberation and noise.",

An exit interview was used to evaluate the MHHI’s clinical utility. Results Results revealed the MHHI to have high test–retest reliability and high internal-consistency reliability, and thus to have statistical properties similar to those of the original screening versions of the Hearing Handicap Inventories for Adults and for the Elderly.

Method A rapid review or a streamlined approach to systematically identify and summarize relevant studies was performed. Selected health sciences databases were searched using a search strategy developed with the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, and outcome) framework. Studies eligible for inclusion had older adult participants with hearing loss and utilized technology-based auditory training in laboratory or home settings. Results The study quality of most studies was found to be low to moderate, with concentrations between low and moderate. Major issues were related to study design and reporting, such as the need for blinding and a control group, larger sample sizes, and a follow-up for long-term outcomes of auditory training interventions. Wide variability in training approaches, participant backgrounds (e.g., audiograms, hearing aid use), and outcome measures are also noted. Conclusions Evidence on the effectiveness of auditory training is mixed. Future research should include high-quality randomized controlled trials with representative populations; follow-up periods to study long-term effects; and exploration of behavioral, electrophysiological, and self-reported outcome measures. Recommendations for study designs and methodologies are also discussed.",

Method This was a retrospective analysis of data from 11,729 older adults included in two population, one community, and two clinical data sets. To aid in the interpretation of the audiogram classifications, the functional significance of audiogram categories was evaluated using Hearing Handicap Inventory–Screen scores available for 10,330 of these same individuals. Results A WARHICS level could be obtained successfully for 99.5% of the 11,729 audiograms included in these analyses. It was applied successfully to population, community, and clinical samples. WARHICS Level 8 audiograms, corresponding to a broad profound hearing impairment (pure-tone thresholds from 500 to 8000 Hz, all &gt; 80 dB HL), were very rare (.1% prevalence). WARHICS subtypes, designed to identify those with high-frequency notched audiograms or flat audiograms, occurred only 3%–6% of the time, depending on the data set. When compared to the current hearing-impairment grading system of the World Health Organization (WHO), several WARHICS levels fell within a given WHO hearing-impairment grade suggesting a finer grained categorization by the WARHICS. The Hearing Handicap Inventory–Screen scores provided justification for the fine-grained categorization according to the WARHICS. It is also demonstrated that the WARHICS levels could be extended to the classification of audiograms from all adults, regardless of age. Finally, a WARHICS-WHO hybrid classification scheme is proposed for future evaluation. Conclusions Although the WARHICS was developed from a population data set, it was demonstrated here to be applicable to population, community, and clinical data sets for adults aged 50–89 years. The applicability of the WARHICS or a WARHICS-WHO hybrid to population data sets that included younger adults suggests that this classification system has the potential to be applied even more broadly than just to age-related hearing loss.",

    "abstract": "Objectives The aim of this study was to generate a conceptual framework describing which aspects of children and adolescents' lives are affected by chronic tinnitus. Design Views and experiences of 32 participants from two participant groups informed this study: (a) a tinnitus group, consisting of adults who had experienced tinnitus during childhood and/or adolescence and primary carers of children/adolescents with tinnitus, and (b) a clinicians' group, consisting of clinicians who provided care for children/adolescents with tinnitus. Participants produced statements describing aspects of children/adolescents' lives that may be affected by chronic tinnitus. Key concepts were identified through the processes of sorting the statements and rating them for degree of associated impact. Result Participants identified 118 unique aspects of the lives of children/adolescents who may be affected by chronic tinnitus. These were clustered into four concepts: (a) emotional well-being, (b) academic performances, (c) social/relationa, and (d) auditory/cognitive processing. At a group level, participants rated the impact of tinnitus as above a slight degree but below a moderate degree of impact. However, individual participant's ratings indicated a range of perceived impact for each statement. Conclusions The experience of chronic tinnitus during childhood and adolescence extends beyond the mere perception of sound. The perception of tinnitus may impact a child's emotional well-being, academic performances, social/relational, and auditory/cognitive processing. The impact of tinnitus in one aspect of a child's life may influence other aspects of their life. While at a group level, participants regarded the impact of tinnitus as “somewhat more than mild” to “less than moderate”; individual participant's ratings indicate that the impact from chronic tinnitus may be highly individual and highlighted the importance of individual assessment and management. Clinically, tinnitus management during childhood and adolescence may be improved if clinicians consider the impact and manifestation of tinnitus within each child's daily life and tailor tinnitus education and management strategies accordingly.",

Method In this cross-sectional analytical comparative study, 47 patients (35 women and 12 men) aged 18-80 years with posterior canal BPPV were randomly assigned to one of two following groups: the control group, who received the modified Epley procedure only, and the VRT group, who received the modified Epley procedure plus vestibular rehabilitation for 4 weeks. Outcome measures, including the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), the Vertigo Symptom Scale-Long Version (VSS-L), and the Vertigo Symptom Scale-Short Form (VSS-SF), were conducted on the same session before initial therapy (T1), at 48 hr later (T2), and at 4 weeks later (T3). Presence or absence of residual dizziness was evaluated at T2. Results Residual dizziness was found in 20 (42.6%) patients after a successful modified Epley procedure. There was no statistically significant difference between the mean DHI, VSS-L, and VSS-SF scores at T1, T2, and T3 in patients who manifested with residual dizziness and those without residual dizziness in both groups. The average DHI, VSS-L, and VSS-SF score reduced during the time in both groups. These results were demonstrated that the VRT group and the control group have similar reductions in symptoms after treatment with the VRT plus modified Epley procedure and the modified Epley procedure only, respectively. Conclusions Residual dizziness is a common condition after a successful modified Epley procedure for BPPV. The VRT plus modified Epley procedure is as effective as modified Epley procedure alone in the management of residual dizziness.

    "abstract": "Purpose Smartphone apps for tinnitus relief are now emerging; however, research supporting their use and effectiveness is lacking. Research has shown that Tinnitus Therapy sounds intended for individuals with acoustic hearing provide relief to some patients using cochlear implants (CIs) with tinnitus. Here, we evaluated the use and acceptability of a smartphone app to help CI patients with tinnitus. Method Participants completed a laboratory trial (n = 19) and an at-home trial (n = 14) using the ReSound Tinnitus Relief app to evaluate its acceptability and effectiveness in reducing their tinnitus. During the laboratory trial, participants selected a sound that was most acceptable in managing their tinnitus (termed chosen sound). Word recognition scores in quiet were obtained before and after sound therapy. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups for the at-home trial, that is, AB or BA, using (A) the chosen sound for 2 weeks and (B) the study sound (i.e., broadband noise at hearing threshold) for another 2 weeks. Ratings were collected weekly to determine acceptability and effectiveness of the app in reducing tinnitus loudness and annoyance. Results Results indicated that some, but not all, participants found their chosen sound to be acceptable and/or effective in reducing their tinnitus. A majority of the participants rated the chosen sound or the study sound to be acceptable in reducing their tinnitus. Word recognition scores for most participants were not adversely affected using the chosen sound; however, a significant decrease was observed for three participants. All 14 participants had a positive experience with the app during the at-home trial on tests of sound therapy acceptability, effectiveness, and word recognition. Conclusions Sound therapy using a smartphone app can be effective for many tinnitus patients using CIs. Audiologists should recommend a sound and a level for tinnitus masking that do not interfere with speech perception.",

To determine whether ANL is influenced more by afferent or efferent cortical responsiveness, the authors measured differences in temporal masking responses between individuals with low versus high ANLs. If listeners with low ANLs have masked thresholds similar to those of listeners with high ANLs, low ANLs may be due to reduced afferent responsiveness affecting both the masker and signal. If, however, listeners with low ANLs have masked thresholds better than that of listeners with high ANLs, there may be a physiological basis for improved selective attention via stronger efferent inhibition of the \"unwanted\" sound.Participants were 19 listeners with normal hearing between the ages of 19 and 35. Ten listeners had low ANLs and 9 had high ANLs. All participants were compared using tone-in-noise simultaneous, forward, and backward masking tasks.Results revealed no observed differences in masked thresholds between the low versus high ANL group. The low ANL group, however, required significantly more threshold runs to achieve criterion necessary for threshold determinations.Findings suggest that low ANLs are associated with reduced afferent cortical responsiveness and, possibly, decreased sustained attention.",

Measured occlusion effect was calculated from aided and unaided real-ear responses obtained while subjects vocalized /i/. Perceived occlusion measures were acquired using an occlusion effect scale. Results Measured occlusion was greatest for the largest receiver. The most common perceived occlusion ratings were none to mild occlusion for all receiver sizes. Perceived ratings were weakly correlated to acoustic measures. There was little to no correlation between receiver size and estimated ear canal volume. Conclusions Measured and perceived occlusion was minor in all receiver conditions. Occlusion was not correlated to ear canal volume, suggesting that RIC hearing aids most often result in negligible amounts of measured and perceived occlusion effect, regardless of ear canal size. Because no significant relationship existed between the occlusion measures, clinicians may need to consider that self-rating of occlusion may not match measured occlusion results.",

All measures were made with an insert earphone coupled to a standard foam tip and with an insert earphone coupled to each participant's personal earmold.Threshold and RECD measures obtained with a personal earmold were significantly different from those obtained with a foam tip on repeated measures analyses of variance. One-sample t tests showed these differences to vary systematically with increasing tubing length, with the largest average differences (7-8 dB) occurring at 4 kHz.This systematic examination demonstrates the equal and opposite effects of tubing length on threshold and acoustic measures. Specifically, as tubing length increased, sound pressure level in the ear canal decreased, affecting both hearing thresholds and the real-ear portion of the RECDs. This demonstration shows that when the same coupling method is used to obtain the hearing thresholds and RECD, equal and accurate estimates of real-ear sound pressure level are obtained.",

Method The study sample in this exploratory, descriptive, and comparative study comprised 40 female subjects who were evaluated: 20 had tinnitus and 20 formed the control group. The contralateral AR threshold was evaluated at the frequencies of 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz. Results Elevated or absent AR thresholds were found only in subjects with complaints of tinnitus. At all frequencies and in either ear, the median AR threshold was higher in the group that complained of tinnitus (100.0 dB; range = 95.0–100.0 dB) compared with the control group (90.0 dB; range = 86.3–95.0 dB; p &lt; .01). There was a statistically significant difference ( p &lt; .05) in the group with tinnitus, in each of the frequencies studied and in both the right and left ear. Conclusion The results suggest that evaluation of the efferent system, through AR, could be an important tool for the differential diagnosis of tinnitus in patients whose hearing was within clinically normal limits.",

    "abstract": "Negative cognitions related to tinnitus sensation have been previously shown to affect the level of emotional distress. Anxiety sensitivity is another psychological factor that influences individuals to more closely monitor their own bodily sensations, resulting in increased negative cognitions and negative emotional responses among tinnitus patients. However, increasing acceptance of tinnitus sensation may attenuate emotional distress. The goal of this research was to investigate the relationship between negative tinnitus-related cognitions, acceptance, and anxiety sensitivity.Two hundred sixty-seven participants completed online measures of the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (Newman, Jacobson, & Spitzer, 1996), Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (Hayes, Follette, & Linehan, 2004), and the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (Taylor et al., 2007).Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that acceptance fully mediated the relationship between negative tinnitus-related cognitions and anxiety sensitivity.On the basis of these results, it is suggested that practitioners improve acceptance of tinnitus sensation, duration, and intensity. More research is warranted on the clinical techniques to improve acceptance.",

ASSRs were elicited by repeated tone-burst stimuli presented at rates of 40 and 0.75 Hz at 3 frequencies and 5 levels of stimulus intensity. The design also permitted scrutiny of any gender bias to the results.Similar to derived transient response findings, ASSR magnitude (harmonic sum) systematically increased with intensity. Input-output function only at 0.75 Hz approximated a log-log linear function. However, slopes fell well below that of doubling of loudness per 10 dB SPL. Results failed to demonstrate significance as a function of carrier frequency and gender for both repetition rates.Effects of stimulus intensity, carrier frequency, and gender on ASSRs were similar to those of their transient counterparts. Findings remain disappointing for objective loudness estimation.

Five neurotologists rated the importance of disease on 3 dimensions related to the necessity of detection prior to adult hearing aid fitting.Ratings of adverse health consequences, diagnostic difficulty, and presence of nonotologic symptoms associated with these diseases resulted in the identification of 104 diseases potentially important for detection prior to adult hearing aid fitting.Current and evolving health care delivery systems, including direct-to-consumer sales, involve inconsistent means of disease detection vigilance prior to device fitting. The first steps in determining the safety of these different delivery methods are to identify and prioritize which diseases present the greatest risk for poor health outcomes and, thus, should be detected in hearing health care delivery systems. Here the authors have developed a novel multidimensional rating system to rank disease importance. The rankings can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative detection methods and to inform public health policy. The authors are currently using this information to validate a consumer questionnaire designed to accurately identify when pre- fitting medical evaluations should be required for hearing aid patients.",

However, the literature on the manifestation and impact of hyperacusis on children is scant. This qualitative study examined online discussion forums to understand the lived experiences of hyperacusis in children from a parent or carer perspective.Posts from publicly available online discussion forums were thematically analyzed. Online searching identified 219 potentially relevant conversation threads across 18 forums and involving 1,436 forum users. A total number of 170 eligible conversation threads, containing 1,834 messages, were used in the analysis.Thematic analysis of the data generated six themes: personal and health information about the child, onset and prognosis, bothersome sounds and characteristics, reactions, coping strategies, and impact. Hyperacusis onset was associated with loud noise, physical trauma, or stress. Bothersome sounds were categorized in terms of appliances, vehicles, public places, nature, and very loud sounds. Children's reactions included panic, shaking, and screaming. Strategies to manage hyperacusis included ear defenders, building up tolerance, and school adaptations. Hyperacusis had an impact on various aspects of the child's life including academic performance and social development.This is the first study to account for the lived experiences of children experiencing hyperacusis from a parent/carer perspective using online forum data.

    "abstract": "Purpose: Characterizing and comparing speech recognition development in children with cochlear implants (CIs) is challenging because of variations in test type. This retrospective cohort study modified the Pediatric Ranked Order Speech Perception (PROSPER) scoring system to (a) longitudinally analyze the speech perception of children with CIs and (b) examine the role of age at CI activation, listening mode (i.e., unilateral or bilateral implantation), and interimplant interval. Method: Postimplantation speech recognition scores from 31 children with prelingual, severe-to-profound hearing loss who received CIs were analyzed (12 with unilateral CI [UniCI], 13 with sequential bilateral CIs [SEQ BiCIs], and six with simultaneous BiCIs). Data were extracted from the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Audiology database. A version of the PROSPER score was modified to integrate the varying test types by mapping raw scores from different tests into a single score. The PROSPER scores were used to construct speech recognition growth curves of the implanted ears, which were characterized by the slope of the growth phase, the time from activation to the plateau onset, and the score at the plateau. Results: While speech recognition improved considerably for children following implantation, the growth rates and scores at the plateau were highly variable. In first implanted ears, later implantation was associated with poorer scores at the plateau (β = −0.15, p = .01), but not growth rate. The first implanted ears of children with BiCIs had better scores at the plateau than those with UniCI (β = 0.59, p = .02). Shorter interimplant intervals in children with SEQ BiCIs promoted faster speech recognition growth of the first implanted ears. Conclusion: The modified PROSPER score could be used clinically to track speech recognition development in children with CIs, to assess influencing factors, and to assist in developing and evaluating patient-specific intervention strategies.

    "abstract": "Military service personnel are at increased risk for developing tinnitus due to heightened exposure to acoustic trauma. The auditory disorder is the leading service-connected disability among veterans and is highly comorbidly diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The biopsychosocial model illustrates that chronic health conditions are exacerbated or maintained by psychiatric distress. Therefore, alleviation of such psychiatric distress can have beneficial impacts on health conditions, such as tinnitus. The aim of this study was to determine whether individuals with both disorders who receive evidence-based therapy for PTSD will experience decreases in both PTSD and tinnitus-related distress.Veterans with comorbid bothersome tinnitus and PTSD received cognitive processing therapy and were assessed for PTSD, tinnitus-related distress, and depression at baseline and 1 month posttreatment follow-up.At posttreatment follow-up, participants demonstrated significant decreases in PTSD symptoms compared to their baseline scores. Participants also demonstrated decreased tinnitus-related distress and depression, with high effect sizes.This pilot study demonstrated that clinical management addressing psychiatric distress, as associated with PTSD, may simultaneously provide benefit for patients with bothersome tinnitus. Although not statistically significant due to the small sample size, large effect sizes indicate that tinnitus-related distress decreased as a function of receiving evidence-based therapy for PTSD. Future clinical trials should increase sample sizes and compare effects to control conditions.",

While new users' benefit was equally as good for blended and conventional service provision, blended provision was less efficient and required more follow-up visits. For existing hearing aid users, no differences were seen in GHADP outcomes of different pathways and remote fittings increased service efficiency.Remote hearing aid fittings are less effective for new users than hearing aids fitted using standard face-to-face service provision or service provision using a blended model of remote and face-to-face care. Current pathways using a blended model of care are less efficient but equally effective for new hearing aid users compared with provision prior to COVID-19 and result in equivalent patient outcomes in terms of benefit.https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.21067585.",

Dual sensory impairment (DSI) is a risk factor for dementia, but whether DSI is associated with SCCs is unknown. We evaluated whether self-reported DSI is associated with SCCs.We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 9,899 community-dwelling respondents aged 60+ years without dementia or depression in the 2019 National Health Interview Survey. Participants self-reported difficulty remembering or concentrating, seeing even when wearing corrective lenses, and hearing even when using a hearing aid. We defined SCCs and sensory impairment for each mode as reporting at least some difficulty. We categorized sensory impairment into no sensory impairment, vision impairment only, hearing impairment only, and DSI. We then estimated weighted prevalence ratios (PRs) of SCCs by impairment category.After weighting (9,899 participants representing a weighted n = 59,261,749), 12% of participants reported vision impairment only, 19% reported hearing impairment only, and 7% reported DSI. Relative to no impairment, after adjustment for potential confounders, vision impairment (PR = 2.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.79, 2.39]), hearing impairment (PR = 2.26; 95% CI [2.00, 2.55]), and DSI (PR = 3.21; 95% CI [2.83, 3.63]) were associated with an increased prevalence of SCCs.In this nationally representative survey of older Americans, DSI was associated with a threefold increased prevalence of SCCs.

However, the majority perceived that creating awareness and training on telehealth was important.Effective management for people with hearing loss needs to consider the challenges faced by them, as the world prepares to live with the coronavirus. Clinical protocols should consider providing a service that is helpful for the clients as well as safe and sustainable in future pandemics.",

    "abstract": "Optimal measurement settings to measure the medial olivocochlear reflex (MOCR) in humans have not yet been defined. The purpose of this study was to advance the representation of the MOCR in auditory brainstem response (ABR) as an addition to the current diagnostic portfolio.Twelve female and 14 male normal-hearing adults participated in the study. Potential effects of a contralateral acoustic stimulus (CAS) on amplitude changes were investigated by recording ABR waveform profiles on the left side at click intensities of 50/60/70 dB nHL with and without CAS (60 dB SPL). Secondly, to detect potential chronological order influences, measurement settings were rearranged on the right side and measurements were repeated. Additionally, ABR thresholds were recorded with and without a CAS in 10 patients.When the effect of contralateral suppression was analyzed on the basis of amplitude changes, there was a change under administration of the CAS signal that was statistically significant. Interestingly, the order of recordings affected the degree of amplitude change. In three out of 10 patients, reproducible suppression effects on ABR thresholds were detectable upon CAS presentation.To our knowledge, this is the largest study dealing with the recording of the MOCR elicited by a contralateral noise via ABR in normal-hearing individuals. Effects of MOCR are measurable via amplitude changes upon CAS administration. Chronological orders influence the impact of this effect on amplitude changes. Optimal measurement settings have not yet been defined. However, experiments such as this study may help to further improve measurements, and thus advance the representation of the MOC reflex in ABR as an addition to the current diagnostic portfolio.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Although benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is often considered benign and easily treatable, aberrant cases of persistent BPPV can be challenging to manage. Detailed differential diagnosis is essential as central-, vascular-, and cervical-related etiologies may mirror the presentation of persistent BPPV. In addition, an understanding of alternative noninvasive treatment options is important as persistent BPPV is often refractory to traditional particle repositioning maneuvers (PRMs). This article reviews clinical considerations for persistent BPPV. Method: A case of a 68-year-old male diagnosed with posterior semicircular canal BPPV (PC-BPPV) and received various unsuccessful PRMs treatments is described. His clinical presentation is referenced alongside various possible etiologies to discern the most likely diagnosis. Nonsurgical treatment options for intractable PC-BPPV will also be reviewed. Conclusions: BPPV recalcitrant to PRM treatment warrants investigation of other etiologies; however, key elements of the case history and objective examination are helpful for differential diagnosis. Brandt-Daroff exercises may facilitate habituation of symptoms secondary to persistent BPPV. More research is needed to understand the use of multiaxial repositioning chairs for the treatment of intractable BPPV.",

RIs were calculated using nonparametric methods and interrater reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients between three audiologists who independently reviewed and cleaned the data.Reference populations for each outcome measure comprised 40 to 72 individuals, 19 to 61 years of age, who served either as noninjured controls (NIC) or injured controls (IC) in the 15-year study; none had a history of TBI or blast exposure. A subset of 15 SMVs from the NIC, IC, and TBI groups were included in the interrater reliability calculations. RIs are reported for 27 outcome measures from the seven rotational vestibular and balance tests. Interrater reliability was considered excellent for all tests except the crHIT, which was found to have good interrater reliability.This study provides clinicians and scientists with important information regarding normative ranges and interrater reliability for rotational vestibular and balance tests in SMVs.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study investigated to what extent residual hearing and rehabilitation options (e.g., hearing aids [HAs]) affect the auditory cortex in children with hearing loss. Method: Twenty-one children with bilateral congenital sensorineural hearing loss who were candidates for cochlear implantation were recruited. Voxel-based morphometry analysis was conducted to assess the gray matter (GM) volume in the auditory cortex. Children's residual hearing was measured by pure-tone audiometry at different frequencies. Multiple linear regression models were conducted to examine the effects of residual hearing and the use of HAs on GM volume in the auditory cortex with the control of age and gender. Results: Children with more residual hearing at high frequencies had larger GM volume ratio (corrected by total intracranial volume) in the left Heschl's gyrus ( r = −.545, p = .013). An interaction effect between residual hearing and the use of HAs suggested that the effect of residual hearing on GM ratio was moderated by the use of HAs (β = −.791, p = .020). Compared with children with less residual hearing, children who had more residual hearing benefited more from longer use of HAs in terms of a larger GM ratio. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings highlight the impact of residual hearing on the neuroanatomy of the auditory cortex in children with hearing loss. Moreover, our results call for more auditory input via HAs for children with more residual hearing to preserve the auditory cortex before cochlear implantation. For children with less residual hearing who might receive limited benefit from HAs, an early cochlear implant would be necessary.",

Data from audiological examinations and self-reported hearing difficulties were used to compare subjective and objective hearing. Hearing aid use was also assessed.Over 40% of the participants had some level of hearing loss (n = 155, 44.8%), and 31% (n = 133) of these reported having hearing problems during subjective assessment. Only 18 (10%) of those with objectively measured hearing loss reported using hearing aids.There was an inconsistency between measured and self-perceived hearing loss among adults aged 61-63 years in this cohort. The small number of hearing aid users in the cohort is a concern, in that people in this age group appear not to be getting the help they need. The data also add to the research evidence that people at this age underestimate their hearing loss.",

Results: Five participants (25%) fell in the 6 months after the research session. Significant correlations were noted between prospective falls and age, home safety modifications, engagement in fall prevention activities, and history of falls in the last 12 months. Conclusion: Straightforward case history questions that could be part of a routine audiologic evaluation, such as fall history in the previous year, are significantly correlated with prospective number of falls in 6 months.

Perceiving speech in noise, a situation commonly encountered by humans, requires the irrelevant noise to be inhibited while processing the relevant speech stimulus. We hypothesized that the two (sensory gating and speech perception in noise [SPiN]) might be related and that sensory gating may provide evidence of cortical inhibition involved in SPiN.An observational research following a correlational design was conducted on 10 neurotypical individuals. Auditory sensory gating was assessed using a conditioning-testing paradigm for tone and speech token pairs. The SPiN was measured using standardized sentences in the participants' native language.Differences were observed in the gating index of the P2 peaks of speech and tone pairs. A significant relationship between SPiN and the auditory sensory gating of the P2 peak of the speech-evoked cortical potential was obtained.The results of this preliminary investigation indicate an association between the sensory gating mechanism and neurotypical individuals' ability to perceive speech in noise.",

This study was a follow-up to an earlier clinical trial of ReSound's behind-the-ear version of the same sound processor, the BT2 Personal Hearing System (Walden, B. E., Surr, R. K., Cord, M. T., &amp; Pavlovic, C. V. (1998). A clinical trial of the ReSound BT2 Personal Hearing System. American Journal of Audiology, 7 , 85–100). Forty adult males with gradually sloping, moderate sensorineural hearing losses participated. All were experienced hearing aid users who wore linear Class D instruments with input compression limiting at the time of their enrollment in this study. The Connected Speech Test, presented at several presentation levels and under various conditions of signal degradation, and the scales and subscales of the Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit were used to evaluate hearing aid performance and benefit under four relatively independent prototype listening situations (Walden, B. E., Demorest, M. E., &amp; Hepler, E. L. (1984). Self-report approach to assessing benefit derived from amplification. Journal of Speech and Hearing Research, 27 , 49–56). Aided performance with the IC4 HD was compared with (a) unaided performance, (b) performance of persons with normal hearing, and (c) performance with linear amplification. Participants with hearing loss obtained significant benefit from the IC4 HD, although IC4-aided performance remained well below that of unaided performance of persons with normal hearing, especially on laboratory measures of speech recognition. Furthermore, small mean performance advantages were observed for the IC4 HD compared to linear hearing aids, although there was substantial variability across participants. Finally, when given a choice to either purchase the IC4 HD at a discount from the manufacturer or continue using their own government-issued linear hearing aids, the majority of the participants chose to purchase the IC4 HD.",

Here, we applied a simple modification of LGOB to children and adults with normal hearing and then compared the loudness growth functions (as obtained from end-point data) between the two age groups. In addition, reliability data obtained within a single session and between test sessions were compared between the two groups. Large differences were observed in the means between the two groups for the lower boundary values, the upper boundary values, and the range between boundaries both within and across all frequencies. The data obtained from children also had greater variance than the adult data. In addition, there was more variability in the data across test sessions for children. Many test-retest differences for children exceeded 10 dB. Adult test-retest differences were generally less than 10 dB. Although the LGOB with the modifications used in this study may be used to measure loudness growth in children, its poor reliability with this age group may limit its clinical use for children with hearing loss. Additional work is needed to explore whether loudness growth measures can be adapted successfully to children and whether these measures contribute worthwhile information for fitting hearing aids to children.",

Method: The Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) was used to measure the intelligibility of speech for 10 participants with hearing loss when they listened in a background of recorded industrial noise at 85 dBA. Participants listened with 3 different sets of amplified earmuffs (Peltor Tactical 7-S, Elvex COM 55, and Bilsom 707 Impact II), with a set of passive earmuffs (E-A-R Ultra 9000), and with ears unoccluded. Two measurements of sentence threshold were obtained under each of the 5 listening conditions. Gain was measured electroacoustically across a range of input levels and frequencies for each amplified earmuff. Results: Electroacoustic measurements indicated that each electronic earmuff amplified at low input levels and attenuated at high input levels. However, gain characteristics varied greatly across devices. HINT sentence thresholds were not significantly different across the 5 listening conditions or across the 2 trials. Conclusion: Results suggest that each type of earmuff can be used to reduce the noise exposure of people with hearing loss without compromising their ability to understand speech.",

    "abstract": "The Chinese Sound Test (Hung, Lin, Tsai, & Lee, 2016) has been recently developed as a modified version of the Ling Six-Sound Test (Ling, 2012). By incorporating Chinese speech sounds, this test should be able to estimate whether the listener can hear across the Chinese speech spectrum. To establish the clinical validity of the test, this study examined the relationship between the aided audiometric thresholds and the distance thresholds.Sixty children with bilateral hearing aids were recruited. The aided sound-field thresholds at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, and 6000 Hz were compared with the distance thresholds of six sounds, /u, ə, a, i, tɕʰ, and s/, which encompass the entire Chinese speech frequency range from low to high.Partial correlation and stepwise regression analyses revealed that the Chinese testing sounds are frequency specific and that the audibility of each sound could be predicted by a specific frequency threshold.The results confirm the validity of the Chinese Sound Test, indicating that the testing sounds can be reliably used to assess the perception of frequency-specific information. Crucially, these data also demonstrate that the Chinese Sound Test is a useful tool to identify red flags of poor auditory access in daily environment to monitor device malfunctions and possible hearing fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Compared to photon-based radiotherapy, protons deliver less radiation to healthy tissue resulting in the potential reduction of late complications such as sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). We report early auditory outcomes in children treated with proton radiotherapy (PRT) for craniopharyngioma.Conventional frequency (CF = 0.25-8.0 kHz) audiometry, extended high-frequency (EHF = 9.0-16.0 kHz) audiometry, distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) testing, and speech-in-noise (SIN) assessments were prospectively and longitudinally conducted on 74 children with a median of 2 post-PRT evaluations (range, 1-5) per patient. The median age at PRT initiation was 10 years, and median follow-up time was 2 years. Ototoxicity was classified using the Chang Ototoxicity Grading Scale (Chang & Chinosornvatana, 2010) and the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) criteria (ASHA, 1994). Comparisons were made between baseline and most recent DPOAE levels, with evidence of ototoxicity based on criterion reductions of ≥ 6 dB. The critical difference values for comparing SIN scores between two conditions (i.e., pre- and post-PRT) were used to determine a significant change between test scores.At last evaluation, no patients had SNHL in the CF range, and 2 patients had SNHL (Chang Grade 1a) in the EHF range. Based on the ASHA criteria, a decrease in hearing was observed in 0 patients in the CF range alone, in 9 patients in the EHF range alone, and in 15 patients in both the CF and EHF ranges. DPOAE levels decreased at a faster rate at higher versus lower frequencies. For 41 evaluable patients, SIN perception did not decline over time (p = .6463).At a median follow-up time of 2 years post-PRT, normal hearing was maintained within the CF range. However, subclinical decreases in hearing were observed, particularly in the EHF range and in the DPOAE level; thus, long-term follow-up is recommended to monitor for potential auditory late effects from PRT.",

    "abstract": "Purpose In the past decade, resting-state functional connectivity, acquired using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), has emerged as a popular measure of tinnitus, especially as related to self-reported handicap or psychological reaction. The goal of this study was to assess replicability of neural correlates of tinnitus, namely, resting-state functional connectivity, in the same individuals acquired over 2 sessions. Method Data were collected at 2 different sites (University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and Joint Base San Antonio Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center) using similar 3T magnets and similar data acquisition paradigms. Thirty-six patients (all civilians) were scanned using resting-state fMRI at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. Ten patients, active-duty Service members and Veterans, were scanned at the Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center and the Department of Defense Hearing Center of Excellence. Each participant was scanned twice, a week apart, using identical protocols of 10 min resting-state fMRI. Results Tinnitus handicap scores using the Tinnitus Functional Index and the Tinnitus Primary Function Questionnaire ranged between no or mild handicap to moderately severe handicap but did not significantly differ between visits. We examined the default mode, dorsal attention, and auditory resting-state networks and found that the strength of the within-network functional connections across visit was similar for the attention and default mode networks but not for the auditory network. In addition, the functional connection between the attention network and precuneus, a region of the default mode network, was also replicable across visits. Conclusions Our results show that resting-state fMRI measures are replicable and reliable in patients with a subjective condition, although some networks and functional connections may be more stable than others. This paves the way for using resting-state fMRI to measure the efficacy of tinnitus interventions and as a tool to help propose better management options.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of perceived benefit of hearing aid acclimatization. Specifically, measures in the auditory and cognitive domain were tapped to investigate its relationship with the perceived benefit. Method Twenty-six individuals with sensorineural hearing loss served as participants for the study. The perceived benefit of hearing aid use was assessed using the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ; Gatehouse &amp; Noble, 2004 ). Signal-to-noise ratio-50 (SNR-50) and acceptable noise levels were the measures in auditory domain, whereas working memory and listening effort (LE) were the measures in cognitive domain. All the measures were tracked over a span of 2 months of hearing aid use to determine the benefits of hearing aid acclimatization. Results The SSQ showed improvements from baseline to 2nd month of hearing aid use. The mean improvement in the SNR-50 scores was 3.19 dB from the baseline. Acceptable noise levels and working memory did not change with hearing aid use. LE showed improvements in quiet but not in noise. The improvements in the SSQ were found to relate with the improvements in SNR-50. Conclusions The study indicated a significant perceived benefit with hearing aid acclimatization, and the underlying mechanism appears to be the signal-to-noise ratio gain. The findings of LE indicated reduced LE, thereby suggesting lesser cognitive load with hearing aid acclimatization. In addition, the individuals who performed poorer in the baseline measurement showed greater perceived benefit with hearing aid acclimatization.

    "abstract": "Patients often experience hearing difficulties despite the use of HA (hearing aids). The difficulties may be related to a number of auditory and non-auditory factors such as benefit, comfort, maintenance etc. It is difficult for both the patient and the audiologist to know, if the fitting and the given outcome is the best possible. The sound may be experienced differently in the clinic compared to daily life and the knowledge and skills related to hearing aid use vary largely from patient to patient. The aim of the present study is to gain insight into the daily experiences of new hearing aid users, which may shed light on aspects of aided performance, which may not be unveiled through standard questionnaires or during consultation. Data is collected online and consists of more than 400 pre-fabricated sentences representing experiences related to HA use. The sentences have been developed based on observations, involvement of experts, and inspired by elements from validated questionnaires. Patients are asked to relate to each experience (sentence) on a regular basis over a period of two months. The method is designed as a pass-time activity, where the patients swipe through the randomly presented experiences, and select the ones they have had recently. The sentences are expected to evoke the memory of recent experiences in the patients and at the same time provide a language to describe these. The two-month data-logging is expected to elucidate the short- and long-term challenges of each patient and thus provide a useful feedback – and maybe adjustment – tool in a follow-up situation. The work is on-going. Data will be analyzed and if feasible, summarized in a feedback tool for the professionals for a two-month follow-up. The study is part of BEAR project funded by Innovation Fund Denmark and partners (incl. Oticon, GN Resound and Widex). Funding and collaboration is sincerely appreciated.",

Method This was a prospective study of 25 patients who were found to have nonvestibular etiologies of their symptoms and normal vestibular function test results and who underwent caloric testing with a mean maximum slow phase eye velocity for each irrigation of 15° or greater. Following each caloric irrigation, patients were asked whether they had any sensation of movement. Patients were grouped based on the presence or absence of motion during the caloric exam (motion perception vs. absent perception). Postural stability was assessed using computerized dynamic posturography, and visuospatial memory was assessed using a memory match card game application. Results There were no significant differences between groups on any measures of peripheral vestibular function. However, the Absent Perception Group showed greater postural instability during Condition 5 of posturography and performed significantly worse on a task of visuospatial working memory. Both age and absence of motion perception predicted abnormal performance on measures of postural stability and visuospatial working memory. Conclusions There appears to be clinical implications to a lack of motion perception during the caloric exam in patients with an otherwise normal peripheral vestibular system. Based on the current findings, we are unable to determine whether differences in postural stability and visuospatial memory were due to age or a central vestibular processing deficit.",

Results Normative data for three Spanish word recognition lists were established. Performance–intensity functions at sensation levels from 0 to 40 dB SL in 8-dB steps were obtained, establishing list equivalency for Lists 1, 2, and 3. Conclusions The Spanish Pediatric Picture Identification Test was developed and validated as a picture-pointing task for word recognition with monolingual Spanish-speaking children. The two validated channel recordings include an English translation for ease of testing by clinicians lacking Spanish language skills.

    "abstract": "Purpose The SUpport PRogram (SUPR) study was carried out in the context of a private academic partnership and is the first study to evaluate the long-term effects of a communication program (SUPR) for older hearing aid users and their communication partners on a large scale in a hearing aid dispensing setting. The purpose of this research note is to reflect on the lessons that we learned during the different development, implementation, and evaluation phases of the SUPR project. Procedure This research note describes the procedures that were followed during the different phases of the SUPR project and provides a critical discussion to describe the strengths and weaknesses of the approach taken. Conclusion This research note might provide researchers and intervention developers with useful insights as to how aural rehabilitation interventions, such as the SUPR, can be developed by incorporating the needs of the different stakeholders, evaluated by using a robust research design (including a large sample size and a longer term follow-up assessment), and implemented widely by collaborating with a private partner (hearing aid dispensing practice chain).",

    "abstract": "Purpose Tinnitus and temporomandibular disorders have already been associated in the literature, but despite many studies, it is still an intriguing discussion point. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of hearing loss among somatosensory tinnitus patients with temporomandibular disorders and to assess the influence of tinnitus on patients' quality of life. Method An otolaryngologist examined 585 patients in order to detect and evaluate the presence of tinnitus. Subjects were evaluated using the Portuguese version of the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders. An analysis of the somatic component of tinnitus was performed. Tinnitus was rated according to its onset (at least 6 months) and intensity with a visual analog scale. The sample was composed of 100 patients with somatosensory tinnitus divided into two groups: Group 1 (with temporomandibular disorder, n = 85) and Group 2 (without temporomandibular disorder, n = 15). The audiological evaluation was composed of pure-tone audiometry, high-frequency audiometry, tympanometry, and transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions. The impact of tinnitus on quality of life was assessed by the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory adapted and validated to Portuguese language. Results Pure-tone audiometry did not differ with statistical significance between groups (p = .29), neither did the high-frequency audiometry results (p = .74). Tinnitus Handicap Inventory scores also did not show any differences between Groups 1 and 2 (p = .67). Conclusions Subjects with somatosensory tinnitus, who also have temporomandibular disorders, do not seem to have hearing impairment. Also, they do not have a higher quality of life handicap when compared to those without tinnitus and temporomandibular disorder.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Auditory threshold estimation using the auditory brainstem response or auditory steady state response is limited in some populations (e.g., individuals with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder [ANSD] or those who have difficulty remaining still during testing and cannot tolerate general anesthetic). However, cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) can be recorded in many such patients and have been employed in threshold approximation. Thus, we studied CAEP estimates of auditory thresholds in participants with normal hearing, sensorineural hearing loss, and ANSD. Method We recorded CAEPs at varying intensity levels to speech (i.e., /ba/) and tones (i.e., 1 kHz) to estimate auditory thresholds in normal-hearing adults (n = 10) and children (n = 10) and case studies of children with sensorineural hearing loss and ANSD. Results Results showed a pattern of CAEP amplitude decrease and latency increase as stimulus intensities declined until waveform components disappeared near auditory threshold levels. Overall, CAEP thresholds were within 10 dB HL of behavioral thresholds for both stimuli. Conclusions The above findings suggest that CAEPs may be clinically useful in estimating auditory threshold in populations for whom such a method does not currently exist. Physiologic threshold estimation in difficult-to-test clinical populations could lead to earlier intervention and improved outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Traditional clinical measures of cochlear implant (CI) recipient performance may not fully evaluate the benefit of bimodal listening (hearing aid contralateral to a CI). The clinical assessment of spatial release from masking (SRM) may be a sensitive measure of the benefit of listening with bimodal stimulation. This study compared the SRM of pediatric bimodal and bilateral CI listeners using a clinically feasible method, and investigated variables that may contribute to speech recognition performance with spatially separated maskers. Method Forty pediatric bimodal ( N = 20) and bilateral CI ( N = 20) participants were assessed in their best aided listening condition on sentence recognition in a four-talker masker. Testing was completed with target and masker colocated at 0° azimuth, and with the masker directed at 90° to either ear. SRM was calculated as the difference in performance between the colocated and each 90° condition. A two-way mixed-methods analysis of variance was used to compare performance between groups in the three masker conditions. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to investigate potential predictors for SRM asymmetry including hearing history, unaided thresholds, word recognition, duration of device use, and acoustic bandwidth. Results Both groups demonstrated SRM, with significantly better recognition in each 90° condition as compared to the colocated condition. The groups did not differ significantly in SRM. The multiple regression analyses did not reveal any significant predictors of SRM asymmetry. Conclusions Bimodal and bilateral CI listeners demonstrated similar amounts of SRM. While no specific variables predicted SRM asymmetry in bimodal listeners, pediatric bimodal and bilateral CI recipients should expect similar amounts of SRM regardless of the side of the masker. SRM asymmetry in pediatric bimodal listeners may signal a need for consideration of a second CI.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Simulation is a tool commonly used in the clinical training of students within the health professions fields, such as medicine and nursing. The effectiveness of simulation as a teaching technique has been extensively documented in numerous health care professions; however, little is known about the effectiveness of simulation techniques in audiology education. This study assesses the effectiveness of a simulation activity focused on auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing conducted with students of an applied doctoral program in audiology. Method Twelve 2nd year audiology graduate students enrolled in the auditory electrophysiology course at Towson University in Fall 2018 participated in this pre–post study. Over a 3-week period, each student (a) received didactic instruction in ABR testing, (b) underwent a presimulation exercise skills assessment, (c) participated in a simulation exercise, and (d) underwent a postsimulation exercise skills assessment. Results Significant improvements were observed in clinical skill level for the ABR tasks evaluated in terms of both accuracy and efficiency (time in seconds needed to complete the task). The tasks evaluated included skin preparation, identification of scalp electrode placement sites, and scalp electrode placement in a variety of configurations (single- and two-channel arrays, horizontal and vertical electrode montages). Benefits associated with simulation-based instruction varied by clinical skill as well as by student. Conclusions The data described in this study reinforce the need to incorporate simulation in audiology training programs, especially for complex clinical skills. It also emphasizes the need for additional research that can be useful in the design and implementation of simulation-based exercises.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Around 80%–93% of the individuals with tinnitus have hearing loss. Researchers have found that tinnitus pitch was related to the frequencies of hearing loss, but unclear about the relationship between tinnitus pitch and audiometry edge frequency. The comorbidity of tinnitus and speech perception in noise problems had also been reported, but the relationship between tinnitus pitch and speech perception in noise had seldom been investigated. This study was designed to estimate the relationship between tinnitus pitch, audiogram edge frequency, and speech perception in noise. The speech perception in noise was measured using auditory stream segregation paradigm. Method Thirteen individuals with bilateral mild-to-severe tonal tinnitus and minimal-to-mild cochlear hearing loss were selected. Thirteen individuals with hearing loss without tinnitus were also selected. The audiogram of each participant with tinnitus was matched with that of the participant without tinnitus. Tinnitus pitch of the participants with tinnitus was measured and compared with audiogram edge frequency. The stream segregation thresholds were calculated at the participants' admitted tinnitus pitch and one octave below the tinnitus pitch. The stream segregation thresholds were estimated at fission and fusion boundary using pure-tone stimuli in ABA paradigm. Results High correlation between tinnitus pitch and audiogram edge frequency was noted. Overall stream segregation thresholds were higher for individuals with tinnitus. Higher thresholds indicated poorer stream segregation abilities. Within tinnitus participants, the thresholds were significantly lesser at frequency corresponding to admitted tinnitus pitch than at one octave below the tinnitus pitch. Conclusions The information from this study may be helpful in educating the patients about the relationship between hearing loss and tinnitus. The findings may also account for speech-perception-in-noise difficulties often reported by the individuals with tinnitus.",

The study was aimed at examining the hearing aid consumer reviews using automated linguistic analysis, and how the linguistic variables relate to self-reported hearing aid benefit and satisfaction ratings. Method The study used a cross-sectional design. One thousand three hundred seventy-eight consumer hearing aid reviews (i.e., text response to open-ended question), self-reported benefit and satisfaction ratings on hearing aids in a 5-point scale with meta-data (e.g., hearing aid brand, technology level) extracted from the Hearing Tracker website were analyzed using automated text analysis method known as the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count. Results Self-reported hearing aid benefit and satisfaction ratings were high (i.e., mean rating of 4.04 in a 5-point scale). Examining the association between overall rating and the key linguistic variables point to two broad findings. First, the more people were personally, socially, and emotionally engaged with the hearing device experience, the higher they rated their hearing device(s). Second, a minimal occurrence of clinic-visit language dimensions points to factors that likely affect benefit and satisfaction ratings. For example, if people mention paying too much money (money), their overall ratings are generally lower. Conversely, if people write about their health or home, the ratings were higher. There was no significant difference in linguistic analysis across different hearing aid brands and technology levels. Conclusions Hearing aid consumers are generally satisfied with their hearing device(s), and their online reviews contain information about social/emotional dimensions as well as clinic-visit related aspects that have bearing toward hearing aid benefit and satisfaction ratings. These results suggest that the natural language used by consumers provide insights on their perceived benefit/satisfaction from their hearing device.",

The purpose of this study was to use focus groups with consumer and community representatives to explore how we might improve the provision of support for clients experiencing emotional and psychological issues in relation to their hearing loss. Participants: Adults with hearing loss ( n = 19) and their significant others ( n = 9), as well as 10 hearing health care professionals ( n = 4 hearing health care clinicians, n = 4 reception staff, and n = 2 clinical managers), participated in consumer and community engagement focus groups. Method: Consumer and community representatives were tasked with (a) identifying the stakeholders involved in supporting adults experiencing emotional or psychological difficulties on account of their hearing loss, (b) describing the behaviors undertaken by each stakeholder group, and (c) selecting target behavior(s) that could optimally form the basis of an intervention program to improve the quality and frequency of support provided to people experiencing emotional and psychological problems in the audiology setting. Results: Participants identified 12 stakeholder groups involved in supporting adults with hearing loss experiencing emotional and psychological problems. The three behaviors voted by participants to be the most promising for a behavioral intervention included the clinician (a) asking about, (b) providing information on, and (c) delivering therapeutic intervention for emotional and psychological well-being within audiological service provision.

Furthermore, phonotactic probabilities and neighborhood densities of word recognition errors were assessed to explore potential underlying linguistic complexities that might differentially influence performance among groups. Method Four groups of adult participants were tested: participants with no brain injury with normal hearing, participants with no brain injury with hearing loss, participants with brain injury with aphasia and normal hearing, and participants with brain injury with aphasia and hearing loss. The Northwestern University Auditory Test No. 6 (NU-6; Tillman &amp; Carhart, 1966) was administered. Those participants who were unable to respond orally (repeating words as heard) were assessed with the Picture Identification Task (Wilson &amp; Antablin, 1980), permitting a picture-pointing response instead. Error patterns from the NU-6 were assessed to determine whether phonotactic probability influenced performance. Results All participants with no brain injury and 72.7% of the participants with aphasia (24 out of 33) completed the NU-6. Furthermore, all participants who were unable to complete the NU-6 were able to complete the Picture Identification Task. There were significant group differences on NU-6 performance. The 2 groups with normal hearing had significantly higher scores than the 2 groups with hearing loss, but the 2 groups with normal hearing and the 2 groups with hearing loss did not differ from one another, implying that their performance was largely determined by hearing loss rather than by brain injury or aphasia. The neighborhood density, but not phonotactic probabilities, of the participants' errors differed across groups with and without aphasia. Conclusions Because the vast majority of the participants with aphasia examined could be tested readily using an instrument such as the NU-6, clinicians should not be reticent to use this test if patients are able to repeat single words, but routine use of alternative tests is encouraged for populations of people with brain injuries.",

Each participant underwent bithermal caloric irrigation at 2 separate counterbalanced visits. At 1 visit mental tasking was utilized, whereas the other visit did not utilize mental tasking. The following outcomes were measured for each visit: peak slow-phase velocity (SPV), response duration, peak SPV latency, and eye blink artifact. Results No significant difference was seen for tasking versus no tasking with peak SPV, peak latency, or response duration. A significant difference was seen for the amount of eye blink artifact, with significantly more eye blinks present for the tasking condition. Conclusions Results could indicate mental tasking does not affect the important measure of SPV. Moreover, increased eye blink artifact with tasking could obscure the clinician's ability to read the nystagmograph.

Method The study used a within-subject, repeated-measures design with 13 adult hearing-aid users. The music included rock and classical samples with different amounts of audio-industry compression limiting. CLL measurements were taken at ear level (i.e., at input to the hearing aid) and at the tympanic membrane. Results For aided listening, average CLLs were 69.3 dBA at the input to the hearing aid and 80.3 dBA at the tympanic membrane. For unaided listening, average CLLs were 76.9 dBA at the entrance to the ear canal and 77.1 dBA at the tympanic membrane. Although wide intersubject variability was observed, CLLs were not associated with audiometric thresholds. CLLs for rock music were higher than for classical music at the tympanic membrane, but no differences were observed between genres for ear-level CLLs. The amount of audio-industry compression had no significant effect on CLLs. Conclusion By describing the levels of recorded music chosen by hearing-aid users, this study provides a basis for ecologically valid testing conditions in clinical and laboratory settings.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that many children with Down syndrome possess unique physical and behavioral characteristics that should be considered when doing audiologic assessments. Possible test modifications have been suggested to maximize attending behavior and to improve test reliability and validity. It has been reported that children with Down syndrome may not hear as well as other children, and determining the presence of hearing impairment can be problematic. Research needs have been highlighted. Because these children are at risk for middle ear disease and hearing impairment, audiologic assessment should occur early (infancy) and frequently (4–6 month intervals), with use of amplification when appropriate.",

Listeners with hearing loss were tested using the ALDs alone and using the ALDs inductively coupled to personal in-the-ear (ITE) hearing aids. Significant improvements in word recognition ability with the FM, induction loop, and infrared systems were noted in listeners with normal hearing and with all ALD systems in listeners with hearing loss, as compared to performance with no system. Listeners with hearing loss performed better and preferred using the FM, induction loop, and infrared systems with headsets, but preferred the soundfield amplification system with their hearing aids. Both groups of listeners preferred the FM system over other systems in terms of performance, comfort, and ease of use.",

For non-tumor ears, the percentage of abnormal absolute latencies for waves I, III, and V increased rather systematically as hearing loss increased, whereas absolute latencies for eighth-nerve tumor ears were largely abnormal regardless of hearing loss. Interpeak intervals were normal for most of the non-tumor ears, but the I–III and I–V intervals were abnormal for most of the tumor ears. The most sensitive index for otoneurologic assessment was a combination of abnormal wave V interaural latency differences or I–V interpeak interval, and the most specific criterion was the I–V interpeak interval. Tumor size influenced sensitivity of most ABR indices.",

    "abstract": "Improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for individuals with hearing loss who are listening to speech in noise provides an obvious benefit. Although binaural hearing provides the greatest advantage over monaural hearing in noise, some individuals with symmetrical hearing loss choose to wear only one hearing aid. The present study tested the hypothesis that individuals with symmetrical hearing loss fit with one hearing aid would demonstrate improved speech recognition in background noise with increases in head turn. Fourteen individuals were fit monaurally with a Starkey Gemini in-the-ear (ITE) hearing aid with directional and omnidirectional microphone modes. Speech recognition performance in noise was tested using the audiovisual version of the Connected Speech Test (CST v.3). The test was administered in auditory-only conditions as well as with the addition of visual cues for each of three head angles: 0°, 20°, and 40°. Results indicated improvement in speech recognition performance with changes in head angle for the auditory-only presentation mode at the 20° and 40° head angles when compared to 0°. Improvement in speech recognition performance for the auditory + visual mode was noted for the 20° head angle when compared to 0°. Additionally, a decrement in speech recognition performance for the auditory + visual mode was noted for the 40° head angle when compared to 0°. These results support a speech recognition advantage for listeners fit with one ITE hearing aid listening in a close listener-to-speaker distance when they turn their head slightly in order to increase signal intensity.",

The importance of health professionals such as audiologists gaining core competencies in genetics has been recognized. The current report describes a survey of academic programs in audiology designed to determine the extent to which genetics content is included in the curriculum. Responses from 56% of existing academic programs indicate that 95% include some genetics content in their programs, with the total number of classroom hours ranging from 2 to 65. Most programs included information on basic genetic mechanisms, syndromes, and interpreting family history information, while many fewer reported covering the molecular basis of hearing loss, genetic testing, or ethical or legal issues. The results of this survey demonstrate the need to incorporate more genetics content into audiology curricula and suggest strategies for assisting audiology faculty with this process.",

    "abstract": "It is known that many listeners with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) have difficulty performing binaural tasks. In this study, interference and enhancement effects on interaural time discrimination and level discrimination were investigated in 4 listeners with normal hearing (NH) and 7 listeners with SNHL. Just-noticeable differences were measured using 1/3-octave narrowband noises centered at 0.5 and 4 kHz. Noises were presented in isolation and together at equivalent sound pressure level (EqSPL) and equivalent sensation level (EqSL). Each noise served as target and distractor in the dual-band conditions. Congruent conditions included interaural differences in both noises that varied together, and incongruent conditions included an interaural difference in one noise with the second noise diotic. No significant enhancement effects were observed for either group in either task. Interference effects for the NH group were limited to the interaural level discrimination task in the 0.5-kHz target and 4-kHz distractor condition. Performance of participants with SNHL was similar to that of the NH group for interaural time discrimination with noises at EqSL but not EqSPL. In interaural level discrimination, listeners with SNHL demonstrated interference with a 4-kHz target and 0.5-kHz distractor. Results indicated that the relative levels of low- and high-frequency targets and distractors could affect binaural performance of individuals with SNHL but that in some conditions listeners with SNHL performed similarly to those with normal hearing. Implications of these results for binaural clinical tests and hearing aid fitting strategies are discussed.",

Method: A 3-stage least squares regression technique was used to analyze the hearing aid market. Results: Our results show that, while recessionary periods reduced both demand and supply, the demand side of the hearing aid industry is significantly more responsive to changes in the economy. Further, the demand function within the hearing aid industry is inelastic. Finally, negative media coverage from nationally televised reports during the FDA’s intervention between the 2nd quarter of 1993 and the 3rd quarter of 1994 did not significantly affect the market demand of hearing aids. Conclusions: The demand for hearing aids increases in a flourishing economy and decreases during periods of recession. The negative media campaign from the FDA’s intervention between the 2nd quarter of 1993 and the 3rd quarter of 1994 had essentially little effect on the end user. The repercussions of the FDA’s intervention have resulted, however, in a reduction in the market supply of hearing aids and an increase in their cost due to manufacturer-sponsored clinical trials.",

However, directional microphones also increase internal hearing aid noise. The purpose of this study was to investigate how varying directional microphone bandwidth affected listening preference and speech-in-noise performance.Ten participants with normal hearing and 10 participants with hearing impairment compared internal noise levels between hearing aid memories with 4 different microphone modes: omnidirectional, full directional, high-frequency directionality with directional processing above 900 Hz, and high-frequency directionality with directional processing above 2000 Hz. Speech-in-noise performance was measured with each memory for the participants with hearing impairment.Participants with normal hearing preferred memories with less directional bandwidth. Participants with hearing impairment also tended to prefer the memories with less directional bandwidth. However, the majority of participants with hearing impairment did not indicate a preference between omnidirectional and directional above 2000 Hz memories. Average hearing-in-noise performance improved with increasing directional bandwidth.Most participants preferred memories with less directional bandwidth in quiet. Participants with hearing impairment indicated no difference in preference between directional above 2000 Hz and the omnidirectional memories. Speech recognition in noise performance improved with increasing directional bandwidth.",

The current study explored how hearing loss and hearing aids are represented in the U.S. newspaper media. Method A cross-sectional study design was selected to analyze publicly available newspaper media data. The data sets were generated from the database, the U.S. Major Dailies by ProQuest, by searching key words for newspapers published during 1990-2017. Cluster analysis (i.e., text pattern analysis) and chi-square tests were performed using Iramuteq software. Results The hearing loss data set had 1,527 texts (i.e., articles). The cluster analysis resulted in 7 clusters, which were named as (1) causes and consequences (26.1%), (2) early identification and diagnosis (9%), (3) health promotion and prevention (22.1%), (4) recreational noise exposure (10.4%), (5) prevalence (14.3%), (6) research and development (12.4%), and (7) cognitive hearing science (5.6%). The hearing aids data set had 2,667 texts. The cluster analysis resulted in 8 clusters, which were named as (1) signal processing (20.2%), (2) insurance (8.9%), (3) prevalence (12.4%), (4) research and development (5.4%), (5) activities and relation (16.2%), (6) features to address background noise (13.8%), (7) innovation (12%), and (8) wireless and connectivity (11.1%). Time series analysis of clusters in both \"hearing loss\" and \"hearing aids\" data sets indicated changes in the pattern of information presented in the newspaper media during 1990-2016 (e.g., Cluster 7 focuses on cognitive hearing science in a hearing loss data set emerging only since the year 2012 and growing rapidly). Conclusions The text pattern analysis showed that the U.S. newspaper media focuses on a range of issues when considering hearing loss and hearing aids and that patterns or trends change over time. The study results can be helpful for hearing health care professionals to understand what presuppositions society in general may have as the media has the ability to influence societal perception and opinions.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Low residual noise (RN) levels are critically important when obtaining electrophysiological recordings of threshold auditory brainstem responses. In this study, we examine the effectiveness and efficiency of Kalman-weighted averaging (KWA) implemented on the Vivosonic Integrity System and artifact rejection (AR) implemented on the Intelligent Hearing Systems SmartEP system for obtaining low RN levels. Method Sixteen adults participated. Electrophysiological measures were obtained using simultaneous recordings by the Vivosonic and Intelligent Hearing Systems for subjects in 2 relaxed conditions and 4 active motor conditions. Three averaging times were used for the relaxed states (1, 1.5, and 3 min) and for the active states (1.5, 3, and 6 min). Repeated-measures analyses of variance were used to examine RN levels as a function of noise reduction strategy (i.e., KWA, AR) and averaging time. Results Lower RN levels were obtained using KWA than AR in both the relaxed and active motor states. Thus, KWA was more effective than was AR under the conditions examined in this study. Using KWA, approximately 3 min of averaging was needed in the relaxed condition to obtain an average RN level of 0.025 μV. In contrast, in the active motor conditions, approximately 6 min of averaging was required using KWA. Mean RN levels of 0.025 μV were not attained using AR. Conclusions When patients are not physiologically quiet, low RN levels are more likely to be obtained and more efficiently obtained using KWA than AR. However, even when using KWA, in active motor states, 6 min of averaging or more may be required to obtain threshold responses. Averaging time needed and whether a low RN level can be attained will depend on the level of motor activity exhibited by the patient.",

Method Secondary data analysis of the SUpport PRogram trial was performed (n = 267 older, 1st-time HA candidates). All SUpport PRogram participants started an HAEP shortly after study enrollment. Decision to purchase an HA by the end of the HAEP was the outcome of interest of the current study. Participants' baseline covariates (22 in total) were included as candidate predictors. Multivariable logistic regression modeling (backward selection and reclassification tables) was used. Results Of all candidate predictors, only pure-tone average (average of 1, 2, and 4 kHz) hearing loss emerged as a significant predictor (odds ratio = 1.03, 95% confidence interval [1.03, 1.17]). Model performance was weak (Nagelkerke R2 = .04, area under the curve = 0.61). Conclusions These data suggest that, once HA candidates have decided to enter an HAEP, factors measured early in the help-seeking journey do not predict well who will and will not purchase an HA. Instead, factors that act during the HAEP may hold this predictive value. This should be examined.",

Method The study used a multiple static group comparison research design. Twenty normal-hearing individuals (NH), 19 individuals with ANSD, and 23 individuals with CHL underwent DLI measurement using behavioral (psychoacoustic) techniques and ACC. For eliciting ACC, a 500-ms, 1,000-Hz pure tone was presented at 80 dB SPL. Additionally, six variants of this stimulus with intensity increments of 1, 3, 4, 5, 10, and 20 dB starting 250 ms after stimulus onset were used to elicit the ACC. Results The lowest intensity change that produced replicable and clearly identifiable ACC was referred as objective DLI. In comparison to NH and CHL, the behavioral as well as the objective DLI were significantly larger (poorer) in ANSD ( p &lt; .05). Significantly strong positive correlation existed between DLI obtained using behavioral and objective measures ( p &lt; .05). Conclusions ACC could be a useful objective tool to measure DLI in the clinical population, provided the individuals of the clinical population fulfill the prerequisite of the presence of Auditory Long Latency Responses.

Many people with hyperacusis turn to the Internet for information and support from online communities to discuss their condition. The purpose of this study was to assess the content and quality of hyperacusis information presented online. Method The three most used Internet search engines were used to identify relevant websites using the single search term hyperacusis . Fifteen websites were selected for analysis. Details of the purpose, audience, and content of each website were extracted using a bespoke data extraction form. The quality of the information on each website was rated using the validated DISCERN questionnaire. Results There was a wide disparity in the quality and content of hyperacusis information across websites. The website Hyperacusis Focus achieved the highest overall DISCERN score. Hyperacusis Focus and U.K. National Health Service websites were the most comprehensive online resources for health care professionals and patients, respectively. Wikipedia was judged useful for both health care professionals and patients. In general, hyperacusis-related information was accurate. However, no single website provided a complete account of hyperacusis, and some were judged to be selective in the information they provided. Conclusions The Internet provides an important source of information for those who have hyperacusis and those who care for them. Revisions to the websites reviewed here are needed for each to provide a complete account of hyperacusis. Supplemental Material https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.12869717",

    "abstract": "Purpose The main purpose of this study was to evaluate aging effects on the predominantly subcortical (brainstem) encoding of the second-formant frequency transition, an essential acoustic cue for perceiving place of articulation. Method Synthetic consonant–vowel syllables varying in second-formant onset frequency (i.e., /ba/, /da/, and /ga/ stimuli) were used to elicit speech-evoked auditory brainstem responses (speech-ABRs) in 16 young adults ( M age = 21 years) and 11 older adults ( M age = 59 years). Repeated-measures mixed-model analyses of variance were performed on the latencies and amplitudes of the speech-ABR peaks. Fixed factors were phoneme (repeated measures on three levels: /b/ vs. /d/ vs. /g/) and age (two levels: young vs. older). Results Speech-ABR differences were observed between the two groups (young vs. older adults). Specifically, older listeners showed generalized amplitude reductions for onset and major peaks. Significant Phoneme × Group interactions were not observed. Conclusions Results showed aging effects in speech-ABR amplitudes that may reflect diminished subcortical encoding of consonants in older listeners. These aging effects were not phoneme dependent as observed using the statistical methods of this study.",

    "abstract": "Purpose This study investigates common real-ear aided response (REAR) configurations prescribed by the NAL-NL2 algorithm for older adults with hearing loss. Method A data set that is representative of the older adult U.S. population with mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss was constructed from the audiometric data of 934 adults (aged 55-85 years) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey years 1999-2012. Two clustering approaches were implemented to generate common REAR configurations for eight frequencies (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 kHz) at three input levels (55, 65, and 75 dB SPL). (a) In the REAR-based clustering approach, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey audiograms were first converted to REAR targets and then clustered to generate common REAR configurations. (b) In the audiogram-based clustering approach, the audiograms were first clustered into common hearing loss profiles and then converted to REAR configurations. The trade-off between the number of available REAR configurations and the percentage of the U.S. population whose hearing loss could be fit by at least one of them (i.e., percent coverage) was evaluated. Hearing loss fit was defined as less than ± 5-dB difference between an individual's REAR targets and those of the clustered REAR configuration. Results Percent coverage increases with the number of available REAR configurations, with four configurations resulting in 75% population coverage. Overall, REAR-based clustering yielded 5 percentage points better coverage on average compared to audiogram-based clustering. Conclusions The common REAR configurations can be used for programming the gain frequency responses in preconfigured over-the-counter hearing aids and provide clinically appropriate amplification settings for older adults with mild-to-moderate hearing loss.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Hearing loss is a common impairment of the human senses with an estimated 48 million American adults reporting some trouble hearing; however, access to hearing health care is limited. Detection of hearing loss through a mobile, handheld tool can provide an important access point and potentially expedited access to the continuum of hearing health care. Here, we determined that GoAudio, a portable, automated hearing assessment tool, can be used to identify individuals who require additional hearing evaluation in a clinical workflow. Method This initial study included 24 adults, ages 18-65 years (M = 50, SD = 12), tested with GoAudio versus \"gold-standard\" clinical audiometry for eight frequencies to evaluate \"real-world\" applications. Participants utilized noise-canceling headphones combined with a tablet-based application for the GoAudio assessment. Results The primary study outcome measurements were the comparison of hearing thresholds (dB HL) from clinical audiometry and GoAudio. Results suggest that GoAudio is comparable to clinical audiometry for the identification of hearing loss at most frequencies (except 1 kHz for both ears and 2 kHz in the right ear). Upon stratifying data based on age, we identified that GoAudio is capable of identifying suspected age-related hearing loss or hearing thresholds greater than 30 dB HL at higher frequencies in both ears. Conclusion The study results support that GoAudio can be used effectively in clinical practice workflows as a reliable hearing assessment tool for the identification of hearing loss at the majority of frequencies outside a sound-treated booth and can detect characteristics of age-related hearing loss.

(2019), in which we described the rationale, development, and implementation of the standard-of-care protocol used in the Tinnitus Retraining Therapy Trial (TRTT), a multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, definitive efficacy trial of tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT). We now describe the historical background, development, and standardized implementation and delivery of the TRT counseling protocol (tinnitus counseling [TC]) used in the TRTT. TC is conjectured to be the key component in the TRT protocol for initiating the habituation process that reduces the response to the tinnitus signal and, ultimately, reduces its impact. In the TRTT, participants assigned to receive TC achieved &gt; 30% reduction in the impact of tinnitus. Method and Results The design and implementation of standardized treatments in multisite randomized controlled trials presents many challenges for investigators. Here, subsequent to presenting the background, rationale, and the TRT protocol model, we describe the development, refinement, and training/certification for standardized delivery of TC in the TRTT. The primary challenges encountered while distilling and streamlining TC for standardized delivery across multiple clinicians and their replacements at six participating military treatment centers in the TRTT are considered, and the resulting counseling protocol is detailed. Conclusions The standardized and streamlined TC used in the TRTT was successful for treating debilitating tinnitus among persons with functionally adequate unaided hearing sensitivity. The structured TC protocol described here appears to be the main determinant of the significant and sizable TRT treatment effects measured in the TRTT, thus bolstering the merits of this standardized counseling approach as one model for the clinical implementation of TRT for the treatment of primary tinnitus.",

Method Fifteen pediatric hearing aid users (6-12 years old) received new bilateral, individually fitted Oticon Opn hearing aids programmed with OpenSound Navigator (OSN) processing. Word recognition in noise, sentence repetition in quiet, nonword repetition, vocabulary learning, selective attention, executive function, memory, and reading and mathematical abilities were measured within 1 week of the initial hearing aid fitting and 2 months post fit. Caregivers completed questionnaires assessing their child's listening and communication abilities prior to study enrollment and after 2 months of using the study hearing aids. Results Caregiver reporting indicated significant improvements in speech and sound perception, spatial sound awareness, and the ability to participate in conversations. However, there was no positive change in performance in any of the measured skills. Mathematical scores significantly declined after 2 months. Conclusions OSN provided a perceived improvement in functional benefit, compared to their previous hearing aids, as reported by caregivers. However, there was no positive change in listening skills, cognition, and academic success after 2 months of using OSN. Findings may have been impacted by reporter bias, limited sample size, and a relatively short trial period. This study took place during the summer when participants were out of school, which may have influenced the decline in mathematical scores. The results support further exploration with age- and audiogram-matched controls, larger sample sizes, and longer test-retest intervals that correspond to the academic school year.",

Method Stimuli were nouns from the University of Western Ontario Plurals Test (Glista &amp; Scollie, 2012), low-pass filtered with 5 different cutoff frequencies: 8000 Hz, 5000 Hz, 4000 Hz, 3000 Hz, and 2000 Hz. Listeners were children (age range = 7–13 years) and adults with normal hearing. The task was a 2-alternative forced-choice task with a picture-pointing response. Results Performance was worse for lower than for higher low-pass filter cutoff frequencies, but the effect of low-pass filtering was similar for children and adults. Nearly all listeners achieved 100% correct performance when stimuli were low-pass filtered with cutoff frequencies of 8000 Hz or 5000 Hz. Performance remained well above chance even for the most severe filtering condition (2000 Hz). Restricting high-frequency audibility influenced performance for plural items to a greater extent than for singular items. Conclusion The results indicate that children and adults with normal hearing can use acoustic information below the spectral range of frication noise typically associated with /s/ and /z/ to discriminate between singular and plural forms of nouns in the context of the University of Western Ontario Plurals Test.",

Also, the Consonant-Nucleus-Consonant Word Recognition Test (Peterson & Lehiste, 1962) and sentences from the Hearing in Noise Test (Nilsson, Soli, & Sullivan, 1994) were administered. Forty CI recipients with postlingual deafness (ages 31-81 years) participated in the study.Acoustically similar vowels were more difficult to identify than acoustically dissimilar vowels. With increasing age, performance deteriorated when identifying acoustically similar vowels. Vowel identification was also affected by the use of a contralateral HA and the degree of residual hearing prior to implantation. Moderate correlations were found between speech perception and vowel identification performance.Identification performance was affected by the acoustic similarity of the vowels. Older adults experienced more difficulty identifying acoustically similar confusable vowels than did younger adults. The findings might lend support to the ease of language understanding model (Ronnberg, Rudner, Foo, & Lunner, 2008), which proposes that the quality and perceptual robustness of acoustic input affects speech perception.",

This review article highlighted that all audiologists have an important role to play in reducing the global crisis of falls in older adults. However, without further research to aid in the development of standardization of documentation and training programs, we may continue to see a lack of awareness and education on fall risk and on the audiologist's role in the screening and early detection hereof.",

One risk is that user-selected settings may provide inadequate audibility. This study assessed that risk by quantifying relationships between self-adjusted settings, subjective preferences, and speech recognition performance using speech at low levels in quiet, where achieving high speech audibility requires sufficient amplification.Fifteen people with symmetric, mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss self-adjusted hearing aid amplification while listening to speech in quiet at 45, 55, and 65 dBA. After self-adjustment, 11 participants made blinded ratings of their self-adjusted fit, their NAL-NL2 prescriptive fit, and experimenter-created fits with reduced gain. Participants completed blinded paired comparisons and sentence recognition assessments using these settings.The gain of self-adjusted fits showed a large range of variability between participants. On average, self-adjusted gain was similar to NAL-NL2 prescribed gain for input signals of 55 dBA and slightly greater than prescribed gain for 45-dBA signals. Speech recognition scores for NAL-NL2 fits were consistently high, and differences in speech recognition results were strongly correlated with the overall preferences obtained from paired comparisons.Self-adjusted fits are highly variable between individuals for low-audibility conditions. Nonetheless, self-adjusted fits are at least as satisfactory as NAL-NL2 fits, and listeners tend to disfavor settings that result in poorer speech recognition. The findings argue against concerns that self-adjustment will result in inadequate audibility compared to prescribed settings.",

The aim of this review article was to review the effect of SFAS on children in primary school.A comprehensive search of four online databases (ERIC, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) was conducted. The search terms were classroom sound-field amplification and classroom amplified distribution system. Twenty-one articles were deemed relevant for the review plus an additional six from their references.Most articles were published between 1996 and 2015. Only one article was published since 2016. A range of child populations were studied including typically developing children and children with difficulties and disabilities such as hearing loss, developmental language disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, emotional and behavior disorders, Down syndrome, and developmental disabilities. There were several different measures that were used to evaluate the effectiveness of SFAS including speech perception assessments, language assessments, academic and comprehension assessments, classroom observations, interviews, and questionnaires. Improvements with SFAS were found for speech perception, listening comprehension and auditory analysis, language outcomes, academic outcomes, and behavior.SFAS can benefit children's listening and learning; however, the child's background, classroom reverberation time (limit to < 1 s), and layout and type of learning activities, especially in modern classrooms, need to be taken into consideration.",

    "abstract": "Until recently, there has been little investigation on the effects of cochlear implantation on the transmission of acoustic stimuli through the middle-ear system. Recent studies have shown that cochlear implantation decreases low-frequency acoustic absorbance, consistent with a stiffer middle-ear system postsurgery. The objectives of this study are (a) to investigate the time course of changes in acoustic absorbance post-cochlear implantation in the implanted ear and (b) to compare changes in acoustic absorbance between implanted and nonimplanted ears over time.Seventeen adult cochlear implant (CI) recipients within 6 months of device activation participated in this study. Wideband acoustic absorbance was measured in both ears at one to six different time points from pre-implantation up to 6-month postactivation. Analyses examined (a) changes in acoustic absorbance as compared to pre-implantation and (b) differences in acoustic absorbance between implanted and nonimplanted ears over time.Acoustic absorbance in the implanted ear decreased postsurgery for frequencies lower than 1.5 kHz and persisted through at least 6-month postactivation. We also observed that the spectral range of decreased acoustic absorbance in the implanted ear decreased with longer time postsurgery. Differences in acoustic absorbance between implanted and nonimplanted ears occurred over a broad spectral range at the activation time point and persisted through at least 3-month postactivation, though for a narrower spectral range at the later time point.Cochlear implantation increased middle-ear stiffness as indicated by decreased acoustic absorbance of low-frequency acoustic power. The findings of this study are consistent with those of previous studies and may have important implications toward understanding spatial hearing and programming of acoustic components for CI-combined electric and binaural acoustic stimulation patients.",

The sample was restricted to adults aged 25-65 years with complete audiometric data. HL was defined based on the pure-tone average (PTA) of 0.5-, 1-, 2-, and 4-kHz thresholds in the better hearing ear as follows: no loss (PTA < 25 dB), mild HL (25 dB < PTA < 40 dB), and moderate-to-severe HL (PTA > 40 dB). The association between HL and labor force participation was estimated using weighted logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, living arrangements, and health status.In a sample of 9,963 participants (50.6% women, 22.6% Black, 27% Hispanic), we found that compared with adults without HL, individuals with moderate-to-severe HL had greater odds of being outside of the labor force (odds ratio = 2.35; 95% confidence interval: 1.42-3.88). However, there were no differences by HL status in being employed or having a full- versus part-time job.Moderate-to-severe HL, but not mild HL, was associated with higher odds of not participating in the labor force. However, there were no differences by HL status in being employed or having a full- versus part-time job. Further research is needed to better characterize how HL may affect labor force participation.https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.19858930.",

This retrospective study examined differences in age at identification, hearing aid (HA) fitting, and seeking supportive services. Commonly requested attributes of services, reasons for HA rejection, and children's language performance were investigated.The age at identification decreased from 50.3 months in 2012 to 2.6 months in 2019. Similar trends of declining age were obtained for the age at HA fitting and age at first service contact. In addition, 40% of the parents did not seek support until the child became older (M = 30.5 months) and showed more noticeable behaviors related to hearing loss, and only 64% of the children were consistent HA users. Children with UHL enrolled in the intervention programs approximated the average language performance of the assessment norm; however, they showed depressed language levels when compared to the norm group at the 75th percentile.UNHS had a positive impact on early identification and intervention in children with UHL. Compared to parents of children with all types of hearing loss, parents of children with UHL seemed to be more uncertain about aural habilitation at the early stage.",

Veterans were identified as receiving care via the traditional face-to-face method or clinical video telehealth (CVT). Data were compiled to determine which, if any, PTM skills were being used 6-10 years later and the impact on self-reported ratings of well-being.More than half of the respondents reported using all four self-management skills up to 10 years postcompletion; relaxation was utilized by more Veterans than the other three skills. Approximately 69% reported improved ability to control reactions to tinnitus. At least half reported ratings of improved well-being. Eighty-eight percent of the respondents said they would recommend the workshops to someone with bothersome tinnitus. Veterans who received care via CVT reported using fewer skills than those who received care face-to-face; however, the CVT respondents reported the same or slightly better ability to cope with tinnitus, less bothersome tinnitus, and improved ratings of well-being. Finally, most participants who responded to an open-ended question about their workshop experience reported it as positive.This clinical focus project suggests that PTM Level 3 skills continue to be utilized up to 10 years after participation in the workshops. Although there were reductions in the number of skills used, Veterans' ability to manage reactions to tinnitus and improvement in self-reported ratings of well-being indicate successful ongoing tinnitus management efforts. Respondents who received care via CVT did not report lower self-reported ratings of well-being or appear less likely to recommend Level 3 group PTM to other Veterans with bothersome tinnitus.",

The study also attempted to define the optimal frequency tuning characteristic of NB CE-chirp evoked cVEMPs.cVEMP was performed on 26 young healthy adults using four different NB CE-chirps centered at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. The neck torsion method was applied for electrode placement. To have the acute recording, visual feedback of sternocleidomastoid muscle contraction was provided, and electromyography (EMG) scaling was done.cVEMPs were present for 100% across all frequencies except at 4000 Hz. Amplitudes between each pair of frequencies were significantly different for EMG scaled and unscaled conditions. Frequency tuning was observed at 500 Hz regardless of scaling done. Positive peak 1 of cVEMP (P1) latencies showed no differences between frequencies while both negative peak 1 of cVEMP and the complex of positive peak 1 and negative peak 1 of cVEMP (P1N1) interpeak latency values decreased with increasing frequency. Interaural amplitude asymmetry ratio showed no difference between scaled and unscaled amplitudes. Intraclass correlation revealed a range of test-retest reliability across frequencies. EMG unscaled amplitude were having relatively lower test-retest reliability consistently across frequencies Conclusions: Differences in amplitudes between frequencies with a maximum at 500 Hz can be attributed to the low frequency centered saccular response. No differences in P1 were observed. Yet, N1 latency and P1N1 interpeak latency difference gradually shortened with the decrement in the stimulus duration as the stimulation frequency increased. The lower reliability of EMG unscaled amplitude across frequencies supports the need to use EMG scaling to avoid confounding variables related to muscle contraction.",

Direct stimulation of the CI can be obtained via the Bluetooth connection of a device to the CI, thus excluding the typical-hearing ear. This study aims to investigate the use of CI connectivity features as a rehabilitative strategy in a small cohort of children affected by SSD. Method: A newly developed training protocol was presented to children with SSD who have less than 2 years of experience with CI. We developed a user-friendly and short-term (six sessions within 20 days) training protocol for speech perception that patients themselves can manage independently at home using CI connectivity systems. Children were telematically tested before and after the training by trained speech and language therapists. Results: Four patients met the inclusion criteria. They all showed better results in the final online assessment, when compared with the initial one. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first clinical focus article presenting an auditory training protocol for SSD patients with CI using the Bluetooth connectivity systems for teletherapy. The results, although preliminary, support the efficacy of this rehabilitative strategy. Further research is needed to support our findings.",

The secondary aim was to identify the optimal metric for measuring spatial processing changes across the life span (ages 10-70 years).A cross-sectional study comprising 115 participants with clinically normal hearing was conducted. Purposive sampling was adopted to recruit participants in the study, who were divided into six groups based on their chronological age.Temporal, intensity, spectral, and composite correlates of spatial acuity were assessed using psychoacoustic measures and perceptual questionnaires. The temporal (interaural time difference [ITD]) and intensity correlates (interaural level difference [ILD]) of spatial perception were obtained using a MATLAB (v 2020a), whereas the composite correlate (virtual auditory space identification scores [VASIs]) and perceptual ratings of spatial processing were measured using Paradigm software and speech spatial and qualities in Kannada (SSQ-K).Results across all tests (multivariate analyses variance: 6 age groups × 4 tests, followed by post hoc tests) consistently demonstrate poor ITD and ILD thresholds and overall lower spatial accuracy (VASI, SSQ-K) with increasing age. Discriminant function analyses (DFAs) revealed that VASI had a higher predictive power in capturing age-related changes in auditory spatial processing. The group segregation on spatial performance in DFA became evident after 50 years.This study provides evidence of gradual change in all three correlates of spatial processing, with statistically demonstrable deficits appearing from fourth decade of life on VASI and fifth decade of life on binaural processing.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Bone conduction hearing devices (BCDs) that deliver sound across the skin (i.e., transcutaneous) are suitable for some individuals who have conductive or mixed hearing losses. Prescriptive targets for percutaneous devices are available, for example, from the Desired Sensation Level–Bone Conduction Hearing Device (DSL-BCD) algorithm. These targets, however, may require modification for use with transcutaneous BCDs. The current study investigated three key variables that may inform target modification: (a) comparison of thresholds measured using an audiometric bone conduction (BC) transducer versus transcutaneous BCDs that offer in situ threshold measurement, (b) transcutaneous BCD default force level outputs versus recommended DSL percutaneous BC targets, and (c) the preferred listening levels (PLLs) of adults wearing transcutaneous BCDs in a laboratory setting. Method: Bilateral conductive hearing loss was simulated in 20 normal-hearing adults via earplugs. Thresholds were measured using a B-71 BC transducer and two commercially available BCDs coupled to a soft headband. DSL percutaneous BC targets were generated, and PLLs were obtained for a 60-dB SPL speech stimulus. Force level outputs were measured using a skull simulator on the Audioscan Verifit2 at the hearing aids' default settings and at the participants' PLL for each device. Results: On average, audiometric BC thresholds were significantly better than those measured in situ with each BCD. PLLs were similar to prescribed targets for one device with the smoother response shape and agreed in the high frequencies for both devices. Conclusions: In situ thresholds are significantly higher than audiometric BC thresholds, suggesting that device-based in situ measurement more accurately accounts for the signal transmission from transcutaneous BCDs. PLLs differed from the percutaneous targets and varied between devices, which may indicate that either target modifications or manipulations of device frequency response shaping are needed to approximate PLL with transcutaneous BCD devices.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Telepractice is a growing service model that delivers aural rehabilitation to deaf and hard-of hearing children via telecommunications technology. Despite known benefits of telepractice, this delivery approach may increase patients' listening effort (LE) characterized as an allocation of cognitive resources toward an auditory task. The study tested techniques for collecting physiological measures of LE in normal-hearing (NH) children during remote (referred to as tele-) and in-person communication using the wearable Empatica E4 wristband. Method: Participants were 10 children (age range: 9–12 years old) who came to two tele- and two in-person weekly sessions, order counterbalanced. During each session, the children heard a short passage read by the clinical provider, completed an auditory passage comprehension task, and self-rated their effort as a part of the larger study. Measures of electrodermal activity and blood volume pulse amplitude were collected from the child E4 wristband. Results: No differences in child subjective, physiological measures of LE or passage comprehension scores were found between in-person sessions and telesessions. However, an effect of treatment duration on subjective and physiological measures of LE was identified. Children self-reported a significant increase in LE over time. However, their physiological measures demonstrated a trend indicating a decrease in LE. A significant association between subjective measures and the passage comprehension task was found suggesting that those children who reported more effort demonstrated a higher proportion of correct responses. Conclusions: The study demonstrated the feasibility of collection of physiological measures of LE in NH children during remote and in-person communication using the E4 wristband. The results suggest that measures of LE are multidimensional and may reflect different sources of, or cognitive responses to, increased listening demand.

    "abstract": "Purpose: U.S. Army Soldiers undergo annual audiometric surveillance to facilitate prevention of auditory injury. Soldiers are screened for bothersome tinnitus and subsequently referred for a clinical audiological evaluation as warranted. Presumably, most Soldiers seen in the clinic for bothersome tinnitus receive a tinnitus diagnosis. The incidence of self-reported bothersome tinnitus at the time of annual audiometric surveillance and subsequent diagnosis of tinnitus in the medical record has not been examined to date. This study estimated the incidence of tinnitus diagnosis in a population of Soldiers who reported new onset bothersome tinnitus and explored trends associated with tinnitus diagnosis to refine hearing health education. Method: A subset of hearing conservation records retrieved for a previous study were selected based on change in self-reporting of bothersome tinnitus. Corresponding medical records were retrieved for this sample of Active Duty (AD) Soldiers. The data were retrospectively examined, and analyses were conducted to identify statistically significant differences between Soldiers with and Soldiers without a tinnitus diagnosis. In addition, trend patterns of bothersome tinnitus and significant threshold shift (STS) were examined. Results: Of the sample of 730,350 AD Soldiers, 16.7% self-reported new onset bothersome tinnitus and 7.1% of those recorded as having bothersome tinnitus had a diagnosis of tinnitus in their medical record. Soldiers with a tinnitus diagnosis were older and had higher pure-tone averages than Soldiers without a tinnitus diagnosis. Counterintuitively, overall trend percentages of bothersome tinnitus increased per calendar year, while the percentages of STS decreased throughout the study period. Conclusions: The rate of tinnitus diagnosis in the medical record is vastly lower than the prevalence of bothersome tinnitus recorded in the annual surveillance system. Steps should be taken to screen, refer, and diagnose tinnitus more consistently. Based on the outcome of the study analysis, we recommend that screening for bothersome tinnitus more closely follows procedure recommendations from the Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense (VA/DOD) Tinnitus Working Group, which may reduce the rate at which Soldiers report bothersome tinnitus.",

The participants ( N = 125) were randomized into four groups: paper–paper, online–online, paper–online, and online–paper. All participants completed the Swedish SSQ12 twice. Results: Principal components analysis revealed one component. Statistical analysis revealed good psychometric properties. Administration formats were compared using repeated-measures analysis of variance, which revealed no statistically significant differences. Conclusions: The results indicate that the Swedish SSQ12 is possible to use in paper-and-pen and online formats interchangeably. The questionnaire has potential to be used by Swedish audiologists seeking to understand the individual experience of hearing loss or to evaluate hearing rehabilitation. To further understand the possible differences and to broaden the use and understanding of the SSQ12, future studies should aim to determine the minimal clinically important difference for the SSQ12.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: We aim to determine the prevalence and characteristics of developmental disabilities among the clinical population of children who receive hearing health care in the United States. Method: Using electronic health records of 131,709 children (0–18 years), we identified those with a diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, vision differences, cerebral palsy, chromosomal abnormalities, delayed milestones, Down syndrome, or intellectual disability. We determined prevalence, age of first audiology encounter, age of diagnosis for the developmental disability, and hearing status based on the specific disability and the number of diagnoses. Binomial and multinomial logistic regressions were performed. Results: One in four children had a diagnosed developmental disability. The most common disabilities were delayed milestones (11.3%), vision differences (7.4%), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (6.6%), and autism spectrum disorder (6.2%). Half of the children with developmental disabilities had at least one diagnosis before their first audiology encounter. Children with developmental disabilities were more likely to have a reduced hearing or an unknown hearing status than children without developmental diagnoses. For children with reduced hearing, those with developmental disabilities had higher rates of bilateral configurations and poorer hearing severity levels. Conclusions: Developmental disabilities are common among children who seek hearing health care. Moreover, developmental disabilities often co-occur with reduced hearing. Further research and advocacy efforts are critical for creating clinical practices that are inclusive of, and equitable for, children with complex and diverse developmental profiles.

    "abstract": "Frequency modulation (FM) technology can significantly improve the speech perception ability of individuals with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in background noise. Previous investigations have demonstrated that the microphone design of the FM transmitter can have a significant impact on this improved speech perception. The purpose of this investigation was to compare 3 types of FM transmitter microphone designs: (a) wide angle (omnidirectional microphone), which amplifies sounds coming from all directions around the microphone equally; (b) zoom (1 directional microphone), which provides less amplification to signals coming from the rear, and (c) superzoom (2 directional microphones), which provides less amplification to signals originating from the rear and the sides. Fifteen adults with bilateral slight to moderately severe SNHL participated. Speech perception was assessed using the Hearing in Noise Test (M. Nilsson, S. Soli, &amp; J. Sullivan, 1994). Speech spectrum shaped noise served as the noise competition. Results revealed that the best speech perception in noise was obtained when the FM transmitter was used in the zoom setting. The poorest performance was obtained when the FM transmitter was in the wide-angle mode. The clinical implications of these results are discussed.",

More than 2 years after the 1st participants exited the project, a retrospective survey was conducted to determine the participants' use of, and satisfaction with, the 2 programs. Results From the 30 returned questionnaires, it seems that WDRC is used with a high degree of satisfaction in general everyday listening situations. The reported benefit from the addition of a directional microphone and speech enhancement for listening in noisy environments was lower and varied among the users. This variable was significantly correlated with how much the program was used. Conclusions The less frequent and more varied use of the program with directional microphones and speech enhancement activated in combination suggests that these features may be best offered in a 2nd listening program for listeners with severe or profound hearing loss.",

This study aimed to identify APD criteria, which are consistent with that used for comorbidities, and how comorbidities predicted APD. Method A retrospective study of 167 participants (males = 105, females = 62; age: 6–16 years; nonverbal IQ &gt; 80) with suspected APD is presented. Five SCAN-3 tests evaluated auditory processing (AP). Comorbidities included attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, language impairment, and impaired manual dexterity, which were identified using percentile ≤ 5 in the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham parental rating scale; Children's Communication Checklist-2; and Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2, respectively. Results Percentiles ≤ 9, ≤ 5, and &lt; 2 in two or more AP tests had sensitivities (specificities) of 76% (70.6%), 59.3% (76.5%), and 26% (82.4%), respectively, in predicting comorbidities, which were present in 150 of the 167 participants. The criterion of “≤ 9 percentile in two or more AP tests” (Approach I) diagnosed APD in 119 participants, and criterion “≤ 5 percentile in two or more AP tests or ≤ 5 percentile in one AP plus one or more measures of comorbidities” (Approach II) diagnosed 123. The combination of approaches diagnosed 128 participants (76.6%) with APD, of which 114 were diagnosed by each approach (89%). Language impairment and impaired manual dexterity, but not attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, predicted APD. Conclusions “Percentile ≤ 9 in two or more AP tests” or “percentile ≤ 5 in one AP plus one or more measures of comorbidities” are evidence-based APD diagnostic criteria. Holistic and interprofessional practice evaluating comorbidities including motor skills is important for APD.",

The extent and type of instruction in tinnitus clinical care provided by audiology graduate (AuD) programs is not clear, nor is it known whether training programs are consistent in their recommendations. It is certainly true that widely accepted standards do not exist to ensure that all tinnitus clinical services are supported by adequate scientific evidence, which may result in unsatisfactory outcomes and unnecessary expense for patients. The purpose of this clinical focus article is to describe the results of an informal survey of AuD programs to determine their level of training for tinnitus management. Method A short survey was sent to all 75 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association-accredited AuD programs to assess the extent and type of tinnitus training their students receive. Conclusions The 32 AuD programs that responded to our survey provide tinnitus training using a variety of settings and methods. Further research could explore in more detail the extent of training in specific methods provided by these programs, and aim to elicit responses from a greater number of programs and from the students themselves.",

    "abstract": "Purpose People with hearing impairment (HI) face numerous challenges that can be minimized with the use of hearing aids and cochlear implants. Despite technological advances in these assistive hearing devices, musical perception remains difficult for these people. Tests and protocols developed to assess the musical perception of this audience were the target of this systematic review, whose objective was to investigate how assessments of musical perception in people with HI are carried out. Method Searches for primary articles were carried out in the PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, and ASHAWire databases. Search results were managed using EndNote X9 software, and analysis was performed according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) Statement. Results The 16 cross-sectional included studies analyzed music perception data from people with HI compared to a control group of participants with normal hearing. Among these, four studies were selected to be included in a meta-analysis, performed with timbre and melody. Variability was observed in the tests and between the levels of auditory perception skills analyzed in relation to the components of music. With respect to the tests, sound stimuli generated by synthesizers were the most used stimuli; with the exception of timbre evaluation, the most frequent test environment was a booth with sound attenuation, and the average intensity for presenting sound stimuli was 70 dB SPL. The most evaluated sound component was pitch, followed by rhythm and timbre, with a pattern of responses based on adaptive and psychoacoustic methods. Conclusions The heterogeneity of the musical parameters and the auditory abilities evaluated by the tests is a fact that can compromise evidence found in this area of study. It is worth considering the quality of samples that were recorded with real musical instruments and digitized afterward, in comparison with synthesized samples that do not seem to accurately represent real instruments. The need to minimize semantic parallelism that involves the auditory skills and elements of music involved in the assessment of musical perception is highlighted.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of external feedback on perceptual learning of visual speech during lipreading training with sentence stimuli. The goal was to improve visual-only (VO) speech recognition and increase accuracy of audiovisual (AV) speech recognition in noise. The rationale was that spoken word recognition depends on the accuracy of sublexical (phonemic/phonetic) speech perception; effective feedback during training must support sublexical perceptual learning.Normal-hearing (NH) adults were assigned to one of three types of feedback: Sentence feedback was the entire sentence printed after responding to the stimulus. Word feedback was the correct response words and perceptually near but incorrect response words. Consonant feedback was correct response words and consonants in incorrect but perceptually near response words. Six training sessions were given. Pre- and posttraining testing included an untrained control group. Test stimuli were disyllable nonsense words for forced-choice consonant identification, and isolated words and sentences for open-set identification. Words and sentences were VO, AV, and audio-only (AO) with the audio in speech-shaped noise.Lipreading accuracy increased during training. Pre- and posttraining tests of consonant identification showed no improvement beyond test-retest increases obtained by untrained controls. Isolated word recognition with a talker not seen during training showed that the control group improved more than the sentence group. Tests of untrained sentences showed that the consonant group significantly improved in all of the stimulus conditions (VO, AO, and AV). Its mean words correct scores increased by 9.2 percentage points for VO, 3.4 percentage points for AO, and 9.8 percentage points for AV stimuli.Consonant feedback during training with sentences stimuli significantly increased perceptual learning. The training generalized to untrained VO, AO, and AV sentence stimuli. Lipreading training has potential to significantly improve adults' face-to-face communication in noisy settings in which the talker can be seen.",

Method The traditional Valsalva-induced nystagmus test is described, followed by a new method for assessment of superior semicircular dehiscence conducted by laying the patient supine during testing. A case study is presented to illustrate this new testing technique known as the Supine Superior Semicircular Canal Dehiscence Test. Results It is hypothesized that during Valsalva-induced nystagmus testing performed in the upright, seated position, the dura mater could potentially seal the superior semicircular canal fistula, thereby concealing a defect in the bony labyrinth and yielding a false-negative test. To circumvent this, the patient should be placed in the supine position during Valsalva-induced nystagmus testing in order to prevent the dura mater from inadvertently sealing itself against the petrous portion of the temporal bone. The Supine Superior Semicircular Canal Dehiscence Test may reveal the defect in the bony labyrinth and improve the sensitivity of the Valsalva-induced nystagmus test. Conclusions The Supine Superior Semicircular Canal Dehiscence Test may be more sensitive for identifying superior semicircular canal dehiscence in patients with traditional symptoms and a negative Valsalva-induced nystagmus test in the seated position. While a case study is presented to illustrate the potential benefits of including the Supine Superior Semicircular Canal Dehiscence Test in the battery of diagnostic tests, further research is needed in larger samples.",

The difference score was calculated at each of the four pure-tone frequencies. The measurement time and residual noise level in all stimulus levels were also determined.The difference scores across the 4 frequencies ranged within ±10 dB (1st: 58% to 71%, 2nd: 54% to 79%), within 20 dB (1st: 79% to 96%, 2nd: 79% to 100%), and ≥ 30 dB (1st: 4% to 17%, 2nd: 0% to 17%). The measurement times for both ears were approximately 20 min in both sessions. There was a significant correlation between the measurement time and the mean residual noise level for pooled frequencies in all stimulus levels (p = .0001249, r = .70). The measurement time was reduced by approximately 50% from conventional auditory steady-state response measurement.The results of this preliminary study support the use of this technology as a rapid and accurate method for behavioral auditory threshold evaluation.",

Listeners with hearing loss were tested with and without high-frequency acoustic energy to identify the type of amplification (narrowband, wideband, or frequency lowering) that yielded optimal performance.No differences were observed between the adults and children with normal hearing except for the adults' better nonsense word detection. The poorest performance was observed for the listeners with hearing loss in the unaided condition. Performance improved significantly with amplification to levels at or near that of their counterparts with normal hearing. With amplification, the adults performed as well as the children on all tasks except for word recognition.Adults retain the skills necessary for lexical acquisition regardless of hearing status.

    "abstract": "Purpose The Turkish Digit Triplet Test for hearing self-screening purposes and the Turkish Matrix Test (TURMatrix) for follow-up hearing diagnostics offer an automated closed-set response format where patients respond by choosing from response alternatives. Their applicability for testing Turkish-speaking patients in their native language by German audiologists with different Turkish language skills was investigated. Method Tests were composed of spoken numbers (Turkish Digit Triplet Test) or sentences (TURMatrix). For 49 participants differing in hearing ability, speech reception thresholds (SRTs) in noise and quiet were obtained, for the TURMatrix with either the open- or closed-set response format, by audiologists with and without Turkish language skills, respectively. Results SRTs of both tests correlate closely with each other as well as with hearing ability, but not as closely as individual SRTs in quiet with hearing ability. SRTs in noise of listeners with normal hearing were about 0.7 dB lower for the closed-set than for the open-set response format. Conclusions The 2 tests yield comparable results and are applicable to professionals without suitable language skills. For the closed-set response format of the TURMatrix, literacy is crucial and supplemental (visual) cues improve performance. Speech audiometry in noise should assess suprathreshold processing deficits independently from language proficiency in the majority language.",

    "abstract": "Purpose This study investigated the influence of voice onset time (VOT) on the perception of consonant–vowel (CV) signals during a dichotic listening (DL) task. Method Sixty-two young adults with normal hearing were tested with the English language version of the Hugdahl Dichotic CV (DCV) Test. They were asked to identify 1 CV syllable during 3 DL conditions: free recall (report the syllable heard most clearly), forced right (report the syllable in the right ear), and forced left (report the syllable in the left ear). Averages for number and percent correct syllables were recorded under each condition and across the entire test. Results All subjects demonstrated an overall right-ear advantage (REA) when scores from all 3 listening conditions were averaged. The REA occurred for all VOT pairings except when the long VOT was presented to the left ear, whereas the short VOT was presented to the right ear when subjects produced an average left-ear advantage. The left-ear advantage overcame the structural advantage of the right ear even when subjects were directed to attend to the right ear. This result was consistent with findings of earlier studies done with Norwegian and Australian subjects. Conclusions Listeners' REA may be overcome by interaural temporal differences that favor processing in the listener's nondominant ear during the DCV test. Balanced VOT conditions across the DCV test prevent this effect from producing an overall bias toward the left ear, but clinical DL tests with consonant–vowel–consonant words should be examined for effects of the long VOT on laterality of performance.",

Four repetition rates were used (1.6, 4.8, 8.3, and 26.6 Hz) and resulting oVEMP response presence, amplitude, amplitude asymmetry, and n1/p1 latency were assessed.Response presence was significantly reduced for 26.6 Hz using monaural stimulation and for 8.3 Hz and 26.6 Hz for binaural stimulation. For monaural stimulation using 1.6, 4.8, and 8.3 Hz, no significant differences were noted for amplitude or latency. Responses obtained using binaural stimulation demonstrated a significant effect of rate on amplitude, with 8.3 Hz producing significantly reduced amplitude. Binaural amplitudes were significantly larger than monaural contralateral responses but with reduced response presence. No significant differences were noted for latency or amplitude asymmetry.Using repetition rates of approximately 5 Hz or less may produce more consistent oVEMP response presence with minimal effects on amplitude for monaural or binaural recordings.",

Method CAEPs were recorded from 13 young adults with normal hearing. A 1000-Hz pure tone was presented in unaided and aided conditions with a linear analog hearing aid. Direct audio input was used, allowing recorded hearing aid noise floor to be added to unaided conditions to equate SNRs between conditions. An additional stimulus was created through scaling the noise floor to study the effect of signal level. Results Amplification resulted in delayed N1 and P2 peak latencies relative to the unaided condition. An effect of absolute signal level (when SNR was constant) was present for aided CAEP area measures, such that larger area measures were found at higher levels. Conclusion Results of this study further demonstrate that factors in addition to SNR must also be considered before CAEPs can be used to clinically to measure aided thresholds.",

HA gain was set low until sound was tolerable, then increased as listeners acclimated. Participants logged their daily listening experiences and were closely monitored by the audiologist. Measures included pre- and posttrial consonant-nucleus-consonant (CNC) word and phoneme scores and self-reports of satisfaction and listening ability in difficult situations.Acoustic stimulation was initially unpleasant, but approached comfort at target gain within the 3-week period. Benefit was demonstrated in continued voluntary HA use and higher bimodal phoneme scores compared to CI alone (8%-31% increases) for 4 of the participants.When a second CI is not a consideration, a contralateral HA should be pursued as the standard of care for prelingually deaf adults despite substantial auditory deprivation in the previously unaided ear, unpleasant sensations at initial HA fit, or lack of dramatic objective test gains. Frequent audiologist contact, repeated HA adjustments, and client journals are valuable in promoting favorable outcomes with bimodal hearing (adaptation, acceptance, and benefit) for this population.",

These tests include speech perception measures administered in quiet and in background noise. Such tests are required to make disability determinations for adults and children following cochlear implantation. The test review required an evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of the speech perception measures. Following a review of the literature, NASEM wrote that the evidence needed to support such a recommendation was lacking. They resorted to \"professional judgment\" and recommended a monosyllabic word recognition test, presumably in quiet, along with a measure of self-report or parent report. The primary purpose of this article was to critically review the committee's report. The secondary purpose was to critique the committee's recommendation of a monosyllabic word test as a measure of functional hearing ability for disability determinations. The third purpose was to provide a review of diagnostic accuracy studies not included in NASEM (2021) with an emphasis on speech recognition in noise (SRN) tests.In contrast to the committee's recommendation, studies have shown that a monosyllabic word test is a poor predictor of SRN ability. Contrary to the conclusion of NASEM (2021), diagnostic accuracy studies have been conducted for a few SRN tests. The Hearing in Noise Test and the AzBio SRN test have published data demonstrating their ability to correctly identify the presence and absence of an SRN disorder.",

Both clients and clinicians acknowledged the benefits of teleaudiology including convenience and accessibility and identified drawbacks, such as loss of personal interaction and communication difficulty. About 80% of students and academics reported inclusion of teleaudiology within their universities' curriculum but only to a limited extent. Low teleaudiology uptake rates in placement clinics, as well as insufficient funding and staffing, were suggested as barriers to learning and teaching teleaudiology. Industry partners were generally confident in training clinicians to use teleaudiology products and teaching students on teleaudiology, but only one industry partner had been invited by universities for teaching purposes.Low teleaudiology use and reserved attitudes toward widespread teleaudiology implementation were observed among clients.

The accuracy scores at each location and overall accuracy scores were compared across the sessions.The Shapiro-Wilk test indicated that the VASI data were not normally distributed. Intraclass correlation coefficient analysis revealed excellent test-retest reliability of the overall accuracy scores and moderate-to-high reliability of location-specific scores. This was complimented by the low response variability of the overall and location-specific accuracy scores. The Bland-Altman analysis also indicated minimal bias in VASI accuracy scores across the three sessions.It can be concluded from the results that VASI is a reliable tool for assessing spatial-hearing acuity in school-aged children. The high test-retest reliability and ease of portability make the test highly relevant for classroom setups where early diagnosis and intervention of spatial deficits can play a critical role in determining the academic success of school-going children.",

This study explored the effectiveness of hearing aid data logging (DL) awareness and coaching sessions on increasing hours of hearing aid use. We also collected qualitative data on challenges participants experienced managing hearing aid use.We used a single-subject design that included three conditions, during a 6-week period, in the same order for each participant. Condition A was baseline, Condition B was DL monitoring alone, and Condition C was remote coaching calls plus DL monitoring.Hours of hearing aid use increased for each child from baseline to the end of the study, ranging from 1.19 to 4.4 hr. Mothers reported that the coaching calls were beneficial and helped them identify and problem-solve issues.Parents were able to increase hours of hearing aid use with DL awareness and coaching support. Tele-audiology offers an opportunity to provide parents with more frequent support that can be individualized based on their situation, challenges, and family needs.",

Based on the overall outcome of these effects, detailed consideration is given to the health and well-being of individuals.Because hearing loss and tinnitus are consequential in affecting quality of life, novel neuromodulation paradigms are reviewed for their positive abatement and treatment-related effects. Examples of clinical data, research strategies, and methodological approaches focus on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve paired with tones (VNSt) for their unique contributions to this area.Acoustic toxicants transmitted through the atmosphere are noteworthy for their propensity to induce hearing loss and tinnitus. Mounting evidence also indicates that high-level rapid onset changes in atmospheric sound pressure can significantly impact vestibular and balance function. Indeed, the risk of falling secondary to loss of, or damage to, sensory receptor cells in otolith organs (utricle and saccule) is a primary reason for this concern. As part of the complexities involved in VNSt treatment strategies, vocal dysfunction may also manifest. In addition, evaluation of temporospatial gait parameters is worthy of consideration based on their ability to detect and monitor incipient neurological disease, cognitive decline, and mortality.Highlighting these respective areas underscores the need to enhance information exchange among scientists, clinicians, and caregivers on the benefits and complications of these outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is considered to be the greatest threat to human health in the 21st century, and its effects are accelerating. Extensive research has clearly demonstrated its increasing impact across the continuum of health conditions. Despite this, there has been limited attention to the ramifications of climate change on hearing loss and hearing disorders. This lack of consideration is somewhat surprising as the environment itself and its changing nature have a substantial effect on hearing.Tackling climate change could be the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century. To address this issue, this tutorial provides a general introduction to climate change and its three major elements (pollution, infectious diseases, and extreme weather events) and their effects on health. The substantial consequences of climate change for the incidence, development, and exacerbation of hearing loss and disorders are clearly described and detailed.The challenge of responding to this very real and escalating threat to hearing requires a combination of prevention, advocacy, and education. These three roles place audiologists in the perfect position to take action on the far-reaching effects of climate change on hearing loss and disorders. To respond to this challenge and to fulfill these roles, several strategies, ranging from the individual level to the global level, are delineated for audiologists to incorporate into their practice.",

However, there is evidence to suggest that these symptoms persist into the chronic phase of injury. Few prospective studies have examined the frequency and type of dizziness and imbalance in adults with chronic moderate-severe TBI. The aim of this preliminary analysis was to investigate the prevalence of these symptoms in adults with chronic moderate-severe TBI.Twenty-four adults with chronic moderate-severe TBI and a group of 19 age-, sex-, and education-matched noninjured comparison participants were recruited. Self-reported dizziness and imbalance were measured using a modified version of a standard case history form. Significant associations between group (TBI group or noninjured comparison [NC] participants) and self-reports of dizziness, imbalance, and related symptoms (endorsed \"yes\" or \"no\") were explored.The TBI group most reported lightheadedness (75%), vertigo (38%), and imbalance and/or falling (46%). The most common related symptom reported by the TBI group was headache (63%) and nausea (46%). Significant associations revealed that the TBI group responded \"yes\" in higher percentages than the NC group across all categories (dizziness, imbalance, and related symptoms). There were no statistically significant relationships among dizziness, imbalance, or headache symptoms within the TBI group.These preliminary findings suggest that dizziness and imbalance are prevalent in adults with chronic moderate-severe TBI. Persistent vertiginous symptoms may point to an underlying vestibular impairment. However, further research is needed to characterize vestibular function in chronic moderate-severe TBI.",

A case report of an ABI recipient with exceptionally good speech recognition outcomes presents an opportunity to better understand the core information processing mechanisms that underlie variability and individual differences in outcomes. Method: A case study is reported of an adult ABI recipient (ID-006) with postlingually acquired, Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2)–related hearing loss who displayed exceptional postoperative speech recognition scores. A novel battery of assessment measures was used to evaluate ID-006's auditory, cognitive, and linguistic information processing skills. Results: Seventeen years following ABI activation, ID-006 scored 77.6% correct on the AzBio Sentences in quiet. On auditory processing tasks, ID-006 scored higher on tasks with meaningful sentences and much lower on tasks that relied exclusively on audibility. ID-006 also demonstrated exceptionally strong abilities on several cognitive and linguistic information processing tasks. Conclusions: Results from a novel battery of information processing tests suggest that ID-006 relies extensively on top-down predictive processing and cognitive control strategies to efficiently encode and process auditory information provided by his ABI. Results suggest that current measures of outcomes and benefits should be expanded beyond conventional speech recognition measures to include more sensitive and robust measures of speech recognition as well as neurocognitive measures such as executive function, working memory, and lexical access.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Tinnitus is highly prevalent among U.S. military Veterans, yet referral to, and use of, tinnitus rehabilitation services to improve quality of life and functional status with tinnitus is low. Veterans with tinnitus often have other health issues that overlap or exacerbate the impact of tinnitus, potentially complicating referral and rehabilitative pathways. This qualitative study explores views on the daily impacts of tinnitus and experiences with tinnitus-related health care among Veterans. The goal of this research is to amplify the voices of Veterans regarding their experiences with tinnitus to illuminate the physiological and socioemotional sequelae associated with the condition and to increase clinician awareness of the complex, interdisciplinary rehabilitative needs among Veterans with bothersome tinnitus. Method: This qualitative study was part of a larger study about tinnitus and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Veterans were sampled to represent national Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) users with and without comorbid TBI, and who were or were not interested in tinnitus rehabilitation services. Forty Veterans with tinnitus were interviewed (32 men, eight women). Data were analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach. Results: Major themes across the Veteran interviews included (a) functional effects of tinnitus on daily life, (b) tinnitus and other health conditions, (c) reactions to the lack of a cure for tinnitus, (d) strategies to improve quality of life and function, and (e) use of VA services for tinnitus. Conclusions: Our findings highlight that bothersome tinnitus negatively impacted various aspects of daily functioning, including communication, sleep, concentration, and mood, suggesting a need for audiologists to work closely with mental health services to improve quality of life and functional status for those negatively impacted by the condition. Future work is needed to obtain the viewpoints of clinicians and other health care partners to better understand the barriers and facilitators to providing evidence-based tinnitus treatment in VA and non-VA settings.",

The resources for this study included financial reports related to establishing UNHS in different health care systems; Canadian provincial, territorial, and federal regulations and publications; local and nationwide media; and interviews health care staff and program managers.Because of its benefits and its cost-effectiveness, UNHS programs have been implemented in many health care systems around the world. Despite Canada's success in offering a wide array of health care services to its citizens, certain provinces trail behind others in developing UNHS programs. Although there have been recent improvements in the screening rate of the province of Québec, nearly half of all Québec newborns continue to not be screened for hearing loss. The reasons for the current low screening rate include delays in implementation, information-technology complications, operating costs, and lack of public awareness.For UNHS to be implemented in a timely fashion, those involved in the process should first understand what challenges may arise. Québec's experience with this process may provide useful lessons for other health care systems.",

    "abstract": "In the present report, we reviewed the role of cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) as an objective measure during the evaluation and management process in children with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD).We reviewed the results of CAEP recordings in 66 patients with ANSD aged between 2 months and 12 years and assessed the relationship between their characteristics (prevalence, morphology, latencies, and amplitudes) and various clinical features, including the mode of medical management.Overall, the CAEPs were present in 85.2% of the ears tested. Factors such as prematurity, medical complexity, neuronal issues, or presence of syndromes did not have an effect on the presence or absence of CAEPs. CAEP latencies were significantly shorter in ears with cochlear nerve deficiency than in ears with a normal caliber nerve. Three different patterns of CAEP responses were observed in patients with bilateral ANSD and present cochlear nerves: (a) responses with normal morphology and presence of both P1-P2complex and N2 components, (b) responses with abnormal morphology and presence of the N2 component but undefined P1-P2complex peak, and (c) entirely absent responses. None of the patients with normal, mild, or moderate degree of hearing loss had a complete absence of CAEP responses. No significant differences were uncovered when comparing the latencies across unaided and aided children and children who later received cochlear implants.The CAEP protocol used in our ANSD program did inform about the presence or absence of central auditory stimulation. Absent responses typically fit into an overall picture of complete auditory deprivation and all of these children were ultimately offered cochlear implants after failing to develop oral language. Present responses, on the other hand, were acknowledged as a sign of some degree of auditory stimulation but always interpreted with caution given that prognostic implications remain unclear.",

    "abstract": "For half a century, psycholinguists have been exploring the idea that developmental language disorders may have their roots in suprathreshold auditory dysfunctions, but results are inconclusive. Typical studies focus on relationships between temporal processing abilities and measures of various language skills at the time of testing, a proximal account. This study expanded that focus by testing three novel hypotheses: (a) Spectral processing impairments may be more responsible for language-learning deficits than temporal processing impairments. (b) Phonological sensitivity is likely the specific language skill most strongly affected by auditory (dys)functions. (c) Poor auditory functioning observed at young ages may wholly or partly recover, reducing the magnitude of relationship between those recovered functions and persistent language skills at older ages.Sixty-six children (31 boys, 35 girls) 7-10 years of age participated: 36 with typical language and 30 with reading or speech disorder; from this sample two subsamples were designated: younger (7-8 years) and older (9-10 years) children. Four auditory measures were obtained of spectral modulation detection (0.5 and 2.0 cycles per octave) and temporal modulation detection (16 and 64 Hz). Four language measures were obtained, two lexicosyntactic and two phonological.Younger children showed deficits in all auditory skills, but most strongly for spectral modulation detection at 0.5 cycles per octave; that measure was the only one for which older children showed deficits. Spectral modulation detection was the auditory function most strongly correlated with a language skill, and that language skill was phonological sensitivity.Early impairments in suprathreshold auditory functions, especially spectral processing, interfere with language acquisition at early stages, especially phonological sensitivity. Although auditory functions can recover to some extent, impairments in language skills persist, indicating that a distal account may more appropriately explain the relationship.https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.24730128.",

Accurate measurement of SPL at the tympanic membrane (TM) requires probe microphone placement within 6 to 8 mm of the TM. A method of probe placement using the acoustical properties of the EAM (Sullivan, 1988) was investigated in 6 adults. Sullivan's acoustic probe placement method was found to overestimate probe distance from the TM, but with minor modification the acoustic method could be used to place the probe so that real ear measurements accurately predicted SPL at the TM. The difference between TM SPL and SPL at probe position was compared for the acoustic method and a constant insertion depth (25 mm) method. More accurate estimates of TM SPL were obtained with the acoustic method.",

Recently, Walden (1997) described a model protocol that might be used to assess hearing aid benefit in manufacturer-sponsored clinical trials. The Walter Reed protocol includes laboratory measures of speech recognition ability using the Continuous Speech Test (CST, Cox, Alexander, & Gilmore, 1987; Cox, Alexander, Gilmore, & Pusakulick, 1988) and the scales and subscales of the Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (PHAB, Cox & Gilmore, 1990) to assess user benefit in four prototype listening environments.A clinical trial of the ReSound BT2 Personal Hearing System (BT2 PHS) using the Walter Reed protocol is reported here. The results for 40 adult participants with moderate-to-severe acquired sensorineural hearing losses revealed significant benefit from the BT2 PHS as compared to unaided performance on most of the CST and PHAB measures.Compared to performance (unaided) of persons with normal hearing, the individuals with hearing impairments obtained substantially poorer performance on the CST and reported slightly poorer BT2-aided performance on the PHAB. Finally, on average, participants reported significantly more success on the PHAB with the BT2 PHS as compared to their own linear hearing aids, and 70% of the participants preferred the BT2 PHS enough to be willing to purchase it rather than to continue to use their own government-issued linear hearing aids.",

    "abstract": "The pediatric and adult versions of the SCAN-3 test (Keith, 2009a, 2009b) are widely used to screen and diagnose auditory processing disorders. According to the instruction manual, the test administration is flexible in that it may be administered through an audiometer at 50 dB HL or a portable CD player at the patient or administrator's most comfortable listening level (MCL). Because MCL may vary across individuals, even in those with normal hearing sensitivity, this study explored whether the presentation level affected scores on the SCAN-3 for both pediatric and adult populations.Twenty-two young adults and 23 children with normal hearing sensitivity and middle ear function were administered the SCAN-3 three different times at 1-month intervals, at 40, 50, and 60 dB HL. The stimulus level of the SCAN-3 was counterbalanced across participants to eliminate test order effects. In addition, MCL was measured in the pediatric participants during each session.MCL varied significantly across children as well as between test sessions, ranging from 40 to 75 dB HL. Performance on 3 of the 4 subtests administered, as well as composite scores, was significantly different across presentation levels (based on scaled scores). Effect sizes were also calculated and found to be strong. The number of composite scores interpreted as within normal limits versus borderline or disordered was also statistically different across presentation levels.Presentation level appears to affect performance on auditory figure ground, monaural low-redundancy, and binaural integration types of auditory processing tasks that are measured by the SCAN-3. In children, MCL was found to vary significantly both between and within individuals. Although several professions outside audiology are qualified to administer the SCAN-3, it is likely that many of these individuals administer the test without an audiometer and would use an MCL to determine presentation level. It is recommended that SCAN-3 users administer the test through an audiometer at 50 dB HL, rather than with a portable CD player, using MCL values to avoid any presentation level effects.",

Author impact metrics were summed to represent the total institution output, and median values were calculated to reflect a measure of central tendency of individual faculty performance.Three hundred and seventy-nine audiology faculty members were identified and of those 86.0% (n = 326) were found in Scopus. Database presence increased with increasing rank (p = .003). Scopus index values were positively skewed. The total summed number of documents, citations, and h indices were positively correlated with the total number of faculty in the institutions and with the summed number of coauthors (p < .001). The median number of documents, citations, and h indices were not significantly correlated with the total number of faculty in the institutions but were positively correlated with the median number of coauthors (p < .001). In general, indices were higher for research/doctoral versus nonresearch universities. Higher college program rankings were statistically related with better Scopus index values.These institutional metrics may be used to serve as a benchmark for institutional production, attracting students, hiring faculty, and assessing allocation of institutional funding.",

    "abstract": "Purpose This project was aimed at evaluating the reliability, validity, and clinical utility of a protocol for integrated measurements of the most comfortable level (MCL) and uncomfortable level (UCL) for speech, in combination with the speech recognition threshold (SRT). We also evaluated the validity of using spondee words when measuring speech MCL and UCL. Method In a randomized block design, equal numbers of women and men with normal hearing, aged 18-29 years, were assigned to each of 3 experimental stimulus conditions: spondee singlets, spondee triplets, or connected discourse ( n = 12 per group). Following measurement of the SRT, a modified method of limits was employed to establish, on a 7-point loudness rating scale, an ascending MCL, a descending MCL, and an ascending UCL. A single instructional set covered all loudness measurements. Test times were tracked electronically to assess clinical efficiency. All test conditions were repeated during each of 2 separate test sessions. Results Mean SRTs, MCLs, and UCLs across the 3 different experimental groups were found not to differ statistically or clinically (mean differences < 5 dB). Intrasession and intersession reliability for the various measures were excellent, and testing of all listeners was completed in a timely manner. In a follow-up experiment with adults with normal hearing who were only a decade older than participants in our main experiment, the older group was found to have significantly higher MCLs and UCLs. Conclusions Spondee words can be used routinely to obtain reliable, valid, and clinically efficient measures of MCLs and UCLs for speech, in a protocol combined with the SRT. Spondees, presented singly, yielded the greatest level of efficiency overall. Results support a recommendation to obtain an ascending measurement of MCL prior to a descending measurement and to establish the MCL by averaging the 2 values.",

Method Fifteen subjects ( M = 27.7 years, SD = 6.73 years) participated in this study. The participants had no prior history of otological or neurological disease. Both oVEMPs and cVEMPs were recorded at a fixed stimulus level for stimulus durations of 2, 5, 10, and 25 ms. For both cVEMP and oVEMP, responses were obtained using a traditional differential recording montage and a monopolar recording montage. Results The cVEMP and the oVEMP had the greatest amplitude in the 2-ms stimulus condition. There was a statistically significant decrease in amplitude for durations greater than 2 ms. Monopolar and bipolar cVEMP and oVEMP latencies and amplitudes were not significantly different. Conclusion As stimulus duration increased beyond 2 ms, the amplitude of the response decreased for both the cVEMP and the oVEMP. There was no significant change in latency with increasing stimulus duration for either response. These results suggested the optimal stimulus duration for both the oVEMP and cVEMP is 2 ms, and there is no apparent advantage of using a bipolar recording technique.",

However, many older adults have hearing loss that is unidentified. Because they do not present the problem at health care settings, there is a dearth of research on people with unrecognized hearing loss (URHL). This study elucidates differences between older adults with normal hearing, adults with recognized hearing loss (RHL), and adults with URHL. Method Participants included 130 adults, ages 55-85 years. Of these, 39 had hearing in the normal range (HNR), 61 had RHL, and 30 reported HNR but failed a hearing screen (i.e., URHL). Participants completed the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988 ) and a battery of neuropsychological tests. Results The URHL group reported more positive affectivity than the HNR and RHL groups on the PANAS. In addition, the URHL group was significantly older and more likely to be male compared to the HNR group. Importantly, age was not significantly correlated with PANAS. Positive affectivity accounted for unique variance in group membership even after accounting for age, gender, physical health, and cognitive health. Conclusions Older adults with URHL have more positive affectivity than older adults with HNR or RHL. This group may be prone to downplaying their difficulties; consequently, they may need to experience larger hearing deficits before seeking help. The findings highlight the need for research investigating the effectiveness of psychoeducation on the importance of formal hearing assessment verses relying on self-assessment in facilitating early and effective intervention among people with URHL.",

Consequently, we have significant gaps in our understanding of how auditory development unfolds during this time period. One method that appears to be promising is an observer-based procedure that uses conditioned, play-based responses (Bonino & Leibold, 2017). In order to evaluate the quality of data obtained with this method, this study presented a suprathreshold signal to determine the number of trials 2- to 7-year-old children could complete, as well as the associated hit rate and observer confidence. Method Participants were 23 children (2-7 years old). Children were taught to perform a play-based motor response when they detected the 1000-Hz warble tone signal (at 30 dB SPL). An observer evaluated children's behavior using a 2-interval, 2-alternative testing paradigm. Testing was terminated after 100 trials or earlier, if signs of habituation were observed. Results Data were successfully collected from 22 of the 23 children. Of the 22 children, all but 1 child completed 100 trials. Overall hit rate was high (0.88-1.0;",

Purpose The purpose of the study was to compare P300 event-related potentials in normal-hearing adults with those of adults with Type II diabetes mellitus. Research Design A two-group (with diabetes and controls) comparative study (age- and sex-matched) with a nonprobability sampling method was used. Study Sample Sixty-four adult participants (32 with diabetes, 32 without diabetes) between the ages of 23 and 60 years participated. Data Collection and Analysis Pure-tone audiometry was performed to ensure participants had pure-tone averages of ≤ 25 dB HL. Folstein Mini-Mental State Examinations were conducted, which ensured absence of cognitive impairment. Blood glucose levels were measured immediately prior to P300 testing, after which amplitude and latency results were captured. Descriptive analysis was used to calculate mean, standard deviation, median, and 25th and 75th percentiles. To study differences between adults with and without diabetes as well as the effect of glucose, linear mixed-model regression analyses were performed when left and right ears were combined, and simple linear regression analyses were performed when left and right ears were analyzed separately. Results For P300 latency results, a significant statistical difference ( p &lt; .001) was observed between participants with and without diabetes (352.46 ms, SD = 36.36; 314.09 ms, SD = 32.08), respectively. A significant statistical difference ( p &lt; .001) in amplitude was observed between participants with and without diabetes, respectively (12.10 μV, SD = 3.70; 15.08 μV, SD = 2.82). Glucose was a key moderator of only amplitude after adjusting for diabetes status. Glucose had no effect on amplitude and latency for adults without Type II diabetes mellitus (DM). Conclusions Type II DM decreases amplitude and increases latency; in addition, adults with Type II DM, attention, and working memory, as denoted by P300 amplitude, may deteriorate with increased glucose levels on the day of testing.",

Specifically, we examined the extent to which families own necessary hearing aid maintenance equipment, whether and by whom hearing aid maintenance tasks are being completed, and the effects of grade and receipt of an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or 504 plan on a child's assumption of responsibility for hearing aid care. Method Participants included 167 children who are hard of hearing in 1st to 4th grade. Caregivers reported whether the families owned various types of hearing aid maintenance equipment (listening tube, battery tester, and dri-aid kit) and who normally completes various hearing aid maintenance tasks. Information about children's audiological characteristics was also collected. Results Thirty-two percent of families reported not owning at least 1 piece of hearing aid maintenance equipment. Using a battery tester and performing a listening check were the maintenance tasks completed the least frequently, with 49% and 28% of caregivers reporting that these tasks are not completed regularly, respectively. Children's responsibility for hearing aid maintenance increased with grade. After controlling for maternal education and degree of hearing loss, children with an IEP or 504 plan took more responsibility for hearing aid maintenance tasks than children without these services. Conclusion Important hearing aid maintenance tasks, such as listening checks, are not completed regularly for many children, even when families own the necessary equipment. Ensuring that children who are hard of hearing have an IEP or 504 plan throughout elementary school may support self-advocacy and encourage children to take responsibility for their hearing aids, which may lead to more consistent hearing aid functioning.",

However, these tasks are sensitive to language disturbances already found in them. Thus, in this study, monosyllables were used ruling out the language effects, and auditory working memory ability was evaluated in AWS using the n-back task. In specific, the auditory sensory input of the working memory mechanism was evaluated. Method Thirty-two participants, 16 each of AWS and adults with no stuttering (AWNS), performed behavioral auditory 1-back and 2-back tasks. The long latency responses were also recorded during no-back and 2-back conditions from 64 electrode sites. Results Results revealed no significant differences between the groups in any of the behavioral parameters such as reaction time, accuracy, false alarm rate, or d'. N1 amplitude modulation was noted in AWNS, which was absent in AWS. The segmentation analysis showed a left hemisphere-oriented topographical distribution in the N2 region in AWS irrespective of conditions, whereas the scalp topography was right hemisphere-oriented with the involvement of parietal channels in AWNS. The timing differences existed between AWS and AWNS in the intervals that a topographical distribution lasted in all throughout the time window of analysis. Conclusion The results suggest altered neural pathway and hemispheric differences during auditory working memory tasks in AWS.",

    "abstract": "Objective Frequency tuning of ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential (oVEMP), which is the stimulus frequency corresponding to the largest oVEMP amplitude, has been used to diagnose cases with Ménière's disease and differentiate them from cases with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. However, this measure of oVEMP is carved out of the peak-to-peak amplitude of oVEMP, and studies on test–retest reliability of amplitude of oVEMP have shown moderate-to-excellent reliability of amplitude. This would theoretically render the frequency tuning of oVEMP susceptible to variations across multiple recordings. This being the case, erroneous conclusions regarding the presence of Ménière's disease could be made if the frequency tuning varies between recordings. However, there is no published report regarding the test–retest reliability of frequency tuning measure of oVEMP even in healthy individuals, to the best of our knowledge. Therefore, this study aimed to study the test–retest reliability of frequency tuning of oVEMP in healthy individuals. Method The study included 20 healthy adults in the age range of 18–25 years. All participants underwent oVEMP recording in 4 different sessions, with each session consisting of oVEMP recording for octave and midoctave tone-burst frequencies from 250 to 2000 Hz. Results The results revealed no significant difference in frequency tuning of oVEMP among the sessions ( p &gt; .05). The intraclass correlation coefficient for frequency tuning data was found to be .857. Conclusion The frequency tuning of oVEMP has excellent test–retest reliability and therefore lends itself to applications requiring multiple sessions of recording.",

Using a dual-task paradigm, it has been shown that older adults deploy more listening effort than younger adults when performing a speech recognition task in noise. Purpose The primary purpose of this study was to investigate whether a dual-task paradigm could be used to investigate differences in listening effort for an audiovisual speech comprehension task. If so, it was predicted that older adults would expend more listening effort than younger adults. Method Three groups of participants took part in the investigation: (a) young normal-hearing adults, (b) young normal-hearing adults listening to the speech material low-pass filtered above 3 kHz, and (c) older adults with age-related normal hearing sensitivity or better. A dual-task paradigm was used to measure listening effort. The primary task consisted of comprehending a short documentary presented at 63 dBA in a background noise that consisted of a 4-talker speech babble presented at 69 dBA. The participants had to answer a set of 15 questions related to the content of the documentary. The secondary task was a tactile detection task presented at a random time interval, over a 12-min period (approximately 8 stimuli/min). Each task was performed separately and concurrently. Results The younger participants who performed the listening task under the low-pass filtered condition displayed significantly more listening effort than the 2 other groups of participants. Conclusion First, the study confirmed that the dual-task paradigm used in this study was sufficiently sensitive to reveal significant differences in listening effort for a speech comprehension task across 3 groups of participants. Contrary to our prediction, it was the group of young normal-hearing participants who listened to the documentaries under the low-pass filtered condition that displayed significantly more listening effort than the other 2 groups of listeners.",

Method A crossover, double-blinded study was conducted for 12 weeks. Twelve adult participants were randomly assigned to two groups. During the first 6-week test interval, one group continued to use their everyday FSP strategy, whereas the other group was upgraded to the FS4 strategy. In the second 6-week interval, the two groups switched coding strategies. Speech perception was measured at the end of each test interval with the Oldenburg Sentence Test and the Göttingen Sentence Test. Participants completed the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale at the end of each test interval and a simple preference test at the end of the study. Results There was no significant difference in speech perception test results obtained with the Oldenburg Sentence Test and the Göttingen Sentence Test, neither in quiet nor in noise. Participants' Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale self-evaluation and preference test results showed that the two coding strategies had similar effects on their hearing perception. No clear preference for either of the strategies was found. Conclusions Speech perception test results and the participants' level of satisfaction were similar for the two FS coding strategies. Despite differences in the presentation of temporal fine structure between FSP and FS4, a clear benefit of the newer FS4 strategy could not be shown.",

Method Thirty adults with mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss (clinical group) and 17 adults with normal hearing (control group) in the age range of 23-60 years participated in the study. Syllable identification in noise (SIN) and ALLRs in noise were measured three times (three sessions) over a period of 2 months of hearing aid use. Results Results showed a significant increase in SIN and a decrease in the latency of ALLRs in the later sessions compared to the baseline session in the clinical group. However, the changes seen across the three sessions in the control group were not statistically significant. The magnitude of change in ALLRs seen in the clinical group did not significantly correlate with the change in SIN scores seen in them. Conclusions The study provides evidence for improvements in speech perception in noise and in processing time of auditory cortical areas with hearing aid acclimatization. However, it is important to note that the improvement in ALLRs does not assure improvement in speech perception in noise.",

To address this issue, our objective was to cross-culturally adapt a \"Hearing Loss Toolkit for Self-Management\" for use with Spanish-speaking adults seen in a clinical setting. In this clinical focus article, we describe a process for translation and cross-cultural adaptation of patient education materials based on current best practices guidelines. Method We utilized guidelines from the International Society for Pharmoeconomics Outcomes Research Task Force for Translation and Cultural Adaptation, the World Health Organization, and the International Collegium of Rehabilitative Audiology to complete a comprehensive, systematic, cross-cultural adaptation process of the source materials. The adaptation stages included forward translation and reconciliation, back translation and review, field testing with representative end users from the target population, and finalization. Results We successfully cross-culturally adapted the source materials following best practice guidelines. The Spanish-language adaptation was deemed understandable, actionable, aesthetically pleasing, and culturally appropriate by a group of native Spanish speakers. Conclusions There is an unmet need for the development of hearing loss self-management materials that incorporate cultural and linguistic competence with best health literacy practices. High-quality cross-cultural adaptations that consider the intersection of culture, language, and health literacy are a positive step toward reducing barriers to hearing health care related to language access for U.S. Hispanic/Latino adults with hearing loss.",

Research has indicated that audiologists are more comfortable with counseling that is information based than with personal adjustment counseling. The prevailing model of diagnosis appears to be the medical model in which, first, a case history is taken, then testing and, finally, counseling. This model lends itself to audiologist as expert and the counseling as a separate entity based on information and advice. Further research has indicated parents retain little of the information provided in the initial examination because of their heightened emotions. This article presents a client-centered model of diagnosis in which information is provided within an emotionally safe context, enabling the parents to express their feelings and have the ability to control the flow of information. The ultimate purpose of a client-centered model is to empower parents by making them active participants in the diagnostic process rather than passive recipients. Conclusion The client-centered model has wide implications for the diagnostic process as well as for the training of students.",

The second method was based on a regression analysis of wave I latency delays and the magnitude of conductive component for the subjects in this study with normal cochlear status.

    "abstract": "The Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (JCIH, 2000) has presented principles and guidelines for universal newborn hearing screening and early hearing detection and intervention (EHDI). The guidelines describe the need for a national data set for early hearing detection and intervention. The guidelines fail to provide the specific constructs for such a data set. To the authors’ knowledge, no nationally proposed uniform data structure exists to capture EHDI services’ outcome metrics. This article presents a proposed newborn hearing screening and EHDI data model. This model was developed to record EHDI outcomes data from Military Health System birthing centers. The data are to be collected for tracking implementation of Healthy People 2010 goals related to newborn hearing screening and EHDI programs within the Military Health System. In this article, the authors use the T. Helfer, A. Shields, and K. Gates (2000) methods to model a uniform structure for collection of newborn hearing screening and EHDI data. They also discuss expansion of the data model for application to public health reporting of EHDI outcomes in the civilian sector to include integration of Census Bureau demographic data and geographic information system data to further enhance the research value of these EHDI outcomes data. They offer the data model with the intention of supporting national research efforts for studying the efficacy of EHDI programs and to help establish a national evidence-based practice database for such programs.",

    "abstract": "The physiologic basis for cochlear and brainstem implants is discussed. It is concluded that the success of cochlear implants may be explained by assuming that the auditory system can adequately discriminate complex sounds, such as speech sounds, on the basis of their temporal structure when that is encoded in a few separate frequency bands to offer moderate separation of spectral components. The most important roles of the cochlea seems to be to prepare complex sounds for temporal analysis and to create separate channels through which information in different frequency bands is transmitted separately to higher nervous centers for decoding of temporal information. It is then pertinent to ask how many channels are needed. Because speech discrimination is very important, it is probably sufficient to use enough channels to separate formants from each other.",

    "abstract": "A case study is reported of an adult bilateral cochlear implant patient who owns both a pair of ear-level and body-worn speech processors and chooses to wear them in unique configurations, knowingly compromising his auditory performance. The aim was to determine if differences in hearing could be quantified between these devices and to examine the size of these effects that would lend themselves to trading between performance and cosmetics. The patient reported wearing bilateral ear-level speech processors (programmed with the Cochlear Corporation spectral PEAK [SPEAK] coding strategy) 75% of the time for cosmetic and convenience reasons even though he \"heard the best\" with bilateral body-worn speech processors (programmed with the Cochlear Corporation advanced combination encoder strategy [ACE]). Speech perception and localization tests confirmed that this patient performed significantly better on monosyllabic phonemes in quiet (a difference from 60% to 75%) and localization (a total root-meansquared- error difference from 22° to 12°) with bilateral body-worn speech processors and consistently rated various speech sounds as more clear than with bilateral ear-level units. There was a 2-dB difference in sentence reception threshold in noise, which was not statistically significant. These results suggest that clinicians should consider and provide options to patients when there are trade-offs to be made regarding understanding performance and cosmetics. Some individuals may choose better speech perception over cosmetics, and the ability to choose might result in greater compliance. The observations made here are relevant to hearing aid users as well.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Clinical use of electrophysiologic measures has been limited to use of brief stimuli to evoke responses. While brief stimuli elicit onset responses in individuals with normal hearing and normal central auditory nervous system (CANS) function, responses represent the integrity of a fraction of the mainly excitatory central auditory neurons. Longer stimuli could provide information regarding excitatory and inhibitory CANS function. Our goal was to measure the onset–offset N1–P2 auditory evoked response in subjects with normal hearing and subjects with moderate high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (HFSNHL) to determine whether the response can be measured in individuals with moderate HFSNHL and, if so, whether waveform components differ between participant groups. Method Waveforms were obtained from 10 participants with normal hearing and seven participants with HFSNHL aged 40–67 years using 2,000-ms broadband noise stimuli with 40-ms rise–fall times presented at 50 dB SL referenced to stimulus threshold. Amplitudes and latencies were analyzed via repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). N1 and P2 onset latencies were compared to offset counterparts via repeated-measures ANOVA after subtracting 2,000 ms from the offset latencies to account for stimulus duration. Offset-to-onset trough-to-peak amplitude ratios between groups were compared using a one-way ANOVA. Results Responses were evoked from all participants. There were no differences between participant groups for the waveform components measured. Response × Participant Group interactions were not significant. Offset N1–P2 latencies were significantly shorter than onset counterparts after adjusting for stimulus duration (normal hearing: 43 ms shorter; HFSNHL: 47 ms shorter). Conclusions Onset–offset N1–P2 responses were resistant to moderate HFSNHL. It is likely that the onset was elicited by the presentation of a sound in silence and the offset by the change in stimulus envelope from plateau to fall, suggesting an excitatory onset response and an inhibitory-influenced offset response. Results indicated this protocol can be used to investigate CANS function in individuals with moderate HFSNHL. Supplemental Material https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.14669007",

    "abstract": "Purpose Tinnitus, or the perception of sounds that occur without an external sound source, is a prevalent condition worldwide. For a subset of adults, tinnitus causes significant distress and impairment. Several patient-reported outcome measures have been developed to assess severity of tinnitus distress. However, at present, the field lacks a brief measure that is sensitive to treatment change. The purpose of the current study was to develop and preliminarily validate a brief questionnaire for tinnitus severity from two existing measures of tinnitus-related distress, the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) and Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI). Method Using data from nine study samples in the United States and United Kingdom, we conducted exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to identify a short measure with good psychometric properties. We also assessed sensitivity to treatment-related change by examining associations with change in the TFI and THI. Finally, we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis of the final short questionnaire in a new sample of adults seeking treatment for tinnitus-related distress. Results We identified 10 items from the THI and TFI that exhibited limited loadings on secondary factors. The resulting Tinnitus Severity Short Form achieved good to excellent fit, including in a unique sample of individuals seeking online treatment for tinnitus, and appeared sensitive to treatment-related change. Conclusions The Tinnitus Severity Short Form developed in the current study may be a useful tool for the assessment of subjective severity and distress associated with tinnitus, especially when patient burden is a concern. Further research is necessary to fully validate the questionnaire for the assessment of treatment-related change.",

The participants were divided into two groups, Group A had 29 participants with no motion sickness, and Group B consisted of 29 individuals who had motion sickness. All the participants underwent HIMP and SHIMP testing. Results None of the participants had a presence of saccades in the HIMP technique, and all the participants in both the groups had anticompensatory saccades in SHIMP technique. Also, there was no difference in VOR gain or VOR gain asymmetry between individuals with and without motion sickness using HIMP and SHIMP Techniques. Conclusions The results of the study show no differences in VOR gain between individuals with and without motion sickness. It has been reported that only low frequencies trigger the motion sickness.

Method The Hearing Education and Research (HEAR) presentation, which included activities and videos to educate a group of ethnically diverse adolescents ( n = 100) on NIHL, was created by 11 doctor of audiology (AuD) students through online collaborations toward course-related eSL requirements. Adolescents responded to a baseline survey to assess hearing health–related behaviors prior to reviewing the presentation. A postprogram survey was administered 1 week after the presentation to assess change in knowledge and attitudes toward NIHL prevention. Online collaborations with schoolteachers helped with project implementation. Postreflection papers written by AuD students regarding the eSL activities were analyzed. Lastly, suggestions from a focus group of educators were included that highlight the role of interprofessional collaborations to enhance school-based hearing conservation opportunities. Results The HEAR presentation resulted in changes in knowledge about NIHL among the adolescents. Postreflection papers by the AuD students indicated that the eSL activity served as a high-impact pedagogical assignment, especially during the academic challenges of the pandemic. Feedback from a focus group of schoolteachers helped outline ideas for future implementation of sustainable hearing conservation programs in school settings. Conclusion The pilot data collected in this study serve as a proof of concept for future hearing conservation projects in school-based settings via interprofessional collaborations and by engaging university students via eSL.",

Method Two arms of research, a survey of audiologists ( n = 110) and qualitative interviews with adult hearing aid users ( n = 13), were conducted. Surveys were distributed and collected both via paper and online methods. Descriptive analyses of survey results were conducted to report on common threads. Qualitative interviews were conducted with video recording for transcription purposes. These transcripts were then coded thematically to identify shared themes across participants. Results Results of this study highlight the variability in behavior between provider-recommended strategies (preemptive battery management) and the reactive/delay strategies that are implemented by users. Patient reports indicate several challenges related to changing their batteries including limited information on hearing aid batteries, physical/sensory challenges to the act, and the social impact of having to change hearing aid batteries. Concurrently, patients express a wide range of strategies to address other challenges including engaging in cost-conscious behaviors when managing batteries (both purchasing and deciding to replace) and maintaining a collection of easily accessible batteries for use. Conclusions Hearing aid batteries are a topic that reflect social and economic factors in a patient's life. While providers may report they cover these topics sufficiently, challenges related to batteries may need specific elucidation by the clinician to ensure adherence to recommendations and functioning devices.",

Untreated hearing loss has been associated with diminished interpersonal interactions; increased risk of depression (Armstrong et al., 2020), dementia, and cognitive decline (Dawes et al., 2015; Deal et al., 2017; Gurgel et al., 2014; Jayakody et al., 2018); and limited access to health care due to communication barriers (Chang et al., 2018). Two of the most prevalent preventable causes of hearing loss are exposure to high-intensity noise and ototoxins. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently reported that in the United States, at least 10 million adults under 70 years old (6%)—and possibly up to 40 million—exhibit noise-induced damage based on audiometric findings (CDC, 2017). Similar statistics do not exist for cases of ototoxicity, partly due to a lack of proactive hearing surveillance in clinics that prescribe highly ototoxic treatments (e.g., platinum-based chemotherapeutics or aminoglycosides) and in industrial or military occupational settings in which exposures to ototoxic chemicals are common (e.g., printing, construction, manufacturing, aircraft maintenance). However, we do know that 1.7 million Americans will be diagnosed with cancer this year and that ototoxic platinum-based chemotherapy is a mainstay of treatment for many solid tumor types (American Cancer Society, 2016). In addition, over 70,000 people worldwide (30,000 in the United States) have been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF), which is commonly treated with aminoglycoside antibiotics (e.g., tobramycin) to manage lifelong gram-negative bacterial infections (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, 2020). Over 1,000 new cases of CF are diagnosed per year, and life expectancy continues to improve, which will likely result in an increase of cumulative aminoglycoside dose exposure and ototoxicity risk (Garinis et al., 2017). Oncology and patients with CF, as well as other infectious disease populations, will continue to receive ototoxic treatments as a primary choice for therapeutic management, just as exposure to noise and ototoxins in the workplace will continue. Because both the risks and the consequences of noise- and ototoxin-induced auditory damage can be mitigated, these should be important priorities for audiological management. This special issue of the American Journal of Audiology arose out of the 9th Biennial National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research (NCRAR) [VA RR&D C2361-C] national conference in Portland, OR, supported by the National Institutes of Health [1 R13 DC018228-01]. The conference was titled, \"Ototoxicity and Noise Damage: Translating Preclinical Findings to Audiological Management,\" and took place in September 2019. The NCRAR conference brought together over 150 stakeholders, including clinicians, researchers, and students from five countries to comprehensively address pertinent problems related to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of auditory disorders due to ototoxicity and/or noise. Attendees spanned a variety of ethnic and racial groups, with over 56% reporting a VA or DoD affiliation. The objectives of this conference were to enhance knowledge of the mechanisms of auditory injury from ototoxins and noise overexposure and their relationships to theoretical models of tinnitus and hearing loss generation and to discuss how this knowledge can be translated into clinical practice. The overarching hypothesis of this conference was that clinicians and researchers will devise improved rehabilitative and pharmaceutical interventions if they can be shaped according to the specific auditory deficits, lesion sites, and individual patient priorities. Thus, a crucial aspect of the conference was to provide the patient's perspective by bringing in speakers who are themselves suffering from difficulties with speech perception and/or tinnitus secondary to noise or ototoxin exposure. This special issue consists of 10 manuscripts that highlight information presented at the conference, and cover three broad themes that parallel the conference themes. The first theme is \"Mechanisms.\" Peter S. Steyger's (2021) \"Mechanisms of Aminoglycoside- and Cisplatin-Induced Ototoxicity\" outlines multiple mechanisms of auditory damage resulting from treatment with aminoglycosides or cisplatin in a highly accessible and clinically pertinent manner. This article describes the trafficking routes of each drug, the resulting systematic damage of inner ear structures, and knowledge gaps that must be overcome to enable us to further refine ototoxicity management. Susan E. Griest-Hines, Naomi F. Bramhall, Kelly M. Reavis, Sarah M. Theodoroff, and James A. Henry (2021) provide insight into the types of noise exposure histories associated with auditory damage in their article, \"Development and Initial Validation of the Lifetime Exposure to Noise and Solvents Questionnaire in U.S. Service Members and Veterans.\" Use of this questionnaire will no doubt be crucial for standardizing data collected in studies aimed at identifying risk factors for hearing loss, tinnitus, or hyperacusis in relation to noise and solvent exposure. In addition, the combined impacts of noise exposure and ototoxic chemicals among military Service members are addressed by Thais C. Morata, Michelle Hungerford, and Dawn Konrad-Martin (2021) in \"Potential Risks to Hearing Functions of Service Members From Exposure to Jet Fuels.\" This article provides a brief synopsis of both hearing health policies and research related to noise-chemical interactions. The goal of this viewpoint is to assist audiologists in their decision making when providing care for populations who are routinely exposed to jet fuels. In \"Review: Neural Mechanisms of Tinnitus and Hyperacusis in Acute Drug-Induced Ototoxicity,\" Richard Salvi, Kelly Radziwon, Senthilvelan Manohar, Ben Auerbach, Dalian Ding, Xiaopeng Liu, Condon Lau, Yu-Chen Chen, and Guang-Di Chen (2021) build on these articles to describe changes to the central auditory system that occur following peripheral auditory damage and how these changes are associated with tinnitus and hyperacusis. This article lays the foundation for an understanding of how auditory damage can manifest in deficits that extend past the audiogram. The second theme is \"Clinical Presentation.\" Included in this theme are two articles addressing the clinical presentation of ototoxicity in patients with CF. In their article, \"Wideband Acoustic Reflex Growth in Adults with Cystic Fibrosis,\" Martha R. Westman, Daniel B. Putterman, Angela C. Garinis, Lisa L. Hunter, and M. Patrick Feeney (2021) describe how acoustic reflex growth functions differ in CF patients treated with aminoglycosides compared with controls. This work contributes to the growing body of literature regarding methods of separating out outer hair cell dysfunction and synaptic/neuronal damage in clinical patients. The article, \"Functional Impacts of Aminoglycoside Treatment on Speech Perception and Extended High-Frequency Hearing Loss in a Pediatric Cystic Fibrosis Cohort,\" written by Chelsea M. Blankenship, Lisa L. Hunter, M. Patrick Feeney, Madison Cox, Lindsey Bittinger, Angela C. Garinis, Li Lin, Gary McPhail, and John P. Clancy (2021), discusses metrics to determine the impacts of ototoxic treatments on speech perception. Speech perception difficulty is a key consequence of exposure to aminoglycoside medications and yet has rarely been characterized in the literature. This theme is further discussed an article about the clinical presentation of noise-induced auditory damage from Naomi F. Bramhall, Garnett P. McMillan, and Amy N. Mashburn (2021), \"Subclinical Auditory Dysfunction: Relationship Between Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions and the Audiogram,\" which uses statistical modeling to predict the audiogram from distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) in young Veterans with normal audiograms and demonstrates that discrepancies between DPOAEs and the audiogram may be related to cochlear synaptopathy. The last article for this theme is a viewpoint from Khaya D. Clark, Angela C. Garinis, and Dawn Konrad-Martin (2021), \"Incorporating Patient Narratives to Enhance Audiological Care and Clinical Research Outcomes,\" which highlights several patients' perspectives on participating in their own clinical care decisions. This article argues for engagement of patients as key stakeholders in their experience of care processes for both clinical quality improvement projects and translational research. The third theme is \"Future Directions.\" In \"Clinical Considerations for Routine Auditory and Vestibular Monitoring in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis,\" Angela C. Garinis, Gayla L. Poling, and Carmen C. Brewer, et al. (2021), along with numerous members of the International Ototoxicity Management Working Group (IOMG; see publication for complete author list), discuss optimal audiological monitoring strategies for patients receiving ototoxic therapies (e.g., those with CF). This is the first of several anticipated reports from the IOMG aimed at providing recommendations on how to implement an ototoxicity management program that addresses the needs of patients receiving specific ototoxic therapies and of the medical specialists that prescribe them. This theme is also discussed in Dawn Konrad-Martin, Keri O'Connell Bennett, Angela Garinis, and Garnett P. McMillan's (2021) article, titled, \"A Randomized Controlled Trial Using Automated Technology for Improving Ototoxicity Monitoring in VA Oncology Patients.\" This article shows that a dedicated hearing surveillance program that uses the Oto-ID audiometer's automated mode improves adherence to ototoxicity monitoring protocols over a traditional service delivery model. The results demonstrate the need to consider accessibility when designing an ototoxicity management program for this population and highlight the interest cancer patients have in obtaining aural rehabilitation services. We are enthusiastic to present this special issue to the American Journal of Audiology readership and thank the numerous individuals who contributed to the conference and these publications. We hope this information will lead to improved clinical care in patients exposed to ototoxins and/or noise, as well as greater understanding of the associated underlying mechanisms. Cutting-edge research in these areas continues to develop, with a focus on patient-centered care and quality of life considerations. Thank you to the American Journal of Audiology and the audiology and hearing science community for your support.

Five participants took part in studies in both settings. Precalibrated equipment was delivered to participants who performed headphone output level checks and measured ambient noise levels. After a practice run, CLS measurements were collected for two runs at 1 and 4 kHz.Mean headphone output levels were within 1.5 dB of the target calibration level. Mean ambient noise levels were below the target level. Within-run variability was similar between the two settings, but across-run bias was smaller for data collected in the laboratory setting compared with the remote setting. Systematic differences in CLS functions were not observed for the five individuals who participated in both settings.This study demonstrated that precise stimulus levels can be delivered and background noise levels can be controlled in a home environment. Across-run bias for remote CLS was larger than for in-laboratory CLS, indicating that further work is needed to improve the reliability of CLS data collected in remote settings.

    "abstract": "Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) has been found in rural children, potentially due to occupational and recreational noise exposure without consistent use of hearing protection devices (HPDs). However, questions remain regarding the specifics of rural adolescents' noise exposure and use of hearing protection around different types of noise. As such, the purpose of the current study was to provide preliminary results on rural adolescents' noise exposure and use of hearing protection for gunfire, heavy machinery, power tools, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), and music.A questionnaire was administered to 197 students (seventh to 12th grade) from rural schools in West Texas. Questions were related to noise exposure and use of HPDs for specific categories of noise. Testing was performed at the schools, with an investigator recording each student's responses.Approximately 18%-44% of adolescents reported exposure 12 or more times a year to gunfire, heavy machinery, power tools, and ATVs. Only 1%-18% of the adolescents reported never being exposed to such noise sources. Almost half of rural adolescents never used hearing protection around gunfire, and 77%-91% reported never wearing hearing protection when exposed to heavy machinery, power tools, and ATVs.The current study revealed that rural adolescents are exposed to noise sources that could damage their hearing. However, the majority of rural adolescents do not consistently wear hearing protection. Additional research is now needed to extend these findings by assessing rural adolescents' duration of exposure to different noise sources, in addition to investigating prevention of NIHL in this population.

    "abstract": "In this work, we have determined the long-term average speech spectra (LTASS) and dynamic ranges (DR) of 17 Indian languages. This work is important because LTASS and DR are language-dependent functions used to fit hearing aids, calculate the Speech Intelligibility Index, and recognize speech automatically. Currently, LTASS and DR functions for English are used to fit hearing aids in India. Our work may help improve the performance of hearing aids in the Indian context.Speech samples from native talkers were used as stimuli in this study. Each speech sample was initially cleaned for extraneous sounds and excessively long pauses. Next, LTASS and DR functions for each language were calculated for different frequency bands. Similar analysis was also performed for English for reference purposes. Two-way analysis of variance was also conducted to understand the effects of important parameters on LTASS and DR. Finally, a one-sample t test was conducted to assess the significance of important statistical attributes of our data.We showed that LTASS and DR for Indian languages are 5-10 dB and 11 dB less than those for English. These differences may be due to lesser use rate of high-frequency dominant phonemes and preponderance of vowel-ending words in Indian languages. We also showed that LTASS and DR do not differ significantly across Indian languages. Hence, we propose a common LTASS and DR for Indian languages.We showed that differences in LTASS and DR for Indian languages vis-à-vis English are large and significant. Such differences may be attributed to phonetic and linguistic characteristics of Indian languages.",

Two months later, potential participants were sent all three paper-based self-report surveys, irrespective of whether they had attended or not attended an HAR appointment.(a) There was no significant difference in gender or source of funding for hearing services between HAR appointment attendees and nonattendees. HAR nonattendees lived a greater distance from their clinic and were younger than attendees. (b) Survey completion did not influence HAR appointment attendance rates. (c) A significant reduction in individuals' self-reported hearing aid problems was recorded following the attendance at the HAR appointment. No significant changes in hearing aid management skills or overall hearing aid outcomes were detected.Long travel distances may be a barrier to attendance at review appointments. HAR appointments appear to be effective in improving hearing aid problems.",

Multiple linear regression was used to explore these relationships for 215 male Veterans whose records were available from 2009 to 2020. To be analyzed, Veterans must have possessed their hearing aid(s) for at least 3 consecutive months.An active problem of subjective tinnitus was associated with increased hearing aid wear time (positive association) and one or more active neurologic conditions were associated with decreased hearing aid wear time (negative association). A high unaided speech intelligibility index (greater access to speech sounds without hearing aids) was also associated with decreased hearing aid wear time (negative association).There are many complex audiologic and medical concerns that may affect hearing aid wear time in U.S. Military Veterans. Therefore, the information from this study should be expanded on prospectively by further exploring these associations, and their severity, on hearing aid wear time. The information from this and future studies may lead to clinical recommendations with the goal of increasing daily hearing aid use in this and other populations.",

In this study, we determined MCILs and examined the correspondence of MCILs to true hearing thresholds to quantify the accuracy of this procedure.Sixteen adults with normal hearing participated. Subjects were asked to feign a unilateral hearing loss at 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 kHz. MCILs were determined. Subjects also made lateralization judgments for simultaneously presented tones with varying interaural intensity differences.The 90% confidence intervals, calculated for the distributions, indicate that the MCIL in 90% of cases would be expected to be very close to threshold to approximately 17-19 dB poorer than the true hearing threshold. How close the MCIL is to true threshold appears to be based on the individual's response criterion.Response bias influences the MCIL and how close an MCIL is to true hearing threshold. The clinician can never know a client's response bias and therefore should use a 90% confidence interval to predict the range for the expected true threshold. On the basis of this approach, a clinician may assume that true threshold is at or as much as 19 dB better than MCIL.",

The primary goal of this study was to determine the extent to which this type of device can yield benefit when users are listening in a range of acoustic conditions, rather than to compare benefit among devices. Method: Participants ( M age = 58 years, n = 40) completed a speech perception task with and without one of four direct-to-consumer devices. Stimuli were presented with three types of maskers (steady-state noise, modulated noise, and competing talkers) at two different signal-to-noise ratios and two target levels. Participants also rated the effort required to complete the task with and without the devices and completed a short questionnaire about device comfort and perceived effectiveness. Results: The amount of objective benefit (in terms of speech recognition accuracy) varied among the four products, with two of the four devices yielding statistically significant benefit with medium-to-large effect sizes. Reduction in self-rated listening effort was noted from the use of all four devices, with a moderate effect size. Degree of hearing loss (4-frequency pure-tone average) was not significantly associated with the amount of either subjective or objective benefit. Responses to the posttask questionnaire indicated that many of the participants would be willing to use these or similar devices in the “real world.” Conclusions: Our findings support the concept that direct-to-consumer hearing devices have the potential to improve objective and/or subjective speech recognition in middle-aged adults, at least when fit to prescriptive targets. Benefit from these devices was not related to degree of hearing loss in this sample of participants.",

A deductive directed content analysis approach was applied to assess respondents' perspectives. A total of 106 participants (37 hard of hearing adults and 69 audiologists) were involved across the multiple phases of this study.Referral practices for the evaluation of cochlear implantation candidacy in Australia are highly inconsistent, supporting the need to streamline referral information. The following facilitators were identified to support the development of referral material: appropriate content, perceived patient benefit, and objectivity. Areas for improvement related to the broadness of the content, impact on professional identity, and accessibility.Practical insight from patients and referrers can inform the development of patient-facing material related to cochlear implant referrals. Streamlining information used in educational material could alleviate confusion inherent to varied health literacy levels and support patients in making informed decisions related to pursuing, or not, cochlear implantation candidacy evaluation services.",

Method: We held two online training workshops during which students reflected on their clinical communication experiences and asked questions related to clinical scenarios. Third-year audiology students from a South African university participated in the workshops (17 in the first, 15 in the second). We analyzed these reflections using thematic analysis. Results: Students' reflections related to four themes: (a) balancing information giving, (b) managing shared decision making, (c) managing linguistic differences, and (d) relating bad news. The first theme was heavily prioritized in students' reflections. Providing students with time to practice skills introduced in the initial communication skills workshop enabled further reflection in the subsequent workshop. We discuss these themes using specific examples raised by students. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that students first need to master basic information giving skills before they can move on to more advanced skills such as managing shared decision making, linguistic differences, and relating bad news. This study confirms that reflective skills need to be developed with students in an explicit manner, rather than as part of a hidden curriculum. Our approach to providing communication training and encouraging reflection on clinical experiences offers a starting point for clinical educators to support students in developing these skills.",

    "abstract": "In this exploratory, open-label study, we used behavioral and brain imaging measures to assess the effectiveness of a smartphone application (ReSound Relief app), which aims to help reduce tinnitus-related distress.Fourteen participants with a wide range of tinnitus-related symptoms and who were not currently undergoing any external treatment participated. They completed the 6-month study and reported different levels of engagement with the app.Across a range of tinnitus questionnaires, most participants showed either no change or decrease in tinnitus handicap. Resting-state and task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected at baseline and the end of the study. Resting-state fMRI of 12 participants revealed alterations in interregional connectivity of default mode, salience, emotion, auditory, and visual processing networks at the end of the intervention period compared to baseline. Ratings of affective sounds (as pleasant, neutral, or unpleasant) were assessed using fMRI, and comparison after 6 months of app usage revealed reduced activity in the left superior temporal gyrus (secondary auditory cortex), right superior occipital gyrus, and left posterior cingulate cortex. Our findings were not significant at a false discovery rate level of p < .05.The reported changes were not significant, possibly due to the small sample size, heterogeneity of the tinnitus handicap among subjects at the start of the project, and the length of the intervention period. Nevertheless, this study underscores the ease of usage of the app and the potential use of brain imaging to assess changes due to a passive, self-administered intervention for individuals with varying levels of tinnitus severity.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Human studies enrolling individuals at high risk for cochlear synaptopathy (CS) have reported difficulties in speech perception in adverse listening conditions. The aim of this study is to determine if these individuals show a degradation in the neural encoding of speech in quiet and in the presence of background noise as reflected in neural phase-locking to both envelope periodicity and temporal fine structure (TFS). To our knowledge, there are no published reports that have specifically examined the neural encoding of both envelope periodicity and TFS of speech stimuli (in quiet and in adverse listening conditions) among a sample with loud-sound exposure history who are at risk for CS. Method: Using scalp-recorded frequency-following response (FFR), the authors evaluated the neural encoding of envelope periodicity (FFR ENV ) and TFS (FFR TFS ) for a steady-state vowel (English back vowel /u/) in quiet and in the presence of speech-shaped noise presented at +5- and 0 dB SNR. Participants were young individuals with normal hearing who participated in the marching band for at least 5 years (high-risk group) and non–marching band group with low-noise exposure history (low-risk group). Results: The results showed no group differences in the neural encoding of either the FFR ENV or the first formant (F1) in the FFR TFS in quiet and in noise. Paradoxically, the high-risk group demonstrated enhanced representation of F2 harmonics across all stimulus conditions. Conclusions: These results appear to be in line with a music experience–dependent enhancement of F2 harmonics. However, due to sound overexposure in the high-risk group, the role of homeostatic central compensation cannot be ruled out. A larger scale data set with different noise exposure background, longitudinal measurements with an array of behavioral and electrophysiological tests is needed to disentangle the nature of the complex interaction between the effects of central compensatory gain and experience-dependent enhancement.",

    "abstract": "Adverse effects of noise exposure on hearing and cognition are well documented in the literature. Recently, it has becoming increasingly evident that noise exposure deteriorates suprathreshold auditory skills, even though the hearing sensitivity is intact. This condition is termed as cochlear synaptopathy or hidden hearing loss, which is apparent in animal models. However, equivocal findings are reported in humans. This study aimed at assessing the working memory, attention abilities, and suprathreshold hearing abilities in normal-hearing individuals with and without occupational noise exposure. We also explored the relationship between cognitive measures and suprathreshold auditory measures.The study participants were divided into two groups. All the participants had normal-hearing thresholds. The control group consisted of 25 individuals with no occupational noise exposure, whereas the noise exposure group had 25 individuals exposed to occupational noise of 85 dBA for a minimum period of 1 year. Working memory was assessed using auditory digit span (forward and backward), operation span, and reading span. The Erikson flanker test was used to evaluate attention abilities. The suprathreshold hearing was assessed in terms of gap detection thresholds and sentence identification in noise.The results showed that the noise exposure group performed poorly compared to the control group on all auditory and cognitive tasks except the reading span.The results of the study suggest that occupational noise exposure may hamper the cognitive skills and suprathreshold hearing abilities of the individual despite having normal peripheral hearing.",

However, for adults, many clinicians question whether it is necessary.Hearing aids were fit on two groups of 85 older adults seen at a Veterans Administration audiology clinic. One group was fit using RECD measurements, whereas the second group was fit with population-based average RECD values. The two groups had similar pure-tone hearing thresholds.Like previous studies, there was little difference between the measured RECD for the right and left ears among the participants. Although the majority of the measured RECDs were within 1 SD of the mean, approximately 20% of those measured were outside of the normal range. It also was found that all participants produced lower (improved) Hearing Handicap Inventory for Elderly-Screening (HHIE-S) scores from pre- to postfitting, thus suggesting a reduction in self-perceived hearing handicap.Despite having similar prefitting HHIE-S scores, those participants who had their hearing aids fit using measured RECD values had lower postfitting scores than the group that was fit with average RECD values. Furthermore, there was a significant difference between the groups on several questions of the International Outcome Inventory-Hearing Aids, suggesting that there was higher satisfaction with the fittings based on the custom RECD rather than the fittings based on the average RECD. This study demonstrated that, in addition to performing verification using real-ear measurements, accurate conversion of dB HL to dB SPL using personalized RECD likely improved hearing aid satisfaction.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the stability of rotary chair, video head impulse test (vHIT), and vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) responses in children with normal hearing (NH) and children with cochlear implants (CIs).Retrospective analysis of 66 children (33 males, Mage = 11.4 years, range: 3-18 years) seen in a tertiary clinic and/or research laboratory who completed rotary chair, VEMP, and vHIT across two test sessions between 2012 and 2019. The stability of these measures was compared between two groups: children with NH (n = 35) and children with CI (n = 31). For each outcome, the session difference was calculated by subtracting Session 1 from Session 2.For rotary chair (gain and phase) and vHIT (gain), linear mixed-effects models revealed that there were no significant interactions or main effects for group (CI vs. NH), time between session, gender, or age on the session difference, suggesting that the outcomes of these measures are stable across sessions. For cervical and ocular VEMP amplitude, there was a significant interaction between group and time between sessions on the session difference. Specifically, children with NH demonstrated larger amplitudes at Session 2, whereas children with CI demonstrated smaller amplitudes at Session 2. Next, test findings were classified as normal, unilaterally abnormal, or bilaterally abnormal for Sessions 1 and 2. Misclassification was defined as a mismatch of classification between sessions. Rotary chair and vHIT had the fewest misclassifications, whereas cervical VEMPs had the most misclassifications in children with CI and ocular VEMPs had the most misclassifications in children with NH. Misclassifications in children with CI were mostly consistent with progressive vestibular loss, whereas misclassifications in children with NH were mostly consistent with improved vestibular function.Stability and misclassification rates varied between tests and groups. Overall, rotary chair and vHIT outcomes were stable in both groups; however, VEMPs differentially changed between groups, improving in children with NH and declining in children with CI. Furthermore, despite relative stability, some children with CI evidenced progressive vestibular loss on all measures suggesting that vestibular testing should be completed serially due to the possibility of progression.",

Method: We performed a comprehensive and systematic literature search via PubMed, Web of Science, Clinical-Trials.gov, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Our goal was to identify prospective RCTs of tinnitus intervention conducted in the United States from January 1994 to September 2021 and published in peer-reviewed journals. Results: A total of 2,584 studies were retrieved. Thirty-two peer-reviewed articles met all inclusion criteria. Of the included studies, approximately 96% reported participants' gender. Approximately 15% studies reported race/ethnicity information in alignment with the U.S. Census Bureau. However, an underrepresentation of both females and people of color was evident across studies. Reporting of socioeconomic status information of participants was also scarce, with only 25% studies reporting education and/or occupation of participants and 0% reporting income levels. Conclusions: This study indicates underrepresentation and underreporting of diverse participant pools in tinnitus research. Reasons for such underrepresentation are explored. Additionally, this systematic review indicates that recent research in tinnitus portrays an optimistic trend in terms of reporting and recruitment of diverse participant groups. Sustainable strategies for including diverse research participants are essential for hearing health care equity. Research and strategies to promote this goal are discussed.",

Data from 69 patients with an average age of 37.9 years (SD = 11.2, range: 16.0-63.8 years) were included. Patients were assessed by primary health care audiologists (87%) or community health workers (13%) using portable audiological equipment. The average length of time between initial and exit assessments was 84.6 days (SD = 74.2, range: 2-335 days).EHF ototoxicity of a mild or greater degree of hearing loss (> 25 dB HL in one or both ears across frequencies) was evident in 85.5% of patients' posttreatment, compared with 47.8% of patients across conventional frequencies. EHF audiometry demonstrated an ototoxic shift (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association criteria) in 56.5% of cases compared with 31.9% when only conventional audiometry was considered. Mean hearing deterioration for patients was significant across EHFs (9-16 kHz) bilaterally (p < .05). Absent EHF thresholds at the initial assessment, owing to maximum output limits, was a limitation that occurred most frequently at 16 kHz (17.4%, 24/138).EHF audiometry is most sensitive for the early detection of ototoxicity and should be included in monitoring programs. Clinical ototoxicity monitoring protocols should consider shortened assessment approaches that target frequencies most sensitive to ototoxicity, including EHFs.https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.21651242.",

    "abstract": "Perceived sound quality was variously compared between either no aiding or aiding with three models of hearing aid that varied the microphone position around the pinna, depth of the receiver in the auditory meatus, degree of meatal occlusion, and processing sophistication. The hearing aids were modern designs and commercially available at the time of testing.Binaural recordings of multichannel spatially separated speech and music excerpts were made in a manikin, either open ear or aided. Recordings were presented offline over wide-bandwidth, high-quality insert earphones. Participants listened to pairs of the recordings and made preference ratings both by clarity and externality (a proxy for \"spaciousness\"). Two separate groups of adults were tested, 20 with audiometrically normal hearing (NH) and 20 with mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss (hearing impaired [HI]).For ratings of speech clarity, the NH group expressed no preference between the open ear and a deeply inserted occluding aid, both of which were preferred to a low-pass filtered output of the same aid. For the music signal, a small preference emerged for the open-ear recording over that of the aid. For the HI group, clarity of the deeply inserted aid was similar to in-the-ear and behind-the-ear devices for speech, but worse for music. Ratings of spaciousness produced no clear result in either group, which can be attributed to study limitations and/or participant factors.Based on clarity, a wide bandwidth, particularly to beyond 5 kHz generally and below 300 Hz for music, is desirable, independent of hearing aid design.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The minimum masking level (MML) is the minimum intensity of a stimulus required to just totally mask the tinnitus. Treatments aimed at reducing the tinnitus itself should attempt to measure the magnitude of the tinnitus. The objective of this study was to evaluate the reliability of the MML. Method Sample consisted of 59 tinnitus patients who reported stable tinnitus. We obtained MML measures on two visits, separated by about 2–3 weeks. We used two noise types: speech-shaped noise and high-frequency emphasis noise. We also investigated the relationship between the MML and tinnitus loudness estimates and the Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire (THQ). Results There were differences across the different noise types. The within-session standard deviation averaged across subjects varied between 1.3 and 1.8 dB. Across the two sessions, the Pearson correlation coefficients, range was r = .84. There was a weak relationship between the dB SL MML and loudness, and between the MML and the THQ. A moderate correlation ( r = .44) was found between the THQ and loudness estimates. Conclusions We conclude that the dB SL MML can be a reliable estimate of tinnitus magnitude, with expected standard deviations in trained subjects of about 1.5 dB. It appears that the dB SL MML and loudness estimates are not closely related.",

Despite potential for middle ear sound transmission characteristics to affect this separation, no primary tone level optimization formula accounts for its influence. This study was conducted to determine if inclusion of ear- and frequency-specific immittance features improves primary tone level optimization formula performance beyond that achieved using a univariate, L2-based formula.For 30 adults with normal hearing, DPOAE, wideband absorbance, and 226-Hz tympanometry measures were completed. A mixed linear modeling technique, incorporating both primary tone and acoustic immittance features, was used to generate a multivariable formula for the middle ear-specific recommendation of primary tone level separations for f2 = 1-6 kHz. The accuracy with which L1OPT, or the L1 observed to maximize DPOAE level for each given L2, could be predicted using the multivariable formula was then compared with that of a traditional, L2-based univariate formula for each individual ear.Use of the multivariable formula L1 = 0.47L2 + 2.40A + f2param + 38 [dB SPL] resulted in significantly more accurate L1OPT predictions than did the univariate formula L1 = 0.49L2 + 41 [dB SPL]. Although average improvement was small, meaningful improvements were identified within individual ears, especially for f2 = 1 and 6 kHz.Incorporation of a wideband absorbance measure into a primary tone level optimization formula resulted in a minor average improvement in L1OPT prediction accuracy when compared with a traditional univariate optimization formula. Further research is needed to identify characteristics of ears that might disproportionately benefit from the additional measure.",

Method A standard group comparison research design was adopted in this study. Participants were assigned to 2 groups. Group I consisted of 13 participants with mild–moderate flat or sloping SNHI, while Group II consisted of 13 participants with NH sensitivity. Electroencephalographic data using virtual acoustic stimuli (spatially loaded stimuli played in center, right, and left hemifields) were recorded from 64 electrode sites in passive oddball paradigm. Both local (electrode-wise waveform analysis) and global (dissimilarity index, electric field strength, and topographic pattern analyses) measures were performed on the electroencephalographic data. Results Results of local waveform analyses marked the appearance of mismatch negativity in an earlier time window, relative to those reported conventionally in both the groups. The global measures of electric field strength and topographic modulations (dissimilarity index) revealed differences between the 2 groups in different time periods, indicating multiphases (integration and consolidation) of spatial processing. Further, the topographic pattern analysis showed the emergence of different scalp maps for SNHI and NH in the time window corresponding to mismatch negativity (78–150 ms), suggestive of differential spatial processing between the groups at the cortical level. Conclusions The findings of this study highlights the differential allotment of neural generators, denoting variations in spatial processing between SNHI and NH individuals.",

    "abstract": "Purpose This article combines the results of 3 studies that were presented at the HeAL 2018 Conference in Lake Como, Italy, in June 2018. Each study involved electrocochleography (ECochG), a neurodiagnostic evaluation that has been used clinically for over 80 years but whose applications continue to expand. The 1st study describes recent research wherein ECochG was recorded from asymptomatic subjects who were siblings or offspring of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Ménière's disease (MD). Our results provide evidence that ECochG may be helpful in not only diagnosing MD but also predicting it as well. Second, case studies are described where ECochG was important in both diagnosing superior semicircular canal dehiscence and monitoring the repair of this condition during surgery. Finally, although ECochG has been practiced clinically for over 8 decades, the protocols for recording, measuring, and interpreting the electrocochleogram continue to lack standardization among clinicians and scientists. We thus present normative data for some of these features based on noninvasive recordings made from the tympanic membrane from 100 normal hearing subjects. Conclusions Although the primary use of ECochG continues to be in the diagnosis of MD, we report on 2 additional clinical applications for this important test of inner ear/auditory nerve function. First, a preliminary study on a small sample of subjects indicates that ECochG may also be useful in predicting MD prior to the onset of symptoms in individuals who may be genetically predisposed to developing it. Second, through a series of case studies, we demonstrate how ECochG is used to help diagnose superior semicircular canal dehiscence and monitor the status of the inner ear during the surgical repair of this condition. Finally, normative values for clinically important components of the electrocochleogram based on tympanic membrane recordings have been established from a large sample of subjects.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Music is an important part of life for many people. Furthermore, music training has been shown to improve a variety of cognitive functions among children and adults. However, little research exists on how children who are hard of hearing (HH) perceive or participate in music. In particular, it is unknown whether hearing loss limits participation in music activities among school-aged children with mild-to-severe hearing loss. The purpose of this study was to determine whether hearing loss limits participation among children who are HH compared to children with normal hearing (NH). Method Participants were parents of 2 cohorts of children finishing 5th grade (approximately 11 years old). Parents were asked to complete a survey (online or paper) regarding the role of music in their child's life. A total of 88 surveys were completed (67 from parents of children who are HH and 21 from parents of children with NH, with an overall response rate of 74%). Results Hearing loss did not limit music participation among children. Children who are HH listened to recorded music, attended live concerts, and practiced an instrument at the same rates as children with NH. Listening to recorded and live music, practicing an instrument, and playing in an ensemble were equally as important to children who are HH as children with NH. Children who are HH were significantly more likely to regularly play in an ensemble than children with NH. Parent participation in music significantly influenced music participation for children who are HH but not children with NH. Descriptive data about music genres, instruments, and ensembles are also presented. Conclusions Children who are HH participate in music at the same or greater rates as children with NH. Parent participation in music may be particularly important for children who are HH. In light of this, music listening should be a consideration when fitting children with hearing aids.",

Method PEMs on ARHL were identified through a computerized search of EHR databases and CSD organization websites. Selected PEMs were assessed using three readability indices as well as the Suitability Assessment of Materials (SAM; Doak et al., 1996), which is a standardized tool to assess the content and design of written educational materials. Ten PEMs from EHR databases and 17 PEMs from CSD organizations were analyzed. Results Overall, 66.7% of PEMs were written above the eighth-grade readability target. PEMs from CSD organizations were significantly more difficult to read compared to those from EHR databases. In total, 85.2% of PEMs were classified as “adequate” using the SAM analysis. No significant SAM score differences were found between PEMs from CSD organizations and those from EHR databases. Common areas of weakness among PEMs were (a) failure to include a summary of key information, (b) reading level, (c) vocabulary (too advanced for the intended audience), and (d) limited subdivision of complex topics. Conclusions The readability and suitability of PEMs on topics of ARHL supplied by EHR providers and CSD organizations are not supportive of the health literacy skills of the average U.S. adult. It is critical to improve the readability, suitability, and comprehensibility of PEMs on ARHL to make information about hearing health care more accessible and usable.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Motion sickness (MS) is a common condition that affects millions of individuals. Although the condition is common and can be debilitating, little research has focused on the vestibular function associated with susceptibility to MS. One causal theory of MS is an asymmetry of vestibular function within or between ears. The purposes of this study, therefore, were (a) to determine if the vestibular system (oculomotor and caloric tests) in videonystagmography (VNG) is associated with susceptibility to MS and (b) to determine if these tests support the theory of an asymmetry between ears associated with MS susceptibility. Method VNG was used to measure oculomotor and caloric responses. Fifty young adults were recruited; 50 completed the oculomotor tests, and 31 completed the four caloric irrigations. MS susceptibility was evaluated with the Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire–Short Form; in this study, percent susceptibility ranged from 0% to 100% in the participants. Participants were divided into three susceptibility groups (Low, Mid, and High). Repeated-measures analyses of variance and pairwise comparisons determined significance among the groups on the VNG test results. Results Oculomotor test results revealed no significant differences among the MS susceptibility groups. Caloric stimuli elicited responses that were correlated positively with susceptibility to MS. Slow-phase velocity was slowest in the Low MS group compared to the Mid and High groups. There was no significant asymmetry between ears in any of the groups. Conclusions MS susceptibility was significantly and positively correlated with caloric slow-phase velocity. Although asymmetries between ears are purported to be associated with MS, asymmetries were not evident. Susceptibility to MS may contribute to interindividual variability of caloric responses within the normal range.",

Method Fifty-two adults (104 ears), with a mean age of 32 years (SD = 12.39, range: 18-60 years) were included in this study. A within-subject repeated-measures design was used to compare tympanometric measurements yielded with the investigational device in unilateral and bilateral simultaneous conditions compared with an industry-standard tympanometer. Results No significant bias (p > .05) was found between the mean of the differences of tympanometric measurements yielded by the two devices, except for a significant bias (p < .05) of the mean of the differences for ear canal volume measurements (0.05 cm3). The Bland-Altman plots showed overall good agreement between the tympanometric measurements between the two instruments. In all 104 ears, the tympanogram types of the KUDUwave TMP were compared with the reference device. The results were highly comparable with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% (95% CI [86.8%, 100%]) and 92.3% (95% CI [84.0%, 97.1%]), respectively. Conclusions The investigational device is a suitable instrument for unilateral or bilateral simultaneous tympanometric measurements in adults and demonstrates the potential of decentralized and accessible tympanometry services.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The study investigated whether the auditory brainstem response (ABR) at a baseline and at higher repetition rates can detect if neurodegeneration has occurred in adults living with HIV who present with normal behavioral pure-tone thresholds. Method An exploratory research design was used. Forty adults with HIV (80 ears, 57.5% female; Mage = 26.3 years, SD = 3.68) and 20 adults without HIV participated. Phase 1 compared ABR absolute and interwave latencies at a baseline rate. Phase 2 examined the effect of HIV status and category of immunodeficiency on ABR absolute Wave V latency and Wave V latency shift at increased stimulus rates. Analysis included a two-way analysis of variance of the interaction between stimulus rate and HIV status and between CD4+ category and rate, and multiple regression analysis. Results In adults living with HIV, the baseline ABR yielded prolonged Wave III and V absolute latencies and interpeak prolongations in 22.5%. Interaural Wave V latency differences were present in 15% of participants. An additional 15% of ears presented with abnormal Wave V at increased rates. No significant interaction between HIV status and rate in either ear or between CD4+ category and rate was found in either ear (p > .05). Although rate and gender contributed significantly to the prediction of Wave V latency of the rate study (left and right, p < .001), HIV status did not (left and right, p > .05). Conclusions Although the interaction of HIV status and CD4+ with rate was not significant, more ears were identified with abnormal results at increased stimulus rates than with the baseline ABR alone. The ABR at increased rates may therefore be a valuable addition for the identification of individuals living with HIV with auditory neural deficiencies.",

    "abstract": "During routine clinical speech assessment, if the person being tested were to write down what he or she heard, it would not always match what the audiologist heard while scoring the listener's vocal responses (Nelson & Chaiklin, 1970). This study demonstrated a method to assess examiner accuracy and whether speechreading cues reduce writedown-talkback errors.Examiners were divided into 3 categories: normal hearing native speakers of English, normal hearing nonnative speakers of English, and native speakers with hearing loss. Each examiner assessed 4 normal-hearing listeners. Two NU-6 lists were presented to each listener; one was scored without visual cues and one with visual cues. Lists were presented at 50 dB HL in the presence of speech noise at 0 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).Results analyzed by percentage of correct phonemes and words revealed fewer writedown-talkback discrepancies for all 3 examiner groups when visual cues were added, with a substantial improvement for examiners with hearing loss.The finding of errors between talkback versus writedown scoring of lists for all of the examiners, even with visual cues, suggests a need for modification of the clinical word-recognition procedure for applications that potentially affect diagnosis, rehabilitation choices, or financial compensation.",

Effects of the test dialect and listeners' first language on psychometric variables (i.e., slope and 50%-correct threshold) were analyzed.Thirty-two normal-hearing Wu-speaking adults who used Mandarin since early childhood were compared to 16 native Mandarin-speaking adults. Both Beijing and Taiwan bisyllabic word recognition tests were presented at 8 signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in 4-dB steps (-12 dB to +16 dB). At each SNR, a half list (25 words) was presented in speech-spectrum noise to listeners' right ear. The order of the test, SNR, and half list was randomized across listeners. Listeners responded orally and in writing.Overall, the Wu-speaking listeners performed comparably to the Mandarin-speaking listeners on both tests. Compared to the Taiwan test, the Beijing test yielded a significantly lower threshold for both the Mandarin- and Wu-speaking listeners, as well as a significantly steeper slope for the Wu-speaking listeners.Both Mandarin tests can be used to evaluate Wu-speaking listeners. Of the 2, the Taiwan Mandarin test results in more comparable functions across listener groups. Differences in the performance-intensity function between listener groups and between tests indicate a first language and dialectal effect, respectively.",

Compiled data were analyzed for similarities and differences between state regulations and legislature.All states require audiologists to hold licensure; however, many differences exist between the requirements of acquiring and maintaining the license. Some states regulate the identification and management of children with hearing loss, whereas others do not. Additionally, states differ in their regulation of services provided to children with hearing loss, who can provide these services, and what is covered by insurance.It is critical for audiologists to understand the requirements of their state in the provision of audiology services.

Method Participants completed the HHI at their hearing aid evaluation and again at their hearing aid follow-up visit. At follow-up, half received a clean HHI form (blind administration), whereas the remainder responded on their original form (informed administration) and could thus base their follow-up responses on those they gave at the hearing aid evaluation. Results The data show that for the population examined here, informed administration of the follow-up HHI did not yield a different outcome to blind administration of the follow-up HHI. This was not influenced by past hearing aid use, age of the participant, or the duration of time between baseline questionnaire completion and follow-up completion. Conclusion These data suggest that completion of follow-up questionnaires in either informed or blind format will have little impact on HHI responses, most likely because of the many other factors that combined to influence hearing aid outcome.",

The present study used Boothroyd and Nittrouer's (1988)j factor to tease apart these two components of word recognition.Participants included 15 native English and 29 native Russian listeners. Fourteen and 15 of the Russian listeners reported English (ED) and Russian (RD) to be their dominant language, respectively. Listeners were presented 119 consonant-vowel-consonant real and nonsense words in speech-spectrum noise at +6 dB SNR. Responses were scored for word and phoneme recognition, the logarithmic quotient of which yielded j.Word and phoneme recognition was comparable between native and ED listeners but poorer in RD listeners. Analysis of j indicated less effective use of lexical information in RD than in native and ED listeners. Lexical processing was strongly correlated with the length of residence in the United States.Language background is important for nonnative word recognition. Lexical skills can be regarded as nativelike in ED nonnative listeners. Compromised word recognition in ED listeners is unlikely a result of poor lexical processing. Performance should be interpreted with caution for listeners dominant in their first language, whose word recognition is affected by both lexical and acoustic-phonetic factors.",

Method Adult audiology interventions relevant to this review were identified through a literature search in Google Scholar and a hand search of key journals. Four key interactive design features that have been proposed to mediate the effects of Internet-based health interventions were reported for each intervention: social context and support, contacts with the intervention, tailoring, and self-management. Results Five interventions were identified as representative examples of work in the field. Social context and support and contacts with the intervention were provided in most interventions, mainly through clinician guidance. Only 1 intervention utilized tailoring to personalize intervention content to individual users, but use was minimal. Self-management features were also used in all interventions but the precise nature of these features was poorly reported. Conclusion Future studies should assess the optimal dose and combinations of intervention features for maximizing efficacy in audiology intervention. To be specific, the role of tailoring should be explored, which has been identified as a potential mediator of intervention outcome in the wider e-health literature.",

    "abstract": "Eight years of experience with the Communication Strategies Program have provided evidence that participation in a program of this type can lead to marked improvement in children's abilities to cope with communication breakdown. However, it is clear that children can not be expected to master every aspect of the program in 6 weeks. Most move through the program, learning the basic components during one summer, and then return in subsequent summers to expand their understanding of these concepts and/or to refine their application of the techniques they have been taught. Many children need work on specific vocabulary or syntax skills before they can tackle some of the issues related to causes of communication breakdown (e.g., unclear pronoun referents) or feelings encountered when communication breakdown occurs (e.g., frustration, confusion).This description of the program has focused on communication between a child who signs and children and adults who do not. However, the children were taught to use the same approach with individuals who do sign or can understand their speech. Marked improvement was seen in interactions among the children, between the children and the clinicians, and between the children and the dorm staff. Parent reports also indicate that benefits cut across many types of interactions. One mother told a local reporter that, \"Jaclyn learned that there was a way to make herself understood- whether by sign, gestures, drawing, mimicking or pointing-and not to let anyone tell her anything different... . After the first summer in the University program, Jaclyn was much more sure of herself. She was willing to tackle anything\" (Brown, 1989, p. 3).This program can be readily adapted to a variety of clinical and educational settings. The basic format can be varied to meet the needs of children of different ages, or with different degrees of hearing loss, cognitive abilities, or speech and language skills. The program can also be adjusted to fit within the time frame of school or clinic calendars.Within the SRP setting, the program has served as the foundation for discussing behavior in emergency situations, use of TDDs, and foreign languages. Formal descriptions of these aspects of the project are under development. It is likely that clinicians who experiment with the program will find additional ways to broaden the program's scope.",

    "abstract": "The populations most susceptible to hearing loss and to aphasia overlap substantially, creating a high likelihood that audiologists will be called on to assess and treat individuals with aphasia. There is, however, scarce research available to guide best practices for serving this population.The available relevant literature is reviewed to summarize what is already known, providing basic information about aphasia and its potential impact on audiological diagnostic and intervention processes.Suggestions for managing aphasia in the clinical audiology setting are provided, and areas of needed research are identified so that services for individuals with aphasia can be optimized.",

Fifty subjects with hearing impairment were randomly assigned one of four circuit types whose marketing claims suggested resultant improvement in speech recognition in noise backgrounds. Although no apparent circuit superiority was shown, the subjects indicated a high level of satisfaction with the hearing aids chosen for them. Improved measuring tools, improved fitting strategies, and overall improved hearing-aid circuitry (though probably not the noise reduction feature) may explain this level of satisfaction.",

    "abstract": "Telephone communication remains a major obstacle for hearing-impaired listeners. Even with the use of amplification, many hearing aid (HA) users report significant difficulty understanding telephone conversations. Although much effort has recently been focused on determining ideal HA performance for typical communication settings, less has been directed toward preferred HA responses during telephone coupling conditions. If one assumes that telecoil coupling strategies may require different HA performance characteristics because of line noise, filtering effects, coupling method, and output limitations imposed by the telephone system and receiver, then further study of listeners' preferred HA response characteristics under telecoil coupling conditions appears warranted.This study evaluated the preferred real ear aided response (REAR) for a group of hearing-impaired listeners under acoustic and telecoil conditions when coupled to a standard telephone receiver. Findings revealed that subjects preferred substantially more low-frequency gain than would be predicted using three popular prescriptive formulae. In general, a gradually rising to flat response was preferred by most of the hearing-impaired listeners. Implications for HA fitting and management will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The Cochlear Implant Skills Review (CISR) was developed as a measure of cochlear implant (CI) users' skills and knowledge regarding device use. This study aimed to determine intra- and interrater reliability and agreement and establish construct validity for the CISR. Method In this study, the CISR was developed and administered to a cohort of 30 adult CI users. Participants included new CI users with less than 1 year of CI experience and experienced CI users with greater than 1 year of CI experience. The CISR administration required participants to demonstrate skills using the various features of their CI processors. Intra- and interrater reliability were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients, agreement was assessed using Cohen's kappa, and construct validity was assessed by relating CISR performance to duration of CI use. Results Overall reliability for the entire instrument was 92.7%. Inter- and intrarater agreement were generally substantial or higher. Duration of CI use was a significant predictor of CISR performance. Conclusions The CISR is a reliable and valid assessment measure of device skills and knowledge for adult CI users. Clinicians can use this tool to evaluate areas of needed instruction and counseling and to assess users' skills over time.",

    "abstract": "Introduction There is need for greater understanding of tests used in assessing all aspects of auditory processing disorder (APD). This is important so that specific deficits can be identified and later remediated with the smallest possible test battery. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) recommends five areas/domains for behavioral assessment: (a) temporal, (b) binaural (dichotic) separation/integration, (c) monaural low redundancy, (d) binaural interaction/localization/lateralization, and (e) auditory discrimination. Multiple-factor studies support the first three domains, which are most often used for APD assessment and which can be measured in a test battery normed within the United States (Multiple Auditory Processing Assessment–2 [MAPA-2]). This study was designed to determine if factored results from children would clarify whether a behavioral test (Listening in Spatialized Noise–Sentences Test [LiSN-S]) would factor within one of the first three domains or be separate, possibly within the fourth domain, binaural interaction. Method Fifty-one 8- and 9-year-olds with normal development and normal otoscopy and hearing responses bilaterally from 500 to 4000 Hz at 20 dB HL were recruited. Two sets of APD tests were administered: MAPA-2 and LiSN-S. Results Results verified the expected three-factor structure for MAPA-2. LiSN-S did not factor within one of those three, suggesting that some processes involved in the LiSN-S tasks require interactions between the two ears different from those involved in dichotic perception and thus better belong in the ASHA binaural interaction/lateralization domain. Conclusions Auditory processing abilities are sufficiently independent of each other that test batteries spanning the first three ASHA domains are not sensitive to at least some abilities in the fourth domain. This additional factor evidence is helpful. Future research should examine the utility of measuring additional factors within APD in order to achieve the most efficient and comprehensive test battery.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Bilingual children's linguistic experience can vary markedly from child to child. For appropriate audiological assessment and intervention, audiologists need accurate and efficient ways to describe and understand a bilingual child's dynamic linguistic experience. This report documents an approach for quantitatively capturing a child's language exposure and usage in a time-efficient manner. Method A well-known pediatric bilingual language survey was administered to 83 parents of bilingual children, obtaining information about the child's exposure to (input) and usage of (output) Spanish and English for seventeen 1-hr intervals during a typical weekday and weekend day. Results A factor analysis indicated that capturing linguistic exposure and usage over three grouped-time intervals during a typical weekday and weekend day accounted for ≥ 74% of the total variance of the linguistic information captured with the full-length survey. Conclusions Although further confirmation is required, these results suggest that collecting language exposure and usage data from parents of bilingual children for three grouped-time intervals provides similar information as a comprehensive hour-by-hour approach. A time-efficient method of capturing the dynamic bilingual linguistic experience of a child would benefit pediatric audiologists and speech-language pathologists alike.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of different types of tasking on the measurement of peak slow phase velocity (SPV) for caloric testing and rotary chair testing. Method This study evaluated the peak SPV response for caloric testing and rotary chair across five conditions. Three verbal, one tactile, and one condition without tasking were used for both caloric testing and rotary chair. The subjects consisted of 20 young adults (age range: 22–33 years, M = 26.65, SD = 3.72; seven male, 13 female) with normal vestibular function and no history of ear surgery or vestibular disorder. Study participation consisted of two visits with 24 hr minimum between each, one for caloric testing and one for rotary chair testing. The test completed at each visit was counterbalanced. Caloric Testing : The caloric irrigations were performed 5 times, with the ears randomized and tasking conditions randomized. Rotary Chair Testing : Rotary chair sinusoidal harmonic acceleration testing was performed 5 times at 0.08 Hz with the tasking conditions randomized. Results Tasking of any kind resulted in significantly larger peak SPV responses when compared to the no tasking condition for rotary chair testing. When comparing each type of tasking, no significant differences were noted. No significant difference was noted when comparing the conditions with tasking to the no tasking condition for caloric testing. Conclusions Clinically, either mental or tactile tasking can be utilized as a method to reduce VOR suppression during rotary chair testing. As no difference was found when comparing different verbal tasks to each other, the type of tasking can be catered to the patient. If verbal tasking cannot be completed, the braiding tactile task is a valid substitution. Caloric results varied widely across subjects and did not reach statistical significance, so conclusions on the need for tasking cannot be drawn.",

Interprofessional collaborators increasingly understand and value other professions. A.T. Still University provides students from multiple programs with opportunities to develop interprofessional collaboration skills. This research note presents details of one such interprofessional education (IPE) opportunity, a collaborative case. Audiology was part of this case in two ways: Audiologic details of the simulated patient were provided to all students, and audiology students participated in the experience. The results of this involvement are reported. This research note is primarily descriptive in nature; however, the question of whether students viewed their interprofessional competencies as improving following the IPE experience was explored using a validated self-report tool, the Interprofessional Collaborative Competency Attainment Survey (ICCAS).A total of 23 students completed the ICCAS. Additionally, student case presentations were reviewed and audiology-based recommendations were tallied.Highly significant differences (p ≤ .01) for all 20 items on the ICCAS were observed for differences in self-assessed interprofessional skills knowledge. All but one of the 12 teams made specific recommendations regarding the communication needs of the patient.Students viewed their own competencies related to interprofessional collaboration as improved following the collaborative case experience. Overall, the collaborative case experience was effective in providing students with the opportunity to develop a breadth of skills needed for interprofessional collaboration. Providing audiologic information in the case history prompted all but one team to consider patient communication needs.",

They were provided the first copy of the LSEQ in the clinic to take home to complete. Those participants who completed and returned the first copy of the questionnaire were then mailed a second copy of the LSEQ to complete and return approximately 2 weeks later. The mean subscale and total scale scores from the two administrations were compared using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) to determine test-retest reliability of the measure. The MDC scores, or the minimum difference between scores to demonstrate a real change in self-efficacy levels, were also calculated for each subscale and the total scale.The ICCs ranged from 0.786 to 0.920 for the subscale and total scale scores. The MDC scores for the subscale and total scale ranged from 14.3% to 19.1%.The results of this study indicate that the LSEQ has moderate to excellent test-retest reliability. The MDC scores demonstrate that the LSEQ has the potential to detect true changes in listening self-efficacy in older patients with hearing loss who use hearing aids. The LSEQ may aid clinicians in understanding listening self-efficacy in their patients and how their self-efficacy levels change with amplification.",

Method Eligible patients included those referred to the Duke University Medical Center otology clinic complaining of dizziness, with a head computed tomography scan and caloric stimulation results within normal ranges (inter-ear difference ≤ 10% or &lt; 25% unilateral weakness). Three-dimensional reconstructions of computed tomography scans in 11 patients were used to calculate the surface area and volume of lateral semicircular canals (LSCCs), mastoid airspaces, mastoid bones, and internal auditory canal diameter and circumference. Percent differences in interaural temporal bone anatomy (i.e., left-to-right asymmetry) were analyzed and correlated with warm caloric inter-ear difference (WCD) and clinically indicated caloric predictor asymmetry. Results A multivariate model predicting WCD from 9 interaural anatomic variables demonstrated a Pearson's coefficient of 0.999. A similarly constructed model of the clinically indicated caloric predictor demonstrated a Pearson's coefficient of 0.999. The univariate correlation was strongest for WCD versus Proctor internal auditory canal diameter ( r = 0.476; p = .139) and WCD versus lateral semicircular canal surface-area-to-volume ratio ( r = −0.474; p = .141). Conclusions This pilot study provides multivariate models that predict caloric asymmetry in subjects without vestibular pathologic findings per caloric testing, based on interaural differences across variables of the temporal bone anatomy.

    "abstract": "Hearing impairment is one of the most common chronic diseases causing deterioration of the quality of life in elderly individuals. Several viral infections have been suggested to cause hearing impairment. We investigated association of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with hearing impairment using a representative sample of the Korean population.Participants included 6,583 men and 8,702 women, who were ≥ 20 years of age from the Korea National Health and Nutritional Examination Surveys of the Korean population (2010-2012). Air-conduction pure-tone thresholds were measured in a soundproof booth using an automatic audiometer for each ear at 6 frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 6000 Hz). An audiometric test and a laboratory examination, including an HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) test, were performed.Subjects who are HBsAg positive had lower average of pure-tone thresholds and lower prevalence of hearing impairment at both low/mid and high frequency compared with those without. Adjusted means of hearing thresholds were also lower among subjects who are HBsAg positive compared with subjects who are HBsAg negative. After the adjustment for age and gender, the odds of high-frequency mild hearing impairment were lower for subjects with HBV infection. In the multiple logistic regression analyses adjusting for confounding variables, the significant negative association between HBV infection and high-frequency mild hearing impairment still remained.Contrary to previous reports, subjects who are HBsAg positive had a lower prevalence of hearing impairment compared with subjects who are HBsAg negative. Further studies are warranted to investigate the underlying mechanism regarding their negative relationship.",

    "abstract": "The author of this letter to the editor expresses concern about the use of the word \"nonorganic\" as a source of confusion in terminology. Specifically, this is in response to the December 2017 American Journal of Audiology article, \"Estimating Nonorganic Hearing Thresholds Using Binaural Auditory Stimuli\" (Norrix, Rubiano, & Mueller, 2017). \"Nonorganic\" is a source of confusion in terminology, because it can be used in two different ways. One way can mean to say there is no hearing loss. When used in this sense, it is illogical because it is qualifying a hearing loss believed not to exist. The second usage means there is a real disorder of function, but the organs themselves are not damaged and the basis is unknown. In the place of \"nonorganic,\" I have proposed \"false hearing loss.\" \"Nonorganic\" might carry a negative connotation that \"false\" might not. Many instances of false hearing loss stem from physical-mental health disturbances. Audiologists must stay alert to signs of psychosocial difficulty and refer for further evaluation accordingly.\"False\" hearing loss is a more appropriate term than \"nonorganic\" hearing loss.",

The AUC metric is believed to represent the total amount of neural energy contributing to the evoked response. This proposed method of measure, therefore, may provide an alternative method of quantifying the response. The subjects were divided into five age groups ( n = 10 for each group): infants, children, preteens, teens, and adults. Ipsilateral and contralateral recordings of the AMLR were obtained at two stimulus levels (70 and 40 dB nHL) and at two stimulus rates (11.3 and 3.3/s). AUC measures were obtained for each recording at 70 and 40 dB nHL and at 3.3 and 11.3 clicks/s. These area measurements were compared among the five age groups for significant differences due to age. According to the results, no significant differences in the AUC of the AMLR waveform existed as a function of age.",

    "abstract": "The family described in this article provides an unusual opportunity to relate findings from genetic, histological, electrophysiological, psychophysical, and rehabilitative investigation. Although the total number evaluated is large (49), the known, living affected population is smaller (14), and these are spread from age 20 to age 59. As a result, the findings described above are those of a large-scale case study. Clearly, more data will be available through longitudinal study of the individuals documented in the course of this investigation but, given the slow nature of the progression in this disease, such studies will be undertaken after an interval of several years. The general picture presented to the audiologist who must rehabilitate these cases is that of a progressive cochlear degeneration that affects only thresholds at first, and then rapidly diminishes speech intelligibility. The expected result is that, after normal language development, the patient may accept hearing aids well, encouraged by the support of the family. Performance and satisfaction with the hearing aids is good, until the onset of the speech intelligibility loss, at which time the patient will encounter serious difficulties and may reject hearing aids as unhelpful. As the histological and electrophysiological results indicate, however, the eighth nerve remains viable, especially in the younger affected members, and success with cochlear implantation may be expected. Audiologic counseling efforts are aided by the presence of role models and support from the other affected members of the family. Speech-language pathology services were not considered important by the members of this family since their speech production developed normally and has remained very good. Self-correction of speech was supported by hearing aids and cochlear implants (Case 5’s speech production was documented in Perkell, Lane, Svirsky, &amp; Webster, 1992). These patients received genetic counseling and, due to the high penetrance of the disease, exhibited serious concerns regarding future generations and the hope of a cure.",

Speech recognition, sound quality, and strength of preference for the SA settings and the original prescriptive (National Acoustic Laboratories-Nonlinear 2 [NAL-NL2]) settings were also compared. Method Participants included 12 musician ( M = 60 years) and 12 nonmusician ( M = 55 years) adult hearing aid users with mild-moderate hearing loss, on average. Self-adjustments were made to hearing aid gain and compression settings for 2 music stimuli and a speech stimulus. Speech recognition in quiet and noise, sound quality for 6 dimensions (clarity, pleasantness, naturalness, fullness, brightness, and overall impression), and strength of preference ratings using paired comparisons were then assessed at both the NAL-NL2 settings and the participants' SA settings. Results On average, self-adjustments made by both groups were quite small (< 5 dB for gain and < 0.5 for compression ratio). Furthermore, SA changes to gain and compression ratio were not significantly different for musicians versus nonmusicians or for music versus speech. Finally, speech perception performance and sound quality ratings did not differ for the SA settings versus the NAL-NL2 settings, with the exception of the naturalness sound quality dimension. Conclusions These data suggest that a gain-frequency response specific to musicians and/or music inputs may not be necessary. Thus, current, validated prescriptive methods continue to be well supported as an appropriate starting place for listeners with mild-moderate hearing loss using open hearing aid fittings.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Interfrequency amplitude ratio (IFAR), the ratio of amplitude between ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (oVEMPs) for tone bursts of 500 and 1000 Hz, aids in identification of Ménière's disease with high sensitivity and specificity. However, it requires recording of oVEMP for 2 frequencies, which doubles the time of recording. Use of simultaneous recording of responses for both frequencies could potentially bring down testing time. Simultaneous recording might be possible by modifying the oddball paradigm and using a ratio of 1:1 for the 2 frequencies. This might also reduce variation in oVEMP amplitude between frequencies due to changes in gaze angle between the recordings. However, it remains to be explored whether or not the use of modified oddball paradigm to record oVEMP (MoVEMP) will produce comparable responses to conventional sequential recording of oVEMP (CoVEMP) for obtaining IFAR. Hence, the study aimed to compare MoVEMP and CoVEMP on various measures of oVEMP. Method The study included 29 healthy adults in the age range of 18–30 years, 23 of which were used for validation and 6 for finding test–retest reliability. All participants underwent contralateral oVEMP recording using 500- and 1000-Hz tone bursts presented using MoVEMP and CoVEMP paradigms. Results Comparable outcomes on latencies, amplitude, and IFAR were obtained between CoVEMP and MoVEMP. Furthermore, MoVEMP took significantly lesser time per ear and also produced better test–retest reliability than CoVEMP. Conclusion MoVEMP is a quicker and more reliable clinical stimulation paradigm for obtaining IFAR than CoVEMP.",

Family involvement can help improve their outcomes. Purpose This study aimed to determine audiology adult patients hearing experiences and inquired about their perspectives on family involvement in appointments. Research Design A cross-sectional survey was completed. Descriptive statistics, item analyses, and quantitative analyses were used to examine patient's characteristics and perspectives. Study Sample Three hundred eighty-two adult audiology patients participated in the study. Data Collection and Analysis A 15-item survey was created with 4 sections, including patient demographic information, general hearing questions, hearing experiences, and family interactions and involvement. Descriptive statistics were used to examine patient's characteristics and perspectives on family involvement in audiology appointments. Chronbach's alpha was used to reveal good internal consistency of difficult feelings related to hearing and perceived negative family member reactions. Quantitative analyses were used to determine patient perspectives on family involvement. Results Though patients reported difficulties due to their hearing loss, more than half reported that they did not want family involvement or they were unsure of the benefit that the involvement would provide. Patients who were interested in having family involved reported benefits such as educational opportunities and support. Few barriers of family involvement were reported by patients. Conclusions Patients had a mixed desire about family involvement in their adult audiology appointments. Education of patients about the benefits of family involvement may need to happen for this shift in audiologic practice.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Despite the current legislative indications toward the digitization of patient health records, 80% of health data are unstructured and in a format that cannot be used in electronic archives or in registries of diseases. An innovative automated system is here proposed to efficiently retrieve and digitize clinical information from original unstructured ear, nose, and throat (ENT) medical records, in order to reduce the manual workload in the retrieval and digitization process. Method The system, based on an eHealth technology named cognitive computing, interprets medical reports to transform unstructured clinical data (e.g., narrative text) into a structured digital format. The system has been tailored to handle the reports of aged cochlear implant (CI) patients by digitizing the information typically requested in electronic CI registries and by the current ENT/audiology guidelines. Results were obtained from the reports generated by an outpatient ENT care service from 52 older adult CI patients. Results The system allowed a quick and automated interpretation and retrieval of all the information required, such as the patient's medical history, risk factors, examination outcomes, communicative performances before and after CI implantation, and CI settings. The accuracy of the system in correctly interpreting and retrieving the above information from the original unstructured medical reports was very good (recall = 0.78; precision = 0.95). The system allowed to reduce the time needed to manually digitize the information from 20-30 min/report to only 20 s/report. Conclusion The proposed system is a viable solution for the automated digitization of unstructured health data as recommended by the ENT/audiology clinical best practices.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) testing is often performed under general anesthesia for children unable to complete behavioral audiologic evaluation. Alternatively, acupuncture treatment may be considered appropriate for BAER. Reports of acupuncture treatment in pediatric patients are scarce but are needed to demonstrate effectiveness. This study had 2 main objectives: (a) to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of acupuncture to achieve sleep to perform diagnostic BAER testing in medically complex (Cohort I) and nonmedically complex (Cohort II) children and (b) to assess acceptability to parents and audiologists of acupuncture as an alternative to anesthesia for BAER testing. Method A prospective feasibility study at Seattle Children's Hospital Outpatient Audiology Clinic from August 2015 through December 2018 was performed. A total of 31 pediatric patients were included. The median age for Cohort I was 29 months (interquartile range: 19-37 months), and the median age for Cohort II was 25.5 months (interquartile range: 16-32 months). Variables included number of BAER thresholds obtained, sleep indicators, and acceptability. The cost of BAER with acupuncture and the cost of BAER under anesthesia were compared. Results Acupuncture treatment effectively contributed to an adequate sleep state to obtain BAER results for most patients in both cohorts. Across cohorts, most patients (81%) fell asleep after acupuncture treatment. Complete test results were obtained in 48% of patients. Audiologists and parents reported high satisfaction rates with this procedure (87%). There were no adverse safety effects. Acupuncture treatment was less costly than anesthesia for BAER testing. Conclusions Acupuncture to induce sleep for BAER testing is effective, safe, and cost-efficient in small samples of medically and nonmedically complex pediatric patients. This procedure allowed earlier detection of hearing status and avoided potential adverse effects of anesthesia. Audiologists and parents reported that acupuncture treatment was an acceptable alternative to anesthesia for the BAER procedure.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The bone-conduction device attached to a percutaneous screw (BCD) is an important treatment option for individuals with severe-to-profound unilateral hearing loss (UHL). Clinicians may use subjective questionnaires and speech-in-noise measures to evaluate BCD use in this patient population; however, the translation of these metrics to real-world aided performance is unclear. The purpose of this study was twofold: first, to measure speech-in-noise performance in BCD users with severe-to-profound UHL in a simulated real-world environment, relative to individuals with normal hearing bilaterally; second, to determine if BCD users' subjective reports of aided performance relate to simulated real-world performance. Method A between-subjects design with two groups was conducted with 14 adults with severe-to-profound UHL (BCD group) and 10 age-matched participants with normal hearing bilaterally (control group). Speech-in-noise tests were administered in an eight-speaker R-Space simulating a real-world environment. To further explore speech-in-noise evaluation methods for this population, testing was also completed in a clinically common two-speaker array. The effects of various microphone settings on performance were explored for BCD users. Subjective performance was measured with the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB; Cox &amp; Alexander, 1995) and the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale (Gatehouse &amp; Noble, 2004). Statistical analyses to explore relationships between variables included repeated-measures analysis of variance, regression analyses, independent-samples t tests, nonparametric Mann–Whitney tests, and correlations. Results In the simulated real-world environment, BCD group participants struggled with speech-in-noise understanding compared to control group participants. BCD benefit was observed for all microphone settings when speech stimuli were presented to the side with the BCD. When adaptive directional or fixed directional microphone settings were used, a relationship was noted between simulated real-world speech-in-noise performance for speech stimuli presented to the side with the BCD and subjective reports on the Background Noise subscale of the APHAB. Conclusions The Background Noise subscale of the APHAB may help estimate real-world speech-in-noise performance for BCD users with severe-to-profound UHL for signals of interest presented to the implanted side, specifically when adaptive or fixed directional microphone settings are used. This subscale may provide an efficient and accessible alternative to assessing real-world speech-in-noise performance in lieu of less clinically available measurement tools, such as an R-Space.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Cannabis is widely used for medicinal and recreational purposes. Studies have evaluated its health benefits and consequences, although there is limited work on its effects on the auditory system. In this exploratory study, we evaluate the effects of cannabis smoking on early auditory evoked potentials. Method We investigated auditory brainstem response (ABR) and electrocochleography waveforms in 18 cannabis smokers (44% women, 54% men; M age = 23.06 years, range: 21–28 years) and 19 nonsmoker controls (63% women, 37% men; M age = 23.74 years, range: 21–33 years). Threshold ABRs were recorded using rarefaction clicks at a rate of 17.7/s from 80 dB nHL to Wave V threshold. Resulting amplitudes and latencies for Waves I, III, and V were compared via independent-samples t tests. Electrocochleograms obtained with 90 dB nHL (7.1/s) alternating clicks were assessed for summating and compound action potentials, which were compared between groups using independent-samples t tests. Results ABR Wave I amplitudes were significantly lower in smokers ( M = 0.14 μV, SD = 0.11) compared to nonsmokers ( M = 0.21 μV, SD = 0.10, p = .039) at 80 dB nHL. Wave V latencies were significantly delayed in smokers at 80 dB nHL. Wave I and III latencies did not differ significantly between the two groups. Summating potential/compound action potential ratios were significantly elevated in smokers ( M = 0.30, SD = 0.04) versus nonsmokers ( M = 0.21, SD = 0.05, p = .042). Conclusion We identified significant differences in electrophysiological outcomes between cannabis smokers and nonsmokers. Cannabis smoking may have a subtle neurotoxic effect on the auditory system. Larger confirmatory studies are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Purpose To overcome methodology limitations for studying auditory development in young children, we have recently developed an observer-based procedure that uses a conditioned, play-based, motor response (see Bonino & Leibold, 2017). The purpose of this article was to examine interrater reliability for the method. Method Video recordings of test sessions of 2- to 4-year-old children (n = 17) were examined. Detection of a 1000-Hz warble tone was measured with the Play Observer-Based, Two-Interval (PlayO2I) method in each of two conditions: for a fixed intensity level (30 dB SPL) or for a variable intensity level signal (0-30 dB SPL). All test sessions were scored independently by three observers (one real-time, two offline). Observer consensus was evaluated with Fleiss' kappa statistic. To determine if summary data were similar across the observers of each test session, the proportion of correct trials (fixed-level condition) or threshold (variable-level condition) were computed. Results The strength of observer consensus was classified as \"almost perfect\" and \"substantial\" for the fixed-level and variable-level conditions, respectively. Follow-up analysis of the variable-level data indicated that differences in observer consensus were seen based on the signal level, the type of response behavior provided by the child, and the confidence level of the real-time observer. Resulting summary data were similar across the three observers of each test session: no significant differences for estimates of the proportion of correct trials or threshold. Conclusions Results from this study confirm strong interrater reliability for the method. The PlayO2I method is a powerful tool for measuring detection and discrimination abilities in young children.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to explore the utility of impairment(s) in language (LI), manual dexterity (IMD), and visual perceptual skills (IVPS) as a reference standard for diagnosing auditory processing disorder (APD).Data from 104 participants with suspected APD (males = 57, females = 47; 6-16 years) were retrospectively analyzed. Index auditory processing (AP) tests included Auditory Figure Ground 0 dB, Competing Words-Directed Ear (CW-DE), and Time-Compressed Sentences (TCS). General Communication Composite (GCC) of the Children's Communication Checklist-2, manual dexterity (MD) component of the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-Second Edition, and Test for Visual Perceptual Skills-Third Edition (TVPS-3) were used to identify LI, IMD, and IVPS, respectively.Eighty-one (77.8%), 58 (55.8%), and 37 (35.6%) participants had LI, IVPS, and IMD, respectively. Four factors explaining 67.69% of the variance were extracted. TVPS-3 (except visual closure [VClo]) represented the first; AFG 0, VClo, and MD the second; CW-DE and GCC the third; and TCS the fourth. APD diagnosed by combining AP tests and comorbidities had better accuracy compared to AP tests alone. The combined approach had overall diagnostic accuracy of 92.2%, 88.4%, and 81.7% for the 9th, 5th, and 2nd percentile AP test cutoffs, respectively.First-order AP tests in this study were related to language, MD, and visual perceptual skills. Given the overlap of LI, IMD, and IVPS with impaired AP, these comorbidities are an effective reference standard for APD. APD can be diagnosed following failing one AP test if one or more comorbidities exist. Ninth percentile AP test cutoff had better diagnostic accuracy compared to the currently used 2nd percentile cutoff.",

Three groups were formed to achieve this goal: two control groups (one using no collaboration and one using live, face-to-face collaboration) and one treatment group using virtual collaboration.A quasi-experimental design was conducted at two U.S. universities to examine whether there is a significant difference in clinical reasoning skills between three treatment groups using IUP Audiosim software. Two computer-based audiology case simulations were developed, and participants were randomly placed into the three groups. The clinical reasoning data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's post hoc analyses.The results indicated that there was a significant difference in clinical reasoning skills between the three treatment groups. The score obtained by the no-collaboration group was significantly less than the scores obtained by the virtual and live collaboration groups.The results imply that lower scores were associated with students receiving more instructor-designed content and higher scores with students receiving less instructor-designed content. Students who received more scaffolds with the collaborations may have demonstrated better decision-making outside the training exercise than those who did not receive scaffolds. However, lower scores on the exercise did not necessarily imply lower skill. Lower scores simply implied a different path toward mastery.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the localization ability of bilateral cochlear implant (BiCI) users for virtual sound sources produced over a limited loudspeaker arrangement.Ten BiCI users and 10 normal-hearing subjects participated in listening tests in which amplitude- and time-panned virtual sound sources were produced over a limited loudspeaker setup with varying azimuth angles. Three stimuli were utilized: speech, bandpassed pink noise between 20 Hz and 1 kHz, and bandpassed pink noise between 1 kHz and 8 kHz. The data were collected via a two-alternative forced-choice procedure and used to calculate the minimum audible angle (MAA) of each subject, which was subsequently compared to the results of previous studies in which real sound sources were employed.The median MAAs of the amplitude-panned speech, low-frequency pink noise, and high-frequency pink noise stimuli for the BiCI group were calculated to be 20°, 38°, and 12°, respectively. For the time-panned stimuli, the MAAs of the BiCI group for all three stimuli were calculated to be close to the upper limit of the listening test.The computed MAAs of the BiCI group for amplitude-panned speech were marginally larger than BiCI users' previously reported MAAs for real sound sources, whereas their computed MAAs for the time-panned stimuli were significantly larger. Subsequent statistical analysis indicated a statistically significant difference in the performances of the BiCI group in localizing the amplitude-panned sources and the time-panned sources. It follows that time-panning over limited loudspeaker arrangements may not be a useful clinical tool, whereas amplitude-panning utilizing such a setup may be further explored as such. Additionally, a comparison with the patient demographics indicated correlations between the results and the patients' age at time of diagnoses and the time passed between date of diagnosis and their implant surgeries.",

At Rush University's Student Community Outreach Program of Excellence (SCOPE), a pediatric hearing loss outreach program is under development to address and overcome those barriers through in-person hearing aid fittings and virtual follow-up appointments.The goal of this clinical focus article was to develop a proposed protocol for SCOPE's pediatric hearing loss outreach program that would detail the use of a bimodal model of service delivery for pediatric amplification services. This clinical focus article provides a general description of the proposed protocol.The proposed protocol was developed as a guideline for future service delivery within SCOPE's pediatric hearing loss outreach program. Categories and details within the protocol were derived from previously published protocols and clinically relevant research.The final protocol is composed of six sections, which detail the rationale and target population, necessary equipment, procedures for in-person hearing aid fittings, procedures for virtual follow-ups, outcome measures, and schedule of appointments.On the national level, access to audiological care for pediatric patients and their families is restricted by both financial and logistical barriers. A telehealth model of service delivery has been shown to be effective in providing high-quality patient care while addressing these barriers. A clinical program using a bimodal model of service delivery will be implemented to address these barriers in Chicago, Illinois. Future investigation is required to monitor the efficacy of the program and develop program-specific materials.",

    "abstract": "Cochlear implant (CI) recipients with normal or near normal hearing (NH) in the contralateral ear, referred to as single-sided deafness (SSD), experience significantly better speech recognition in noise with their CI than without it, although reported outcomes vary. One possible explanation for differences in outcomes across studies could be differences in the spatial configurations used to assess performance. This study compared speech recognition for different spatial configurations of the target and masker, with test materials used clinically.Sixteen CI users with SSD completed tasks of masked speech recognition presented in five spatial configurations. The target speech was presented from the front speaker (0° azimuth). The masker was located either 90° or 45° toward the CI-ear or NH-ear or colocated with the target. Materials were the AzBio sentences in a 10-talker masker and the Bamford-Kowal-Bench Speech-in-Noise test (BKB-SIN; four-talker masker). Spatial release from masking (SRM) was computed as the benefit associated with spatial separation relative to the colocated condition.Performance was significantly better when the masker was separated toward the CI-ear as compared to colocated. No benefit was observed for spatial separations toward the NH-ear. The magnitude of SRM for spatial separations toward the CI-ear was similar for 45° and 90° when tested with the AzBio sentences, but a larger benefit was observed for 90° as compared to 45° for the BKB-SIN.Masked speech recognition in CI users with SSD varies as a function of the spatial configuration of the target and masker. Results supported an expansion of the clinical test battery at the study site to assess binaural hearing abilities for CI candidates and recipients with SSD. The revised test battery presents the target from the front speaker and the masker colocated with the target, 90° toward the CI-ear, or 90° toward the NH-ear.",

Stimuli were spatialized low-context sentences mixed with six-talker babble at two realistic signal-to-noise ratios (3 and 8 dB) and processed through a hearing aid simulator. Preference for full factorial combinations of three common hearing aid processing features (two levels each) was elicited using a paired-comparison task. Participants completed two versions of the experiment: The lab version was completed in a sound-treated booth using a custom MATLAB application on a desktop computer; the remote version was completed in a quiet room in the participant's home, using a custom MATLAB executable application on a tablet. Both versions used the same calibrated headphones. Strict infection control protocols were followed.McNemar's test showed no association between preference and data collection method for the majority of the conditions. Percentage agreement and kappa scores were moderate/fair across most conditions. The results indicated that the remote versus lab versions did not have a systematic effect on preference. However, the relatively low agreement and kappa scores suggested within-subject variability in the outcome (preference).The tablet-based version of remote experimentation was comparable to the lab-based version for eliciting preference for hearing aid signal processing features.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of reported dizziness/imbalance, frequency of falls, and hearing loss in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) and determine the relationship of these self-reported problems both during and in the absence of an SCD crisis. Also, the impact of educational level and health insurance on seeking treatment services, as well as the relationship of falls to stroke, legal blindness, and other orthopedic problems, was assessed. Interrupted blood flow to shared vestibular and auditory arteries supports the notion of increased likelihood of balance deficits and increased falls in this population.A cross-sectional survey study design was used. Adults living with SCD responded to a questionnaire that was distributed online and through traditional mail.Adults living with SCD (N = 135) participated in the study.Responses revealed 70% of participants with SCD experienced dizziness/imbalance and 23% reported hearing loss. Furthermore, 33% of participants reported falling one or more times in the last year. The prevalence of dizziness/imbalance, falling, and hearing loss in the respondents with SCD was much higher than that of the general population of the United States. Additionally, for dizziness and falling, the prevalence was higher not only than the national average but also for persons over 65 years of age. A significant association was demonstrated between dizziness/imbalance and hearing loss as well as dizziness/imbalance and falls for adults living with SCD. In fact, participants with self-reported hearing loss were 5.2 times more likely to also report dizziness/imbalance. They were 4.9 times more likely to fall if they also reported dizziness/imbalance. Numbness of the feet was revealed to significantly impact the likelihood of falling in this disease population and should be further studied. Regarding SCD crisis status, dizziness/imbalance and falls were more likely to occur outside of SCD crisis than during a crisis. Furthermore, pain levels were significantly associated with dizziness/imbalance only when respondents were in crisis and not in the absence of a crisis. In crisis, higher pain levels were reported from respondents who also reported dizziness/imbalance than from those who did not report dizziness. No significant relationship was revealed between hearing loss and falls.These results provide justification for patient and health care provider education regarding appropriate referrals for vestibular/balance assessments and provision of fall prevention strategies. Future studies on balance and SCD are encouraged.",

We also explored the associations between hearing aid self-efficacy (HASE) and listening-related personality traits and affective states.Sixty-two adults with self-reported hearing difficulties and no experience with hearing aids (HAs) participated in this descriptive study. Participants self-reported their self-efficacy, personality, and affective states in general and in listening-related contexts. Paired t tests and repeated measures with Holm-Šídák corrections were performed to explore differences between reports of patient traits in different contexts. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to explore significant associations.On average, there were no significant differences between general and listening-related self-efficacy or personality traits. However, our participants indicated significantly more negative affective states in listening-related situations compared to in general. There was a small positive association between HASE and reported affective states in \"General\" and \"Listening at Home\" contexts.This study confirms that context-specific measures are not required to accurately assess self-efficacy and personality traits in the initial stages of the hearing health journey. However, reported affective states were listening dependent for this sample. Although reported affective states were related to HASE, context-dependent measures did not provide additional insight into participants' self-efficacy for successful HA use. This suggests that rehabilitation protocols designed to promote HASE and positive affect in general and listening-related situations could facilitate HA success.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Susac syndrome (SS) is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the brain and the retina and causes unilateral or bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Although vestibular dysfunction is reported in SS, limited information is available underlying the vestibular pathophysiology. Method: The diagnosis of SS was established based on symptoms and diagnostic tools such as magnetic resonance imaging and fundus fluorescein angiography. The audiovestibular evaluation was done on the seventh day of admission (Session 1) into the emergency unit, whereas the second and third evaluations were done at 3-month (Session 2) and 8-month (Session 3) follow-ups after discharge, respectively. The audiovestibular test battery consisted of routine audiological tests, auditory brainstem response, and vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs; both cervical and ocular). Results: We found unilateral sensorineural hearing loss and absent cervical VEMPs(cVEMPs) when testing the left ear during Session 1. In the following sessions, the unilateral hearing loss did not recover; however, cVEMPs were present bilaterally. The ocular VEMPs showed an increase in amplitude during Sessions 2 and 3. Conclusions: SS can selectively disrupt auditory and vestibular structures. It may present with unique findings of audiovestibular tests. A detailed audiovestibular evaluation may be essential in patients with SS. Supplemental Material: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.21513843",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare speech perception performance in noise, as measured by signal-to-noise ratio for 50% correct scores (SNR-50) and SNR loss, between monolingual English speakers and two bilingual second-language learner populations with normal hearing sensitivity: Arabic–English and Spanish–English bilinguals. Additionally, this study observed how speech perception in noise varied as a function of language dominance for the Arabic–English bilinguals. Method: This study was a quasi-experimental, nonrandomized study. Adults with normal peripheral hearing sensitivity participated in this study: Group 1 ( n = 16) bilingual Arabic–English speakers who learned English as a second language; Group 2 ( n = 10) bilingual Spanish–English speakers from a previous study; Group 3 ( n = 27) monolingual English speakers combined from this study and the study of Mendel and Widner (2016). Speech perception was assessed using standardized methods for the Quick Speech-in-Noise (QuickSIN), the Bamford–Kowal–Bench Speech-in-Noise, the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT), and the Words-in-Noise tests. Results: The two bilingual groups had significantly higher SNR-50 scores and greater SNR loss as compared to their monolingual peers. SNR-50 negatively correlated with language dominance for the QuickSIN and HINT for the Arabic–English speakers. Conclusions: Despite having normal hearing and being proficient in the English language, bilingual Arabic–English and Spanish–English speakers exhibited a mild SNR loss. Speech perception abilities were affected by test difficulty as well as the individual's degree of language dominance.",

Pure-tone and SRT tests were administered in both ears. The D-SRT and W-SRT were compared to pure-tone average (PTA) thresholds per ear.Analysis of variance revealed a significant interaction of test and step size: PTA was significantly lower when measured with 2-dB than with 5-dB increment; however, step size yielded no differences in D-SRT and W-SRT. Right ear thresholds across tests were significantly lower than left ear. Pearson correlations were significant for all tests except two; D-SRT was highly correlated to W-SRT (r = .49-.72) in both ears. Regression analyses for both ears and step sizes revealed that prediction of the hearing threshold for speech from PTA was equally accurate for SRT measured with digit pairs or popular pediatric spondee stimuli.Digit pairs are an appropriate alternative stimulus for SRT measurement in children with normal hearing. Future diagnostic audiology implications, including application for other pediatric populations, are discussed.",

The model was used to explore how HA coupling influences SNR.To generate the model, HA output was measured in a coupler. Known coupler to real-ear transformations and known values for vent (gain) loss as a function of coupling were also used. The model was verified by measuring sound pressure level (SPL) at the TM in 6 ears.The model predicts similar overall SNRs at the TM regardless of coupling method when HA and FM microphones are active. The primary difference in SNR is in the low frequencies and depends on the amount of low frequency insertion gain and the noise levels at the HA and FM microphones.A model was developed to explore how complex variables contribute to SNR at the TM. One variable, HA coupling, is predicted to have only a minimal effect on SNR at the TM when there is HA gain. Further studies will be needed to assess the real-world effectiveness of an FM system coupled to an open- versus closed-fit HA.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The primary aim of this study was to examine the factors associated with long-term outcomes of postconcussive disruptive dizziness in Veterans of the post-9/11 wars. Method: For this observational cohort study, the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory–Vestibular subscale (NSI-V) score was used as an outcome measure for dizziness in 987 post-9/11 Veterans who indicated disruptive dizziness at an initial Veterans Health Administration Comprehensive Traumatic Brain Injury Evaluation (CTBIE). An NSI-V change score was calculated as the difference in the scores obtained at the initial CTBIE and on a subsequent survey. Differences in the NSI-V change scores were examined for demographics, injury characteristics, comorbidities, and vestibular and balance function variables, and multiple linear regression analyses were used to explore associations among the variables and the NSI-V change score. Results: The majority of Veterans (61%) demonstrated a decrease in the NSI-V score, suggesting less dizziness on the survey compared with the CTBIE; 16% showed no change; and 22% had a higher score. Significant differences in the NSI-V change score were observed for traumatic brain injury (TBI) status, diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), headache and insomnia, and vestibular function. Multivariate regressions revealed significant associations between the NSI-V change score and the initial CTBIE NSI-V score, education level, race/ethnicity, TBI status, diagnoses of PTSD or hearing loss, and vestibular function. Conclusions: Postconcussive dizziness can continue for years following an injury. Factors associated with poor prognosis include TBI, diagnoses of PTSD or hearing loss, abnormal vestibular function, increased age, identification as a Black Veteran, and high school education level.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the possibility that exposure to the high speech intensities required for that UCL test might bias the subsequent measurement of a listener's most comfortable loudness level for speech (MCL) in the opposite ear.Across 32 test runs, the left and right ear MCLs were established for 16 young adult listeners with normal hearing (five women, 11 men). The MCL assessed on each test run was measured twice. The first measurement was made at the start of the run and before a full integrated speech evaluation was conducted in the opposite ear (pretest); the second was made after that evaluation (posttest).The difference between the MCL means measured on the pretest (37.7 dB) and the posttest (38.5 dB) was less than 1 dB, and it did not approach statistical significance, t(15) = 0.69, p = .50.There was no evidence that UCL testing done in one ear on a bilateral speech test will have carryover effects that bias the subsequent measurement of a listener's MCL in the other ear. The results, therefore, support the potential clinical use of an integrated protocol when conducting bilateral speech audiometric evaluations.",

Prior research has demonstrated associations between ABR and behavioral thresholds for tone burst stimuli > 4 kHz in adults, but there are no comparable data for children. The ability to predict behavioral thresholds > 4 kHz clinically based on the ABR would provide valuable audiologic information for individuals who are unable to provide behavioral thresholds. This study included children with hearing loss and children with normal hearing to determine the association between ABR and behavioral thresholds at 6 and 8 kHz.ABR and behavioral thresholds were obtained for children ages 4.7-16.7 years (M = 10.5, SD = 3.4) with sensorineural hearing loss (n = 24) or normal hearing sensitivity (n = 16) and for adults ages 18.4-54.4 years (M = 32.7, SD = 10.4) with sensorineural hearing loss (n = 13) or normal hearing sensitivity (n = 11). Thresholds obtained for 6 and 8 kHz using ABR and conventional audiometry were compared.Differences between ABR and behavioral thresholds averaged 5-6 dB for both children and adults for both test frequencies, with differences of ≤ 20 dB in all instances. Linear mixed modeling for data from participants with hearing loss suggested that ABR threshold is a good predictor of behavioral threshold at 6 and 8 kHz for both children and adults. Test specificity was 100%; no participants with behavioral thresholds ≤ 20 dB HL had ABR thresholds > 25 dB nHL.Initial evidence suggests that ABR testing at 6 and 8 kHz is reliable for estimating behavioral threshold in listeners with hearing loss and accurately identifies normal hearing sensitivity. The results of this study contribute to efforts to improve outcomes for vulnerable populations by reducing barriers to clinical implementation of ABR testing at > 4 kHz.",

The diagnoses of each patient were recorded from the clinical reports of each specialty consultation and were classified as structural, functional, or psychiatric. They were contacted by phone at least 6 months after their visit to obtain feedback regarding their symptoms and overall patient experience.The change in DHI total score did not differ significantly by diagnosis (p = .56), indicating that patients experienced an improvement in DHI total score regardless of diagnosis. PHQ-4 anxiety scores worsened by a mean of 0.7 points for those with structural diagnoses (p = .04), improved by a mean of 0.7 points for psychiatric diagnoses (p = .16), and improved by a mean of 0.3 points for functional diagnoses (p = .39). Only seven patients would not recommend the team to a family or friend; these patients tended to report worsening DHI total scores (p = .27) compared to the significant improvement in DHI total scores for patients who would make such a recommendation (p < .001). Similarly, only 13 patients did not feel the information they received had a positive impact; these patients tended to report worsening DHI total scores (p = .18) compared to the significant improvement in DHI total scores for patients who did feel the information had a positive impact (p < .001).The assessment and management of patients with chronic dizziness is challenging due to symptoms arising from multiple etiologies. Our finding of a vast difference between high satisfaction and relatively unchanged dizziness handicap suggests that there is value in seeing a multidisciplinary team where consultations are unhurried, care is coordinated, and expectations regarding treatment can be managed.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in measuring vestibular perceptual thresholds, which quantify the smallest motion that a subject can reliably perceive, to study physiology and pathophysiology. These thresholds are sensitive to age, pathology, and postural performance. Threshold tasks require decisions to be made in the presence of uncertainty. Since humans often rely on past information when making decisions in the presence of uncertainty, we hypothesized that (a) perceptual responses are affected by their preceding trial; (b) perceptual responses tend to be biased opposite of the “preceding response” because of cognitive biases but are not biased by the “preceding stimulus”; and (c) when fits do not account for this cognitive bias, thresholds are overestimated. To our knowledge, these hypotheses are unaddressed in vestibular and direction-recognition tasks. Conclusions: Results in normal subjects supported each hypothesis. Subjects tended to respond opposite of their preceding response (not the preceding stimulus), indicating a cognitive bias, and this caused an overestimation of thresholds. Using an enhanced model (MATLAB code provided) that considered these effects, average thresholds were lower (5.5% for yaw, 7.1% for interaural). Since the results indicate that the magnitude of cognitive bias varies across subjects, this enhanced model can reduce measurement variability and potentially improve the efficiency of data collection.",

Two types of OAEs, transient-evoked OAEs (TEOAEs) and distortion product OAEs (DPOAEs), are currently utilized in clinical practice. However, it remains unknown how confident U.S. clinicians are in performing and interpreting TEOAEs and DPOAEs. Additionally, the extent to which U.S. audiologists incorporate OAEs for different clinical applications and populations has not been thoroughly investigated. To fill these gaps in knowledge, this study characterized the attitudes toward and usage of TEOAEs and DPOAEs in a sample of U.S. audiologists. Method: This study utilized an online survey distributed to U.S. audiologists through multiple channels from January to March 2021. A total of 214 completed surveys were included in the analysis. Results were analyzed descriptively. Associations between variables and comparisons between users of DPOAEs only and users of TEOAEs and DPOAEs were also examined. Results: DPOAEs were reportedly utilized more frequently and with greater confidence than TEOAEs. The most common clinical application of both OAE types was a cross-check. Significant associations were found between responses to DPOAE questions and the clinician's setting and patient age. There were some significant differences between users of DPOAEs only and users of TEOAEs and DPOAEs. Conclusions: Results suggest that U.S. audiologists utilize OAEs for multiple clinical purposes and that there are appreciable differences in terms of attitudes toward and usage of DPOAEs versus TEOAEs. Future work could investigate the reasons that underlie these differences to further improve clinical implementation of OAEs.",

The studies conducted about hyperacusis are very limited in Iran. The purposes of this study are the psychometric evaluation of the Persian version of the Hyperacusis Questionnaire (PHQ) and the investigation of its prevalence.This cross-sectional study was accomplished on 203 young university students with normal hearing sensitivity. After translating the questionnaire, the psychometric properties of the PHQ were evaluated by content validity ratio (CVR) and index (CVI) and exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Students were evaluated by clinical audiology tests, the loudness discomfort level (LDL) measurement, and answering the PHQ. The research data collection was done from April to November 2022. Otoscopy, clinical and speech audiometry, and LDL were all executed, respectively. The participants directly answered the PHQ. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software Version 26.The PHQ demonstrated acceptable validity and reliability, Cronbach's alpha (.81), CVI (> 0.88), and CVR (> 0.98). EFA revealed four dimensions of the questionnaire. Of the participants, four (2%) were identified as suffering from hyperacusis. The PHQ showed the possibility of differences between genders.The psychometric evaluations of the PHQ were found to be acceptable and can be used in future studies. The prevalence of hyperacusis in our sample was 2%, and estimated to be higher in females. These findings suggest the need for further research on hyperacusis in Iranian population and specified studies to compare the two genders.",

Most of the children (9/11) had a bilateral hearing loss, and two had an additional disability. Three themes emerged for hearing aid management experiences: audiology services, routines, and emotional challenges/supports. Parents had variable levels of confidence in their skills ranging from no confidence to complete confidence, with the greatest variability for three items: (a) using the listening tube to make sure that the sound quality of the hearing aid is good, (b) removing moisture from the earmold tubing, and (c) troubleshooting problems when your child's hearing aids are not working. All participants reported having consistent Internet access and had positive perceptions about the possibility of remote audiology services.This study provided insights into hearing aid management experiences and perceptions of Spanish-speaking parents. Parents described variability for audiology services, routines for hearing aid use and care, and access to other parents of children with hearing loss. Spanish-speaking parents present additional elements in the hearing care process that need to be incorporated in planning. Remote services may be an opportunity to enhance access to support that could improve effectiveness of hearing aid management.",

No significant association was found between the presence of ITD abnormality with the presence of brainstem lesions (MRI) and brainstem dysfunction (BFSS). Also, this study did not find any relationship between JND-ITD thresholds with disability (EDSS).This study supports the findings that JND-ITD for high-pass filtered noise is a sensitive test to detect lesions along the auditory system. Even though JND-ITD thresholds did not relate with BFSS and EDSS scores, JND-ITD abnormalities can be of great value in identifying lesions along the auditory system, especially in the early stages of MS, when clinical neurological examination does not show any signs of brainstem dysfunction, disability, and MRI without any lesions in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Clinical decision-making is an essential component of most clinical processes across the health sector and an ongoing challenge for clinical education programs to teach to students. The traditional methods of teaching these skills outside of lectures are mainly through clinical placements and problem-based learning (PBL) sessions, but availability and consistency can be variable and resource heavy. To address these challenges, an e-simulation module specific to pediatric infant diagnostic testing has been developed and implemented into the teaching program. We aimed to establish whether e-simulation resulted in student skill acquisition.Academic performance measures for 67 audiology students who used a traditional PBL and 108 students who used the e-simulation module were collected and analyzed. Student survey results generated both quantitative and qualitative data, which were analyzed using a thematic analysis with an inductive approach.Findings indicated that the e-simulation platform introduced in this study yielded learning outcomes similar to the traditional PBL format previously used. Participants experienced a significant in situ increase in understanding of infant diagnostic testing concepts following the use of the e-simulation and evaluated the e-simulation platform positively.The data support that an e-simulation-based approach in clinical education presents pedagogical benefits and can provide a meaningful sustainable inclusion in today's clinical teaching programs.",

Our goal was to provide reference guidelines for the rational use of medication and gene-targeted therapy for patients with hereditary hearing loss and discuss the future development of research in this area.We searched two core databases, PubMed and Web of Science, for relevant literature relating to potential treatments and interventional methods for hereditary hearing loss. Then, we used Microsoft Excel to perform basic statistical analysis of the data, the R language to perform bibliometric analyses, and VOSviewer and CiteSpace to visualize data. In addition, we clustered and descriptively analyzed the data and identified the relative importance of each approach with regard to precise patient outcomes.In this study, we followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standardized screening process and identified a total of 103 research articles. The average annual growth rate of publications in this area was 12.73%. The country with the highest number of publications and citations was the United States; 80 of these publications (associated with 76.92% of funding) were supported by grants from 16 countries. Potential treatments and interventions were clustered according to the stage of research and showed that 8.74% remain in the research design stage, 59.22% are in the clinical validation stage, and 32.04% are being applied in the clinic. The main research focus in this field is cochlear implants and gene therapy.Hereditary hearing loss is in a critical period of transition from preventive to therapeutic research.

Method: A consumer survey was developed from themes that arose during 11 semistructured interviews with adults who had no previous hearing aid experience. Using Qualtrics research panels, a 28-item questionnaire was distributed online to U.S. residents above the age of 50 years with no previous hearing aid experience. A quota of 1,000 completed responses was set, with a maximum of 70% of respondents identifying as White. Completed surveys were obtained from 1,377 individuals. Three hundred forty responses were excluded due to ineligibility and/or poor response quality. Results: Two unique customer archetypes were developed using five factors identified in the data set: Physician Trust, Sociability, Comfort Buying Online, Verify Sources, and Reliance on Others. Eighty-four percent of respondents chose an in-person pathway for hearing health care. There was no association between customer archetype and pathway selection choice. Conclusions: The two archetypes reflect those with greater comfort with consuming health care online and in person, respectively. However, both archetypes are likely to use in-person models of hearing health care at the present time. Supplemental Material: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.24431212",

The audiovisual Connected Speech Test served as the signal, and the ipsilateral competing message from the Synthetic Sentence Identification-Ipsilateral Competing Message (SSI-ICM) served as the noise. Measures of speech understanding, satisfaction with sound quality and clarity, and preference were obtained.Speech understanding was significantly better in quiet than in noise, and streaming improved performance in noise when the hearing aid microphones were muted. Sound quality satisfaction was significantly better in quiet than in noise but was not impacted significantly by the hearing aid settings. Speech clarity satisfaction was significantly better in quiet than in noise, and streaming improved satisfaction in noise when the hearing aid microphones were muted. More participants preferred streaming with the microphones muted in quiet, in noise, and overall; however, results did not reach statistical significance.Hearing aid users did not benefit from TV streaming with the microphones attenuated or muted when listening in quiet. TV streaming was more beneficial to hearing aid users when listening in noise with the microphones muted. Hearing aid users should be counseled on the impact of the hearing aid microphone settings when using a TV streamer, particularly in noise.",

This was done by comparing the Tinnitus Reaction Questionnaire (TRQ) to the following hope scales: the Herth Hope Scale (HHS) and the Herth Hope Index (HHI).Patients seen for a tinnitus evaluation in the University of Tennessee audiology clinic completed the TRQ, HHS, and HHI scales. Investigation of relationships between tinnitus assessment using the TRQ and measurements of hope (HHS and HHI) was performed via correlation analyses using Pearson coefficients and linear regression.Significant correlations were found between overall scores on the TRQ and HHS, and TRQ and HHI, indicating that greater tinnitus distress was associated with lower levels of hope. Further analyses showed the HHS and HHI Domain 1, regarding temporality and future, as significantly related to tinnitus distress.Significant correlations between tinnitus disturbance and hope suggest that potential interventions based on hopefulness may be of benefit for individuals suffering from tinnitus.",

    "abstract": "The goal was to evaluate whether implicit talker familiarization via an interactive computer game, designed for this study, could improve children's word recognition in classroom noise. It was hypothesized that, regardless of age, children would perform better when recognizing words spoken by the talker who was heard during the game they played.Using a one-group pretest-posttest experimental design, this study examined the impact of short-term implicit voice exposure on children's word recognition in classroom noise. Implicit voice familiarization occurred via an interactive computer game, played at home for 10 min a day for 5 days. In the game, children (8-12 years) heard one voice, intended to become the \"familiar talker.\" Pre- and postfamiliarization, children identified words in prerecorded classroom noise. Four conditions were tested to evaluate talker familiarity and generalization effects.Results demonstrated an 11% improvement when recognizing words spoken by the voice heard in the game (\"familiar talker\"). This was observed only for words that were heard in the game and did not generalize to unfamiliarized words. Before familiarization, younger children had poorer recognition than older children in all conditions; however, after familiarization, there was no effect of age on performance for familiarized stimuli.Implicit short-term exposure to a talker has the potential to improve children's speech recognition. Therefore, leveraging talker familiarity through gameplay shows promise as a viable method for improving children's speech-in-noise recognition. However, given that improvements did not generalize to unfamiliarized words, careful consideration of exposure stimuli is necessary to optimize this approach.",

This study reports critical thinking skills for entering doctor of audiology (AuD) students and the trajectory of the change in critical thinking skills measured 2 times over a period of 3 years.This longitudinal, descriptive, and exploratory design was implemented for programmatic review. Critical thinking skills were measured using the Health Sciences Reasoning Test (HSRT; Insight Assessment) upon entering the program and compared to measurements during the final month of academic coursework. Descriptive statistics, exploratory analyses of the HSRT scores among cohorts, the relationship of the HSRT to the graduate record examinations (GREs), and changes in the HSRT over time using a repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance were conducted.There were no significant differences in critical thinking skills between any of the cohort years. There was a significant correlation between the GRE verbal scores and OVERALL HSRT. Improvements in critical thinking skills were found between the time the students entered the graduate program and their final academic semester. Greater gains were reported for students who initially scored below the 50th percentile on the OVERALL HSRT.This program review showed improvement in the critical thinking skills of AuD students during their academic training program. Information regarding critical thinking skills may be useful for programs to monitor students' clinical thinking skills and possibly include clinical and didactical activities to promote critical thinking skills.",

Rather than having to compromise on a single frequency-gain response (the prescriptive target), it is now possible to create a family of hearing aid responses from which the user can select an appropriate response for a given situation. This philosophy is also applicable in the prescription of compression characteristics. The flexibility designed into the 3M two-channel compression system allows the dispenser to program very different types of signal processing strategies (low frequency compression, high frequency compression, full spectrum compression, or linear processing) into a single instrument to match the requirements of different listening environments and to meet the needs of different users. Utilizing this approach, comfort, speech intelligibility, and sound quality can be optimized in a variety of situations by considering the listener's acoustic environment and the input signals to which the hearing aid must respond.",

    "abstract": "Mainly because of packaging size limitations, most amplifiers for in-the-ear (ITE) and in-the-canal (ITC) hearing aids have performed linear processing and had a class A output stage. Recent advances in the miniaturization of analog semiconductor technology have made it possible to package much more sophisticated signal processing circuitry and push-pull and class D output stages in ITE and ITC hearing aids. These advancements have been used in hearing aids to improve sound quality, enhance the speech signal to emphasize weak consonants, provide increased flexibility in frequency response shaping, and reduce the amplification of undesired noise. Although digital programmability offers increased flexibility in hearing aid fittings, in most programmable hearing aid designs it is the analog portion of the circuit rather than the digital portion that performs the signal processing functions. Although \"true\" digital signal processing holds promise for further dramatic improvements in hearing aid performance, the capabilities of analog electronics are just beginning to be exploited. Through advances in low-voltage CMOS circuitry, analog ITE and even ITC hearing aids are now being made with multiband amplifiers that have relatively steep filter slopes. These small, nonprogrammable hearing instruments are essentially master hearing aids for frequency response shaping that require only a few potentiometers and an ordinary screw-driver for adjustment. Consequently, analog circuitry should not be totally abandoned as yet in favor of digital circuitry.",

Two hundred sixty-eight completed surveys were returned. Respondents indicated interest in a wide range of continuing education topics, with the greatest amount of interest in areas related to technology. The majority of respondents preferred to complete continuing education activities via traditional, face-to-face programming, whereas most respondents indicated interest in using both traditional and distance-learning methods to upgrade to a professional doctoral degree. Results of the survey also showed that a large proportion of audiologists are undecided about their desire to obtain a professional doctoral degree.",

For comparisons with other published studies, Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficients (Pearson's r) also were used.Based on GT with chirp stimuli, overall BMEPR measures had good reliability; however, the reliability of individual profiles across frequencies and ears was less than optimal. Lower generalizability coefficients were found when transmittance was evaluated. Test-retest reliability using Pearson's r was better for right versus left ears, and mid-frequencies were generally more reliable than those at either extreme of the frequency range. In contrast, tonal stimuli had higher generalizability coefficients and Pearson's r values than chirps for all frequencies tested; Pearson's r values were also higher for right versus left ears.The authors extended the use of GT as a preferred way to evaluate reliability of BMEPR and transmittance profiles for chirps and tones because it allows for a more comprehensive evaluation compared with unidimensional pairwise correlations.",

For the HA-1 coupling, a standard full-shell earmold with #13 tubing throughout was used. The results suggest that when this earmold configuration is used, the gain and output assumed from HA-2 specifications may not be realized in the higher frequency region. Questionnaires sent to all U.S. earmold manufacturers indicated that only one of those manufacturers considered a “standard” earmold to be one incorporating a “horn” effect in the canal portion of the mold; over 70% of the manufacturers reported inserting tubing to the end of the canal portion as a standard procedure. Measures of real-ear-to-coupler differences (RECD) should be obtained with consideration for this earmold effect.",

Studies in other specialties characterize experts as spending more time and effort in understanding a problem before they begin to solve it. That is, at the beginning of a problemsolving episode, experts work to limit the problem space. On the other hand, novices often plunge immediately into the solution process. In order to learn more about diagnostic problem-solving in audiology, a computer-based environment, Simon Says ©, was used to assist in the collection of problem-solving data. The results of two experiments revealed that accurate diagnosis in audiology appears to be related to the ability to set up patient problem contexts by analyzing presenting symptoms and history information and using the more focused context to interpret test data.",

Method Thirty-two adult NH listeners participated in the three experiments. For all three experiments, the stimuli were presented to the left ear at the subjects' most comfortable level through headphones. All tests were administered in an adaptive three-alternative forced-choice paradigm. Experiment 1 was designed to compare the effect of soundproof booth and quiet room test conditions on amplitude modulation detection threshold and modulation frequency discrimination threshold with each of the five modulation frequencies. Experiment 2 was designed to compare the effect of two test orders on the frequency discrimination thresholds under the quiet room test conditions. The thresholds were first measured in the ascending and descending order of four pure tones, and then with counterbalanced order. For Experiment 3, the amplitude discrimination threshold under the quiet room testing condition was assessed 3 times to determine the effect of the number of test sessions. Then the thresholds were compared over the sessions. Results Results showed no significant effect of test environment. The test order is an important variable for frequency discrimination, particularly between piano tunes and pure tones. Results also show no significant difference across test sessions. Conclusions These results suggest that a controlled test environment may not be required in spectral and temporal assessment for NH listeners. Under the quiet test environment, a single outcome measure is sufficient, but test orders should be counterbalanced.",

Objective This article aims to compare clinical outcomes and utilization data among patients with and without deafness. Design This study used a retrospective cohort study. Setting and Participants The participants included Nationwide Inpatient Sample, year 2017, hospitalized adults with and without diagnostic codes related to deafness and inability to speak. Method Multiple logistic and linear regression were used to compare in-hospital outcomes. Results Thirty million four hundred one thousand one hundred seventeen adults were hospitalized, and 7,180 had deafness and inability to speak related coding. Patients with deafness were older (mean age ± SEM : 59.2 ± 0.51 vs. 57.9 ± 0.09 years, p = .01), and less likely female (47.0% vs. 57.7%, p &lt; .01) compared to controls. Those with deafness had more comorbidities compared to the controls (Charlson comorbidity score ≥ 3: 31.2% vs. 27.8%, p &lt; .01). Mortality was higher among deaf versus controls (3.6% vs. 2.2%; p &lt; .01); this translated into higher adjusted odds of mortality (adjusted odds ratio = 1.7. [confidence interval (CI) 1.3–2.4]; p = .01). Deaf patients had lower odds of being discharged home compared to controls {aOR} = 0.6, (CI) 0.55–0.73]; p &lt; .01. Length of stay was longer (adjusted mean difference = 1.5 days CI [0.7–2.3]; p &lt; .01) and hospital charges were higher, but not significantly so (adjusted mean difference = $4,193 CI [−$1,935–$10,322]; p = .18) in patients with deafness. Conclusions Hospitalized nonspeaking deaf patients had higher mortality and longer hospital stays compared to those without this condition. These results suggest that specialized attention may be warranted when deaf patients are admitted to our hospitals in hopes of reducing disparities in outcomes.

    "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to comprehensively describe the intervention planning process for the Tinnitus E-Programme 2.0, an Internet-based cognitive behavioral intervention for tinnitus. Method Theory-, evidence-, and person-based approaches to intervention development were used. In Phase 1, quantitative systematic reviews were used to identify potentially effective intervention techniques and design features. Primary mixed-methods research involving adults with tinnitus explored the acceptability of the first version of the intervention. In Phase 2, person-based guiding principles highlighted key intervention design objectives and features to address needs of the intervention's target group (identified in Phase 1) to maximize its acceptability, feasibility of delivery, and effectiveness. Theory-based “behavioral analysis” and “logic modeling” comprehensively described intervention content and potential mechanisms of action. From this planning work, a prototype intervention was developed. Results The intervention design objectives outlined in the guiding principles were to (a) normalize tinnitus, (b) support users to maintain a regular relaxation practice, (c) minimize the worsening of users' tinnitus sensation, and (d) ensure the intervention is accessible to those with hearing loss. Behavioral analysis and logic modeling identified intervention processes (e.g., illness perceptions, beliefs about consequences, skills, goals) and purported mediators (acceptance of tinnitus, negative thinking, use of the cognitive skills tools for managing negative thoughts, and practicing regular relaxation) hypothesized to facilitate reductions in tinnitus symptom severity. Conclusions The guiding principles highlight key design objectives and features to consider when developing interventions for tinnitus. The logic model offers hypothesized mechanisms of action that can be tested in future process analyses.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The prevalence of dementia has increased in recent years and, along with hearing loss, can negatively impact the health of older adults. The purpose of this retrospective cross-sectional study was to establish self-reported hearing loss and associated factors in older adults at a memory clinic. Method Researchers conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study on factors associated with self-reported hearing loss (i.e., lifestyle, general health, cognition, functional capacity). Data were taken from medical records of older adults (≥ 60 years old) who received care between 2017 and 2018 at a memory clinic located at the Southern Santa Catarina University in Brazil. Analysis included the Pearson chi-squared test and logistic regression, estimation of the crude and adjusted odds ratios ( OR ), with respective confidence intervals of 95%. Results Researchers analyzed the medical records of 257 older adults and verified a prevalence of 13.2% of these adults with self-reported hearing loss. There was a higher prevalence of the outcome (i.e., self-reported hearing loss) in older adults who reported tinnitus (35.2%), those with mild cognitive impairment (14.7%), and those who were sedentary (19.2%). After adjustment for confusion factors, tinnitus ( OR = 4.63; p = .019) and sedentarism ( OR = 2.89; p = .029) were still associated with the outcome. Conclusions Tinnitus and sedentarism were associated with hearing loss in older adults receiving care at a memory clinic. As a public health issue, presbycusis needs to be included in the health planning and health promotion agendas, with effective control, prevention, and treatment measures.",

In this study, central auditory processing abilities were assessed using Speech Perception in Noise test in Kannada (SPIN-K) and quick speech perception in noise tests in Kannada, dichotic consonant-vowel test, gap detection threshold (GDT), and auditory digit sequencing and auditory digit span tests.Results showed that the hearing thresholds at extremely low and high frequencies (250 and 8000 Hz), although within clinically normal limits, were poorer in girls with IDA than in the control groups. Also, girls with IDA performed poorly in SPIN-K of the right ear, GDT, and auditory backward digit span tests.These subtle auditory deficiencies may be attributed to the compromised blood supply to the central auditory nervous system, as observed in the current study.",

The correlations between auditory processing tests and some comorbidities in Ahmmed (2021a) were significant at p < .01. The low sensitivity and specificity reported was not related to the principle of using comorbidities as a reference standard but due to the choice of comorbidities combined in the reference standard. Ahmmed (2021a) suggested the option of inclusion of other comorbidities in addition to language impairment and impaired manual dexterity in the reference standard. Visual processing impairment could be considered as the additional comorbidity to improve sensitivity and specificity of the approach suggested by Ahmmed (2021a).",

This article will briefly review the current state of molecular genetic methodology and relate the assumptions inherent in such methods to the character of the clinical data needed from the audiologist inthese cases. The basic assumption of most molecular biologic investigations of ear disease is that a binary (yes or no) diagnosis can be made by the audiologists and physicians as to the disease status of each member of an affected family. The binary assumption gives rise to a number of clinical diagnosis issues not easily understood by molecular biologists, and these issues are discussed in order to facilitate progress in genetic cases.",

    "abstract": "A portion of idiopathic rapidly progressive sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) cases can be attributed to an immunological process in the cochlea that has been designated \"autoimmune inner ear disease\" (AIED). AIED is characterized by asymmetric bilateral SNHL that progresses over weeks or months, is often accompanied by vestibular symptoms, and responds positively to immunosuppressant medication. Historically, the inner ear was thought to be protected from autoimmune pathology; however, recent evidence suggests that the perisacular tissue surrounding the endolymphatic sac contains the necessary components for an immunological reaction. In addition, the inner ear is capable of producing an autoimmune response to sensitized cells that can enter the cochlea from the circulatory system through the spiral modiolar vein. Thus, AIED can be organ-specific, originating within the inner ear, or non-organ-specific, originating outside the inner ear. Although AIED is a recognized form of SNHL that may be stabilized or even reversed by appropriate medication, it remains the subject of controversy and debate. This paper discusses the pathogenesis of AIED, diagnostic strategy and treatment procedures for AIED, and the role of the audiologist in patient management.",

Therefore, we think it insightful to share a summary of the whole conference before attempting to bring together learnings from the articles in this special issue. The objective of the conference was to enhance knowledge about theoretical models of, psychological responses to, and clinical manifestations of tinnitus, and to discuss how this knowledge can be translated into clinical practice, so that individuals with tinnitus can receive the most effective treatment. To achieve these goals, the conference addressed four broad topics associated with tinnitus: (a) its etiology, (b) evaluation and measurement, (c) clinical presentation, and (d) effectiveness of management options. Presenters described neurophysiological models at the subcortical and cortical levels that attempt to explain the underlying mechanisms that generate tinnitus. It is logical to expect that intervention effectiveness will vary depending on where tinnitus originates from. Together, the presented talks on this topic provide an overview of the biological basis of tinnitus, but it is important to remember that limitations exist in translating animal research to humans—a major barrier in the development of a successful pharmacological agent for tinnitus. When describing approaches to evaluating the tinnitus patient, presenters focused on the difficulties and nuances associated with measuring tinnitus, a subjective percept that is further complicated by the fact that an individual's emotional state contributes to his/her experience of tinnitus. The inability to objectively measure tinnitus means we are limited in confirming its diagnosis and assessing outcome(s) of an intervention. This always has been, and remains, a major problem for both research and clinical settings. Other presenters focused on additional obstacles associated with diagnosis and management of tinnitus, such as (a) the need to differentiate hearing-related problems from tinnitus-related problems and consequent selection of an appropriate intervention; and (b) the observation that many tinnitus patients have auditory comorbidities (e.g., hearing loss, hyperacusis) and nonauditory comorbid conditions involving their mental health, in particular posttraumatic stress disorder among Veterans, such that management and follow-up must be adjusted accordingly. Presenters described and discussed a variety of approaches to tinnitus management including cognitive behavioral therapy, sound-based therapies (including amplification when appropriate), head and neck manipulations when somatosensory tinnitus is suspected, neuromodulation, and novel interventions for which there is often little or no scientific evidence as to their efficacy. When available, the theoretical rationale for the intervention/management approaches were explained, and data on effectiveness and efficacy were presented. It should be clear from this summary, combined with the articles in this issue, that clinical management of tinnitus is complex and limited by knowledge gaps surrounding the biological and physiological basis of the condition, the heterogenous nature of potential sources, and the need to factor auditory and nonauditory comorbidities into the treatment plan. Conclusion In conclusion, the key take-home messages from the conference can perhaps be best summarized in the following four points: The underlying mechanisms by which tinnitus is generated are not fully understood; thus, it is challenging to develop a pharmacological cure and clearly define the relationship with comorbid conditions. The tinnitus percept, and the psychological reaction it evokes, is complex and can involve both auditory and nonauditory systems; therefore, when patients present with complex symptomology and nonauditory comorbid conditions, it is recommended to take a multidisciplinary approach to best meet the needs of your patients. Additionally, it is helpful to create a handout you can provide patients that includes community resources to find a mental health or other appropriate health care provider (e.g., websites of national organizations, associations, etc.) and to let other providers know you are interested in working together. Currently, tinnitus cannot be objectively measured. To evaluate treatment efficacy and effectiveness, it is only possible to indirectly assess the perceptual attributes of tinnitus and reported impacts on quality of life. With that said, using these tools helps evaluate the patients' needs and engages patients to take an active role in the decision-making process and in setting realistic goals. Additionally, using these same tools to monitor change informs the clinician about the effectiveness, or otherwise, of the treatment/management and allows patients to self-assess their progress and revisit/set new goals. Individual differences greatly impact how each patient perceives his/her tinnitus and what s/he finds bothersome about it; thus, it is necessary to adapt the choice of intervention to the specific needs of each patient. Once again, this emphasizes the need for tinnitus management to be multifaceted and individualized—considering the patient's preferences, goals and expectations, mental health status, and auditory and nonauditory comorbid conditions—to achieve the best possible outcome. We hope you have enjoyed the content of the seven articles in this special issue and that it has provided you with insights about tinnitus research and clinical practice that you can integrate into your clinical decision making so your patients receive the best assessment and most effective tinnitus management strategies available to date.

However, the high prevalence of tinnitus is not just limited to Veterans. In the general population of the United States, approximately 25% (~50 million adults) are estimated to have tinnitus (Shargorodsky, Curhan, & Farwell, 2010). People with tinnitus try a variety of management strategies to varying degrees of success. Currently, there is no cure for tinnitus, and its management is complicated by the fact that physiological, psychological, and psychosocial factors influence its presence, severity, and the extent to which it is bothersome and disabling. Negative consequences of tinnitus manifest as sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, and even suicidal ideation (Cima, Crombez, & Vlaeyen, 2011; Erlandsson & Hallberg, 2000; Han et al., 2018; Liu, Streelman, & Guthrie, 2015). It is critical to understand the underlying mechanisms that give rise to tinnitus so that treatments can be developed targeting the neural generator(s) and modulatory pathways. In the fall of 2017, the Veterans Administration (VA) Rehabilitation Research and Development Service National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research (NCRAR) hosted its eighth biennial conference, titled “Translating Tinnitus Research Findings Into Clinical Practice.” The primary objective of the conference, as suggested by its title, was to bring together experts in the field and provide a forum to discuss how tinnitus research findings can be integrated into evidence-based clinical practice. During this 3-day conference, scientists and clinicians discussed a range of topics on tinnitus, including its epidemiology, neurophysiological models to explain its underlying causes, techniques and challenges for developing pharmacological cures, assessment and measurement procedures, and current approaches to tinnitus management. The articles in this special issue are based on seven of the conference presentations. Approaches to Assessment and Management In the first article by Henry and Manning (2019), we learn that clinical services for tinnitus are unstandardized across clinics and among clinicians, leading to inconsistent outcomes and inequalities in patient care. Henry and Manning recommend using an evidence-based clinical protocol known as progressive tinnitus management (PTM), which is endorsed by the VA Central Office. PTM takes a hierarchical approach to evaluating and best meeting the tinnitus patient's needs. PTM focuses on promoting self-efficacy to manage reactions to tinnitus (Henry et al., 2017). Their article brings to light the need for audiologists to have appropriate clinical tools and guidelines to be successful in providing tinnitus management services for their patients. The recommendations they make are informed by years of research combined with existing tinnitus clinical practice guidelines (Tunkel et al., 2014). A tinnitus “decision-tree” is provided to aid clinicians in their decision making for what services to offer their tinnitus patients. In the second article, Beck, Zaugg, Egge, Lima, and Thielman (2019) describe the clinical implementation and outcomes of PTM in two VA clinics. The PTM framework was modified from the standard protocol and tailored to suit the individual VA medical centers. Their work provides added evidence for the effectiveness of PTM as a tinnitus management approach while also noting that clinician-directed modification to the overarching PTM protocol still results in positive outcomes. The research note by Manning, Thielman, Grush, and Henry (2019) reports on a study looking to understand the relationship, in a general sense, between the functional effects of tinnitus (i.e., reactions) and psychoacoustic measures of tinnitus loudness and pitch (i.e., perceptions). The rationale for this work was that while tinnitus psychoacoustic measures are commonly used to assess intervention outcome, there is little evidence to suggest characteristics of the tinnitus perception relate to patient reactions associated with tinnitus distress. Manning et al. reveal that overall, only weak relationships exist between perceptual measures of tinnitus and the reactionary impact of the condition, but they note that in some instances, it may be appropriate to evaluate both domains. The authors go on to explain the value in assessing both perceptual and functional effects of tinnitus; the former can help patients feel emotionally validated, while the latter can be beneficial for tracking changes in reactions to tinnitus over time. These findings demonstrate that to select appropriate metrics, one must account for various considerations specific to the research and/or clinical setting. Comorbid Mental Health Conditions The work of Carlson et al. (2019) examined health care use and mental health diagnoses among Veterans with and without tinnitus using retrospective data obtained from electronic medical records (i.e., VA Corporate Data Warehouse). The rationale for this work stems from the fact that service-connected disabilities and associated compensation are calculated based on multiple variables, and although tinnitus has remained the top service-connected disability for Veterans receiving compensation since 2007, Carlson et al. note the proportion of Veterans seeking health care services for tinnitus, either inside or outside the VA, is unknown. Carlson et al. (2019) determined that while almost all Veterans in their sample had received care in a primary care clinic sometime during a 5-year period, Veterans with tinnitus had a higher percentage of using VA health care services and were more likely to have comorbid mental health disorders compared to Veterans without tinnitus. Their work highlights the need for coordinated tinnitus and mental health care services for Veterans in the VA system of care. Tinnitus Mechanisms Tinnitus can only be measured indirectly, and due to its complex and subjective nature, exacting a “true” measure is beyond challenging. Although no objective measure of tinnitus exists, brain imaging techniques show promise to elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms giving rise to the percept and neural network changes associated with tinnitus distress. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to detect changes in neural activity and/or neural networks during different tasks or subject states (e.g., at rest). Data collected in “resting-state” are spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level–dependent signal and provides insight into the underlying nature of how the brain functions (perceptual and cognitive processes). The article by Husain et al. (2019) explores the replicability of resting-state fMRI in individuals with tinnitus. Specifically, Husain et al. examined the reliability and correlations between different resting-state neural networks (default mode network, dorsal attention network) to establish the replicability of these measures in tinnitus patients. Their findings demonstrate resting-state functional connectivity measures are reliable and replicable within individuals with tinnitus over time. Establishing this fact is an important first step before attempting to understand the relationship between these neural network measures and tinnitus distress. Conducting future studies comparing resting-state functional connectivity measures in individuals with and without tinnitus are necessary to determine if resting-state fMRI measures could be considered objective biomarkers of tinnitus. The next article in this special issue is by Campbell, LaBrec, Bean, Nielsen, and So (2019). They examined the relationship between behavioral audiometric thresholds and physiological measures of central inhibitory function obtained via a sensory gating paradigm, in individuals with and without tinnitus. Sensory gating is a pre-attentive neurological process that functions to filter or “gate” out nonpertinent stimuli. Campbell et al. theorized that compared to controls, tinnitus patients would show reduced sensory gating function associated with elevated behavioral high-frequency (> 8 kHz) audiometric thresholds. Their findings did not support their hypothesis and suggest perhaps there is a tinnitus severity “threshold” that needs to be reached before central inhibitory processes become affected (an interesting theory to be explored in future studies). Additionally, their study investigated the variability in sensory gating performance within the tinnitus group. Examining correlations between extended high-frequency hearing ability and gating performance in tinnitus individuals not distressed by their tinnitus based on their Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI; Newman, Jacobson, & Spitzer, 1996) scores showed that as gating function decreased, THI scores increased. This finding suggests an interaction between decreased sensory gating and heightened auditory awareness. Follow-up studies are needed to fully understand the role sensory gating processes play in contributing to the perception of and reactions to tinnitus. There is widespread acceptance that tinnitus is associated with alterations in cortical activity, but this view is overly simplistic because it does not account for the brainstem's role. Theodoroff and Kaltenbach (2019) discuss a new perspective regarding the brainstem's involvement in generating and modulating tinnitus and associations with nonauditory comorbid conditions. Understanding the involvement of both cortical and subcortical contributions to tinnitus perception, distress, and comorbidities can help guide health care professionals in their treatment approach. For example, somatic manipulations can directly influence the tinnitus perception for many patients (Shore, 2011), which suggests somatosensory tinnitus is an indicator of an underlying musculoskeletal deficit of the head or neck. Clinicians do not routinely perform an in-depth tinnitus assessment, and no standard guidelines exist recommending questions or screening procedures to identify tinnitus fluctuations, triggers, and comorbid conditions. It is critical to consider all the facets of tinnitus patients' needs and keep in mind that successful tinnitus management may involve a multidisciplinary approach to treating/managing auditory and nonauditory comorbid conditions simultaneously. We hope you enjoy reading these articles and that, as a result, you gain a broader perspective on tinnitus etiology, the nuances of tinnitus assessment and management, and knowing when a multidisciplinary approach is warranted. The next NCRAR conference is scheduled for September 2019. It will address the impact of ototoxicity and noise damage on audiological management. We hope to see you there. Sarah M.

    "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether merging the clinical pitch pattern test procedure with psychoacoustic adaptive methods would create a new tool feasible to capture individual differences in pitch temporal processing and patterning capacity of children and adults. Method Sixty-six individuals, young children (ages 10–12 years, n = 22), older children (ages 13–15 years, n = 23), and adults (ages 18–33 years, n = 21), were recruited and assigned to subgroups based on reported duration (years) of instrumental music instruction. Additional background information was collected in order to assess if the pitch temporal processing and patterning span developed, the Pspan, was sensitive to individual differences across participants. Results The evaluation of the Pspan task as a scale indicated good parallel reliability across runs assessed by Cronbach's alpha, and scores were normally distributed. Between-subjects analysis of variance indicated main effects for both age groups and music groups recruited for the study. A multiple regression analysis with the Pspan scores as the dependent variable found that 3 measures of music instruction, age in years, and paternal education were predictive of enhanced temporal processing and patterning capacity for pitch input. Conclusions The outcomes suggest that the Pspan task is a time-efficient data collection tool that is sensitive to the duration of instrumental music instruction, maturation, and paternal education. In addition, results indicate that the task is sensitive to age-related auditory temporal processing and patterning performance changes during adolescence when children are 10–15 years old.",

    "abstract": "Purpose It can be challenging to collect reliable behavioral responses to sound from individuals with significant motor or developmental impairments, the most common types of comorbid disability found in children with hearing loss (e.g., Gallaudet Research Institute, 2011 ). The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of using a 2-interval, forced-choice, observer-based method for individuals considered to be difficult-to-test using behavioral audiometric assessments. Method Participants were 5 children with motor and developmental impairments, ages 5–15 years ( M = 11.6, SD = 4.6). The functional abilities of all participants were greater than 2 SDs below the mean, as measured by the Vineland-II Parent Caregiver Rating Form. Participants listened to either a male talker saying the word “playground” or a 1000-Hz warble tone, presented via an insert earphone or a sound field speaker. An observer, blind to signal presentation, selected 1 of 2 temporal intervals, determining which contained the signal based only on participant behavior. Criterion was reached when the observer correctly identified the interval containing the signal for 8 of the last 10 trials. Results An 80%-correct criterion was met for all participants, suggesting feasibility for use in children with motor or developmental impairment. Two participants were tested using an adaptive tracking procedure; a reliable threshold estimate was obtained for both children. This method offers promise for children who have difficulty performing behavioral audiometric assessments currently in use clinically.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Numerous studies are testimony to the pivotal role of multicomponent tympanometry in diagnosis and differential diagnosis of auditory pathologies, not only of the middle ear but also the inner ear. Repeated measurements using multicomponent tympanometry have been used as a measure for stapedial tendon preservation during middle ear surgeries. However, such applications would produce reliable results only when multicomponent tympanometry produces replicable results across sessions. Nonetheless, there is dearth of studies exploring the test-retest repeatability of multicomponent tympanometry across multiple sessions using various probe tones. Therefore, this study aimed at examining the test-retest reliability of multicomponent tympanometry across 10 different sessions for 226-, 678-, and 1000-Hz probe-tone frequencies. Method The study included 28 healthy adults in the age range of 18 to 25 years. All participants underwent multicomponent (susceptance and conductance) tympanometry using 226-, 678-, and 1000-Hz probe tones. Results Multicomponent tympanometry showed excellent test-retest reliability for all parameters of 226- and 678-Hz probe tones. The probe tone of 1000 Hz produced excellent test-retest reliability for most of the parameters. Conclusions The clinical recording of multicomponent tympanometry over multiple sessions is more reliable when using 226- and 678-Hz probe tones. Hence, these probe tones lend themselves to possible applications requiring multiple recordings, such as evaluation of treatment outcomes or preservation of middle ear structures during surgery.",

Results The belly–tendon electrode derivation was associated with superior N1–P1 amplitudes compared to the infraorbital–chin electrode derivation. However, the large amplitude was also associated with greater variability compared to the infraorbital–chin derivation. There were no significant electrode derivation–based differences in N1 latency. Additionally, there was no predictable relationship between age and oVEMP amplitude.

    "abstract": "Purpose: Uncorrected hearing loss can result in detrimental sequelae. Research addressing clinical presentation and genetic testing would inform clinical decision making. Method: A retrospective chart review of 96 patients aged 1 month to 46 years (median age = 6 years) diagnosed with hearing loss or deafness and who underwent genetic testing at University of Rochester Medical Center from 2011 to 2021. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests examined the relationship between a diagnostic positive genetic test result and various characteristics of hearing loss, including congenital ( n = 52), noncongenital ( n = 34), prelingual ( n = 53), postlingual ( n = 33), progressive ( n = 13), not progressive ( n = 47), bilateral ( n = 67), unilateral ( n = 26), sensorineural ( n = 68), conductive ( n = 14), mixed ( n = 5), syndromic ( n = 10), and nonsyndromic ( n = 87) hearing loss. We also examined the number of patients with presence of developmental disabilities ( n = 35), having a first-degree relative with hearing loss ( n = 19), having hearing aids or cochlear implants ( n = 45), and having a multisystem presentation prior to diagnosis ( n = 45). Results: Patients with sensorineural hearing loss (44.1%) had significantly more diagnostic positive results than those with mixed (0%) or conductive hearing loss (21.4%), p = .004. However, significantly fewer patients with disabilities (19.4%) had diagnostic positive tests than those without disabilities (43.3%), p &lt; .05. More patients with a multisystem presentation were also found to have syndromic causes of hearing loss (23.3%) than patients who did not have a multisystem presentation, p &lt; .05. Conclusions: Our study suggests a significant association between sensorineural type of hearing loss and a diagnostic positive genetic test result, while the presence of disabilities was significantly associated with a nondiagnostic genetic test result. Knowledge of these findings is critical for understanding the cause of the hearing loss, identifying other associated symptoms, and determining risk to family members.",

Method: A cross-sectional study was carried out with a sample from noise-induced hearing loss reports (2007–2019). The dependent variable in this study was dizziness, and the independent variables were sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, symptoms, and noise characteristics in the work environment. Logistic regression analysis was performed. Results: A total of 3,824 individuals with noise-induced hearing loss in Brazil were analyzed. The prevalence of dizziness was 23.4% in the sample. Factors associated with dizziness were women (odds ratio [ OR ]: 2.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.64, 2.69]), hypertension ( OR : 1.68; 95% CI [1.38, 2.06]), headache ( OR : 6.31; 95% CI [5.26, 7.57]), tinnitus ( OR : 3.46; 95% CI [2.82, 4.25]), and continuous noise at the work environment ( OR : 1.54; 95% CI [1.22, 1.94]). Conclusions: The factors associated with the outcome—dizziness—were gender (female), systemic arterial hypertension, headache, tinnitus, and continuous exposure to workplace noise. Such findings demonstrate the importance of promoting a multifactorial approach to understanding dizziness among workers exposed to occupational noise.",

Corrections were validated, and a comparison of behavioral threshold estimates between systems was conducted to inform equipment transition and protocols in Ontario, Canada. Method: In Study 1, a retrospective file review was conducted. ABR threshold estimates from 84 infants with hearing loss were compared to behavioral thresholds to validate the accuracy of the ABR corrections applied in the Ontario Infant Hearing Program since 2016. Study 2 examined the precision of two different ABR systems to estimate thresholds in 37 adult and 105 infant ears. Results: Corrected ABR thresholds predicted behavioral thresholds in infants to within 1.77 dB (range of mean values across frequency: 1.18–2.26 dB) on average. The average differences decreased across frequency to 0.6 dB (range: 0.14 to −1.23) when ear canal acoustics were accounted for. The average between-system difference in ABR threshold estimates was 2.40 dB (range: 1.18–2.26). Conclusions: ABR correction factors used in Ontario's Infant Hearing Program provide accurate predictions of behavioral thresholds in infants with hearing loss. When calibration and collection parameters are similar between different ABR systems, threshold estimates are comparable and no further adjustment to correction factors was required.",

Method: Participants were 18 health care workers and PCAs whose clients were older adults. This was a randomized controlled study in which half of the participants were assigned to the experimental group ( n = 9) and the other half to a control group ( n = 9). The experimental group was administered a hearing aid training program that was developed in this study for health care workers and PCAs. Participants in the control group were trained on a task similar in complexity and administration time to the hearing aid training program. The Practical Hearing Aid Skills Test–Revised Version 2 (PHAST-Rv2) was administered before and immediately after training. A 2 × 2 mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the pre- and post-training scores between and within the experimental and control groups. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the differences between pre- and post-training scores on each of the administered PHAST-Rv2 tasks. In addition, participants were asked about their experience helping clients with their hearing aids. Results: Mean pre- and post-training PHAST-Rv2 scores for the experimental group were 59.50% and 95.84%, respectively, and 57.66% and 59.96%, respectively, for the control group. Results from a 2 × 2 mixed ANOVA with time point (pre- and post-training) as the within-subject variable and group (experimental and control) as the between-subject variable demonstrated that hearing aid training significantly improved PHAST-Rv2 scores for the experimental group. Post-training, the tasks that the experimental group improved on the most were brushing the microphone port, cleaning the dome, placing the hearing aids in the charger, and inserting the hearing aid into the model ear. No demographic variables were significantly correlated with the participants' improvement on the PHAST-Rv2 post-training score. Conclusion: A hearing aid training program designed specifically for health care workers was shown to be an efficient and effective way to improve how well health care workers can care for and operate a hearing aid.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Virtual service delivery models in audiology have become more accessible due to recent technological advancement and improved system-level uptake following COVID-19. Although current evidence identifies the benefits of virtual care to families with children who are d/Deaf or hard of hearing and supports its use in practice, this delivery model is still underutilized. This research aimed to gain consensus on an evidence-informed virtual caregiver participation framework developed from a scoping review of the communication sciences and disorders literature. Method: A two-round modified e-Delphi study was conducted to survey 26 knowledge users from four different countries with experience in virtual audiology care, including caregivers, audiologists, researchers, and organizational leaders. The study employed Delphi techniques, building from a scoping review to synthesize existing literature informing the knowledge gap, including online surveys and team discussions. Consensus was defined numerically (75% agreement) and by comparing and interpreting text-based responses. Results: The resulting framework grouped nine categories of caregiver participation in virtual care according to three main readiness domains: core readiness (opportunities to participate, perceived value, and willingness to participate), engagement readiness (child capacity, family–provider relationship, and role in the care process), and structural readiness (environment for participation, support, and technology). Conclusion: This work adds novel contributions to the field, through the development of a framework for caregiver participation in virtual audiology care, that can be used to support family involvement and will guide clinical tool development and future research efforts.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The current work sought to identify the optimal presentation levels for the NU-6 ordered-by-difficulty (OBD) abbreviated word lists. An optimal presentation level would yield a listener's highest word recognition score (WRS; known as phonetically balanced [PB] max) and allow the use of a shortened test protocol. A protocol based on the dB sensation level (dB SL) at 2000 Hz was used as a starting point. It is not known if these two commonly used time-saving approaches can be used in combination to obtain optimal results. Method: WRSs were obtained at multiple levels. The initial level was based on the hearing threshold at 2000 Hz and was either increased or decreased. For listeners with hearing loss, uncomfortable listening (UCL) levels were measured, and a word list was presented 5 dB below the UCL. Thirty-four adults with (25) and without (9) hearing loss, who were recruited via flyers and direct contact, participated in this study. A descriptive analysis was conducted to identify the level needed to obtain PB max using OBD word lists with the least number of words. Results: In most cases, the initial presentation level did not yield PB max and required more than 10 words. Conclusions: It is recommended that the presentation level for NU-6 OBD word lists be at least 30–40 dB SL relative to the hearing threshold at 2000 Hz with a minimum presentation level of 35 dB HL. If this is not feasible, the presentation of these words at UCL-5 is recommended.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The goal of this study was to provide evidence of the inherent variability associated with monitored live voice (MLV) presentation methods and encourage audiologists to more closely follow best practice of using recorded stimuli. To accomplish the goal, administration times for word recognition testing were compared between MLV and MP3 recorded stimuli presented directly from an audiometer (computer assisted, CA). Furthermore, the variability of administration time across testers was evaluated. Method: Fifty-word NU-6 lists were presented via MLV and CA to listeners with typical hearing (TH; defined as a four-frequency [500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz] pure-tone average [PTA] of 20 dB HL or better) and hearing loss (HL; defined as a four-frequency PTA poorer than 20 dB HL). Audiologists and doctor of audiology students administered the word lists. Administration times were compared between the two presentation methods (MLV and CA). Results: MLV administration time was significantly shorter than CA presentation time for both the TH and HL groups. There was also a significant difference in word recognition scores (WRS) between the TH and HL groups only when using the CA method. Most notably, there was significantly more variability in the administration time for MLV presentation across testers compared to the CA method. Data were compared to Mendel and Owen (2011), and MLV administration time was found to be significantly shorter than CA and compact disk (CD) administration time. Conclusions: Despite the shorter average administration time for MLV presentation compared to CA or CD, the significant variability in administration time among individual testers limits the clinical value of the test results. In addition, WRS for those with hearing loss were significantly poorer than those with TH when using CA but not for MLV, indicating that MLV is not sensitive to the presence of sensorineural hearing loss. Thus, using recorded word recognition is strongly recommended.",

Method: T1-weighted whole-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained from 17 Chinese-learning pediatric CI candidates (12 females and five males, age at MRI = 23.0 ± 15.0 months). Voxel-based morphometry was applied to examine the children's whole-brain structure. Machine learning was employed using neuroanatomical features to predict children's auditory skills up to 24 months after CI. The whole-brain neural model and auditory/visual cortex neural model were compared with a nonneural model using gender, age at CI activation, and preoperative residual hearing as predictors. Model performance was quantified using the mean square error ( MSE ) between predicted values and observations. Results: The model with preoperative neuroanatomical features showed a significantly smaller MSE than the nonneural model in predicting auditory skills in children with CIs. Specifically, the auditory-related area played an important role in predicting post-CI outcomes. Conclusions: The preoperative neuroanatomical features outperformed the nonneural features in predicting auditory skills in children with CIs. These results indicate that neural structure holds the potential to serve as an objective and effective feature for predicting post-CI outcomes.

    "abstract": "Hearing aid design to alleviate the noise problem has concentrated on improving the signal-to-noise ratio with the aid, using devices such as directional microphones, adaptive filters, and circuits that discriminate between steady-state noise and speech. The design approach discussed here is directed at improving the speech recognition of hearing-impaired listeners at a given signal-to-noise ratio, by restoring to their perception speech cues they no longer hear because of their impairment. This allows them to retain more of the redundant information in speech after masking has taken its toll, and empowers their ability to separate desired from undesired signals (what Broadbent calls \"selective listening\" in persons with normal hearing). Experimental results are presented.",

    "abstract": "Multimemory hearing aids have the potential to better serve individuals with hearing impairment, but the technology is new and operational issues need to be resolved before their full advantages can be realized. The current situation is that not all individuals with hearing impairment would benefit from a multimemory hearing aid and not all multimemory hearing aids have the same features for every individual with hearing impairment. In addition, appropriate memory assignment is crucial to a successful fit. In evaluating a listener for a multimemory hearing aid, one must consider the individual's communication needs and psychophysical skills, his or her acoustic environments, and his or her listening preference. An understanding of the available multimemory devices is necessary in order to select the one that meets these requirements. The initial determination of optimal electroacoustic characteristics for each memory is important, but the need to provide constant support and continued follow-up cannot be overemphasized.",

On average, the simple repetition request \"What did you say?\" was as effective as the statement \"I have a hearing loss, what did you say?\" However, the effect of the second statement was more consistent across talkers. In addition to increasing intensity, several talkers used additional strategies to enhance the reception of their message. The data suggest that use of repetition requests by persons with hearing loss is effective, and support the notion that informing the talker that hearing loss is present may be beneficial.",

Participants were asked to reproduce auditory sequences of verbal (syllables /ba/ and /da/) and nonverbal (1-kHz pure tone and a wideband noise) elements by pressing associated buttons.No evidence of a recency effect was found, but a primacy effect was observed in the participants' performance under most experimental conditions. Normal hearing participants in the 6-7-year-old group were better at reproducing 3 to 5 verbal items than their counterparts with hearing loss, independent of item sequence position.Results suggest that, regardless of hearing status, all children use similar mnemonic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Purpose From the Audiology Education Summit held in 2017, several working groups were formed to explore ideas about improving the quality and consistency in graduate education in audiology and externship training. The results are described here from one of the working groups formed to examine postgraduate specialization fellowships. Method Over the course of a year, the committee designed and implemented two surveys: one directed toward faculty and one toward students. The rationale for the survey and the results are presented. Comparisons between faculty and student responses are made for similar questions. Results Overall, the results demonstrate that the majority of both students and faculty believe that postgraduation specialization fellowships are needed for either 1 year or a flexible length. There was a consensus of opinion that the fellowship should be paid, as these would be designed for licensed audiologists. Most believed that the fellowships should be “governed by a professional organization (e.g., American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, American Academy of Audiology, American Doctors of Audiology, etc.),” or less so, a “separate body for this specific purpose.” Potential topics for specialization identified were the following: tinnitus, vestibular, cochlear implants, pediatrics, and intraoperative monitoring. The highest priority attributes for a specialization site were “abundant access to patient populations,” “staff of clinical experts,” and “active research.” The weight put toward these attributes differed between faculty and students with faculty prioritizing “university/academic centers,” and “access to academic coursework in the fellowship area.” The faculty rated “caseload diversity,” “minimum hours,” “research,” and “academic affiliation” as requirements for a fellowship site, with less weight for “coursework” and “other.” Finally, the students valued “improved personal ability to provide exceptional patient care,” “the potential for increased job opportunities,” and the “potential for a higher salary” as benefits most important to them, with lower ratings for “recognition as a subject matter expert” or “potential pathway to Ph.D. program.” Conclusions As a result of the survey, further exploration of a postgraduate specialization fellowship is warranted, especially to determine funding opportunities to offset cost for the sites and to ensure that fellows are paid adequately.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of file compression on clinically measured word recognition scores obtained using the Northwestern University Test Number Six (NU-6; Auditec recording) materials.Participants were 86 adults (N = 170 ears; Mage = 65.5). The 25 most difficult words from each of four NU-6 test lists were used to measure word recognition. Two lists were compressed using a freely available Advanced Audio Coding compression algorithm and two were not. Word recognition was measured in each ear using one compressed file and one uncompressed file. Percent correct scores were calculated in each test condition and log transformed for analyses. Clinically meaningful differences between uncompressed and compressed scores were examined using 95% critical difference ranges. The effects of file compression on word recognition scores were examined in the context of multiple potential confounding effects, including age and degree of hearing loss, using linear mixed-effects models (LMMs).Differences between compressed and uncompressed scores in a given ear exceeded the 95% critical difference range in about 7% of cases, approximating the 5% of expected cases occurring due to chance. Likewise, LMM results revealed no significant effect of file compression on clinically measured NU-6 word recognition scores and no significant interactions between compression effects and age or degree of hearing loss.While the original uncompressed audio files are clearly the most appropriate stimuli for clinical purposes, our study results suggest that file compression, even at an aggressive 64 kilobits per second, does not have a statistically significant, or clinically meaningful, effect on word recognition scores when measured using these Auditec materials.",

Preceptors and newly graduated clinicians were recruited in 2019 for a study prior to COVID-19, and students and preceptors were recruited for comparison during COVID-19. Four groups participated in this study: (a) 101 students who were enrolled in the second, third, or fourth year of an Israeli communication disorders Bachelor of Arts (BA) program during the pandemic; (b) 94 newly graduated audiologists with a BA degree from an Israeli communication disorders program granted in the last 3 years (before COVID-19); (c) 18 audiologist preceptors who supervised audiology practicum in an Israeli communication disorders BA programs (before COVID-19); and (d) 20 audiologist preceptors who, during COVID-19, were supervising an audiology practicum in Israel. Perceptions of the various groups were compared.Although perceptions of preceptors and students regarding the practicum were revealed to be similar, perceptions of the practicum before COVID-19 underwent changes in the course of the pandemic. In evaluating the COVID-19 experience, both preceptors and students agreed that more hours of practicum were needed, as well as more variety in types of cases and exposure to varied placements.Academic programs and employers should consider implications of changes implemented in the practicum due to COVID-19, which can be addressed either in continuing education and/or by additional supervision in the future workplace.https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.19855639.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Speech recognition in noise is a ubiquitous problem in older listeners. Speech, the most commonly encountered noise in the real world, causes greater masking than noise maskers, a phenomenon called informational masking (IM). This is due to the lexical-semantic and/or acoustic-phonetic information present in speech maskers. In this study, we aimed to observe the age-related differences in speech recognition and the magnitudes of IM when the maskers varied in the type of linguistic information. Method: In 30 young and 30 older individuals, we measured the signal-to-noise ratio required to obtain 50% correct identification under four-talker babble (lexical-semantic and acoustic-phonetic information), four-talker reverse babble (predominantly acoustic-phonetic information), and speech-shaped noise (SSN; energetic). Results: In both groups, the four-talker babble caused the greatest masking effect (worst performances), whereas the SSN resulted in the least masking effect (best performances). The effectiveness of IM due to the lexical-semantic information was comparable between the two groups. However, the effectiveness of IM due to the acoustic-phonetic information was significantly higher in the older listeners, causing worse performances. Conclusions: The greater effectiveness of IM due to the acoustic-phonetic information (worse performance) could be due to the minimal-to-mild high-frequency hearing loss and the consequent temporal processing deficits observed in the older listeners. However, it is possible that the older listeners can employ compensatory mechanisms (such as life experiences, contextual cues, employing higher listening efforts, among many possible other mechanisms) to overcome some of these deficits.

    "abstract": "Purpose: This systematic review aimed to update and explore the extant literature (2011–2020) regarding ethics knowledge in audiology and to compare the findings to an earlier study (2001–2010). Method: This systematic review employed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Results: MEDLINE, CINAHL, ERIC, MasterFILE Premier, E-Journals, Africa-Wide information and Academic Search Premier electronic databases, and non–peer-reviewed papers in Seminars in Hearing yielded a total of 63 papers. Following systematic screening using inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 12 full-text papers were included in this review. Pertinent data and findings from the review were tabulated and analyzed using a qualitative, deductive approach. Results showed that the 12 papers were published in nine peer-reviewed journals with a predominantly social scientific approach. This differs from the earlier review that reported only five papers with a predominantly philosophical approach. However, both the current and earlier studies focused on the rehabilitation/management role of the audiologist. In the earlier study, the focus was on moral judgment (as one of the components of moral behavior), whereas this was the focus of only half of the papers identified in this study, with the remaining papers focusing on moral sensitivity and moral motivation. Conclusions: The focus of papers had evolved and continued to include more elements related to the multiple perspectives used to analyze and describe ethics research. The body of knowledge of ethics in audiology specifically expanded in the area of social scientific research, focusing on beneficence and nonmaleficence, including moral motivation and basing research on moral judgment with the emphasis on the rehabilitation/management and education/research/administration role of audiologists.",

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine audiologists' ART protocols, factors influencing audiologists' decision to test, and considerations for mentoring Doctor of Audiology (AuD) students in ART testing.This study used a paper survey distributed by mail to a random sample of audiologists. Participants were 102 audiologists, representing diversity across age, clinical experience, and work setting. The survey asked participants to provide (a) demographics, (b) ART protocols, (c) rationale for ART testing, and (d) perspectives on mentoring of ART testing.When ART testing is conducted, 100% of respondents conduct ipsilateral ART testing, compared to 75% for contralateral testing. Most use 500-, 1000-, and 2000-Hz stimulus frequencies, and 56% report 4000 Hz. Patient-related factors are the primary reason participants cite for conducting, or not conducting, ART tests. Most supervisor-participants encourage AuD students to conduct ART tests, based on patient-centered and student learning-centered reasons, and use a variety of strategies to guide students when ART findings are unusual.Fewer than half (43%) of participants conduct ART testing for all new patients, suggesting it is ancillary to the standard test battery for most participants. When ART testing is conducted, ipsilateral testing only or a combination of ipsilateral and contralateral testing is used. Ongoing trends in ART testing include continued popularity of 500-2000 Hz and ipsilateral-only or ipsilateral plus contralateral testing.https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.21513987.",

Participants were also tested with an English word list-List 1A of the Northwestern University Auditory Test No. 6. Participants' correct pronunciation of each word was scored. A nonparametric Mann-Whitney U Location Difference Test for Equivalence using two one-sided tests equivalence hypothesis: -0.02 < [(List_1) - (List_2)] < 0.02 was conducted to assess equivalence among all four Hmong and the English lists.Seventy Hmong speakers participated in this study (35 women, 35 men; Mage = 29.5 years, SD = 7.1). In all four Hmong lists, 93.5% (187/200) words met the validation criteria for ≥ 92% correct pronunciation. The 13 difficult words were deemed adequate by a Hmong panel and, therefore, were included to maintain four unique, balanced word lists. The test revealed that the Hmong and English word lists were considered equivalent at the 2% bound.The four Hmong word lists were validated to ensure an equal range of word difficulty across the lists.",

The study sample comprised two groups, namely, parents/family members of children with CIs (study group, n = 70, Mage = 44.6 ± 12.4 years) and parents/family members of children with normal hearing (control group, n = 58, Mage = 43.8 ± 11.5 years). Parents/family members completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), and the Family Perspective Profile form, as well as the Demographic Information form.The PSS scores of the study group were higher than those of the control group (p = .001). However, there was no statistically significant difference between groups in the CAS scores (p = .896). According to the Family Perspective Profile form, almost half of the parents/family members of children with CIs reported that their children experienced difficulties in education and hearing health care services during the pandemic and showed some changes in their attitudes and behaviors.During the pandemic, the stress levels of parents/family members of children with CIs were higher than parents/family members of children with normal hearing. In addition to the challenges posed by the pandemic, the difficulties that parents/family members of children with CIs experience in meeting their children's additional needs related to accessing education and hearing health care services may have contributed to increased stress levels.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is commonly used to produce telephone captions to provide telecommunication access for individuals who are d/Deaf and hard of hearing (DHH). However, little is known about the effects of degraded telephone audio on the intelligibility of ASR captioning. This research note investigates the accuracy of telephone captions produced by ASR under degraded audio conditions. Method: Packet loss, delay, and repetition are common sources of degradation in sound quality for telephone audio. Eleven sets of wideband filtered sentences were degraded by high and low levels of simulated packet loss, delay, and repetition. These sets, along with a clean set of sentences, were submitted to ASR, and the accuracy of the resulting output was evaluated using three metrics: a word recognition score, word error rate, and word information loss. Results: The resulting pattern of data indicated the relative impact of each degraded condition on message intelligibility. The high and low packet loss conditions had the largest effect on message intelligibility. This finding was interpreted to indicate that packet loss can have a substantial impact on the accuracy of telephone captions produced with ASR. Conclusions: The results of this investigation point to a potential area of improvement in service quality that could have a substantial impact on telecommunication services for consumers who are DHH. Further research in this area is needed to provide additional information concerning the scope and impact of packet loss on the accuracy of telephone captioning produced by ASR.

    "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the auditory performance and speech perception of 104 children with isolated large vestibular aqueduct syndrome (LVAS) and 523 children with no inner ear malformation (IEM) for 5 years after cochlear implantation, in order to explore whether isolated LVAS can affect the long-term hearing and speech rehabilitation of deaf children after cochlear implantation. Method: A cohort study was established consisting of 627 children who underwent cochlear implantation at Beijing Tongren Hospital from 1999 to 2016. The children were examined at 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months after cochlear implantation to assess their auditory performance and speech perception using the Categories of Auditory Performance (CAP) and Speech Intelligibility Rating (SIR) questionnaires. Results: The CAP scores of the isolated LVAS group increased significantly during the baseline to the 24th month, after which they gradually rose until reaching the plateau during the 24th to the 60th month. The CAP scores of the non-IEM group increased significantly during the baseline to the 36th month and then increased steadily. The SIR scores went up significantly during the baseline to the 48th month, and increased in a gradual manner in other stages of isolated LVAS evaluation. In comparison, The SIR scores of non-IEM group grew remarkably from the baseline to the 60th month. There were no significant differences in the CAP or SIR scores between isolated LVAS and non-IEM groups in each stage of evaluation, with the only exception being the CAP score at baseline month after cochlear implantation. Conclusions: The CAP and SIR questionnaires are helpful tools for quantifying the early hearing and speech skills of younger prelingually deafened cochlear implant recipients. This long-term follow-up study shows that the speech and hearing development of children in isolated LVAS and non-IEM groups follow similar patterns, and isolated LVAS does not affect the long-term rehabilitation of deaf children after cochlear implantation.",

Method: A total of 20 participants with normal hearing and cognition participated in the study. Participants' speech perception performance was measured in two sessions: one over a Zoom call and one in person in the laboratory. Speech perception was measured using Quick Speech-in-Noise Test, Bamford–Kowal–Bench Speech-in-Noise Test, and Words-in-Noise Test. Results: Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences between speech perception scores obtained over the Zoom and in-person methodologies for any of the tests. Additionally, our study found no significant difference in the scores obtained between wired and wireless headphones during Zoom calls. Conclusion: These results suggest that Zoom can be used as a reliable method to measure speech perception in young individuals with normal hearing using these three tests in situations where conventional methods cannot be utilized.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of the present review was to report the effectiveness of Epley maneuver compared to other manual repositioning maneuvers (RM) for treatment of posterior benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (P-BPPV). A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library was conducted up until June 30, 2023. RESULTS: Primary outcomes focused on complete resolution of vertiginous symptoms measured by either a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) or the Dix-Hallpike (DH) test. Secondary outcomes included conversion of a positive DH test to a negative DH test exclusively looking at positional nystagmus and assessment of side effects (cervical/back pain, posttreatment dizziness, and nausea). Both outcomes were assessed within a maximum of 4-week follow-up. Following systematic search and review, nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs; p = .413) were found. The studies reported on the effectiveness of the Epley maneuver compared to three other specific RM: Semont, Li, and Gans maneuvers. Results revealed a low to very low certainty of evidence. With the primary outcomes, Epley maneuver was superior to Gans maneuver 24-hr posttreatment but not after 1 week. No significant differences were found between the remaining maneuvers. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, evidence of low to very low certainty indicates that Epley maneuver is comparable with Semont, Gans, and Li maneuvers for vertiginous symptoms in patients with P-BPPV. Further high-quality studies are needed.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: While general practice parameter recommendations for children with unilateral hearing loss or single-sided deafness (SSD) have been published, clinically utilized subjective instruments specifically designed to assess this population are scarce. Treatment options are evaluated using audiometric data, speech perception data, and quality of life instruments. The Unilateral Hearing Loss in Youth (uniHELO) is a subjective assessment instrument that aims to evaluate the listening challenges in this population, but it has not yet been studied in a clinical setting. This study examined the reliability of the uniHELO among children with SSD. Method: This was a prospective within-subject study. Nine patients with SSD, aged 8–14 years, were enrolled. Participants had not used a personal hearing device for at least 6 months prior to enrollment. The uniHELO instrument was administered at two clinic visits separated by 3–4 weeks. For comparison, the Pediatric and Parent Speech, Spatial, and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ) instruments were administered during the same visits. Results: uniHELO scores were not significantly different between the first and second visits. The correlations of scale scores over time were: .96 for the uniHELO, which suggests excellent test–retest reliability; .84 for the Parent SSQ, which also suggests excellent test–retest reliability; and .27 for the Pediatric SSQ, which suggests poor test–retest reliability compared to the Parent SSQ and uniHELO. Conclusions: Within-subject scale uniHELO scores between clinic visits showed excellent test–retest reliability across items. The test–retest reliability scores for the uniHELO were also stronger than those for the Parent and Pediatric SSQ. These data support the use of the uniHELO to evaluate listening challenges in children with SSD.",

Here, we assess relationships among the presence of hyperacusis, audiometric profiles, and nonauditory factors in a pediatric clinical population. Method: A retrospective review of clinical records from 329 children, ages 2–17 years, was performed to assess the prevalence of hyperacusis and correlations among hearing status, behavioral or communication concerns, and the presence of hyperacusis. Results: In 329 study participants, 18% reported hyperacusis (58% male and 42% female). No significant sex or age differences were found. Hyperacusis was more likely to occur alongside normal hearing or with unilateral hearing loss relative to bilateral hearing loss. Among children with hyperacusis, there was a high prevalence of audiovestibular problems, mental health concerns, speech and language delays, difficulty in school, and behavioral problems. Tinnitus was also found to be comorbid with hyperacusis, but the comorbidity was less than that reported in adults. Conclusions: This study identified common hearing profiles and critical comorbidities in a large clinical cohort of children with hyperacusis. These results demonstrate the urgent need for standardized multidisciplinary assessment and treatment protocols for pediatric hyperacusis.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: For patients with single-sided deafness (SSD), choosing between bone conduction devices (BCDs) and contralateral routing of signal hearing aids (CROS) is challenging due to mixed evidence on their benefits. The lack of clear guidelines complicates clinical decision making. This study explores whether realistic spatial listening measures can reveal a clinically valid benefit and if the optimal choice varies among patients. By assessing listening effort through objective and subjective measures, this research evaluates the efficacy of BCD and CROS, seeking to provide evidence-based recommendation anchored in the effectiveness of these devices in real-world scenarios. Method: Thirteen participants with SSD performed the Hearing-in-Noise Test while using a BCD, CROS hearing aids, and no hearing device (unaided). Subjective listening effort was assessed using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) questionnaire after each testing block. An objective measurement of listening effort was obtained by measuring the peak pupil dilation (PPD) during the task using eye tracking glasses. Results: No significant difference of either PPD or NASA-TLX scores was observed between the three device conditions (BCD, CROS, and unaided). However, a trend is noted toward reduced PPD in the BCD and CROS conditions. The lack of significance in pupillometry results does not stem from technical issues, as the study's findings confirm its effectiveness in measuring task difficulty, and validate its use for assessing listening effort. Conclusions: Although the results from the present study cannot significantly differentiate the hearing devices, we observe a trend that points toward reduced listening effort when using hearing devices. Future investigations should aim to optimize metrics of listening effort, perhaps making them clinically useful on an individual level.",

A willingness-to-pay (WTP) approach was used to determine benefits and value of prescription advanced digital technology (ADT) hearing aids, over-the-counter (OTC) hearing devices, and rehabilitative services using benefit–cost analyses. Method: This study was a cross-sectional survey with chart review of hearing aid users at two independent audiology practices. Seventy hearing aid users (response rate: 15.6%) provided their WTP for ADT prescription hearing aids, OTC hearing devices, and hearing rehabilitative services. Benefit–cost ratios and net social benefit were calculated using deterministic and exploratory approaches. Point estimates for benefit–cost ratios and net social benefit were derived using bootstrap sampling with replacement ( N = 5,000). Results: Median WTP for ADT prescription hearing aids and rehabilitative services were $2,000 and $250, respectively. WTP was lowest for OTC devices ( Mdn = $0; maximum = $500). Benefit–cost ratios and net social benefit for ADT prescription hearing aids, OTC devices, and hearing rehabilitative services favored these interventions when out-of-pocket costs remained low. Benefit–cost analyses also produced results favoring prescription ADT hearing aid intervention with costs as high as $1,530 per device. Conclusions: WTP results indicated that all interventions under study have a measurable consumer-perceived benefit. Results of benefit–cost analyses favored the interventions but only when costs were lower than market prices. The benefit–cost analysis results for hearing care services underscore their value when provided as part of a comprehensive rehabilitative plan that may inform future health policy changes.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study aimed to verify the diagnostic value of tympanometry with 226- and 1000-Hz probe tones in infants by comparing tympanometry results with the gold standard of the middle ear state assessed by myringotomy. Furthermore, clinically useful predictors for false peaked tympanograms despite the presence of middle ear fluid should be identified. Method: Pre-operative 226- and 1000-Hz tympanograms were retrospectively compared with intraoperative findings of the tympanic cavity after myringotomy in 111 infants (217 ears) aged ≤ 12 months. In addition to the shape of tympanograms, demographic and clinical characteristics, the results of other audiometric measurements, and the viscosity of middle ear fluid, if present, were evaluated in several subgroups. Results: The sensitivity and specificity of 1000-Hz tympanometry for middle ear effusion (MEE) detection were 97%–98% and 71%–84%, respectively, whereas standard tympanometry with a 226-Hz probe tone achieved a poor sensitivity of 43%–61% and a specificity of 81%–97%. Younger age, low viscosity of the middle ear fluid, and female sex were associated with an increased risk of false peaked 226-Hz tympanograms despite MEE. Furthermore, larger equivalent outer ear canal volumes were linked to false peaked 226-Hz tympanograms. Conclusions: The comparison of myringotomy findings and 226- and 1000-Hz tympanometry confirms the superiority of high-frequency tympanometry in infants younger than 12 months. Although this study identified some vague predictors of potentially false peaked 226-Hz tympanograms, the assessment of the middle ear state by 226-Hz tympanometry remains unreliable in young infants.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: In 2021, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and Department of Defense (DOD) Tinnitus Working Group conducted a survey of DOD and VHA clinicians to evaluate clinical services provided for tinnitus. Method: The online survey included a mix of multiple-choice and open-ended questions. Respondents included VHA and DOD health care providers in audiology, otolaryngology, mental health, and primary care, as well as DOD hearing conservation technicians. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to analyze the data. Results: A total of 669 providers responded to this combined survey. Results indicated that compared to DOD and VHA providers in other fields, audiologists tended to be more confident and more aware of their role in tinnitus management. In terms of confidence and scope of practice, DOD mental health care providers were the group least familiar with tinnitus care. Other results explored herein include barriers to tinnitus care, facilitators for progressive tinnitus management programs, interventions and patient materials offered, new patient materials wanted, and respondents' preferred information sources and training methods. Conclusion: Survey results indicated that more directed education and support are needed to increase DOD and VHA clinicians' awareness of the need for tinnitus services and their roles in providing that care.

Additionally, this study compared the vOCR results with other otolith function measures: cVEMP, oVEMP, and SVV. Method: This was a cross-sectional, between-group prospective study that compared otolith function tests between noise exposure groups. Thirty-three adults between the ages of 40–60 years with no middle ear pathology, history of balance disorder, neurologic pathology, systemic diseases, or receiving ototoxic medications were included in the study. Group 1 included 17 adults (34 ears) with low-risk noise exposure, and Group 2 included 16 adults (32 ears) with high-risk noise exposure. Independent samples t tests were used to assess group mean differences for dependent variables. The independent variable was group with two levels (low risk and high risk). The dependent variables were Noise Exposure Structured Interview (NESI) score, vOCR torsion, cVEMP amplitude, oVEMP amplitude, and SVV angle. Additional analyses were completed using Pearson correlation to evaluate the relationship of vOCR to the other otolith function tests and NESI score to the otolith function tests. Results: The results indicated significantly decreased vOCR torsion, cVEMP amplitude, and oVEMP amplitude in individuals with high-risk noise exposure compared with those in the low-risk group. Significant correlations were found for NESI scores as well as vOCR and oVEMP measures. Conclusions: This study describes the concomitant degeneration of the auditory and vestibular systems from noise exposure affecting otolith function, as measured by audiologic testing and otolith testing. vOCR appears to be sensitive to this degeneration, indicating that vOCR could be used as a vestibular screening measure for patients with noise exposure and/or suspected utricle dysfunction.",

This was done to investigate the effect of aging on these skills despite exhibiting near-normal peripheral hearing in low frequencies and normal cognitive skills. Method: Twenty-five young adults (18 to 35 years) and 35 older adults (56 to 79 years) were recruited for the study. They were screened for near-normal hearing thresholds (up to 2000 Hz) as well as cognition, and written informed consent was obtained. A battery of auditory processing and working memory tests were administered to the participants. The responses obtained were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test. Principal component analysis (PCA) was also carried out to examine any relationship between the various auditory processes and the cognitive skills. Results: The young adults had superior performance compared to older adults on most of the tasks. PCA revealed the influence of working memory on performance in most tests of auditory processing in young adults and to a lesser extent in older adults. Conclusions: This study aimed to assess and compare the auditory processing and working memory skills of young and older adults with normal hearing and cognition. Overall, young adults demonstrated superior performance compared to older adults across the tasks. The results of PCA indicated that the young adults utilized their cognitive resources better for auditory processing compared to the older adults. These findings suggest a need for tailored interventions targeting both auditory processing and working memory, especially among older adults, and highlight the importance of considering age-related differences in these cognitive processes when interpreting auditory processing assessments.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Although burnout among audiologists has been studied in various countries, there is no research yet that examines this issue in Türkiye, where working conditions and sociodemographic factors may differ from those in other countries. Considering the unique working conditions and sociodemographic factors, this study aimed to investigate the burnout levels of Turkish audiologists. Additionally, this study will explore the impact of various sociodemographic variables on burnout, work-related quality of life, and depression to gain a deeper understanding of the specific challenges faced by audiologists in Türkiye. Method: A total of 193 audiologists, with a median age of 27 (interquartile range: 25–29) years, working in different working areas, such as clinical practice, academic institutions, rehabilitation centers, and amplification services in Türkiye, were included. Audiologists were invited to participate in this study via several online forums and hospital notice boards. All participants completed the sociodemographic data form and then the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), Work-Related Quality of Life Scale (WRQoL), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Results: Differences between MBI, WRQoL, and BDI scores were analyzed according to gender, level of education, area of work, and title of audiologist. There are significant differences in the subscale scores of the MBI and WRQoL scales and in the BDI scores between groups according to gender, education, and area of work. There are also significant differences in BDI scores according to title. There is a significant correlation between the MBI, WRQoL, and BDI scores of audiologists. Conclusions: This study represents the initial exploration of burnout, quality of work life, and depression levels among audiologists employed in Türkiye. A low quality of work life can increase the risk of burnout and depression. Enhancements in the work environment can lessen burnout and depression while also improving employees' general quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have clearly demonstrated that diseases such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B (HBV), herpes simplex, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), as well as others, are on the increase. Because of this factor, and because of expanded scope of practice and increased awareness, there is growing general concern and interest among audiologists about infectious diseases and their control and prevention. In addition, audiologists are in need of specific measures to prevent disease transmission to themselves, their patients, and others, such as their families. This tutorial is intended to assist audiologists in recognizing the importance of disease control and prevention (contracting and/or spreading diseases) in their practice. Procedures to help prevent disease transmission in audiology practice are provided.",

A mono condition with no decrements was used as a control. Eight participants with normal hearing and 8 participants with hearing impairment took part in this experiment.Performance improved in the presence of decrements for both groups and was equivalent for both high- or low-frequency decrements. Comparison with individually measured auditory filters revealed that participants with normal hearing made use of energy cues available within these filters, whereas some participants with hearing impairment, despite improved increment detection, underutilized this information.Inclusion of a single, adjacent, high- or low-frequency decrement improved increment detection but not to the same extent as when decrements flanked both sides.",

The authors sought to identify variables that affect doctor of audiology (AuD) students’ decisions to enter IP or another practice setting.The authors sent a survey link electronically to 1,430 members of the Student Academy of Audiology; 300 returned completed surveys.Nearly 24% of AuD student participants plan to choose IP immediately upon graduation. Men were more likely than women to choose IP as were those who had an IP rotation and were in the 3rd or 4th year of their AuD program. Important predictors included the survey items “job satisfaction among IP practitioners” and “attractiveness of other specialties”; the “patient contact” perception factor; the “overall job satisfaction” influence factor; and the student age (over 30) demographic variable.It appears likely that audiology IP rates will remain steady at levels that lag behind the IP rates of other doctoring professions. The authors report some of the variables that appear to have driven current AuD students’ career setting choices regarding IP.",

In childhood, the same persons (N = 2,024) underwent audiometry in a school investigation (at ages 7, 10, and 13 years), in which 129 were diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss (binaural pure-tone average 0.5-4 kHz ≥ 20 dB HL), whereas 1,895 had normal hearing thresholds.Hearing handicap was measured in adulthood as the sum-score of various speech perception and social impairment items (15 items). The sum-score increased with adult hearing threshold level (p < .001). After adjustment for adult hearing threshold level, hearing aid use, adult age, sex, and socioeconomic status, there was no significant difference in hearing handicap sum-score between the group with childhood-onset hearing loss (n = 129) and the group with adult-onset hearing loss (n = 1,895; p = .882).Self-reported hearing handicap in adults increased with hearing threshold level.

The methodology used involved a close reading of the concerns expressed by Iliadou et al. in view of the central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) literature and the stated purpose of my original article (DeBonis, 2015). The literature used included clinical practice guidelines, respected journals, and recognized authorities on the topic. Many of the objections stated by Iliadou et al. are not well founded (e.g., ICD-10, use of ASHA definition, effect of auditory intervention, lack of research for the model, bias of the article), but their statement that a complete hearing assessment is necessary for students with listening difficulties is an important one that I endorse completely. In conclusion, my original article remains an effective vehicle for discussion about the value of current tests of auditory processing and how to better help students who have listening difficulties.",

    "abstract": "Purpose This study aimed to report an unusual case of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), who showed prolonged positional downbeat nystagmus without latency and was diagnosed with cupulolithiasis of the anterior canal (AC). We compared this case with one of typical AC-BPPV, and possible mechanisms underlying the atypical characteristics were discussed. Method Two patients diagnosed with AC-BPPV were reported. Positional testing using video-oculography goggles was performed, and outcomes were measured via medical records and analysis of videos of the nystagmus. Results Downbeat nystagmus was observed in the contralateral Dix–Hallpike test in both cases. The torsional component was subtle or absent, but motion was induced toward the affected ear. The two cases differed in latency and duration of vertigo, as well as habituation. The patient with atypical nystagmus showed little or no latency and longer duration. Moreover, there was no habituation on repeated tests. The nystagmus showed several differences from that of typical AC-BPPV. Conclusions Based on our case, AC-BPPV may induce various unusual clinical manifestations of nystagmus. Accurate diagnosis requires careful consideration of the patient's symptoms and the characteristics of the nystagmus. Supplemental Material https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.14265356",

    "abstract": "Purpose The current study aimed to compare the specificity of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) in isolation and in combination, with varying pass/refer criteria for DPOAE technology. Method A longitudinal, repeated-measures design was employed. The current study sample comprised 91 of the initial 325 participants who returned for the repeat screening and diagnostic audiological assessment within a risk-based newborn hearing screening program. Results TEOAE screening had the highest specificity in comparison to DPOAE screening at the initial and repeat screening, irrespective of differences in DPOAE pass/refer criteria. DPOAE screening had a slightly higher specificity, with a three out of six rather than the four out of six frequency pass criteria. Conclusions Pass/refer criteria alone do not influence referral rates and specificity. Instead, consideration of other factors in combination with these criteria is important. More research is required in terms of the sensitivity and specificity of OAE screening technology using repeated-measures and diagnostic audiological evaluation as the gold standard.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The aim of the study was to evaluate the relationship between the Screening Checklist for Auditory Processing in Adults and the performance of older adults on a battery of diagnostic tests for auditory processing. This was done for two versions of the checklist, one answered by older individuals at risk for auditory processing disorder (APD) and the other by the family of the older adults. Method Forty-nine older adults and 34 of their family members were initially tested with the screening checklist, each being tested with the version developed for them. Approximately half of the older adults had normal pure-tone thresholds, while the others had mild–moderate hearing loss above 2 kHz. The older adults were administered tests of auditory separation/closure, auditory integration, temporal resolution, temporal patterning, and auditory memory and sequencing. Results Most of the older adults and their family members reported of the presence of auditory processing difficulties on the screening checklist. On the diagnostic test battery, many of the older adults, irrespective of their high-frequency hearing sensitivity, failed the tests measuring temporal resolution and auditory integration. The sensitivity and specificity of the checklist answered by the older individuals were 69.05% and 71.43%, respectively. On the other hand, for the checklist answered by the family members, it was 77.78% and 33.33%, respectively. The test–retest reliability of the two versions of the checklist was found to be good. Conclusions As the specificity of the checklist answered by the family members was considerably lower than that answered by the older adults, the use of the version for the latter group is recommended. However, the checklist answered by the caregivers could be used to complement information obtained from the older adults at risk for APD when the older adults are unable to give valid responses.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) is associated with impaired hearing. However, the evidence is less clear if DM2 can lead to difficulty understanding speech in complex acoustic environments, independently of age and hearing loss effects. The purpose of this study was to estimate the magnitude of DM2-related effects on speech understanding in the presence of competing speech after adjusting for age and hearing.A cross-sectional study design was used to investigate the relationship between DM2 and speech understanding in 190 Veterans (Mage = 47 years, range: 25-76). Participants were classified as having no diabetes (n = 74), prediabetes (n = 19), or DM2 that was well controlled (n = 24) or poorly controlled (n = 73). A test of spatial release from masking (SRM) was presented in a virtual acoustical simulation over insert earphones with multiple talkers using sentences from the coordinate response measure corpus to determine the target-to-masker ratio (TMR) required for 50% correct identification of target speech. A linear mixed model of the TMR results was used to estimate SRM and separate effects of diabetes group, age, and low-frequency pure-tone average (PTA-low) and high-frequency pure-tone average. A separate model estimated the effects of DM2 on PTA-low.After adjusting for hearing and age, diabetes-related effects remained among those whose DM2 was well controlled, showing an SRM loss of approximately 0.5 dB. Results also showed effects of hearing loss and age, consistent with the literature on people without DM2. Low-frequency hearing loss was greater among those with DM2.In a large cohort of Veterans, low-frequency hearing loss and older age negatively impact speech understanding. Compared with nondiabetics, individuals with controlled DM2 have additional auditory deficits beyond those associated with hearing loss or aging. These results provide a potential explanation for why individuals who have diabetes and/or are older often report difficulty understanding speech in real-world listening environments.https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.16746475.",

Cognitive and affective indices of IB also predicted QOL. Those participants with elevated emotional distress and, to a lesser extent, exaggerated concerns for their health, were found to have both lower SE and poorer QOL.Attempts to replicate these findings longitudinally and with larger and more diverse samples (e.g., congenital or illness-derived hearing loss) are encouraged. A more objective assessment of hearing loss may also reduce the potential for spurious associations that may arise from the use of self-reported data. Nevertheless, the analytical results provide encouragement for the continued consideration of IB in the evaluation of the well-being of individuals with hearing loss. It is proposed that IB could be a useful supplement to the study of motivation among this cohort, such as an addition to the commonly used Health Belief Model, to improve the predictive validity of appropriate health behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal sensory integration in audiovisual (AV) speech perception is a naturally occurring phenomenon. Modality-specific responses such as auditory left, auditory right, and visual responses to dichotic incongruent AV speech stimuli help in understanding AV speech processing through each input modality. It is observed that distribution of activity in the frontal motor areas involved in speech production has been shown to correlate with how subjects perceive the same syllable differently or perceive different syllables. This study investigated the distribution of modality-specific responses to dichotic incongruent AV speech stimuli by simultaneously presenting consonant-vowel (CV) syllables with different places of articulation to the participant's left and right ears and visually.A dichotic experimental design was adopted. Six stop CV syllables /pa/, /ta/, /ka/, /ba/, /da/, and /ga/ were assembled to create dichotic incongruent AV speech material. Participants included 40 native speakers of Norwegian (20 women, Mage = 22.6 years, SD = 2.43 years; 20 men, Mage = 23.7 years, SD = 2.08 years).Findings of this study showed that, under dichotic listening conditions, velar CV syllables resulted in the highest scores in the respective ears, and this might be explained by stimulus dominance of velar consonants, as shown in previous studies. However, this study, with dichotic auditory stimuli accompanied by an incongruent video segment, demonstrated that the presentation of a visually distinct video segment possibly draws attention to the video segment in some participants, thereby reducing the overall recognition of the dominant syllable. Furthermore, the findings here suggest the possibility of lesser response times to incongruent AV stimuli in females compared with males.The identification of the left audio, right audio, and visual segments in dichotic incongruent AV stimuli depends on place of articulation, stimulus dominance, and voice onset time of the CV syllables.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Pulsed and warbled tones are suitable substitutions for pure tones in hearing threshold measurement according to the 2005 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association guidelines. These guidelines also recommend measuring thresholds at 3000 and 6000 Hz. To date, there is no research directly supporting substitution of pulsed or warbled tones for pure tones at 3000 and 6000 Hz for listeners with normal hearing or with hearing loss. This study compared pure-, pulsed, and warbled tone thresholds at 3000 and 6000 Hz. Method Forty-seven adults with normal hearing and 16 adults with sensorineural hearing loss participated in this study. Air-conduction thresholds were elicited with pure tones at octave intervals from 250 to 8000 Hz and with pure-, pulsed, and warbled tone stimuli at 3000 and 6000 Hz. Results Small mean differences in thresholds were obtained using each of the 3 stimulus types for both listeners with normal hearing and hearing loss. Some of the mean differences tested were found to be statistically significant. The differences were nevertheless small and in all cases within the clinically accepted 5-dB step size. Conclusion Although substitutions did not violate the 5-dB step size, the slope of a listener’s hearing loss may be a factor in the inaccuracy of measurement during the substitution of warbled tones for pure tones.",

Zamenhof was especially interested in the education of deaf children and the therapy necessary to facilitate their integration into society. His significant achievements were a phonetic method of therapy for the hearing impaired and an automatic device for ear insufflation that was considered indispensable in the management of pyorrhea. In addition, Zamenhof initiated various forms of social support among physicians within the medical community of Warsaw, Poland; made health care available to children with hearing impairments; and organized a Jewish school for deaf children. Zamenhof tried to change public attitudes toward deafness, working to promote the integration of the deaf into wider society. He also translated Polish literature into Esperanto. Conclusions With similar aims to his brother Ludwik, Leon Zamenhof strived to enhance and broaden communication among people who could not hear and to persuade people to change their attitudes about deafness.",

Sauter (2007) commenting on “Initial Audiologic Assessment of Infants Referred From Well Baby, Special Care, and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Nurseries” by R. K. Karzon and J. E. C. Lieu (2006). Method Sauter states that he is in agreement with the article by Karzon and Lieu with respect to the 2-hr time for the initial diagnostic appointment and the reliance on auditory brainstem response (ABR) as the primary method for threshold estimation in young infants. However, he questions the order of test stimuli within the ABR protocol and the order of tests within the test battery. Our comments reflect the clinical experience of the authors and are supported by evidence from the literature. Conclusions Development of a protocol for the initial evaluation of infants referred from newborn screening poses diagnostic challenges. A 2-hr appointment with a battery of tests works well with this population.",

Responses at the audiometric limits were counted, along with the stimulus conditions (i.e., transducer, frequency, and masking) and the age of the patient. Results A total of 307 instances of responses at the lower audiometric limits were seen in 173 of these cases (6.13%), with the majority by bone conduction. Conclusions The overall rate of responses at the audiometric limits was low, as expected. However, these responses were primarily seen in the age group from 4 to 15 years, and at least one such response occurred in 26% of cases in that age range.",

    "abstract": "The aims of this study were to adapt the Parents' Evaluation of Aural/Oral Performance of Children (PEACH) scale into Hebrew, to explore the auditory performance of children with normal hearing (NH) or hearing loss (HL), to examine changes with age, and to investigate the effect of descriptive variables on the performance of children with HL.The PEACH scale was adapted into Hebrew using the \"back-translation\" method. The study included 260 parents of children with NH and 32 parents of children with HL. Children were between 9 and 72 months old. Inclusion criteria for children with HL are as follows: bilateral, congenital, or moderate-severe to profound sensorineural HL using bilateral sensory devices. Parents evaluated their child's auditory performance in real-life situations using the PEACH scale.A Cronbach's alpha analysis (N = 292) scored medium-to-high values: α = .86, α = .74, and α = .78 for the entire scale and in quiet and noisy situations, respectively. Noise affected the auditory performance of both groups, with the effect being more pronounced than the hearing status, although it was more prominent in children with HL. The auditory performance of children with NH improved rapidly up to 18 months of age and then progressed more gradually to reach a plateau of 85% at 36 months of age. Chronological age contributed to auditory performance over the entire scale and in quiet situations for children with NH, whereas maternal education contributed to auditory performance in quiet situations for children with HL.The Hebrew version of the PEACH scale provides a useful tool for evaluating the auditory performance of young children, although it is influenced by cultural differences beyond 36 months of age.",

    "abstract": "Difficulty understanding speech in noise is a common communication problem. Clinical tests of speech in noise differ considerably from real-world listening and offer patients limited intrinsic motivation to perform well. In order to design a test that captures motivational aspects of real-world communication, this study investigated effects of gamification, or the inclusion of game elements, on a laboratory spatial release from masking test.Fifty-four younger adults with normal hearing completed a traditional laboratory and a gamified test of spatial release from masking in counterbalanced order. Masker level adapted based on performance, with the traditional test ending after 10 reversals and the gamified test ending when participants solved a visual puzzle. Target-to-masker ratio thresholds (TMRs) with colocated maskers, separated maskers, and estimates of spatial release were calculated after the 10th reversal for both tests and from the last six reversals of the adaptive track from the gamified test.Thresholds calculated from the 10th reversal indicated no significant differences between the traditional and gamified tests. A learning effect was observed with spatially separated maskers, such that TMRs were better for the second test than the first, regardless of test order. Thresholds calculated from the last six reversals of the gamified test indicated better TMRs in the separated condition compared to the traditional test.Adding gamified elements to a traditional test of spatial release from masking did not negatively affect test validity or estimates of spatial release. Participants were willing to continue playing the gamified test for an average of 30.2 reversals of the adaptive track. For some listeners, performance in the separated condition continued to improve after the 10th reversal, leading to better TMRs and greater spatial release from masking at the end of the gamified test compared to the traditional test.https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.22028789.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to explore the differences in diagnosis (Dix-Hallpike test; the head impulse, nystagmus, and the test of skew [HINTS] procedures; imaging modalities; and audiological battery) and treatment (pharmacological treatments and the Epley maneuver) of acute vertigo (AV) by examining the perspectives of otolaryngologists, emergency physicians (EPs), and primary care physicians (PCPs).A total of 123 physicians (otolaryngologists [n = 40], EPs [n = 41], PCPs [n = 42]) were included in this study. This study was conducted using an online questionnaire created in Google Forms. The questionnaire included five demographic questions and eight questions assessing the diagnosis and treatment of four case scenarios (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [BPPV], vestibular neuronitis, Meniere's disease [MD], and vertebrobasilar insufficiency). Multiple-response and chi-square tests were used to analyze the data.In the case of BPPV, 82.5% of otolaryngologists, 73.2% of EPs, and 59.6% of PCPs preferred the \"Dix-Hallpike maneuver\" (p = .067). In addition, 72.5% of otolaryngologists, 48.8% of EPs, and 47.6% of PCPs preferred the Epley maneuver for treatment in a case with BPPV (p = .032). It was found that physicians preferred the most (18.9%) \"videonystagmography (VNG)-caloric\" test for diagnosis in the MD case. There was a statistically significant difference in the intravenous serum therapy and rest, and Epley maneuver preferences of physicians for the treatment of cases with MD (p = .002 and p = .046).In this study, significant differences were found in the AV care provided by different specialties. Standardized education systems for AV (symposiums, congresses, scientific activities, etc., with multidisciplinary participation) may be beneficial for improving the diagnosis and treatment process of AV in our country.",

    "abstract": "The audiology literature is rich with work in the area of clinical masking, yet there is a perception that learning how to mask is difficult. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of audiology doctoral students and recent graduates in learning clinical masking.This exploratory study used a cross-sectional survey design, sampling doctor of audiology (AuD) students and recent graduates to probe the perceived effort required and challenges experienced in learning clinical masking. A total of 424 survey responses were included in the analysis.A large majority of respondents rated learning clinical masking as being challenging and effortful. Responses suggested that it took more than 6 months for confidence to develop. Qualitative analysis of the open-ended question uncovered four themes: \"negative experience in the classroom\"; \"lack of consensus or variation in teaching\"; \"focus on content/rules\"; and \"positives, internal and external.\"Survey responses shed light on the perception that clinical masking is difficult to learn and highlight teaching and learning strategies that affect the development of this skill. Students reported a negative experience when significant emphasis was placed on formulas and theories and when encountering multiple masking methods in the clinic. On the other hand, students found clinic, simulations, lab-based classes, and some classroom instruction beneficial to learning. Students reported that their learning process included use of cheat sheets, practicing independently, and conceptualizing the process of masking to support their learning.",

Life-space mobility reflects how an individual moves through their daily physical and social environment, and the role of hearing loss in life-space mobility is not fully understood. We hypothesized that those with higher self-reported hearing handicap would be more likely to demonstrate restricted life-space mobility.A total of 189 older adults (Mage = 75.76 years, SD = 5.81) completed a mail-in survey packet including the LSQ and Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE). Participants were categorized into one of three groups (\"no/none,\" \"mild/moderate,\" or \"severe\" hearing handicap) according to HHIE total score. LSQ responses were dichotomized to either \"nonrestricted/typical\" or \"restricted\" life-space mobility groups. Logistic regression models were performed to analyze life-space mobility differences among the groups.Logistic regression results demonstrated no statistically significant association between hearing handicap and LSQ.The results of this study indicate that there is no association between self-reported hearing handicap and life-space mobility as evaluated using a mail-in version of the LSQ. This counters other studies that have demonstrated that life space is associated with chronic illness, cognitive functioning, and social and health integration.",

    "abstract": "Consistent hearing device use in young children with hearing loss is challenging for families. A hearing aid accessory, called a pilot cap, is often recommended to families to help mitigate the issues around device retention. Although pilot caps are commonly suggested to families, there is sparse data available about how acoustically transparent they are when used with a hearing aid. The purpose of this study was to measure the acoustic transparency when a hearing aid functions under a pilot cap accessory.The Verifit 2 Hearing Aid Analyzer and the Speech Intelligibility Index (SII) were used to measure acoustic transparency related to access of aided speech. Measurements involved four hearing aids that are commonly fit on pediatric patients and four different commercially available pilot caps. SII data were collected at two intensity levels for four simulated sensorineural hearing losses (SNHLs). Response differences between acoustic measurements with a hearing aid plus a pilot cap compared with the hearing aid alone (control) were collected.A total of 80 SII measurements were made. There were 16 SII measurements of the hearing aid alone (control conditions) and 64 SII measurements with combinations of the hearing aids and pilot caps selected for this study. For each hearing aid, there was no significant difference between the SII measurements collected for the hearing aid alone and the hearing aid plus a pilot cap. Additionally, there was no significant difference between the different pilot caps used with each hearing aid tested.Pilot cap use with the four types of hearing aids in this study results in no significant differences in acoustic transparency compared with the control condition. The data in this study support the use of the pilot caps for hearing device retention in children with hearing loss.https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.22647217.",

An electroacoustic evaluation was performed for five degrees of hearing loss ranging from a flat 40 to 80 dB HL, and for nine EasyGain settings from +8 to -8 dB with each Roger receiver.A three-way analysis of variance indicated significant main effects of hearing loss, receiver type and EasyGain settings, as well as their two-way interactions (p < .05). Overall, the output of the integrated receiver was 2.77 dB higher than that of the universal receiver. The change in output with 2-dB changes in EasyGain setting varied with the degree of hearing loss. For mild hearing loss (40 and 50 dB), every 2-dB change in EasyGain produced an average of 1.93 dB (SD = 0.17) change in the root-mean-square (RMS) output. For the higher degrees of hearing loss (60, 70, and 80 dB HL), the change in RMS varied depending on the range of EasyGain setting as follows: when EasyGain was > 0 dB, every 2-dB change in EasyGain setting produced an average change in RMS output of 1.32 dB (SD = 0.41); however, when EasyGain was ≤ 0 dB, every 2-dB change resulted in a mean 1.95 dB (SD = 0.16) change.The benefits of EasyGain technology on the RMS output are dependent on the interaction of the receiver type, degree of hearing loss, and EasyGain settings. The results highlight the importance of electroacoustic verification to determine appropriate settings for optimal audibility when using an RM system.",

Systemic prejudice and stigma cause many of these student clinicians to experience bigotry from the patients they work with.This review discusses the populations of audiology students at highest risk of patient bigotry and discusses the intersectionality of students with several historically marginalized identities.Little scholarship exists in the field of audiology on the bigotry that graduate student clinicians experience. The effects of bigotry are reviewed, and practical guidance on preparing for and responding to bigotry from patients is provided.As health care workers, these students are essential workers contributing to the health and health care of the population, making their well-being a critical public health concern.

These symptoms can lead to physical injury, loss of autonomy, and chronic medical problems including cognitive loss and depression and cost, on average, over $60,000 per person (Agrawal et al., 2018). The decrease in quality of life associated with vestibular loss may equal or surpass that suffered by people with significant hearing loss (Soulier et al., 2017). Despite these alarming statistics, our progress in addressing vestibular disorders has not been as robust as our success in diagnosing and treating those with hearing impairment. Specifically, we still lack an adequate understanding of the pathophysiology of many vestibular disorders, sensitive and specific diagnostic techniques, and treatment modalities. This special issue of the American Journal of Audiology is centered on vestibular disorders, based on presentations at the 10th biennial national conference of the National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research (NCRAR) located at the Portland VA Medical Center in Portland, Oregon, in September 2021. The conference aimed to bring together an audience of audiologists, physical therapists, otolaryngologists, neurologists, physiologists, and epidemiologists together with early-career investigators and students to bring participants up to date on the existing state of the field, identify critical places where progress can be made, and develop leaders in each of these aspects of clinical and basic vestibular science. The conference organizing committee included Drs. Dawn Konrad-Martin (conference chair), Robert Peterka and Timothy Hullar (co-chairs), Candice “Evie” Ortiz, and Devin McCaslin. It was supported by NIH grant R13DC019837 from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the conference was held exclusively virtually. As in previous years, no concurrent talks were scheduled in order to allow all participants access to the entire conference. Each of the 13 scientific talks lasted 50 min followed by 10 min of questions. The 15 poster presenters were available at specific times to describe their work, although the posters could also be visited asynchronously. Virtual smaller breakout rooms allowed focused discussions among participants, students, and presenters. The five-member conference organizing committee included two women, with one a woman of color; of the 17 speakers and panel discussants, two were women of color and one was a man of color. Eight of the sixteen poster presenters were students. 29 registrants were students with 16 receiving scholarships. Six were male and 23 were female. Three students described themselves as Asian, two as Black, and five as more than one race. Of the 253 registrants overall, 65 responded that they were male, five were nonbinary, and 175 were female. 21 described themselves as Asian, 11 as Black, 195 as Caucasian, and seven described themselves as being of more than one race. For the first time, the conference included a dedicated session addressing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in our field. The keynote speaker for this portion was Dr. David Brown, MD, associate dean for health equity and inclusion at the University of Michigan, who spoke on “Seeking Balance in Research and Clinical Care.” An interactive session, entitled “Barriers to DEI in Communication Sciences and Disorders: What Are They and Where Do We Go From Here?” included Teresa Girolamo, PhD, of the University of Connecticut; Candice “Evie” Ortiz, AuD, and Ken Grant, PhD, both of Walter Reed Army Medical Center; and Lloyd Minor, MD, of Stanford University. A critical lesson from their presentations was that a team built around the principles of DEI brings a range of opinions, experiences, and skills that naturally enhance the scope, quality, and applicability of the team's work. Dr. Brown and the other participants emphasized several critical steps to improve an organization's ability to meet its DEI goals: (a) understand DEI will not happen by itself and that active engagement and recruitment is necessary; (b) recognize that retaining successful members of a DEI-oriented team requires proactive monitoring and encouragement; (c) hire with a goal of building complementary teams to help recruitment; and (d) do not wait passively for DEI efforts to occur—instead, start by identifying at least one specific barrier and strive to remove it from the workplace. A copy of the document, “Resources and Strategies for Promoting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Audiology and Rehabilitation Services,” is available in Supplemental Material S1. The first day of the conference focused on causes of imbalance. The day's keynote speaker, Ken Burns, PhD, came from a position in industry to speak on cellular mechanisms of peripheral vestibular loss and regeneration. Faith Akin, PhD, of the Mountain Home VA, discussed the effect of head trauma on imbalance; Jeffrey Sharon, MD, of University of California San Francisco, described the pathophysiology of superior canal dehiscence; Christopher Zalewski, PhD, reviewed the relationship of aging to vestibular loss; and Courtney Voelker, PhD, MD, discussed the effect of Ménière's disease on imbalance. The second day of the conference focused on diagnosis of imbalance. The day began with compelling patient interviews describing their clinical experiences with dizziness and imbalance (often recalling their difficulty finding knowledgeable specialists able to offer them quality care). Devin McCaslin, PhD, the day's keynote speaker, generated enormous enthusiasm for his development of an automated triage system for dizzy patients using artificial intelligence. Faisal Karmali, PhD, explored the use of the promising novel modality of psychophysical testing to measure vestibular function, and Kamran Barin, PhD, described the clinical uses for video head impulse testing as a keystone measure in vestibular evaluation. Psychiatric disorders related to vestibular function were described by a world leader in the field, Jeff Staab, MD, and Joel Goebel, MD, discussed vestibular migraine, a common cause of intermittent dizziness seen by audiologists and otolaryngologists that affects up to 10% of patients in clinics specializing in dizziness (Huang et al., 2020). The day concluded with a well-received round table where audience members presented their challenging patient cases to a group of conference presenters comprising audiologists, physical therapists, and physicians. They drew upon their clinical expertise to share their ideas and opinions about each patient's diagnosis and management with the audience. The third day of the conference focused on treatment. Susan Whitney, PT, PhD, a world leader in vestibular rehabilitation and the day's keynote speaker, discussed her use of virtual reality technology in caring for patients with vestibular loss. Michael Schubert, PT, PhD, described central compensation after vestibular loss, and finally, Charley Della Santina, PhD, MD, developer of the Hopkins vestibular implant now in clinical trials, reported the success of his technology in treating patients with severe vestibular loss. While the conference served as a reminder of the immense health-related impact of vestibular loss, it also provided the following optimistic observations: First, our understanding of the cellular and molecular pathologies behind many vestibular conditions is developing rapidly—and with it, opportunities to mitigate their effects. Second, advanced surgical and pharmacologic treatments are increasingly effective in caring for many patients with vestibular problems. Third, improved physical therapy techniques can help even those most frustrating—and frustrated—patients, such as those suffering from head trauma. Fourth, the advent of a vestibular prosthesis may revolutionize the care of patients devastated by peripheral vestibular loss. Presentations and discussions at the conference also highlighted areas where future efforts may be focused. First, we must work to develop diagnostic tests that are more sensitive, specific, reproducible, and relevant than the ones currently available. Second, we should concentrate on conducting trials of balance interventions, such as pharmacotherapy or physical therapy, but remembering that randomized controlled trials are not always necessary to identify a clinically important effect. Third, we should improve systems-based practice, including better triage systems and better use of multidisciplinary teams, to accelerate diagnosis and reduce costs and morbidity. Fourth, we should maintain and expand relevant tissue repositories, encouraging the careful collection of specimens from donors with vestibular problems into temporal bone collections. The articles in this special issue represent the work of established leaders and students in the field. The work by Behr and Honaker (2023) discusses the successful management of a patient with recalcitrant benign paroxysmal positional vertigo using an omniaxial chair to perform canalith repositioning maneuvers. Kirjava, Sladen, and DeBacker's (2023) article identifies barriers and offers guidance for providing audiologic care to the 7% of Americans who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other identities. Talian et al. (2023) provide, in one place, extensive norms for conventional vestibular testing in a large group of healthy adults—a dataset that may provide important correlations in future work. Faith Akin, also one of the conference presenters, and co-authors (Akin et al., 2023) show that risk factors for postconcussive dizziness among Veterans included lower educational level, race, diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder, and hearing and vestibular loss. The article by Shah, which includes conference presenters Jeffrey Staab and Devin L. McCaslin as co-authors (Shah et al., 2023), demonstrates that a multidisciplinary care team was generally successful in relieving dizzy symptoms in a mixed group of patients, although anxiety and depression remain largely unchanged. Faisal Karmali, who presented an introduction to vestibular psychophysics at the conference, joins co-authors Susan A. King and Elena Lopez-Contreras Gonzalez (Gonzalez et al., 2023) to show that psychophysical thresholds can be overestimated due to cognitive biases—a finding that could have dramatic implications for the rapidly growing field of vestibular psychophysics. Benjamin, Gardi, and Sharon (2023), a conference presenter, describe an outcome measure, the Vestibular Migraine Patient Assessment Tool and Handicap Inventory, they have developed for patients with vestibular migraine. Finally, Janky and Steyger (2023) review the mechanisms and impact of aminoglycoside-induced vestibular loss, a key model for ototoxicity as well as a public health concern whose importance is increasingly recognized.

    "abstract": "Hearing loss simulation (HLS) has been recommended for clinical teaching and counseling of patients and their families, so that they can experience hearing impairment. However, few validated procedures for simulating hearing loss are available to instructors and practicing clinicians. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of the Immersive Hearing Loss and Prosthesis Simulator (I-HeLPS) on reducing hearing sensitivity and word recognition to determine its adequacy for educational and clinical use.Thirty-seven young adults with normal hearing completed hearing threshold and word recognition testing under normal and simulated hearing losses. The accuracy of the nominal hearing threshold settings within the I-HeLPS software was assessed with behavioral detection of frequency-modulated pure tones presented in a calibrated sound field, while listeners wore I-HeLPS headphones. The impact of the HLSs on speech perception was measured using the California Consonant Test. Hearing thresholds, word identification accuracy, and sound confusions were compared across listening conditions.Hearing thresholds increased systematically with worse simulated hearing loss. Performance on the California Consonant Test worsened, and the number of phoneme confusions increased with simulated hearing loss severity. Most of the confusions were place confusions with near neighbors and manner confusions increased as a function of increasing severity of simulated hearing loss.The I-HeLPS accurately elevated hearing thresholds with increasing HLS severity and impacted word recognition in a manner consistent with sensorineural hearing loss. The simulations were considered reasonable for educational and clinical purposes.https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.24520966.",

    "abstract": "The Emotional Communication in Hearing Questionnaire (EMO-CHeQ) is designed to evaluate awareness of vocal emotion information and perception of emotion. This study sought to translate the EMO-CHeQ into Turkish in accordance with international standards and to ascertain its validity and reliability statistically by administering it to native Turkish-speaking subjects.This empirical study involved collecting data from participants using a scale. A total of 460 individuals, comprising 158 women and 302 men (Mage = 33.43 ± 13.14 years), participated. The data encompassed 295 subjects with normal hearing, 101 hearing aid users, and 64 cochlear implant users. Exploratory factor analysis, followed by confirmatory factor analysis, was employed to ensure construct validity. Internal consistency was assessed with Cronbach's alpha reliability analysis, and content validity was applied to examine how effectively the Turkish version of the scale fulfilled its intended purpose.The total Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient of the scale was .949, and the explained variance was 74.385%. The Turkish version of the EMO-CHeQ demonstrated high construct validity, internal consistency, and explanatory efficacy. The scale revealed significant differences (p < .05) in emotional communication among the normal-hearing group, hearing aid users, and cochlear implant users.The Turkish adaptation of the EMO-CHeQ is a credible and robust tool for evaluating how individuals perceive emotion in speech. Emotion perception was found to be suboptimal among hearing aid users compared to cochlear implant users, although it was most proficient in those with normal hearing.https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.24520624.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Persons with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) are at high risk for ototoxicity due to the routine use of intravenous aminoglycoside (IV-AG) antibiotics in respiratory infection management. Additionally, factors that contribute to ototoxicity-related symptom development and severity in PwCF are unknown. Given the increased risk of ototoxicity in people with diabetes, we explored the association between cystic fibrosis–related diabetes (CFRD) and self-reported ototoxicity symptoms (tinnitus and vestibular problems) in PwCF treated with aminoglycosides. Method: PwCF ( N = 39; 25 females, 14 males; M age = 30.1 years, SD = 10.3) were recruited from the Cystic Fibrosis Care Center at Oregon Health &amp; Science University. Patients completed the validated questionnaires to ascertain their experiences with ototoxicity-related symptoms of tinnitus and balance function. The diagnosis of CFRD, including oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT), insulin treatment, hemoglobin A1c, and cumulative IV-AG treatment history, was obtained through a medical chart review. Participants were classified into three groups based on their medical diagnoses via OGTT: normal glucose tolerance (NGT; control; n = 16), abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT; n = 9), and CFRD ( n = 14). Participants in each group were further classified based on survey outcomes for ototoxicity-related symptoms. Results: There was a trend toward a higher proportion of patients with CFRD reporting tinnitus compared to the AGT and NGT groups, but did not meet statistical significance ( X 2 = 2.24, p = .13). Approximately, 43% of patients with CFRD reported experiencing clinically significant tinnitus lasting &gt; 3 min compared to 11% in the AGT group and 13% in the NGT group ( X 2 = 3.751, p = .05). Cumulative IV-AG exposure tended to be higher in CFRD compared to other groups. High balance function was generally reported in all groups. Conclusions: Patients with CFRD have greater ototoxicity-related symptoms. Further investigation of the relationship between CF-related comorbidities and the risk of developing ototoxicity-related symptoms is warranted to improve the detection and management of ototoxicity in PwCF.",

    "abstract": "This report describes the effects of unilateral peripheral vestibular lesions on the binocular and monocular optokinetic nystagmus (OKN). Six subjects who had undergone surgical removal of an acoustic neuroma were compared to 14 normal subjects. Stimuli consisted of 15° vertical stripes projected onto a flat screen 1 m from the subject. Stimulus velocities were 15, 30, 45, and 60°/sec. Before surgery, contralateral gain of the slow phase velocity was low, approximately 0.6, compared to 0.9 for ipsilateral gain at 60°/sec. In the acute postoperative period (&lt;30 days), the gains of horizontal OKN were low and symmetrical for both stimulus directions. In the intermediate period (30–60 days postoperative), the OKN was asymmetrical (contralateral gain lower than ipsilateral gain), with the greatest discrepancy at 60°/sec. During the chronic phase (&gt;2 months) the OKN was still asymmetrical in 3 of the 6 subjects. These data suggest that monocular and binocular optokinetic testing can be used to monitor the vestibular compensation of subjects following vestibular nerve section.",

    "abstract": "A large number of personal amplifiers have recently become available commercially. These devices have not been classified as hearing aids by the FDA and are therefore not subject to the FDA rules and regulations governing the sales of hearing aid devices. In this investigation, several of these personal amplifiers were evaluated to determine potential benefits and problems for each device. The devices were evaluated electroacoustically and, also, subjectively by a group of adults with sensorineural hearing loss. The results of the electroacoustic evaluation revealed very sharply peaked frequency responses. The subjective evaluations revealed tremendous variability, with some preferences for power and low-frequency amplification. Clinical implications of these results and suggestions for further research are provided.",

    "abstract": "This investigation was conducted to examine whether adaptive, up-down, speech perception procedures predicted the level yielding 50% correct response as well for older listeners as for younger listeners. The 50% criterion level for NU6 stimuli was estimated via an adaptive procedure in quiet and in two noise conditions for ten older (ages 67–84) and ten younger (ages 20–27) subjects, all with hearing threshold levels &lt; 25 dB HL for the octave frequencies 250–4,000 Hz. Word recognition scores were obtained at the levels estimated by the adaptive procedure. The older group means were closer to 50% in two of the three conditions. No significant group difference was found in the third condition.",

Waves I and III occurred more frequently for the click stimulus than for the 1000-Hz stimulus in ears without tumors. In ears with tumors, Waves I and III were generally absent for both stimuli. Wave V was generally present in response to both stimuli. The Wave V interaural latency difference (ILD V) was significantly different between groups for both stimuli but was not significantly different between stimuli. The sensitivity and specificity were similar for the two stimuli. In selected cases and as an adjuvant measure, the additional use of the 1000-Hz toneburst was useful. Recommendations for clinical interpretation and application are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Audiologic test results were reviewed for 30 patients whose hearing was preserved following eighth nerve tumor surgery. Speech reception thresholds, 4,000-Hz thresholds, acoustic reflexes, and ABR wave I absolute latencies were generally unchanged or poorer following surgery; word recognition scores were essentially unchanged. By contrast, ABR waves III and V, and the I–III and I–V interpeak intervals, were generally improved postoperatively, including several patients who had clear waves following surgery despite absent preoperative responses. The improved ABR tracings likely indicate increased neural synchrony due to reduced pressure on the cochlear nerve following surgery, whereas the reduced hearing sensitivity probably reflects cochlear damage coincident to the surgery.",

    "abstract": "The existing speech corpora are of limited value in assessing the combined effects of hearing loss, hearing protection, and noise on speech intelligibility in the work place. One reason for this is the differences between the acoustic characteristics typical of the elevated vocal effort in the work place and those typical of the normal vocal effort used in recording various existing speech corpora. The other reason for the limited value of the existing tests is related to the differences in nonacoustic factors (linguistic structure, predictability of the messages, etc.) between the available speech corpora and the actual messages used in the work place. In this study a speech test designed for use in industrial work places has been developed. The test material consists of eight 20-phrase lists. The lists are phonetically balanced and of approximately equal difficulty. The variability among lists is greatest at very low sensation levels and decreases progressively as the sensation level increases.",

This article relates to the scope of practice extension in several ways. NIM is defined and described in a manner that presents the comprehensive nature of its application. A developmental review of NIM relates the role played by individual audiologists and audiology as a discipline. This includes a rationale for audiologists as NIM practitioners. The section about the clinical practice of intraoperative monitoring overviews methodologies and is highlighted by case examples. Finally, education, training, research, and reimbursement are underscored as future needs for this specialty area.",

    "abstract": "A broad spectrum of audiology programs and services has been developed in Israel over the past 40 years. Tel Aviv University awards bachelor's and graduate degrees in audiology and speech-language pathology. There is a national licensing program for audiologists and speech-language pathologists who have earned at least a baccalaureate degree and have completed one year of service under the supervision of a senior professional. Wellequipped medical center clinics in the major geographic areas are easily accessible from all parts of the country. Privately operated audiology clinics and offices are run by licensed audiologists, and hearing aid dispensing establishments are staffed mostly by licensed audiologists. An organized national hearing screening program begins with infants and young children in well-baby clinics. Special education programs emphasize integration of children with severe and profound hearing loss in regular classrooms, and volunteer service centers provide supplementary habilitation and social and cultural experiences for such children. Hearing conservation programs for the retired population are carried on in community health maintenance centers for the older adult. Industrial and military hearing conservation programs have been established. Israeli scientists and clinicians engage in both basic and clinical research, and Israel's professional organizations organize periodic local, national, and international meetings, facilitating significant interaction and collaboration with colleagues and organizations abroad.",

Method Fifteen young adults with normal hearing ranging in age from 19 to 25 years participated in the study. All participants had clear external ear canals and normal Jerger Type A tympanograms and had passed a hearing screening. Testing was performed using the Interacoustics Titan acoustic reflex threshold and distortion product otoacoustic emissions protocol. Participants underwent baseline distortion product otoacoustic emissions. Results A paired-samples t test was conducted for both the right and left ears to assess within-group differences between baseline distortion product otoacoustic emissions and repeated distortion product otoacoustic emissions measures. No significant differences were found in distortion product otoacoustic emission measures following administration of acoustic reflexes. Conclusions The use of a protocol when using an automated system that includes both acoustic reflexes and distortion product otoacoustic emissions is important. Overall, presentation of acoustic reflexes prior to measuring distortion product otoacoustic emission did not affect distortion product otoacoustic emission results; therefore, test sequence can be modified as needed.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Rehabilitative auditory training for people with hearing loss faces 2 primary challenges: generalization of learning to novel contexts and user adherence to training goals. We hypothesized that using interview excerpts from popular media as training materials would have the potential to positively influence both of these areas. Interviews contain predictable, structured complexity that promotes perceptual generalization and are also designed to be engaging for consumers. This study tested the viability of such popular media interviews as training materials, comparing their effectiveness to that obtained with sentence transcription training. Method Young adults with normal hearing ( N = 60) completed 1 hr of transcription training using noise-vocoded materials, simulating acoustic perception through an 8-channel cochlear implant. Participants completed pre- and posttraining assessments of vocoded speech perception in quiet and in noise, along with posttraining high-variability sentence recognition and cued isolated word recognition. Scores on all tests were compared across 4 randomly assigned groups differing in training materials: audiovisual interviews, audio-only interviews, isolated sentences, and undegraded isolated sentences (providing an untrained control comparison group). Results Recognition in quiet and in noise improved with both types of interview-based training, and interview training groups outperformed the control group on all generalization tests. Participants in the audiovisual interview group also reported significantly higher, more sustained engagement in a retrospective survey. Conclusions Media interviews appear to be at least as effective as isolated sentences for transcription-based auditory training in simulated hearing loss settings with young adults and may improve engagement and generalization of benefit in auditory training applications.",

Research Design A questionnaire was sent to 116 facilities in geographically diverse locations. Results Of the 116 surveys sent, 25 surveys were returned (response rate of 21.5%) and 22 had sufficient data to be included for analyses. The majority of the sites measure productivity at the individual and/or department level. No predominant productivity measurement method was reported. Measurement methods included the following: appointment length ( n = 6), weighting Current Procedural Terminology codes ( n = 6), relative value units ( n = 5), a combination of methods ( n = 1), and other specific parameters ( n = 1). Thirteen sites measured productivity as a percentage of scheduled worked time with a target of 69% (ranged from 40% to 85%). Many variables thought to impact productivity were evaluated: age of the patient, scheduling, use of a 2nd tester, no-show rate, hearing aid status, components of auditory brainstem response evaluation, documentation time, and monaural or binaural services. Schedule review and adjustment, efficiency, and communication with staff were methods reported to increase productivity. Conclusion Most surveyed facilities measure productivity at the individual and/or department levels. However, there is no standard method. Current productivity measures include time-based measures based on appointment length, time-based measures assigned to Current Procedural Terminology codes, relative value units, combined approaches, and individual site developed programs. Many variables impact productivity measurements. Further study and discussion are needed to develop an optimal method for productivity measurement in audiology.",

Transient improvement was observed after oral steroid and diuretic treatment, but cochlear hydrops recurred until the dose of bromocriptine was increased to 10 mg daily. Conclusion Bromocriptine may stimulate dopamine receptors in cochlear cells with potential therapeutic role in patients with cochlear hydrops. There are no widely accepted and effective treatments for endolymphatic hydrops, and identifying potential new and efficacious therapeutics is of high relevance.",

The effect of the order of frequency in chained stimuli on CAEPs was also studied. Method Seventeen individuals with normal hearing and 17 individuals with mild to severe sensorineural hearing loss participated in the study. In individuals with normal hearing, CAEPs were recorded at 80 dB nHL for 4 chained stimuli with different orders of frequencies within them (Chained Stimuli 1 [CS1]: 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 Hz; Chained Stimuli 2: 4000, 2000, 1000, 500 Hz; Chained Stimuli 3: 500, 2000, 1000, 4000 Hz; Chained Stimuli 4: 4000, 1000, 2000, 500 Hz). CAEP threshold estimation was carried out using CS1 in both groups and was compared with behavioral pure-tone thresholds. Results CS1 elicited the largest amplitude responses at low and mid frequencies, whereas all 4 stimuli elicited similar amplitude responses at high frequencies. CAEP thresholds were generally within 10-20 dB above the participants' behavioral threshold in both groups. The difference between CAEP threshold and behavioral threshold was less for individuals with hearing loss compared to individuals with normal hearing. There was a significant positive correlation between CAEP threshold and behavioral threshold at all the frequencies. Conclusions CS1 could be used to elicit CAEPs for threshold estimation in adult participants with normal hearing and hearing loss of varied degrees with theoretically reduced testing time. The actual time reduction using chained stimuli and the correction factor to be applied to estimate behavioral threshold can be studied in future investigations.",

This scientific initiative, which celebrated its twentieth anniversary, once again hosted around 450 hearing experts representing nearly 50 countries from across the planet (just over half of delegates came from the United States). These meetings date back to the Milan 1998 European Consensus Development Conference on Neonatal Hearing Screening (Grandori & Lutman, 1999), a meeting that inspired a selected group of experts in various disciplines (audiologists; neonatologists; ear, nose, and throat doctors [ENTs]; hearing care providers) to meet periodically to witness the advances in research on hearing and promote improvement of hearing care, initially on infants, and later (since 2010) on adults and the elderly (Grandori & Hayes, 2017). The approximately 300 communications of the 2018 conference covered a wide variety of topics, from fundamental research on mechanisms of hearing and hearing dysfunctions, to developments in hearing devices, instrumentation for diagnosis, and patient management; from correlations between hearing loss and cognitive decline and dementia, as well as state-of-the-art eHealth applications, to improvement in protocols and parent and public health perspectives. This special issue includes a number of papers selected from the HEAL 2018 communications that addressed very timely topics, such as the evaluation of hearing performance in real life (Brown, Mahomed-Asmail, De Sousa, & Swanepoel, 2019; Fletcher, McAuliffe, Kerr, & Sinex, 2019; Humes, 2019; Tangkhpanya, Le Carrour, Doucet, & Gagne, 2019), the impact of hearing rehabilitation on restoring cognitive function (Anzivino et al., 2019), and evidence for factors predicting hearing aid (HA) purchase (Pronk, Meijerink, Kramer, Heymans, & Besser, 2019) or the benefit of bilateral cochlear implants (CIs) versus bimodal hearing (Au & Dowell, 2019). Finally, this issue reports novel clinical applications and normative data for a classical neurophysiological test (Ferraro, Kileny, & Grasel, 2019) and a self-report outcomes measures in audiology (Cassarly, Matthews, Simpson, & Dubno, 2019). The issue concludes with the application of eHealth technology for supporting the clinical management of older CI users (Tognola, Murri, & Cuda, 2019). Below are brief summaries of the articles of this special issue. Humes (2019) presents a refreshing perspective on the long-standing World Health Organization (WHO) hearing impairment grading system (WHO-HI). The original grading system is based on expert opinion only. Humes evaluated the validity of this system using data from five large-population and clinical studies, including self-report measures, pure-tone hearing thresholds, and some type of functional assessment of communication. Based on his results, Humes proposes a new grading system, and he questions the validity of pure-tone audiometry as the only metric for the assessment of someone's functioning with hearing loss. He advocates for the use of self-report to assess impaired communication, as pure-tone audiometry may not be reflective of the associated impact on a person's activity limitations or restrictions placed on their real-life societal participation—two key components of the WHO 2001 model. The issue of pure-tone audiometry being a measure with limitations when it comes to reflecting real-life communication was also raised by Brown and colleagues (2019). They present further progress in the applicability of the self-administered digits-in-noise (DIN) screening test using a smartphone platform coupled to various sound-field transducers (earphones, smartphone speakers, external loudspeakers). Test–retest reliability analyses across sound-field conditions and transducers yielded promising results: The smartphone DIN test is reliable and can be used for screening and rehabilitation purposes. The authors indicate that this result is particularly relevant for the continent of Africa. The smartphone DIN test is a reliable and affordable option to be used in low- and middle-income countries, allowing for an accessible hearing screening solution. Speech processing in noise is also central in the study by Tangkhpanya et al. (2019). An interesting aspect of this study is the use of audiovisual recordings of speech material: 12-min documentaries uttered by a speaker whose face (frontal view of shoulders and head) was also visible. The authors created such a condition because it resembles a real-life conversation situation. Each documentary was followed by 15 questions. The research question was whether audiovisual speech comprehension would be more effortful for older than for younger listeners. A dual-task paradigm with tactile detection as a secondary task was used to assess listening effort. Three groups were compared: (1) young normal-hearing adults, (2) young normal-hearing adults listening to speech material low-pass filtered with a cutoff of 3 kHz, and (3) older adults with age-adjusted normal hearing. Surprisingly, the older listeners outperformed the second group and did as well as the young normal-hearing group. Why did they deploy less effort than the younger participants listening to the low-pass filtered speech task? The authors provide some suggestions in their report. Fletcher et al. (2019) examine the speech-recognition performance of young normal-hearing adults listening to speech in noise. They examined several cognitive and linguistic variables as potential predictors of performance, observing the strongest effects for vocabulary knowledge and working memory among those cognitive–linguistic measures examined. This was especially true at the more moderate signal-to-noise ratios among those examined. As expected, word frequency and phonetic content also affected performance, and these effects were apparent across all signal-to-noise ratios. Anzivino and colleagues (2019) explore how hearing rehabilitation through HAs or CIs could benefit cognitive functions in the long term. They evaluated audiological and neuropsychological function and quality of life in a cohort of bilaterally deaf older patients over a period of 12 months after cochlear implantation or HA fitting. The study reveals that speech recognition in quiet and in noise improved after 6 months of amplification use. This improvement paralleled the observed significant amelioration of short- and long-term memory performances and of executive and attentive functions, thus suggesting that acoustic rehabilitation may have a positive impact on cognitive decline. Pronk et al. (2019) describe a prospective study with older adults in which data gathered prior to the participant's decision to try HAs is used to predict the likelihood that the patient will purchase HAs. Only the severity of pure-tone hearing loss emerged as a significant predictor, but it was a weak predictor. The authors suggest that better insights into the likelihood of HA purchase can be gained through examination of measures obtained during the HA evaluation period, rather than prior to this. Au and Dowell (2019) address the potential benefit between bilateral CIs and bimodal hearing. To this purpose, the authors evaluate speech perception in a cohort of more than 1,300 adults with unilateral and bilateral CIs and bimodal hearing to provide evidence-based recommendations for those considering a second CI. The results suggest bimodal users who scored less than 19% on consonant–vowel–consonant (CVC) word recognition in quiet in the nonimplanted ear would benefit more from a second CI. Nevertheless, other factors including the subject age, medical conditions, and residual hearing play an important role in recommending bilateral CIs. Ferraro, Kileny, and Grasel (2019) illustrate two novel clinical applications of electrocochleography (ECochG). First, they demonstrate how ECochG could be helpful not only in diagnosing but also in predicting Ménière's disease in asymptomatic but genetically predisposed patients. Second, they provide evidence on how ECochG could be useful in the diagnosis of superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SCCD) and for monitoring its repair during surgery. The authors finally provide normative data of ECochG based on noninvasive tympanic membrane recordings. Cassarly and colleagues (2019) provide a concise review of nonparametric item response theory and its potential application in self-report outcome measures in audiology. They then illustrate the application of this tool through an evaluation of the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE)—probably the self-report measure used most often with older adults—and the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults. Finally, Tognola, Murri, and Cuda (2019) describe an accurate and very efficient (20 s/report) automated cognitive-computing approach to the extraction of relevant information from narrative medical reports for older adults receiving CIs. Extraction of similar information from these same reports manually typically required 20–30 min and limited the likelihood of clinical researchers attempting to do so.

    "abstract": "In two recent publications describing clinical trials of hearing aids in this journal (Humes et al., 2017(Humes et al., , 2019)), one of several hearing-aid outcome measures included was the Connected Speech Test (CST;Cox, Alexander, & Gilmore, 1987).All CST scores, unaided and aided, were described in each article as being obtained at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of +3 dB.Due to a calibration error, this was incorrect.We inadvertently used CD Track-1 calibration stimuli rather than the correct CD Track-80 calibration stimuli.As a result, based on analysis of the RMS levels of each of these calibration tracks, the actual SNR was +1 dB rather than the +3 dB SNR reported.As these SNRs were used in both studies and consistently calibrated in this fashion throughout, the relative CST benefit, derived by subtracting the unaided CST score from the aided score for each condition and participant, is not likely to differ for these two SNRs.CST benefit was designated as the secondary outcome measure.The actual performance levels (% correct) for unaided and aided conditions, however, will differ between these two SNRs.Attempts to replicate these scores in similar samples in the future should use a correctly calibrated SNR of +1 dB, rather than the +3 dB SNR indicated in both articles.",

At that time, none of us could have imagined how the world would have changed today, just 366 days later (it was a leap year!). This coincidental anniversary is a fitting reminder that even the simplest assumptions, such as an in-person meeting or a trip to a different city, might need to be questioned. Over the past weeks and months, we have had to learn how to navigate online meetings, host online discussions, teach classes remotely, and manage our work without those informal chats in the break room, but how have we managed to adapt clinical practice for fully remote service provision? Clinicians everywhere, and presumably in every discipline, are struggling to make rapid changes to the services and support they provide to their patients and clients. No doubt some were more prepared than others, but for all, it is a big change. There is certainly light on the horizon. For example, a survey of National Health Service (NHS) audiologists in the United Kingdom conducted by our laboratory at Manchester Centre for Audiology and Deafness (ManCAD) at the University of Manchester, UK, has revealed that prior to the COVID-19 restrictions being brought into place, just 33% of survey respondents had ever offered a remote care appointment, while currently 98% have offered at least one such appointment. Eighty-four percent say they will continue to do so even when restrictions are lifted, with an additional 12% saying they might continue to do so (Saunders & Roughley, 2020). In the United States, audiologists have also rapidly taken up telehealth services, as Medicare, Medicaid, and many private insurers began to cover telehealth coverage and as professional organizations and manufacturers began to provide telehealth resources. In fact, two of the authors in this special issue, Drs. Coco and Marrone, recently published “How Audiologists Can Reconfigure Services for Telepractice During COVID-19” in The ASHA LeaderLive (Coco & Marrone, 2020). The current COVID-19 situation also emphasizes the significance of our Internet and Audiology meetings and illustrates how important and relevant it is for the field of audiology to continue developing and sharing ideas for the practice of teleaudiology. With this in mind, preparations for the 2021 Internet and Audiology meeting are underway. The meeting will take place on May 3rd and 4th, 2021. Whether the meeting will be a hybrid in-person/remote event or whether it will be all remote, we do not yet know. If it has an in-person aspect, attendees will meet at Rush University in Chicago, IL, under the chairmanship of Valeriy Shafiro. We will post all updates here: http://www.internetaudiology.com/ This special issue of AJA highlights some of the work that was presented at the Fourth Internet and Audiology meeting that took place in 2019 at the University of Southampton, with Helen Cullington serving as the meeting chair. The meeting was attended by 124 individuals representing 24 countries. Sixty-four of us met in person, while 60 joined remotely for the presentation and discussion sessions. Indeed, we had presenters located in Australia and India, and remote attendees in the United States, Denmark, and Switzerland. While today all of our meetings are being conducted using virtual communications technology, just one year ago online meetings were the exception. This special issue consists of 12 articles that represent the breadth of topics covered during the meeting. Some of the articles stem from podium presentations, others from poster presentations. Some are research articles or research notes, while others are review articles, viewpoints, and tutorials. Their content is summarized below. Note that AJA organizes articles by type (tutorial, research article, research note, review article, and viewpoint) rather than by topic as we have done below, so make sure to look through the whole issue to find those ones you are interested in, and note that the order in which the articles are described here do not follow the order in the issue. There is a tutorial from Elizabeth Convery et al. (2020) on human–technology interaction and usability that details the impact of technology on the patient–audiologist relationship. She discusses the discipline of human–technology interaction, explains the concept of technology usability, and describes how usability should be evaluated. There are four articles that address teleaudiology methodologies. Paglialonga et al. (2020) describe an automated speech-in-noise test that uses vowel–consonant–vowel sounds in a multiple-choice consonant discrimination task that they hope can be used for widespread remote and in-situ hearing screening. An important feature of the test is that they intend for it to be independent of the listener's language. They describe their progress and conclude that the test is viable but that further research is needed to validate the test in a larger population across a wider range of languages and hearing loss. In a similar manner, the article by Shafiro et al. (2020) describes the development and evaluation of a test of basic auditory skills for remote testing of people who wear cochlear implants (CIs). They report that their findings are encouraging, and they provide initial support in the use of home-based auditory assessment of CI users. In an article examining ecological momentary assessment (EMA) as a tool for assessing hearing aid outcomes, Schinkel-Bielefeld et al. (2020) set out to determine whether and which listening situations are being missed with EMA evaluations, due to situational factors such as the user not having a phone available or because the user considers it inappropriate, rude, inconvenient, or dangerous to provide an EMA rating at a specific time. Their findings indicate the need to find ways to trade off the advantages of using EMA to avoid memory bias with the disadvantage of missing ratings for certain types of listening situations where phone usage may be difficult or impossible. Another novel approach to assessment is described by Lund et al. (2020), who describe a novel tool they developed to shed light on aspects of hearing aid performance that may not be revealed through use of standard questionnaires. The tool has users log activities they have engaged in via a series of short sentences of positive, neutral, or negative valence. They hope that this approach will yield insights into patient experiences over time. Three articles (Burden et al., 2020; Meijerink et al., 2020; Pronk et al., 2020) describe the development of online or app-based self-management programs using a participatory design approach. In participatory design, the key stakeholders, which may include potential patients and clinicians, provide input and feedback throughout the program development process. In the article by Burden et al. (2020), the reader is taken, step by step, through the participatory design process for an interactive online program to motivate adults with untreated hearing loss to seek audiology care. It demonstrates how stakeholders can (and should) influence the design of new interventions. Meijerink et al. (2020) describe their experiences and lessons learned during the development, implementation, and evaluation of a support program for older hearing aid users and their communication partners. Again, through describing the lessons they learned, they illustrate how involvement of the stakeholders, via telephone surveys and focus groups, led to considerable changes in the program over the development process. In Pronk et al.'s (2020) article, they review the theoretical underpinnings (stages of change), technical features (EMA), and the participatory approach that the team will use to develop an app that will offer educational content that is tailored to a person's acoustical environment. The use of the internet as a source of information about hyperacusis was examined by Smith et al. (2020). They analyzed the content provided on 15 different websites, each of which were noncommercial and provided direct access to information related to the symptoms, causes, diagnosis, and/or management of hyperacusis. They determined that there were wide disparities in the quality and content and that while, in general, the information provided was accurate, no single website was all encompassing, and many were judged to be highly selective in their content. Aspects of service provision were discussed in two articles. Saunders et al. (2020) investigated how hearing aid datalogging information is being used in clinical practice by hearing aid dispensers and audiologists using both quantitative and qualitative data collection. Their results show that datalogging is typically used for counseling clients about hearing aid use and for troubleshooting and fine tuning. However, some providers suggested novel uses of datalogging, such as for sending alerts about nonuse and for automated diagnosis of a hearing aid malfunction. Coco et al. (2020) performed a scoping review to explore the role of the patient–site facilitators in teleaudiology. They describe the facilitator's background, training, and responsibilities. The review delineates the need for future research regarding the duties and the training of facilitators. Finally, on a somewhat unique topic for the meeting, Dillard et al. (2020) examine the data integrity issues that arise when using information stored in electronic health records (EHR) for research purposes within the context of an established framework. They note that while there are a multitude of advantages of using EHRs for research, correct interpretation of findings depends on an understanding of the data source and structure, and effort is required to avoid or ameliorate errors and biases.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this investigation was to determine the relationship between the horizontal semicircular canal video head impulse test (hvHIT) and the caloric test in a sample of school-age children evaluated due to complaints of dizziness or imbalance. In adults, these two tests provide different but complementary information regarding vestibular function and/or pathology. However, the most common causes of vestibular loss in children are different than those in adults, and it is not clear how these two tests of horizontal semicircular canal function are related in a pediatric population.This is a retrospective study of electronic records of pediatric patients (< 18 years old) who were referred for vestibular function testing and completed both hvHIT and caloric testing. Agreement between both test results was evaluated by examining measures of sensitivity, specificity, and calculating Cohen's kappa.Results from 117 patients (mean age = 13.7 years, age range: 8-17 years, 37 males) were analyzed. Most patients (97/115 [84.3%]) demonstrated both normal hvHIT and caloric test results. Compared to caloric testing, the hvHIT had poor sensitivity (38.9%) and excellent specificity (98.0%). Cohen's kappa analysis revealed moderate agreement between the methods (coefficient = 0.49 [0.24, 0.73]). Where disagreement between the two tests occurred, the final diagnosis was not contingent on either test result.There is a moderate agreement between the hvHIT and the caloric test in pediatric patients presenting to a tertiary care medical center for a vestibular evaluation. Most patients in this cohort presented with normal findings. The specificity of hvHIT was excellent, although the sensitivity was low. This may be related to the low prevalence of peripheral vestibular system disease in this study cohort, and these results do not generalize to centers that serve populations of children where vestibular disorders are more prevalent (e.g., children with sensorineural hearing loss).",

Stimuli were 2000 ms with 40-ms rise-fall times presented at 50 dB SL referenced to stimulus behavioral thresholds. Amplitudes and latencies were analyzed for N1 and P2 onset and offset components via repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). OOARs were compared between groups using one-way ANOVA and across stimuli per group using paired samples t tests.Despite dB SPL stimulus presentation differences between groups, there were no significant differences in individual/absolute amplitude and latency waveform components between groups for either stimulus. Derived comparative calculations of OOAR for 4000-Hz NBN were significantly larger (p < .025; NH: .39; HFSNHL: .62) for the group with HFSNHL than the group with NH sensitivity; 500-Hz NBN OOAR did not reach significance. OOARs revealed no significant difference between stimuli for the group with normal hearing sensitivity, with .38 OOAR for both stimuli (p = .961). OOAR comparisons for the HFSNHL group across stimuli were significant (p = .012), with the 4000-Hz NBN OOAR being nearly double the size of the 500-Hz NBN OOAR.OOARs may provide insight to the balance of excitatory and inhibitory neural firing in the central auditory nervous system (CANS). Larger OOARs may be a biomarker of reduced CANS inhibition, perhaps indicative of a homeostatic central auditory gain mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that people with tinnitus show attention dysfunctions. In this study, we investigated the influence of tinnitus on attention orienting, especially whether the ability of attention orienting could be modulated by the degree of tinnitus.Fifty-nine and 54 unilateral tinnitus participants were included in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, respectively. All participants reported subjective tinnitus for at least 3 months and were divided into a mild tinnitus group (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory [THI] < 37) or a moderate to severe tinnitus group (THI ≥ 37) according to the THI score. An auditory exogenous attention task and an auditory endogenous attention task were adopted. In the exogenous task, a target sound following a cue sound was presented on either the left or right side. Participants were required to discriminate whether the target was pure tone or white noise. In the endogenous task, participants were required to pay attention to the stimuli on one side and judge the pitch of a target sound. Mixed-design analyses of variance were conducted for the mean reaction times and accuracy across the experimental conditions.Our results showed that in the endogenous attention task, compared with the mild tinnitus group, moderate to severe tinnitus participants had better performance for stimuli presented on the tinnitus side but not on the nontinnitus side. In contrast, in the exogenous attention task, no differences were found between mild and moderate to severe tinnitus groups.The results suggest that the degree of tinnitus influences the performance of auditory endogenous attention but not auditory exogenous attention orienting.",

    "abstract": "In clinical practice, otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) are interpreted as either \"present\" or \"absent.\" However, OAEs have the potential to inform about etiology and severity of hearing loss if analyzed in other dimensions. A proposed method uses the nonlinear component of the distortion product OAEs together with stimulus frequency OAEs to construct a joint reflection-distortion profile. The objective of the current study is to determine if joint reflection-distortion profiles can be created using long-latency (LL) components of transient evoked OAEs (TEOAEs) as the reflection-type emission.LL TEOAEs and the nonlinear distortion OAEs were measured from adult ears. Individual input-output (I/O) functions were created, and OAE level was normalized by dividing by the stimulus level yielding individual gain functions. Peak strength, compression threshold, and OAE level at compression threshold were derived from individual gain functions to create joint reflection-distortion profiles.TEOAEs with a poststimulus window starting at 6 ms had I/O functions with compression characteristics similar to LL TEOAE components. The model fit the LL gain functions, which had R2 > .93, significantly better than the nonlinear distortion OAE gain functions, which had R2 = .596-.99. Interquartile ranges for joint reflection-distortion profiles were larger for compression threshold and OAE level at compression threshold but smaller for peak strength than those previously published.The gain function fits LL TEOAEs well. Joint reflection-distortion profiles are a promising method that could enhance diagnosis of hearing loss, and use of the LL TEOAE in the profile for peak strength may be important because of narrow interquartile ranges.https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.20323593.",

    "abstract": "Falling is a multifactorial condition that can cause severe injury and even death in older adults. Early identification of fall risk factors, as the first step of preventive health care, can assist in reducing the negative and often debilitating effects of falls in older adults. By using the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework to develop an ICF code set to identify fall risk factors in older adults, health care practitioners could obtain health information in a multidimensional way.This study describes the final phase of a comprehensive, three-phase, mixed-methods sequential study. For this third phase, a pre-post group design that focused on the audiologist's perceptions of the clinical utility of a newly developed ICF code set was employed. The questionnaire that was used for this purpose consisted of two distinct sections: clinical application and clinical utility (viz., appropriateness, accessibility, practicability, acceptability, and professional utility). Thirty practicing audiologists participated in the study. Data were analyzed for each of the two sections of the questionnaire.Results related to clinical application indicated that regardless of the audiologists' experience in routine fall risk assessment or fall risk factor identification, the use of the developed ICF code set increased their ability to correctly identify relevant clinical aspects. Results related to clinical utility showed high scores across all five measure components, with the highest clinical utility component being acceptability, closely followed by appropriateness and professional utility, and the lowest being accessibility.Several clinical implications have emerged from this study, including the usefulness of the ICF code set to identify and document fall risk factors in older adults, the code set's ability to guide audiologists to determine individualized assessment needs either by themselves or by other health care disciplines, and that the code set could be used by audiologists regardless of their experience in vestibular assessments.",

These days, it is getting harder and harder to imagine our professional lives without them. Along with other health-care professions, audiology has seen rapid, pervasive, and probably permanent changes in the use of digital technologies spurred on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of these changes were informed by prescient earlier research in teleaudiology, which tried to take advantage of new opportunities afforded by the Internet, to improve patient care delivery. In fact, five years ago, a Lancet report on global hearing health care already identified the Internet as a major potential resource for hearing health-care delivery and access, especially in low-income countries (Wilson et al., 2017). This special issue of the American Journal of Audiology serves to further support future research and clinical practices in teleaudiology with a collection of invited articles based on presentations and panel discussions at the 5th International Meeting on Internet and Audiology. The 5th International Meeting on Internet and Audiology took place in May 2021; it was hosted by the College of Health Sciences of Rush University in Chicago. This series of Internet and Audiology meetings is the only audiology conference series that has been dedicated exclusively to topics and issues in teleaudiology. Unlike the previous four meetings, which were primarily attended in-person, the 5th meeting was held entirely online because of pandemic-related restrictions. Interestingly, the online-only format boosted, rather than reduced, attendance and widened geographical representation of participants with more than 300 people from 31 countries taking part. The 4-day meeting focused on four major areas where research was deemed most needed to strengthen the effectiveness of Internet-based health applications in audiology: (a) patient-centered care and eHealth, (b) social media and hearing, (c) online audiologic rehabilitation, and (d) implementation science. These areas were introduced by keynote speakers who were experts in the topic area, some of whom came from other health-care disciplines. In addition to the keynote presentations, the meeting included seven thematic expert panels and 55 contributed asynchronous presentations. These presentations and panel recordings remain available on the meeting website: https://www.internetaudiology.com/2021. The articles in this special issue follow the meeting's themes. They illustrate the state-of-the-art research in teleaudiology and provide a broader historical context, perspective, and guidance for the development and implementation of novel methods of hearing health-care delivery. The articles in this issue are introduced below based on their subject area and are broadly depicted in a word cloud in Figure 1. Figure 1. A word cloud based on the abstracts of the articles in this special issue. Download figure Download PowerPoint Four articles offer perspectives and guidance on implementation of new technologies, while maintaining high standards for patient-centered care. Young et al. (2022) report on two case studies that illustrate a participatory action approach that explicitly takes patients' needs into account when designing interventions. Morgan et al. (2022) discuss the history of the codependent, and at times fraught, relationship between technology and clinical practice of audiology. The authors provide suggestions on how this relationship can be further improved to benefit both patients and clinicians. Abrams and Callahan (2022) examine why the use of teleaudiology has not increased as much as the use of telehealth services in other professions. They consider several theoretical models that can help us understand audiologist-specific factors that underlie this dynamic and suggest ways to increase the uptake of teleaudiology services in the future. Existing barriers to the use of evidence-based diagnostic and management strategies that utilize the Internet into clinical practice are further discussed by Studts (2022) in a tutorial on implementation science. Studts introduces concepts, themes, and frameworks of implementation science and discusses the use of evidence-based programs and practices in teleaudiology that can maximize their public health impact. One of the major benefits of providing audiological services over the Internet is the possibility of broader access to care through savings in cost, time, and effort. These benefits, however, come with a number of challenges, such as the need for Internet connectivity, patients' technological proficiency, lack of controlled environment, and device compatibility, all of which can undermine clinical outcomes. Ten articles in the special issue examine novel pathways to delivering hearing health care over the Internet. Six articles focus on online assessment and four on intervention and treatment. For nearly a century, pure-tone testing has been one of the main methods for screening and diagnosing hearing loss. Although it is typically performed by trained professionals using special purpose–calibrated equipment, Hazan et al. (2022) propose that pure-tone testing can also be performed by most people at home or in another quiet environment. Their article presents results of an initial validation of a custom iPhone application developed by their research group and indicates that outcomes are comparable to those obtained in clinical settings and have good test–retest reliability. Another promising approach to remote online assessment of hearing ability utilizes speech-in-noise testing. Rather than relying on absolute threshold levels, which are difficult to control across consumer electronic devices and test environments, the critical dependent variable is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Results from SNR tests seem both more resistant to presentation level differences across devices and also more representative of real-world listening environments. Several articles in the special issue highlight one such test, the digits-in-noise (DiN) test, which minimizes linguistic variability by using a small familiar vocabulary and minimizes working memory load by using only three digits on a given trial, while the SNR varies across trials. Using a DiN test, van der Mescht et al. (2022) conducted a validation study for a smartphone-based remote testing procedure in cochlear implant (CI) users in a clinical and a simulated home environment. Results indicated good correspondence across the two settings and good test–retest reliability, suggesting a possible use of the application by CI users for remote self-monitoring outside the clinical setting. Importantly, DiN testing appears to be quite robust to the effects of the test-taker's native language. Hisagi et al. (2022) investigated whether native language may affect performance of Spanish–English bilinguals on a comprehensive online battery of complex auditory processing and speech perception abilities. Results indicated that while monolingual and bilingual speakers did not differ in their spectrotemporal processing abilities, bilinguals who learned English at a later age performed more poorly than early bilingual or native English speakers on most speech perception tests, but not DiN. On the other hand, DiN test results may also reflect the influence of nonauditory factors. Goodwin et al. (2022) utilized the HearWHO smartphone DiN application developed by the World Health Organization to investigate associations between hearing and cognitive impairment, cardiovascular health, and psychosocial wellbeing among adults in the United Kingdom. Results showed that poorer cognitive status, less education, being female, a more sedentary lifestyle, and social isolation were the strongest nonauditory predictors of DiN thresholds. Thus, aspects of the test-taker's health status may also need to be considered when interpreting DiN test results. Another innovative approach to speech-in-noise testing is described by Lenatti et al. (2022), who used several multivariate machine learning (ML) models for detection of hearing loss based on data from a consonant–vowel–consonant test database obtained via a custom smartphone application. Findings indicated a satisfactory performance of the smartphone application in hearing loss detection using some ML models when compared to results of conventional pure-tone audiometry and suggest future ways this approach can be improved. In turn, Bruns et al. (2022) compared intelligibility scores obtained either by a human or a machine listener using automated speech recognition (ASR) with a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) application. The authors further examined the extent that intelligibility scores on sentences in the German Matrix Test may be affected by transmission line distortions that may arise due to low-quality communication systems. Their results indicate strong associations between human and ASR scores and provide a solid basis for further developing this technology for speech testing using everyday communication systems. As hearing aids remain the mainstay of audiological interventions, four articles in this issue address the outcomes of remote hearing aid services, which have become particularly relevant during the pandemic. Petrarca and Worthington (2022) attempt to leverage the greater reach of online services to overcome financial and logistical barriers to traditional in-person audiological care in a pediatric outreach program. The authors propose a six-section protocol that details the rationale and target population, necessary equipment, procedures for in-person hearing aid fittings, procedures for virtual follow-ups, outcome measures, and schedule of appointments. In turn, Arnold et al. (2022) investigated the feasibility of hybrid audiology services in a pilot study with first-time hearing aid users who received in-person hearing aid fittings and remote support follow-up visits on their personal smartphone device via the myPhonak application. The results indicated an average improvement on the self-reported Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly–Screening Version and Client Oriented Scale of Improvement outcomes in this group. In a larger cross-sectional study, Duckworth et al. (2022) compared groups of new and experienced adult hearing aid users who received hearing aid fittings via conventional, fully remote, and hybrid pathways. They report similar user outcomes and clinical efficiency across all pathways for experienced users. However, importantly, for new users, the hybrid and fully remote pathways were less efficient than the conventional pathway, and in the new user group, self-report outcomes were poorer for the fully remote pathway. Tye-Murray et al. (2022) investigated opinions of older adults who used a 4-week digital therapeutic software–based intervention following a remote fitting. Results indicated that most participants reported positive benefits, including an ability to engage in conversation, suggesting that outcomes of remote hearing aid fittings may continue to improve further with software-based rehabilitation. Well before the most recent rise in teleaudiology services, Internet-based treatments had been developed and used for the treatment of tinnitus. In a historical review, Andersson (2022) describes research and implementation of Internet-delivered audiology services over the last 20 years, focusing on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). He notes that despite a strong evidence base for applying Internet-delivered CBT, a number of barriers still exist for its wide adaptation by patients and clinicians and suggests specific steps and general directions for future research and clinical adaptation of Internet-delivered CBT for tinnitus. Finally, social media and online information is known to influence attitudes and opinions, and presumably health-care decisions. Thus, we can learn a lot from social media posts about a health topic. Here, Manchaiah et al. (2022) used natural language processing to examine Reddit social media posts to gain a better understanding of patients' needs and perspectives on tinnitus. Two key topics were identified: “tinnitus causes and consequences” and “tinnitus management and coping.” The authors conclude that their approach is valuable in identifying the concerns and issues of importance for patients. To that end, Ulep et al. (2022) conducted a broader systematic review of existing research studies related to social media use concerning hearing loss, tinnitus, and vestibular disorders. They note that social media is a powerful platform for exchange of condition-specific advice and development of supportive relationships needed to cope with chronic conditions. However, their results also indicate that all social media platforms examined contained misinformation that could negatively affect decision making and that misleading or incorrect information should be addressed to prevent harm and optimize public health outcomes. These findings underscore a larger point that while digital health innovations can improve patient care, it is also important to recognize the limitations of health information technology. This point was underscored by the World Health Organization in its resolution on Digital Health (WHO, 2018; WHA71.7), which states that “while technology and innovation can enhance health service capabilities, human interaction remains a key element to patients' wellbeing.” In the constant tension between quality and quantity, Internet-based audiologic services hold a promise of improving both by making it possible to reach more people in more places and provide them with higher quality hearing care. The articles in this Internet and Audiology special issue of AJA demonstrate that there are many exciting opportunities for assessment, treatment, and delivery of individually tailored patient-centered hearing care via teleaudiology and provide specific suggestions for their implementation. While much work remains before evidence-based online applications are used at scale by patients and clinicians, the current issue highlights some new ways Internet-based applications can help better meet the needs of audiology patients and improve hearing health in the population worldwide.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether the speech-evoked auditory brainstem responses (sABRs) obtained by stimulating the ear with normal sensitivity in children with unilateral hearing loss (UHL) were different from that of children with normal hearing (NH), and to explore correlations between the sABR findings and measures of reading.Eleven children with UHL and 11 children with NH were tested via the BioMARK sABR protocol using the syllable /da/; latency and amplitudes of Waves V, A, C, D, E, F, and O were measured. Participants also were tested on the Phonemic Synthesis Test (PST) and the Woodcock Reading Mastery Test-Revised (WRMT-R), particularly the Reading Readiness, Basic Skills, and Comprehension subtests.Multivariate analysis of variance testing showed a significantly higher amplitude for Wave A for the NH group as compared to the UHL group. Separate ANOVAs also found significantly lower scores for the UHL group compared to the NH group on Basic Skills and Comprehension subtests of the Woodcock. Significant positive Spearman rho correlations were found for the UHL group between wave amplitudes for V, A, and O and the Reading Readiness score, and between wave amplitudes for V, A, D, and O and the Reading Comprehension score. A significant correlation also was found between the Total Reading score and wave amplitudes for V and A. No such correlations were found between wave amplitude and Woodcock scores for the NH group. Further testing of the UHL data found significant relationships between the pure-tone average of the hearing loss ear and the Basic Skills, Comprehension, and Total Reading scores from the WRMT-R. There was also a significant correlation between the PST score and Wave C amplitude.There may be a connection between speech encoding and measures of reading in children with UHL.",

Both N1 and P2 waveforms were recorded for 50-ms frequency-modulated signals from normal hearing listeners. The standard stimuli for this investigation were continuous sweep tones with center frequencies of 1000 Hz that traversed a frequency range of 200 Hz in a single step. The rare stimuli were signals that traversed the same frequency range in two, four, six, or eight discrete steps. Results suggest that for the 10 participants, 1) the mean MMN peak-to-peak amplitude and mean area decreased significantly with decreases in step duration, 2) MMN area amplitude was the best indicator of psychophysical performance for the two magnitude measures, and 3) MMN onsets and peak latencies did not show either a significant increase or decrease in latency as step duration decreased.",

This equipment should be certified annually and traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and its use generally restricts calibration to a laboratory environment and requires a considerable amount of time. We have developed a simplified method for calibrating the sound-level meter by using a sound-level calibrator and microphone. Using the known sensitivities of the microphone and the artificial mastoid, the sound-level calibrator used for calibration of the microphone may also be used for calibration of the sound-level meter to measure force levels with the artificial mastoid.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study was to determine if re-instructing a hearing aid (HA) user on the specific skill(s) they could not successfully perform on the Practical Hearing Aid Skills Test–Revised (PHAST-R) resulted in better HA use and care skills than a traditional fitting method. This is referred to as “targeted re-instruction.” Also, factors that might affect HA use and care skills, including memory function, hearing handicap, and hearing aid–related attitudes, were assessed. Method This study was a randomized control trial. Twenty-six new HA users (13 experimental; 13 control) were fit with HAs and provided a standard HA orientation. HA use and care skills were measured immediately following the HA fitting and then again at 4 weeks post-HA fitting. The experimental group was administered the PHAST-R twice during the trial period to identify the HA use and care skills that participants needed re-instruction on. Results Participants in the experimental group maintained their HA use and care skills over the 4-week HA trial period, whereas participants in the control group showed a significant decline. Working memory, hearing handicap, and HA-related attitudes were not found to be correlated with HA use and care skills. Conclusions Participants who did not receive targeted re-instruction showed a decline in their HA use and care skills after only 4 weeks of HA use, whereas targeted re-instruction prevented a decline in HA use and care skills. It took an average of less than 10 min to administer the PHAST-R and provide targeted re-instruction, indicating that it would be appropriate to use in a clinical setting.",

    "abstract": "Purpose We compared frequency difference limens (FDLs) in normal-hearing listeners under two listening conditions: sequential and simultaneous. Method Eighteen adult listeners participated in three experiments. FDL was measured using a method of limits for comparison frequency. In the sequential listening condition, the tones were presented with a half-second time interval in between, but for the simultaneous listening condition, the tones were presented simultaneously. For the first experiment, one of four reference tones (125, 250, 500, or 750 Hz), which was presented to the left ear, was paired with one of four starting comparison tones (250, 500, 750, or 1000 Hz), which was presented to the right ear. The second and third experiments had the same testing conditions as the first experiment except with two- and three-tone complexes, comparison tones. The subjects were asked if the tones sounded the same or different. When a subject chose “different,” the comparison frequency decreased by 10% of the frequency difference between the reference and comparison tones. FDLs were determined when the subjects chose “same” 3 times in a row. Results FDLs were significantly broader (worse) with simultaneous listening than with sequential listening for the two- and three-tone complex conditions but not for the single-tone condition. The FDLs were narrowest (best) with the three-tone complex under both listening conditions. FDLs broadened as the testing frequencies increased for the single tone and the two-tone complex. The FDLs were not broadened at frequencies &gt; 250 Hz for the three-tone complex. Conclusion The results suggest that sequential and simultaneous frequency discriminations are mediated by different processes at different stages in the auditory pathway for complex tones, but not for pure tones.",

Method It was a cross-sectional correlational descriptive study. Hearing thresholds (250–16000 Hz), transient evoked OAEs, and distortion product OAEs were evaluated in 225 adolescents (450 ears) aged 14 and 15 years. The ears were split into two groups: Group 1 had thresholds ≤ 21 dB HL in all frequencies, and Group 2 had thresholds &gt; 21 dB HL in at least one. Exposure to music was evaluated through a questionnaire. Results Statistically significant differences were found in both ears between Groups 1 and 2. A notch at 3000–6000 Hz was noted in both groups. Group 2 showed a progressive threshold increase from 9000 Hz. Amplitude decrease, negative values, absent distortion product OAEs, and transient evoked OAEs were noted even in Group 1. A statistically significant association between Groups 1 and 2 and the presence/absence of OAEs was observed in most frequencies. Ears with moderate or high exposure to music had greater hearing thresholds compared to ears with low exposure at most frequencies; this was more evident in Group 1. Regarding exposure to music and OAEs, no significant differences were found between the exposure categories. Conclusions The findings highlight the value of implementing hearing conservation programs in Argentina, analyzing hearing tests correlated with questionnaires about recreational noise exposure in order to detect vulnerable ears early.",

    "abstract": "This study examined medication use by individuals with tinnitus who were seeking help for their tinnitus by means of a psychological intervention.This study used a cross-sectional survey design and included individuals with tinnitus enrolled in an Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy trial (n = 439). Study participants provided demographic details, completed various structured questionnaires and provided details about the medications used. The self-reported medications were classified using the United States Pharmacopeial Medicare Model Guidelines v7.0.Current medication use was reported by 67% (n = 293) of the study participants. Those currently using medication were older; had consulted their primary care physician, had greater tinnitus severity, depression, anxiety, and insomnia when compared with those not reporting any current medication use. The top 10 medication used included cardiovascular agents (n = 162; 55.3%), antidepressants (n = 80; 27.3%), electrolytes/minerals/metals/vitamins (n = 70; 23.9%), respiratory tract/pulmonary agents (n = 62; 21.2%), anxiolytics (n = 59; 20.1%), hormonal agents/stimulant/replacement/modifying (thyroid; n = 45; 15.4%), gastrointestinal agents (n = 43; 14.7%), analgesics (n = 33; 11.3%), blood glucose regulators (n = 32; 10.9%), and anticonvulsants (n = 26; 8.87%). Some associations between type of medication used and demographic or tinnitus-related variables were noted especially for the cardiovascular agents, electrolytes/minerals/metals/vitamins, and anxiolytics.This exploratory study indicated a large percentage of patients using medication and a range of medications. Further studies are required to assess the effects of such medications on the tinnitus percept and concurrent medication moderate treatment effects.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to use qualitative research methods to explore connections between audiologists' lived experiences and perceptions of the future and change.This research was based on a constructivist grounded theory approach. A semistructured interview guide inspired 30 audiologists to share their stories via virtual interview. A theoretical framework evolved from grounded theory analysis techniques.The majority of audiologists interviewed in this study entered audiology via the undergraduate-stumble pathway, usually after leaving speech-language pathology. This pathway was associated with poorer perceptions of the future compared with early-purposeful and later-purposeful pathways. Generation differences, value juxtaposition, professional identity, and student debt also influenced perspectives of the future. Participants described high value-of-self relative to patient care and joy stories associated with meaningful relationships with patients. Most participants reported responding actively to changes in the marketplace at the individual work setting level; however, change response was complex and difficult to quantify when broader issues impacting the profession were considered. Participants expressed concern about the future, including the need to address high student debt, perceived lack of unity across the profession, and value-by-others.Grounded theory exploration of the lived experience of 30 audiologists supported a theoretical framework that connects perceptions of the future with origin story, generation perspectives, value juxtaposition, professional identity, and student debt.",

    "abstract": "Although many of the papers at this congress were reiterations of previous work, or at least variations on the same theme, there were a number of new and exciting findings. Examples of these were the papers on the role of cochlear efferents in noise-induced hearing loss by the French researchers Pujol and Puel, the work of Al-Masri and his colleagues on underwater hearing thresholds, the work of Edworthy on warning signals, the sleep study by Ollerhead, and the Munich Airport study by Hygge et al . One cannot help but notice that the majority of the presentations, especially the most innovative and important ones, were given by non-U.S. researchers. This is also true of the activities in the international standards arena. It is quite clear that the United States has taken a back seat in noise effects research and regulation. Greater involvement and support by ASHA would be useful, but without federal government interest and support, the situation is unlikely to change.",

    "abstract": "The methods that have been described, although still under development, are intended to demonstrate that the issues of sound quality, speech intelligibility, and loudness may be addressed in a clinical setting in a reasonable amount of time. Being automated, these methods are relatively time-efficient, and may become more so as they are refined. Being database oriented, these methods make it easy to monitor individual clients over time, and also provide an efficient way to evaluate the success rate of individual circuits across listeners with similar hearing losses. Individually, these techniques provide only some of the information that may indicate whether a particular fitting may succeed. Taken together, these behavioral methods will provide a great deal of both subjective and objective information that will help the dispenser not only decide which of several hearing aids may be best for a user, but also how a given instrument may be adjusted to provide the maximum benefit. By including the formal assessment of sound quality, speech intelligibility, and loudness in the hearing aid evaluation, the needs of the user are more likely to be met, and the degree of satisfaction achieved is likely to be higher than if the evaluation consists solely of matching the real ear insertion response to a prescribed target.",

To determine the consequences of ABR testing with an uncushioned earphone, adults were tested with and without the cushion, and probe-tube sound measurements were made. Although removing the cushion results in substantial signal attenuation below 1 kHz, there is little effect on the click-elicited ABR.",
