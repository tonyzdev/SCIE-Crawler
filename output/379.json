    "abstract": "More than 200 mutations are associated with antiretroviral resistance to drugs belonging to six licensed antiretroviral classes. More than 50 reverse transcriptase mutations are associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance including M184V, thymidine analog mutations, mutations associated with non-thymidine analog containing regimens, multi-nucleoside resistance mutations, and several recently identified accessory mutations. More than 40 reverse transcriptase mutations are associated with nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance including major primary and secondary mutations, non-polymorphic minor mutations, and polymorphic accessory mutations. More than 60 mutations are associated with protease inhibitor resistance including major protease, accessory protease, and protease cleavage site mutations. More than 30 integrase mutations are associated with the licensed integrase inhibitor raltegravir and the investigational inhibitor elvitegravir. More than 15 gp41 mutations are associated with the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide. CCR5 inhibitor resistance results from mutations that promote gp120 binding to an inhibitor-bound CCR5 receptor or CXCR4 tropism; however, the genotypic correlates of these processes are not yet well characterized.",

    "abstract": "Because of the limited tropism of HIV, in vivo modeling of this virus has been almost exclusively limited to other lentiviruses, such as simian immunodeficiency virus, that reproduce many important characteristics of HIV infection. However, there are significant genetic and biological differences among lentiviruses and some HIV-specific interventions are not effective against other lentiviruses in nonhuman hosts. For these reasons, much emphasis has recently been placed on developing alternative animal models that support HIV replication and recapitulate key aspects of HIV infection and pathogenesis in humans. Humanized mice, CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cell transplanted immunodeficient mice, and in particular mice also implanted with human thymus/liver tissue (bone marrow liver thymus mice) that develop a functional human immune system, have been the focus of a great deal of attention as possible models to study virtually all aspects of HIV biology and pathogenesis. Humanized mice are systemically reconstituted with human lymphoid cells, offering rapid, reliable, and reproducible experimental systems for HIV research. Peripheral blood of humanized mice can be readily sampled longitudinally to assess reconstitution with human cells and to monitor HIV replication, permitting the evaluation of multiple parameters of HIV infection such as viral load levels, CD4+ T-cell depletion, immune activation, as well as the effects of therapeutic interventions. Of high relevance to HIV transmission is the extensive characterization and validation of the reconstitution with human lymphoid cells of the female reproductive tract and of the gastrointestinal tract of humanized bone marrow liver thymus mice that renders them susceptible to both vaginal and rectal HIV infection. Other important attributes of all types of humanized mice include: (i) their small size and cost that make them widely accessible; (ii) multiple cohorts of humanized mice can be made from multiple human donors and each cohort has identical human cells, permitting control of intragenetic variables; (iii) continuous de novo production of human immune cells from the transplanted CD34+ cells within each humanized mouse facilitates long-term experiments; (iv) both primary and laboratory HIV isolates can be used for experiments; and (v) in addition to therapeutic interventions, rectal and vaginal HIV prevention approaches can be studied. In summary, humanized mice can have an important role in virtually all aspects of HIV research, including the analysis of HIV replication, the evaluation of HIV restriction factors, the characterization of successful biomedical HIV prevention strategies, the evaluation of new treatment regimens, and the evaluation of novel HIV eradication strategies.",

    "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric adverse events (NPAEs) observed with the integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) dolutegravir (DTG) are usually mild to moderate. The most prevalent symptoms are insomnia and sleep disorders, but the spectrum also includes dizziness, anxiety, depression, headache, paraesthesia, muscle-skeletal pain, poor concentration, and slow thinking. In recent cohort studies involving >6400 patients in different countries, discontinuation rates due to NPAEs were observed in around 3.5% (range, 1.4-7.2%) of subjects treated with DTG. These rates have been higher than those seen in randomized clinical trials and were also higher than with other INSTIs such as elvitegravir or raltegravir. Elderly, female patients and those who initiate abacavir simultaneously appear to be more vulnerable in some cohorts. It remains unclear if NPAEs are driven by an increased DTG exposure. With heightened awareness of health-care providers and patients, reports of NPAEs will probably increase in the future.",

    "abstract": "Each viral particle of HIV-1, the infectious agent of AIDS, contains two copies of the full-length viral genomic RNA. Encapsidating two copies of genomic RNA is one of the characteristics of the retrovirus family. The two RNA molecules are both positive-sense and often identical; furthermore, each RNA encodes the full complement of genetic information required for viral replication. The two strands of RNA are intricately entwined within the core of the mature infectious virus as a ribonuclear complex with the viral proteins, including nucleocapsid. Multiple steps in the biogenesis of the genomic full-length RNA are involved in achieving this location and dimeric state. The viral sequences and proteins involved in the process of RNA dimerization, both for the initial interstrand contact and subsequent steps that result in the condensed, stable conformation of the genomic RNA, are outlined in this review. In addition, the impact of the dimeric state of HIV-1 viral RNA is discussed with respect to its importance in efficient viral replication and, consequently, the potential development of antiviral strategies designed to disrupt the formation of dimeric RNA.",

    "abstract": "Screening and treating correctional populations for HIV and HCV infections is essential to successfully addressing both epidemics in the USA. The prevalence of HIV and HCV infection is high in prisons and jails due to increased rates of incarceration among disproportionately affected groups such as injection drug users. Through a search of the published and grey literature and surveying persons overseeing health programs in prisons, we collected data on efforts to determine prevalence first for HIV and then for HCV. Prevalence of both infections varies geographically and temporally, reflecting epidemics in the community as well as local law enforcement policies. We estimate that seroprevalence of HCV in 2015 for persons in U.S. prisons averaged 18%, over tenfold greater than HIV. For both, transmission and acquisition during incarceration are rare. Screening can identify previously undetected cases: the efficiency of a testing strategy depends on local conditions. Universal opt-out screening of entrants is usually best as conducting risk-based screening has challenges. With HCV, the advent of highly effective regimens makes cure feasible. Treatment within facilities has the potential to reduce HCV incidence and disease burden in the community, especially in difficult-to-reach populations. The extraordinarily high cost of HCV treatment regimens and lack of political will are the main barriers to treatment expansion. Just as community-wide HIV viral suppression has required correctional/community coordination, elimination of HCV infection in the USA will depend on a thoughtful, well-funded effort to manage this disease in populations interacting with the criminal justice system.",

    "abstract": "Toward the end of the year 2019, there was the eruption of an acute respiratory syndrome, which is widely referred as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from Wuhan, Hubei Province. The disease causes a range of respiratory illnesses, which are fatal. The COVID-19 disease has spread globally and has significantly impacted the health delivery systems, travel regulations, and economic activities and has posed and upsurge of responsibilities for the frontline healthcare workers. Due to the nature of the COVID-19 disease, it has typically caused complications which include pneumonia, multiple organ dysfunction together with renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. As of date, there is no approved vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 though there are ongoing research studies to formulate a treatment. COVID-19 is highly contagious, and the risk of infection is higher for patients with immunesuppressed patients than regular patients. The immunesuppressed conditions include cancer, HIV, and patients with solid organ transplants (SOT). This paper aims to review the risk and impact of COVID-19 on immunesuppressed patients, with a focus on cancer, HIV, and patients with SOT and the essence of special parameters for their care and management. Despite the fatal effects of this global pandemic, the findings of this study indicate the high risk which immunosuppressed patients have to contract the disease; thus, the governments and health delivery systems have to offer them extra support and treatment.

    "abstract": "Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have become the second in the global rating of infectious diseases after respiratory infections. Globally, over 1 million, new STI is diagnosed every day. Although four conditions are the most representative and of obligatory declaration (gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, and human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]), there are many other prevalent STI, including trichomona, herpes simplex, papillomavirus, and viral hepatitis. Herein, we perform a narrative and retrospective review, analyzing information from public databases from distinct Spanish government institutions. STI significantly declined in Spain during 2020 as a result of lockdown and social isolation measures dictated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. After releasing restrictions, a major STI rebound occurred in 2021. Increases were 49% for gonorrhea, 45% for HIV, 39% for chlamydia, and 32% for syphilis. Based on nationwide statistics, we build a narrative review of the recent STI surge after COVID-19. In summary, we propose a holistic approach to confront the current re-emergence of STI. On one hand, new innovative medical advances must be implemented, including new rapid tests, novel vaccines, pre-exposure prophylaxis beyond HIV, and long-acting antivirals. On the other hand, information to citizens needs to be reformulated with interventions aimed to build a healthier society, alike it has been undertaken with tobacco, alcohol, diet, and lifestyle. STI determines important sexual, reproductive, and maternal-child health consequences. To promote human well-being or flourishing, the education of adolescents and young adults should be aligned with human ecology. Therefore, it is urgent to address new approaches in sexual health that represent a clear benefit for individual persons and society. In this way, favoring a cultural evolution aimed to delay the age of first sexual intercourse and the avoidance of multiple sex partners should be prioritized.",

This study uses the UNAIDS 90-90-90 program to evaluate the HIV current situation in MENA countries, and understand the challenges that exist in the way of approaching the program goals. All articles and publications were searched based on the 90-90-90 program indexes among national and international data resources such as official national reports and online scientific databases such as PubMed, Medline, and Scopus up to December 2017. The data were categorized into four main stages: (1) estimated number of HIV-positive people (people living with HIV [PLWH]); (2) PLWH who know their status; (3) PLWH receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART); and (4) virally suppressed PLWH. A total of 41 papers were included in the study. 19 out of 24 MENA countries have met the inclusion criteria. The proportion of diagnosed people ranges from 6% in Pakistan to 76% in Algeria. The percentage of diagnosed people receiving ART ranges between 7% in Pakistan and 86% in Algeria. Viral suppression levels vary from 4% to 72% in Pakistan and Kuwait, respectively. Lack of appropriate surveillance systems, low access to HIV-care facilities along with complicated socioeconomic and geopolitical situation of the region have made it challenging for MENA countries to reach 90-90-90 goals by 2020. To achieve these goals, the foremost strategy is global effort to establish peace in this region and rebuild the infrastructure in the countries involved in war and to setup comprehensive surveillance systems in the majority of the MENA countries.",

    "abstract": "Vaccines and antivirals are the classical weapons deployed to contain, prevent, and treat life-threatening viral illnesses. Specifically, for SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccines protect against severe COVID-19 disease manifestations and complications. However, waning immunity and emergence of vaccine escape mutants remains a growing threat. This is highlighted by the current surge of the omicron COVID-19 variant. Thus, there is a race to find treatment alternatives. We contend that oral small molecule antivirals that halt SARSCoV- 2 infection are essential. Compared to currently available monoclonal antibodies and remdesivir, where parenteral administration is required, oral antivirals offer treatments in an outpatient setting with dissemination available on a larger scale. In response to this need at 2021's end, regulatory agencies provided emergency use authorization for both molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir. These medicines act on the viral polymerase and protease, respectively. Each is given for 5 days and can reduce disease progression by 30% and 89%, respectively. The advent of additional oral antivirals, the assessment of combination therapies, the formulation of extended-release medications, and their benefit for both early treatment and prophylaxis will likely transform the landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

These sequelae remind the constellation of clinical manifestations previously recognized as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). This condition has been described following distinct infectious events, mostly acute viral illnesses. In this way, the pathophysiology of PACS might overlap with mechanisms involved in other post-infectious fatigue syndromes. The risk of PACS is more frequent in women than men. Additional host genetic factors could be involved. There is a dysregulation of multiple body organs and systems, involving the immune system, the coagulation cascade, endocrine organs, autonomic nervous system, microbiota-gut-brain axis, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, etc. Hypothetically, an abnormal response to certain infectious agents could trigger the development of postinfectious fatigue syndromes.",

To analyze the current knowledge on this topic, MEDLINE files were searched for articles dealing with any manifestation of sexual dysfunction in the HAART era. Selected references from these articles as well as communications to the main HIV meetings were also reviewed. Sexual dysfunction seems to be a very common event after the introduction of HAART. The average prevalences of sexual dysfunction among the different studies was 51%, erectile dysfunction 46%, decreased libido 44%, ejaculatory disturbances 39% and orgasmic disorders 27%. These disturbances seemed to be more common in patients treated with protease inhibitors. Several relevant questions related to sexual dysfunction in these patients are addressed in this review, including the possible pathogenic mechanisms involved. Despite the inconsistent results among the studies, the data that support a direct or indirect role of HAART in the generation of these disturbances seem to exceed the data that do not support it. As a conclusion, antiretroviral therapy, particularly protease inhibitors, seems to be to some extent directly or indirectly related to sexual dysfunction through different mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The HIV-1 Gag protein assembles into immature capsids when expressed in human cells. Although self-assembly of Gag was once thought to be sufficient to explain capsid formation, in the past decade it has become increasingly apparent that in cells, the pathway from Gag synthesis to assembled capsids is coordinated and facilitated by host factors. These cellular factors likely direct the trafficking, membrane targeting, and multimerization of Gag, and could also assist with encapsidation of viral RNA. While some of these factors have been identified, much remains to be learned about the mechanisms by which they act to promote capsid formation. Moreover, studies suggest that the amount of intracellular Gag undergoing assembly per se at any given time may be quite low, with the majority of Gag in some cell types undergoing degradation or representing Gag that remains cell-associated after assembly. If this model holds true, then defining the Gag subpopulations on which individual cellular factors act will be important for understanding the rqle of host factors. Towards this end, it will be important to find markers and features that can distinguish subpopulations of Gag destined for different outcomes so that these populations can be quantified and tracked separately both at the biochemical and microscopic level. Thus, the challenge for the future will be to understand which cellular factors act during the pathway from Gag synthesis to assembly, and exactly where and how they act in this pathway.",

A systematic review was conducted on studies that use apps to improve self-management among HIV-positive patients, using PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Science direct, UpToDate, and Web of Science databases. The search was limited to English-written articles and published in the past 10 years. A search of Google Play for Android and App Store for iOS devices was performed to find the apps identified in the included articles. Concerning the aim of this study, the target populations of 17 identified HIV-apps were found to be mainly directed at PLHIV (n = 15). Furthermore, the objectives of 17 identified HIV-apps were found to self-care, self-monitoring, and self-management (n = 7), improve medication adherence (n = 5), prevention and treatment (n = 5), adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) (n = 4), Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management (n = 1), and support safer conception among HIV couples (n = 1). The operating system of most HIV-apps was Android (n = 15), one app for iOS and seven apps was both of them, and most apps were free (n = 19). The findings indicate that mHealth strategies for PLHIV have had a substantial positive effect on ART, drug adherence, prevention, and treatment, as well as social and behavioral problems affecting PLHIV.

Factors associated with weight gain in PLWH are multifactorial and include demographics, HIV disease-related, lifestyle, cultural, and antiretroviral therapy (ART)-associated factors. All these confounding factors make it difficult to interpret the potential link between ARVs and weight gain. In antiretroviral treatment- experienced PLWH, confounding factors such as the return to normal health or the advanced stage of disease can be ruled out compared to naïve patients which somewhat facilitates the interpretation of weight gain. Weight gain after ART switch is modest, not generally a big concern in clinical practice in this population and correlated more strongly with baseline regimen, especially after the stop of TDF or EFV, than with sex-, race-, or HIV-related factors. It remains uncertain whether this is due to the loss of a weight suppressive effect of prior regimens with older agent such as TDF or EFV or a weight gain effect of the newer regimens especially TAF and/or INSTI, or both. The mechanisms linked to weight gain attributed to the new ARVs as well as its possible reversibility are not yet elucidated. Clinicians who switched ARV regimen of experienced PLWH should be aware of this side effect and of this potentially consequences on the global health.",

    "abstract": "Long coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a complex, multifactorial condition characterized by persistent symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks following acute severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood, but chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, autoimmunity, and viral persistence are increasingly being implicated. This study investigated the immunopathological drivers of long COVID-19 and their associations with clinical manifestations and organ damage. A prospective, longitudinal cohort study was conducted on 200 COVID-19 survivors aged 18-65 years, in which immune markers, autoantibody profiles, lymphocyte dysfunction, and imaging findings were assessed over a 12-month period. Persistent inflammation was observed, with elevated interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor α ± levels correlated with lung fibrosis and cognitive impairment. Autoantibodies were detected in 40% of the participants, particularly those with cardiovascular and neurological symptoms. A significant reduction in CD8+ T-cell counts was associated with severe fatigue and cognitive dysfunction, whereas persistent SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified in 10% of cases, primarily in individuals with gastrointestinal symptoms. Imaging studies revealed multiorgan involvement, with structural abnormalities in the lungs, heart, and brain. These findings highlight the interplay of immune dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and autoimmunity in long-term COVID-19, underscoring the need for targeted therapeutic strategies to address its long-term health impacts.",

    "abstract": "People with HIV infection have several risk factors for developing neuropsychiatric adverse events: preexisting conditions, HIV disease stage, and antiretroviral treatment. The most widely used system for assessing neuropsychiatric adverse events in clinical trials is the US Division of AIDS severity grading scale, from Grade 1 (mild) to Grade 4 (life-threatening). First-line treatment with efavirenz has been associated with higher rates of neuropsychiatric adverse events than several other antiretrovirals. A MEDLINE search identified 17 randomized clinical trials of first-line HAART with two nucleoside analogs plus efavirenz, of which 13 reported neuropsychiatric adverse events using the Grade 1-4 system. The percentage of patients with graded neuropsychiatric adverse events, and the system used for analysis, was compared across the trials. Of the 13 trials identified, there were five different methods used to report neuropsychiatric adverse events: Grade 1-4 all, Grade 1-4 drug related, Grade 2-4 all, Grade 2-4 drug related, Grade 3-4 all, Grade 3-4 drug related, and adverse events leading to discontinuation. In addition, three trials used questionnaire-based methods instead of the Division of AIDS grading system. There were a significantly higher percentage of patients with Grade 1-4 neurological or psychiatric adverse events in the efavirenz versus comparator arms in the DMP-006, TMC278-C204, and STARTMRK trials. There were generally too few patients with each individual neuropsychiatric adverse event to allow meaningful comparisons of treatment arms. There were no significant differences in Grade 3 or 4 neuropsychiatric adverse events between the treatment arms in the ACTG 5142 or 2NN trials. In summary, there is a wide range of different systems used to report neuropsychiatric adverse events in HIV clinical trials. Use of a standardized endpoint would improve the interpretability of results across clinical trials.",

Both HIV and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 have evolved a complex genetic organization for optimal use of their limited genome and production of all necessary structural and regulatory proteins. Use of alternative splicing is essential for balanced expression of multiple viral regulators from one genomic polycistronic RNA. In addition, nuclear export of incompletely spliced RNA is required for production of structural and enzymatic proteins and virus particles. Decisions controlling these events are largely guarded by viral proteins. In human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1, Rex and p30 are both nuclear/nucleolar RNA binding regulatory proteins. Rex interacts with a Rex-responsive element to stimulate nuclear export of incompletely spliced RNA and increase production of virus particles. In contrast, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 p30 is involved in the nuclear retention of the tax/rex mRNA leading to inhibition of virus expression and establishment of viral latency. How these two proteins, with apparently opposite functions, orchestrate virus replication and ensure vigilant control of viral gene expression is discussed.",

We systematically reviewed published studies examining mtDNA haplogroups in HIV-infected persons to summarize reported outcome associations, and to highlight potential future research directions. We identified 21 articles published from 2005-2013. Multiple different phenotypes were studied; most were antiretroviral therapy associated metabolic outcomes (e.g. lipodystrophy, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia). Haplogroup H was associated with the most outcomes, including AIDS progression, CD4 T-cell recovery, cirrhosis (in hepatitis C coinfection), and metabolic outcomes. This review is the first to focus on the emerging area of mtDNA haplogroups in HIV, and summarizes the published literature on associations between mtDNA haplogroups and clinical outcomes in populations of European and African descent. Several reported associations require replication and ideally biological verification before definitive conclusions can be drawn, but research in this area has the potential to explain outcome disparities and impact clinical management of patients.",

    "abstract": "Sierra Leone is a low-income West African country that has dealt with waves of economic, political, and public health challenges in its recent past, including a decade-long brutal civil war and the Ebola epidemic of 2014-2016. The HIV/AIDS epidemic, which has raged on in the country since 1987, has long been characterized as stable. The latest UNAIDS report estimates a countrywide HIV prevalence rate of 1.7% in 2016 among adults aged 15-49 years. However, there are indications that the epidemic may be in fact escalating and unless arrested urgently, has the potential to deteriorate into a major public health emergency. Although there are high levels of HIV awareness among adults (over 94%), uptake in voluntary HIV testing has remained low (<30%), and under one-third (29%) of the country's 60,000 people living with HIV/AIDS were on antiretroviral therapy in 2015. This review attempts to address the paucity of scientific information on the subject by presenting the historical and epidemiological background to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Sierra Leone. Other aspects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Sierra Leone are examined, including routine HIV screening and diagnosis, linkage to and retention in HIV care, clinical characteristics and molecular epidemiology, treatment coverage, and prevention strategies. Finally, we identify four key areas of challenge that are hampering current efforts attempting to bring the epidemic under control, and perspective is offered on the way forward.",

Despite huge global incidence, STIs remain as neglected diseases. The success of antiretrovirals for halting progression to AIDS in HIV-infected individuals and for stopping HIV transmission to uninfected contacts, either as pre- or post-exposure -prophylaxis, has to lead to increased risky sexual behaviors through risk compensation. Recent epidemics and outbreaks of STIs among men having sex with men reflect the global loss of fear to HIV/AIDS. The -alarming rising rates of STIs worldwide have been fueled by: (1) rapid spread of drug resistance, that is, for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Mycoplasma genitalium; (2) unprecedented impact of recreational drugs (chemsex) and internet (apps, websites) for facilitating exposure to multiple sex partners; and (3) growing rates of sexual violence and commercial sex, associated with wars, refugees, migrations, traveling, and sexual tourism. Moreover, there is an increasing appreciation of sexual transmission for other agents, -including human T-lymphotropic virus type 1, hepatitis A and C viruses, Zika, and Ebola. For addressing this new scenario for STIs, an expert panel workshop was arranged in Madrid, Spain in May 2018. This review summarizes the discussions at the meeting.",

However, other neurological syndromes can be either associated with HAM/TSP or occur in isolation in the HTLV-1 infected individual. Although this fact has been widely described over the years, it has been somewhat neglected by the mainstream literature, which has been largely focused on HAM/TSP. Cognitive dysfunction, encephalopathy, neurogenic bladder, motor neuron disease, inflammatory myopathies, polyneuropathy, and dysautonomia can also occur in the HTLV-1 infected patient and may remain unnoticed to the unsuspecting physician.

Later, the Partners of People on ART-A New Evaluation of the Risks (PARTNER) and the opposites attract studies, which first involved a large number of men who have sex with men (MSM), also showed no transmission, even in condomless receptive anal intercourse (CLAI). In this article, we first review the major studies' data showing the efficacy of ART in HIV transmission in serodiscordant couples at public health scale. Second, we discuss the implications and challenges behind the treatment as prevention strategy regarding the 90-90-90 UNAIDS targets to end the HIV epidemic.We now have strong evidence that ART reduces the risk of transmission of HIV from a positive partner to their negative partner.

    "abstract": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) inhibits HIV replication but does not eradicate the latent reservoir. The previous research suggests that earlier ART initiation provides benefit on limiting reservoir size, but timing and extent of this effect remain unclear. Analytic treatment interruption (ATI) may be used to demonstrate HIV remission, but whether early ART also improves likelihood or duration of even temporary virologic remission is unclear. This review seeks to answer both questions. We performed a systematic review and analysis following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines and included 21 interventional or observational studies with sufficient HIV reservoir outcomes. We also aggregated reservoir outcomes and transformed data into approximate measurements of total HIV DNA per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells and analyzed the correlation between timing of ART initiation and reservoir size. People living with HIV who initiate ART in primary infection maintain smaller reservoirs on suppressive ART than those who initiate treatment during chronic infection. The reduction of reservoir is most pronounced when ART is started within 2 weeks of HIV acquisition. Across studies, we found a moderately strong association between longer time to ART initiation and reservoir size, which was strongest when measured after 1 year on ART (Pearson's r = 0.69, p = 0.0003). After ATI, larger pre-ATI reservoir size predicts shorter time to viral rebound. Early ART may also facilitate long-term control of viremia. Although achieving sustained HIV remission will require further interventions, initiating ART very early in infection could limit the extent of the reservoir and also lead to post-ATI control in rare cases.",

Imprisonment is an important risk factor for contracting TB, especially among those living with HIV. This systematic review summarizes the available data on the prevalence of TB among HIV-positive prisoners; which may support improved targeted TB/HIV prevention plans. We electronically examined published studies up to December 2017 with the aim of finding articles that investigated the prevalence of TB in HIV-positive prisoners. MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Embase, and Web of Science electronic databases were searched with no restriction on language or time. A random effects model was used to conduct the meta-analysis and generate a summary estimate for the global prevalence of TB among HIV-positive prisoners; and subgroup estimates by continent. The meta-analysis included 22 studies published from 1992 to 2016. In total, 2,465 articles were retrieved and 22 papers met inclusion criteria. Eligible papers contained 220,101 prisoners, with 1,611 cases of TB in 6,126 HIV-positive subjects. Globally, the pooled prevalence of TB in HIV-positive prisoners was 32.6% [95% confidence interval (CI): 27.5% to 38.2%; p-value for heterogeneity=0.001]. Results of the subgroup analysis by continent were as follows: Africa, 14% (CI: 8% to 24%); North/South America, 37% (CI: 31% to 44%); Asia, 35% (CI: 12% to 68%); and Europe, 25% (CI: 12% to 45%).The prevalence of TB among HIV-positive prisoners is high worldwide. Screening of TB in this population is essential for the treatment of both diseases. Syndemics of TB and HIV in prisoners during the past three decades have created an alarming situation across the world. Hence, coordinated policies are essential for the early identification and effective treatment of this vulnerable population.",

Third, we discuss common measurement techniques that quantify the magnitude of non-adherence, their relative advantages and limitations in current practice. From January to May 2018, we reviewed guidelines, standard operating procedures, journal articles, and book chapters on treatment adherence among HIV patients receiving adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) globally. We searched PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews with the search terms \"adherence,\" \"adherence behavior,\" \"medication adherence,\" and \"HIV patients,\" or \"HIV/AIDS,\" and \"Antiretroviral Therapy\" or \"ART\" or \"ARVs\" or \"highly active ART \" from 2000 to 2017.

    "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) was isolated in AIDS patients in 1986. Around 1-2 million people are infected worldwide. The virus is less transmissible than HIV-1, being sexual contacts the most frequent route of acquisition. In the absence of antiretroviral therapy, most HIV-2 carriers will develop AIDS; however, it takes longer than in HIV-1 infection. There is no global pandemic caused by HIV-2, as the virus is largely confined to West Africa. Due to historical ties, HIV-2 is also prevalent in Portugal and its former colonies in Brazil, India, Mozambique, and Angola. Other European countries with hundreds to thousands of HIV-2 infections are France, Belgium, and Spain. A few hundred have been reported in North America, mostly in West African foreigners. Globally, HIV-2 infections are steadily declining. Although CD4 declines occur more slowly in HIV-2 than in HIV-1 patients, the CD4 recovery with antiretroviral treatment is smaller in the former. HIV-2 is naturally resistant to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and some protease inhibitors. In contrast, HIV-2 is susceptible to all NRTIs and integrase inhibitors. Drug resistance in HIV-2 may develop earlier than in HIV-1 and select for mutations at distinct sites. Misdiagnosis of HIV-2 in patients wrongly considered as HIV-1 positive or in those dually infected may result in treatment failures with undetectable HIV-1RNA. Given the relatively large number of West Africans migrated to the European Union and North America, HIV-2 infection either alone or as coinfection with HIV-1 should be excluded at least once in all HIV-seroreactive persons. This should be stressed in the face of atypical HIV serological profiles, immunovirological disconnect (CD4 cell count loss despite undetectable HIV-1 viremia), and/or high epidemiological risks (birth in or sex partners from HIV-2 endemic regions). Superinfection with any HIV variant may occur in persons infected with the other, since there is no cross-protection. Thus, earlier antiretroviral therapy is warranted for either HIV-1 or HIV-2, given that it would protect from each other superinfection in persons at risk.",

    "abstract": "Older adolescents and young adults (youth) living with HIV (YLH) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are at high risk for poor HIV treatment adherence and associated negative health outcomes including viral nonsuppression. To describe this risk, we conducted a comprehensive review of studies involving YLH. Eligible studies compared youth adherence or adherence-related health functioning to older or younger samples, examined factors associated with adherence or health outcomes among YLH, or evaluated adherence interventions with YLH. Databases searched included MEDLINE, Web of Science, Global Health, CINAHL, Africa-Wide Information, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library. Of the 7054 articles found, 156 were reviewed and 130 were eligible. Across 16 adherence-related behaviors or health outcomes such as lost to follow-up, retention in care, antiretroviral use, CD4 count, viral suppression, and mortality, 73% of studies comparing YLH to other age groups (n = 106) found worse outcomes among YLH. In 22 studies, barriers and facilitators to adherence were identified, some unique to YLH (e.g., conflicting treatment expectations of providers) and some common to other age groups. Finally, of the eight adherence interventions with YLH reviewed, five showed evidence of being effective. Our findings suggest that YLH in SSA faces numerous obstacles to engaging in HIV treatment across a range of shifting social contexts. Accounting for this group's transition to treatment self-management, developmentally tailored and holistic interventions should be the focus of adherence promotion efforts.",

Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Google Scholar, supplemented by a hand search of bibliographies of articles, was conducted. Study information and outcome measures of time from HIV infection to diagnosis were synthesized. Random-effects metaanalyses were performed. The search identified 12 articles from 4541 unduplicated citations. Studies were conducted in the UK (k = 3), US (k = 3), France (k = 2), Australia (k = 1), Switzerland (k = 1), Netherlands (k = 1), and China (k = 1). The pooled meantime from HIV infection to diagnosis was 3.00 years (95% confidence interval: 2.16-3.84). From 1996 to 2002, meantime reduced from 4.68 to 2.66 years. Subsequently, it increased to 3.20 years in 2003 and remained relatively stable until 2015. In sub-group meta-analyses, men who have sex with men (MSM) had a meantime of 2.62 years (1.91-3.34), while for heterosexuals and people who inject drugs, it was 5.00 (4.15-5.86) and 4.98 (3.97-5.98) years, respectively. In the high- and upper-middle-income countries included in this study, persons live with undiagnosed HIV for about 3 year before being diagnosed. This period is shorter for MSM relative to people with infections attributable to other risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, HIV infection is largely considered as a chronic condition rather than a deadly disease, given that effective antiretroviral treatment allows almost complete and persistent suppression of viral replication and restoration of nearly normal CD4+ T-cell counts. Being HIV a \"condition\", we imply that other illnesses are more frequently seen in persons living with HIV (PLHIV), among which mental health disorders are particularly common. Despite very successful antiretroviral therapy, HIV infection may still cause a wide range of neurocognitive dysfunctions and accelerated brain ageing. Beyond direct viral effects, at least another five causes of neurological damage are more frequent among PLHIV. First, the use of neurochemical substances as sexual boosters (chemsex) has become popular in this population. Second, the rate of sexually transmitted infections as syphilis, which may affect the central nervous system, is more prevalent among PLHIV. Third, the use of certain antiretroviral drugs, such as efavirenz, has been associated with changes in mood and/or psychotic symptoms. Fourth, an increased rate of mental disorders has been reported in PLHIV, either as predisposing conditions or following the recognition of HIV diagnosis (i.e., major depression). Finally, psychosocial factors such as loneliness, isolation and stigmatization are more frequent in PLHIV and worsen their mental health. Given that the life expectancy of PLHIV has increased significantly, a new and much broader spectrum of psychiatric disorders has emerged in PLHIV. Early diagnosis and adequate management, including education and preventative interventions are warranted.",

    "abstract": "HIV is a global deliberating infectious disease. Of note, more than 36 million people living with HIV (PLHIV) with approximately newly diagnosed 1.5 million cases annually. M184V is a single base mutation in the highly conserved YMDD domain of reverse transcriptase (RT). It is one of the most encountered resistances associated with mutations to nucleoside RT inhibitors. There were continuous efforts to evaluate the impact of M184V mutation on the treatment outcomes in PLHIV. Therefore, the present systematic review was executed to reveal the virological failure, virological suppression, and resistance to antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens in PLHIV with the M184V mutation. All clinical studies comparing the treatment outcomes among PLHIV harboring or not harboring M184V mutation were appropriate for systematic review and meta-analysis. The present systematic review included six articles, encompassing 4760 PLHIV. Of them, 1222 (25.67%) patients had M184V mutation, while 3538 (74.32%) PLHIV did not. The meta-analysis showed that patients with M184V mutation were 1.87 times more liable to virological failure (risk ratio [RR] 1.87; 95% 1.09, 3.20; p = 0.02). Furthermore, pooling the data from two studies revealed a significantly higher risk of viral blips (RR 2.26; 95% 1.47, 3.46; p = 0.0002). Concerning discontinuation of ART, there was no statistical difference between patients with and without M184V mutation (RR: 0.99; 95% 0.78, 1.25; p = 0.90). The present study revealed the negative impact of the M184V mutation on treatment outcomes in PLHIV. This included a higher risk of virological failure and viral blips, relative to patients without the mutation. Such patients may benefit from more aggressive and combined therapy for better disease management.",

    "abstract": "Africa hosts the highest burden of esophageal cancer (49%) and HIV (60%) worldwide. It is imperative to investigate the synergistic impact of these two diseases on African populations. This study conducted an exhaustive computerized search of databases, including Medline/PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane library, and African Journals Online, to identify eligible studies up to October 2023. HIV infection was the exposure, esophageal cancer risk was the outcome, and healthy subjects with no cancer history served as comparators. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and potential publication bias was evaluated through funnel plots and the Egger test. Meta-analyses were conducted using Stata 17.0 software and involved a thorough examination of 98,397 studies. Out of these, eight studies originating from Eastern and Southern Africa, recognized as esophageal cancer hotspots on the continent, met the eligibility criteria. The analysis revealed a non-significant association between HIV infection and esophageal cancer risk (odds ratio = 1.34 [95% confidence interval, 0.85-2.12]; with 0.26 as p-value of overall effects). The Egger test yielded a p-value of 0.2413, suggesting the absence of publication bias. In summary, this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that there is no established causal link between HIV infection and esophageal cancer risk. However, further research is essential to delve into the potential mechanisms underlying this relationship.",

This review examined articles on ART adherence in Africa between 2016 and 2023, published in English and indexed in PubMed. A total of 16 articles out of 2415 were eligible and included for analyses. Overall, good ART adherence rates in sub-Saharan African (SSA) regions ranged from 43% to 84%. Rates in the center of the SSA region ranged from 58% to 80%, in the north from 50% to 83%, in the south from 77% to 84%, in the west from 43% to 60%, and in the east from 69% to 73%. Most African countries use self-reporting to assess treatment adherence, which is frequently unreliable. The main factors with negative influence on ART adherence were comorbidities, lack of motivation, socioeconomic difficulties, or side effects. Conclusion: Adherence to ART is a good indicator for controlling the spread of HIV in a given region. It is important to overcome the barriers that make it difficult to comply with ART and reinforce the factors that facilitate access to medication.",

    "abstract": "Despite the success in the development of antiretroviral therapy, the emergence of drug resistance remains an important factor that can undermine the benefits of treatment. The vast majority of well-described resistance-associated mutations are clustered around the binding site for a given inhibitor. However, mutations that are observed at considerable distance from this location can likewise affect drug susceptibility. Treatment-associated mutations in the C-terminal region of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase provide a recently surfaced example in this regard. In this review, we discuss the potential clinical significance of these mutations and underlying molecular mechanisms. Routine resistance testing does not usually include the C-terminal region of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. However, previous studies have shown that mutations in this region can reduce susceptibility to both nucleoside and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The prevalence of some of these mutations can be as high as reported for several classic resistance mutations in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Biochemical studies provided plausible mechanisms that help to explain how certain C-terminal mutations can contribute to alterations in drug susceptibility and viral replication capacity. Overall, the available data warrant further investigation on the impact of C-terminal mutations in combination with classic resistance-associated mutations, on changes in viral load, and response to treatment with different classes of reverse transcriptase inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Although the availability of antiretroviral therapy has increased rapidly to reach over three million people in low- and middle-income countries, coverage remains low as only 31% of people in need were receiving antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa. Antiretroviral therapy scale-up needs to continue to grow exponentially to meet the need for universal access and keep pace with or exceed the new HIV infections. This calls for strategies that will have the greatest impact on the reduction of opportunistic infections, toxicities, and early mortality after antiretroviral therapy initiation as well improve adherence, clinical, immunological, and virologic responses, patient retention in antiretroviral therapy programs, and overall quality of life of people living with HIV/AIDS. Expanding antiretroviral therapy to all those eligible requires evidence-based decisions about how, when, and where expansion should occur. In this article we highlight some of the strategies that have optimized HIV treatment outcomes within the constraints of limited resources in sub-Saharan Africa. Key strategies to optimize HIV treatment outcomes include, i) scaling up HIV testing to identify all in need of HIV treatment, ii) strengthening the links between HIV diagnosis and comprehensive HIV/AIDS care, iii) timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy, iv) optimal diagnosis and treatment of opportunistic infections and comorbidities, v) investing in laboratory tests to support clinical monitoring of patients on antiretroviral therapy, vi) maximizing adherence to antiretroviral medication and retention of patients in HIV/AIDS care, viii) improving the health infrastructure, and increasing the human resources to handle the growing numbers of people in need of HIV treatment.",

Unfortunately, several HIV-associated comorbidities continuously occur in the clinical population, most notably HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). While many molecular and cellular mechanisms have been characterized by describing HAND pathology (specifically neuroinflammatory insults and oxidative stress) in the ART era, compromised adult neurogenesis is emerging as a potential new mechanism. Neurogenesis is a dynamic process that generates new neurons and glial cells from neural stem cells (NSCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in specific areas of the brain. There are increasing observations that HIV-1 can productively and non-productively infect NSCs and NPCs. HIV-1 proteins and/or secondary immune/inflammatory responses impair the initial differentiation process of NSCs to NPCs, restrict neuronal lineage differentiation, and aberrantly promote astrocytic lineage differentiation. Recent studies with HIV-1 transgenic animal models demonstrate varying degrees of adult neurogenic deficits, which correlate with milder to moderate forms of neurocognitive impairments. The neurogenic dysfunction underlying HAND highlights the importance of developing potential therapeutics to restore adult neurogenic homeostasis in HIV-1 patients.",

These disorders turn out to be subtype dependent. Recently, many studies are ongoing trying to understand how the virus induces neuronal injury which could lead to neurological dysfunction. Most of these studies are focusing on the HIV-1 release of proteins such as Tat. However, the exact role of these proteins and their involvement in neuronal degeneration remains unidentified; this is especially true since viral proteins from different HIV-1 subtypes differ in their ability to cause neuronal damage. This review describes the role of different HIV-1 subtypes, identifies probable pathways involved in neuronal damage, the contribution of different HIV-1 subtypes to the progression of HAND, and potential treatments for HAND.",

People living with HIV (PLWH) are living longer presenting an increased number of comorbidities leading to polypharmacy. Literature on the prevalence, associated factors, drug-drug interactions (DDIs), effects on ART-outcomes, geriatric conditions, and nutritional status together with health-interventions aimed to reduce it is presented in this review. A literature search was conducted on the MEDLINE database for all relevant English- and Spanish-language studies since 2006. Studies providing data of interest were identified and ordered in groups: (i) prevalence and associated factors (n = 37), (ii) DDIs (n = 19), (iii) Effects on ART-outcomes (n = 12), (iv) Effects on health conditions (n = 13), and (V) Health-interventions to assess and/or reduce it (n = 9). Polypharmacy occurs in 9-91% of PLWH (2.6-19.5% affected by severe polypharmacy). Main factors associated with polypharmacy are older age, a higher number of comorbidities, frailty, deteriorated renal function, and previous hospitalizations. DDIs were present in 19.15-84% of cases (1.3-12.2% for the most severe types). Mainly involved non-ART drugs were antihypertensives, statins, antithrombotic agents, corticosteroids, divalent cations, and antiacids. Polypharmacy can affect ART selection, adherence, and outcomes and has been related to some geriatric conditions such as falls, frailty, and poor nutritional status. Potentially prescribing issues are present in up to 87.9% of cases according to the STOPP-START and Beers criteria and some pharmacist-led interventions have been shown to reduce it. Considering these findings, polypharmacy should be considered a clinical concern in this population and treatment-optimization programs are needed to reduce its burden.",

Oro-fecal transmissible hepatitis A and E mostly produce acute self-limited episodes in poor income regions and in non-vaccinated travelers. In high-income countries, outbreaks of hepatitis A occur in men having sex with men (MSM) and chronic hepatitis E is occasionally reported among PLWH with severe immunodeficiency. Chronic hepatitis B, C, and D are frequent in PLWH in highly endemic regions and globally in persons who inject drugs (PWID) and MSM. Progression to liver cirrhosis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is major clinical complications in coinfected patients. Current estimates for PLWH are of 38 million worldwide. Roughly 12% have chronic viral hepatitis (5 million). Coinfection figures are of 5-10% for HBV (2-4 million), 4% for HCV (1.5 million), and 15% of HBsAg+ for HDV (0.5 million). Oral direct-acting antivirals (DAA) cure almost all treated patients with hepatitis C. However, given that there is no protective HCV immunity, PLWH with high-risk behaviors may experience HCV reinfection episodes. Tenofovir is the drug of choice in PLWH with chronic hepatitis B, given its dual effect on HIV and HBV. Lifelong oral tenofovir suppresses HBV replication and ameliorate liver damage. However, the risk of HCC persists even in the absence of cirrhosis. Finally, HDV causes the worst of viral hepatitis with faster progression to cirrhosis and HCC. An entry inhibitor, bulevirtide, has recently been approved and another drug, lonafarnib, is completing Phase 3 trials. Combination antiviral therapy for hepatitis D could improve dramatically the poor prognosis of HIV-HDV coinfected patients. The resumption of good medical practices in PLWH after the big disruption caused by COVID-19 will reduce the burden of viral hepatitis coinfections. Renewed efforts on HAV and HBV vaccination of susceptible individuals and earlier and wider prescription of antiviral therapy for HBV, HCV, and/or HDV coinfection should be prioritized in PLWH. The benefits of innovative strategies for viral hepatitis, including pre-exposure prophylaxis or use of long-acting antivirals, warrant further consideration in PLWH.",

    "abstract": "Once HIV-1 enters the target cell, the first goal in the viral cycle is to integrate into the cellular chromosomes. The irreversible integration as a provirus allows HIV-1 to persist in the infected cell in a quiescent or latent stage that leads to viral escape from immune response and current antiviral treatment. HIV-1 replication is absolutely dependent on different cellular and viral factors that initiate viral expression, acting at the long terminal repeat of the integrated provirus. Accordingly, HIV-1 induces changes in the cellular environment to make possible an efficient replication and production of viral progeny. One main instigator of HIV-1 replication is the viral regulator Tat, which is absolutely required for efficient transcription and elongation of viral transcripts. For this purpose, Tat recruits several cellular proteins to make the chromatin structure accessible for the transcription machinery, to acquire the posttranslational modifications essential for its function, and to produce efficient viral replication. However, the host cell has also several antiviral mechanisms that may act at different steps of the viral cycle to thwart HIV-1 replication. To level the match, HIV-1 encodes accessory proteins, such as Vif and Vpu, which play important roles in HIV-1 pathogenesis by counteracting cellular antiviral factors. The increasing knowledge of viral protein interactions with host cell factors will be essential for the discovery of new targets that could be used to design new therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "In 2010, 3.5 million people were living with HIV in the World Health Organization Southeast Asia Region (SEAR), giving this region the greatest burden of HIV after Africa. Scale-up of antiretroviral therapy has resulted in over 717,000 benefitting from it by the end of 2010. A systematic review of studies of HIV drug resistance in the SEAR published between 2000 and 2011 was performed. Of 10 studies of transmitted HIV drug resistance in recently infected patients, all but two reported low levels (< 5%) of transmitted resistance. Of 23 studies of HIV drug resistance in pretreatment populations initiating antiretroviral therapy, three reported moderate levels (5-15%) of HIV drug resistance and 20 reported low levels. Amongst 17 studies of acquired HIV drug resistance, levels of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance ranged from 52 to 92% and 43 to 100%, respectively, amongst those with virological failure. Overall, data included in this review suggest that currently recommended first- and second-line regimens are appropriate for the cohorts studied. However, data were only available from two of 11 Southeast Asia Region countries and studies largely examined urban populations. Results are unlikely to be representative of the region. Studies lacked standardized methods, which greatly limits comparability of data and their use for public health and antiretroviral therapy program planning. Routine, standardized, and nationally representative HIV drug resistance surveillance should be strongly encouraged in the Southeast Asia Region countries to best characterize population-level HIV drug resistance. National-level HIV drug resistance surveillance data may be used to optimize delivery of HIV care and treatment and minimize emergence of population-level HIV drug resistance, thus promoting the long-term efficacy and durability of available first- and second-line antiretroviral therapy regimens.",

    "abstract": "Roughly, 38 million people are living with HIV worldwide. Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for suppressing virus replication and restore immunity in infected persons, the HIV epidemics are not controlled globally. Each year 1.8 million new HIV infections occur. This rate has declined only slightly during the past decade, despite huge efforts for expanding ART coverage, pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis, and stopping vertical transmission. To achieve the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS goals of 95-95-95 by 2030, renewed efforts and innovative strategies must be undertaken. The source of most new HIV infections is people unaware of their HIV-positive status and/or not linked to care. Thus, efforts for unveiling HIV positives and, especially, rapid initiation of ART and retention in care would be the most effective interventions for halting HIV spreading globally. In certain settings, access to point-of-care diagnostic tests and immediate start of ART (even the same day) must be implemented at large scale. Selection of the most convenient ART to be prescribed empirically is an important caveat to minimize the risks of treatment failure. Ideally, it must be easy to take, coformulated as single-tablet regimen (STR), well tolerated, with no requests for prior human leukocyte antigen testing, depict few drug interactions, keep activity against transmitted drug-resistant viruses, remain efficacious in patients with elevated HIV-RNA, and/or low CD4 counts, and when present, suppress hepatitis B coinfection. At this time, the coformulation of darunavir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide (Symtuza®) is the only regimen that has been evaluated in a Phase 3 trial as \"test-and-treat\" strategy. Results at 48 weeks in the DIAMOND study are reassuring, as more than 90% of individuals achieve undetectable viremia.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID-19, was first detected in China in December 2019 and has rapidly spread throughout the world. Globally, the impact of COVID-19 has been severe with more than half a million deaths over 6 months; in contrast, the HIV pandemic has resulted in over 32 million deaths worldwide over 40 years. This paper reviews the current epidemiology of COVID-19, summarizes its relationship to HIV, identifies synergies in our response, and suggests actions that can be taken to curtail the spread of COVID-19 among persons living with HIV (PLWH). Our understanding of the epidemiology, clinical presentation, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19 has evolved rapidly as they did with HIV. Epidemiologically, there are similarities between the two viruses including asymptomatic spread, disproportionate impact on persons of color, need for rapid diagnostic testing, and lack of a cure or vaccine. PLWH do not appear generally to have an increased incidence of COVID-19 infection or a more severe course of disease. Clinical trials to identify potential treatment and prevention options for COVID-19 have included antiretrovirals used to treat HIV that have not been efficacious. Public health responses overlap between the two pandemics including the need for behavior change and containment strategies such as contact tracing. As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic evolves, the path forward to controlling, preventing, and treating COVID-19 can be informed by lessons learned from HIV as we seek to control the spread of both viral pandemics.",

It is the first once-a-day therapy option containing an integrase inhibitor and cobicistat, a novel pharmacokinetic boosting agent without activity on HIV. Stribild® has demonstrated non-inferior virological efficacy and a similar recovery of CD4+ T-cells when compared to Atripla® (efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir) and to ritonavir-boosted atazanavir plus emtricitabine/tenofovir in two large, phase III randomized clinical trials at 48, 96, and 144 weeks.

It was originally thought to result from reduced energy consumption associated with suppression of overt virus replication. However, recent evidence suggests that is not simply a back to normal phenomenon. Indeed, a differential influence on weight has been noticed for distinct antiretroviral drugs, some of which may produce abnormal body weight gain and metabolic disturbances. Treatment with integrase inhibitors in particular leads to significant increases in body mass index. By contrast, protease inhibitors might protect from undesirable weight gain. Ultimately, the development of overweight and obesity in an aging HIV population may increase the risk of cardiovascular events and should be prevented. In this scenario, the differential influence on weight gain using distinct antiretroviral agents might provide an opportunity for personalized medicine, adapting the most convenient drug regimen to each patient.",

The complexity and diversity of G protein signal transduction initiated by chemokine receptor activation has hindered efforts to understand the contributions of these pathways to the HIV life cycle. Several recent studies have demonstrated an important role for G proteins in mediating signaling events through both CCR5 and CXCR4 that are necessary for productive HIV infection. In addition to gp120-mediated G protein activation, there is still much to learn about the impact of G protein signaling during HIV infection, including the role of T-cell receptor/CXCR4 cross-talk, regulation of G protein expression during infection and the contribution of G protein subunit genetic polymorphisms to disease progression. This review will describe the effects of G protein signaling in immune cells, summarize the current understanding of CCR5 and CXCR4-initiated signal transduction in HIV replication, and discuss important gaps that still remain in our understanding of G protein signaling and its contribution to HIV pathogenesis.",

This can expose patients to drug-drug interactions (DDIs) that may lead to suboptimal drug exposure, an increased risk of therapeutic failure or poor tolerability, and a need to adopt alternative therapeutic strategies. Although such undesired responses to pharmacological therapies can be appropriately managed in some situations, the fact that the available information is usually incomplete which makes it difficult (if not impossible) to assess DDIs and the consequent adjustments of polytherapies in clinical practice. For these reasons, we set up our ambulatory polytherapy management (Gestione Ambulatoriale Politerapie [GAP]) outpatient clinic in September 2016 to manage polypharmacy in HIV-infected patients. The main aims of the GAP clinic are to check whether patients are treated with drug combinations that are contraindicated due to known or predictable DDIs; assess the clinical and/or pharmacokinetic relevance of the DDIs; and provide written advice as to how the treatments should be modified if possible. We here describe the results of our 2-year experience in various clinical scenarios.",

Existing data indicate that HIV itself, independent of smoking, constitutes a pathogenic agent implicated in this disease condition. COPD can be viewed not exclusively as a pulmonary disease but rather as a systemic syndrome sparked and fueled by a persistent low-grade HIV-attributable inflammatory state. We speculate that even in the absence of airflow obstruction on spirometry, HIV-related lung disease can manifest with respiratory symptoms and structural lung derangement. Although not fully satisfying the global initiative for obstructive lung disease criteria for COPD, this phenotype of small airways lung disease is related to significant impairment of lung health and is associated with a high comorbidity burden. Within the specific context of the aging epidemic affecting HIV patients characterized by a high burden of comorbidities, frailty, and disabilities HIV-related lung disease has to be fit into the framework of the general comorbidity burden that PLWH experience, due to both HIV infection and to incidental HIV-unrelated risk factors. In this review, we will also provide a list of research gaps and an agenda for future studies in HIV patients.",

Breakthrough therapies are so far lacking for HDV-infected patients and treatment has not changed since the discovery of HDV in 1977 and consists mainly of interferons. While there was little interest on the global epidemiology of HDV until recently, this has changed in the past 2 years and we are currently observing a stream of papers on the global epidemiology of HDV and commentaries about why prevalence estimates appear to differ so dramatically. This may be related to the fact that reliable data are not available for most of the countries. However, in the industrialized world, data on the epidemiology of HDV are expected to be of better overall quality. Hence, this review was undertaken to provide a detailed overview on the epidemiology of HDV infection in industrialized countries using data from representative larger countries. In industrialized countries, with maybe the exception of China, HDV infection is a disease of high-risk groups. Migrant groups and people who inject drugs are the most encountered high-risk groups. This review summarizes the dynamics of their contribution to the HDV epidemiology in industrialized countries of the west and the east.",

Epigenetic alterations, telomere shortening or dysfunction, mitogenic stress,oxidative stress, or accumulation of DNA damage can drive the cell to senescence a permanent cell cycle arrest sometimes associated with a secretory phenotype and inflammatory consequences in the surrounding tissue. The amount of senescent cellsgrows over time in older organisms and may induce tissue inflammation and threaten overall tissue homeostasis, favoring aging. Senolytic and senomorphic therapeuticsare an emerging approach to eliminate senescent cells or to block their secretoryphenotypes respectively.

Inflammation biomarkers may be helpful to assess prognosis or act as surrogate endpoints for studies of strategies focused on reversal of HIV-associated accelerated aging. This review summarizes the latest findings in aging and its major drivers, under the light of HIV infection. Since the number of older PLWH is currently rising, it will be of great importance to address and treat their age-related conditions, as well as to better decipher their biological mechanisms.",

Sophisticated phenotypic assays that incorporate linear regression modeling and conventional phenotypic assays have been used to define and validate clinical cutoffs (i.e. the correlation between viral susceptibility and treatment response) for most antiretrovirals, including the newer protease inhibitors. Using these clinical cutoff values, clinical data show that the newer protease inhibitors retain activity against the majority of isolates from treatment-experienced patients and from those with baseline resistance to multiple protease inhibitors. The utility of phenotypic resistance testing methods have therefore been validated in the clinical setting. In summary, HIV drug resistance testing is currently the recommended standard of care for the selection of antiretroviral regimens for HIV-infected patients in multiple clinical settings. An understanding of the basic principles of phenotypic resistance testing is crucial for providing optimal care, particularly for antiretroviral-experienced patients.",

These trials were conducted in treatment-experienced patients, where complex and expensive drug combinations are typically required. Rates of plasma HIV RNA suppression<50 copies in different treatment groups by week 48 were combined with drug costs to calculate the costs per patient with undetectable viremia. These results were compared with two recent pilot studies of novel triple combination treatment. The average annual per patient cost of antiretrovirals for the active plus optimized background regimen arm versus placebo plus optimized background regimen was US$ 47,324 vs. 38,267 in the DUET Trials, US$ 45,484 vs. 34,585 in BENCHMRK, and US$ 46,633 vs. 36,404 in MOTIVATE. In the three trials, the highest treatment costs were from nucleoside analogs (29-30% of total costs) and enfuvirtide (22-25% of total costs). In the two pilot studies, the total cost of raltegravir/etravirine/darunavir/ritonavir was US$ 32,208, while use of raltegravir/etravirine/maraviroc cost US$ 30,952 per patient-year. The mean cost per patient with HIV RNA<50 copies/ml at week 48 ranged from US$ 62,268 in the etravirine plus optimized background regimen arm of DUET, to US$ 214,141 in the placebo arm of MOTIVATE. In the pilot studies, the cost per patient with HIV RNA<50 copies/ml was US$ 33,204 for raltegravir/etravirine/darunavir/ritonavir and US$ 33,603 for raltegravir/etravirine/maraviroc. In summary, when treating highly treatment-experienced patients, cost-savings could be made by using combinations of newer antiretrovirals in preference to recycled nucleoside analogs and enfuvirtide.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there have been numerous calls by researchers to adopt multi-disciplinary and international perspectives to address the HIV pandemic. Meaningful and prudent public health policy should be based on sound empirical data and research. Henceforth, our study aims to contribute to the current literature by conducting a comprehensive global mapping and determine the landscapes of HIV/AIDS research covering the years between 1983 and 2017. Bibliometric and content analysis was used to describe trends in research productivity, usages, research collaborations, and clusters of research topics. Exploratory factor analysis, Jaccard's similarity index, and Ward dendrogram were applied to abstracts' contents to determine the development of interdisciplinary research landscapes. The United States of America continues to lead in research production and be main hub for author- and country-level collaborations. Research employing an epidemiological, social, and/or behavioral perspective for studying HIV/AIDS was found to dwarf in the presence of basic and biomedical HIV research. Interdisciplinary approaches to HIV research have been increasing with the creation of various research landscapes: strong constructs of studies examining health status, clinical responses, and HIV treatment, risk behaviors have been formed, while research topics relating to psycho-behavioral and cultural aspects as well as services have emerged along. To effectively prevent and control the disease, more researches are needed to provide culturally relevant and/or contextualized evidence of effective interventions. It is also necessary to enhance the ability and partnership of local researchers as well as invest in research infrastructure at national and regional levels to implement high-quality studies since they are the \"gate-keepers\" who could respond to local changes in a timely manner. These types of research could be a helpful guide for international donors, governments, and academicians to set up research priorities in target groups and settings, and to develop future research agendas globally.",

A significant decrease in the incidence of disseminated M. avium complex: (DMAC) infection was observed between pre-cART and post-cART periods. In contrast, diagnoses of DMAC more than doubled from 1990 to 1996. During this time, DMAC prevalence in people living with AIDS (PLHA) in developed countries reached 20-23% overall and >40% in groups with CD4 cell counts <10 cells/mm3. At present, DMAC in PLHA has an incidence of two events per 1000 patient years. Recently, the centers for disease control changed the criteria for MAC primary prophylaxis, where only patients without immediate cART and CD4 cell counts <50 cells/mm3 are prescribed 1200 mg of azithromycin weekly. Treatment is discontinued when patients initiate effective cART. Diagnosing a disseminated M. avium infection is difficult due to the low accuracy of fluid cultures and a lack of diagnostic processes. However, the usefulness of newer molecular techniques such as whole-genome sequencing has not been evaluated for DMAC and HIV/AIDS. As DMAC has a high mortality rate if not properly diagnosed and treated, we performed a literature review of HIV/AIDS and DMAC epidemiology, risk factors, prophylaxis, clinical manifestation, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.",

However, many patients show suboptimal immune recovery (SIR), as defined by virological suppression (i.e. low viral load) with a CD4+ T-cell count of ≤ 200 cells/mm3, after HAART initiation. Here, we performed a systematic evaluation of the SIR prevalence among HIV-infected patients in cohort studies. We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang database, and Chinese Biomedicine Database for cohort studies about HIV-infected participants whose CD4+ T-cell count was ≤ 200 cells/mm3 but still had virological suppression after HAART initiation. The SIR prevalence from each of those cohort studies was pooled into a random-effect meta-analysis. We obtained two kinds of pooled post-HARRT initiation SIR prevalence: one among participants with virological suppression (11 cohort studies involving 18,672 participants), and the other among all HIV-infected participants (seven cohort studies involving 12,063 participants). The pooled SIR prevalence among HIV-infected patients with virological suppression after HAART initiation was 43% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34-51%) at 6 months post-HAART initiation and 10% (95% CI, 5-18%) at 36 months post-HAART initiation; among all HIV-infected patients after HAART initiation, it was 17% (95% CI, 0-55%) and 5% (95% CI, 2-10%) at 6 and 36 months post-HAART initiation, respectively. The SIR prevalence among HIV-infected patients is high at 6 months post-HAART initiation, but its prevalence gradually reduces over time under continuous HAART. Thus, it is important to follow-up on variations in the CD4+ T-cell count and viral load.",

Triple-drug regimens (3DR) have been the cornerstone of HIV treatment, which provide durable virologic suppression, reduce HIV-related morbidity and mortality, and improve immune reconstitution. However, 3DR are associated to long-term toxicities. In certain settings, two-drug regimens (2DR) present non-inferior virological efficacy compared to 3DR and may improve tolerability and adherence. In this review, we examine the efficacy, safety, and patient-centered outcomes of 3DR and 2DR, and the potential benefits of transitioning from triple to dual therapy regimens in people with HIV. We conducted a literature search on PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases for studies published between January 2010 and June 2024. Overall data support the non-inferior efficacy of 2DR to 3DR in the management of HIV, with no evidence of an increased risk of subclinical failure with dual therapy. Switching from 3DR to 2DR may reduce the risk of drug interactions and toxicity. Within the 2DR, the long-acting therapies represent the most innovative dual therapy since they simplify the treatment by reducing from triple to dual therapy along shifting from daily pills to bi-monthly injections. Long-acting 2DR are effective, provide high levels of satisfaction, and improve adherence and quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was first reported in Pakistan in 1987. Initially believed to have a low HIV prevalence mainly confined to high-risk groups such as injection drug users (IDUs) and commercial sex workers. However, HIV prevalence has steadily increased, with Punjab and Sindh provinces reporting the highest rates. Heterosexual transmission is the most frequent transmission route. High-risk populations include IDUs, men having sex with men, commercial sex workers, as well as truck drivers and miners. Furthermore, HIV has spread from urban centers to rural areas. The World Health Organization has reported over 200,000 HIV cases in Pakistan, making it the second-largest HIV-positive nation in Asia after India. The proportion of undiagnosed individuals is high and antiretroviral coverage is suboptimal. Fear of societal discrimination often leads individuals with HIV to hide their status, further spreading the virus. Mother-to-child transmission is another significant concern. Challenges in patient adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) exist, with many patients missing follow-up appointments. ART access due to shortages is frequent stemming from the reliance on imports. To mitigate the growing burden of HIV in Pakistan, it is essential to prioritize prevention through awareness campaigns and robust screening and antiretroviral programs targeting high-risk populations.",

This situation highlights the urgent need for targeted and coordinated public health action. In this context, this review aims to clarify the links between these two diseases, to understand their interaction better, and to guide prevention and treatment strategies adapted to this high-risk region. This study, conducted according to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, explored the impact of HIV on the risk of cervical cancer and the prevalence of HIV among cervical cancer patients in southern Africa. Eighteen original studies, covering six countries in the Southern Africa region and published between 2003 and 2022, were included. The prevalence of HIV in patients with cervical cancer was 5.30% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.21-6.67; and p = 0.001). In addition, the analysis revealed a significant association between HIV infection and an increased risk of cervical cancer, with an overall odds ratio of 2.29 (95% CI: 1.62-3.23; p = 0.001). Tests for publication bias showed no significant bias, and trim-and-fill analysis did not reveal any missing studies. In conclusion, this study highlights a high prevalence of HIV among cervical cancer patients in southern Africa, with a strong association between HIV infection and an increased risk of this form of cancer. These findings underline the importance of integrated prevention strategies, including human papillomavirus vaccination, cervical cancer screening, and improved access to antiretrovirals, to reduce the combined burden of HIV and cervical cancer in this high-risk region.",

    "abstract": "This review elucidates the complex interplay between HIV infection and male infertility, underscoring the multifaceted mechanisms through which HIV undermines male reproductive health. These mechanisms encompass diminished semen quality, orchitis, hypogonadism, and leukocytospermia. Concurrently, while antiretroviral therapy (ART) is salvific, it may pose additional fertility challenges. The introduction of highly suppressive ART has revolutionized the reproductive landscape for HIVserodiscordant couples, enabling them to plan for children with minimal risk of HIV transmission, thereby justifying the Undetectable = Untransmissible (U = U) paradigm. Despite these impediments, sperm washing in conjunction with sophisticated assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs), such as in vitro fertilization and intracytoplasmic sperm injection, offers efficacious fertility solutions for HIV-positive males, substantially mitigating the risk of HIV transmission. Psychological and ethical considerations further shape fertility treatment decisions and outcomes within this demographic. Future research should focus on elucidating the long-term effects of ART on male fertility and devising targeted interventions to enhance reproductive health in HIV-positive men.",

    "abstract": "The advent of protease inhibitors (PI) in the mid-nineties and its use as part of triple combinations revolutionized the management of HIV infection. Since then, progression to AIDS and AIDS-related deaths can be prevented. However, antiretroviral therapy based on PI has been discouraged for a while given its lower tolerability compared to alternative options; and only recent improvements in pharmacotherapy have renewed the interest for the newest agents within this class. First, the tolerability of the latest PI darunavir (DRV) and atazanavir is much better than for older PI, such as indinavir or lopinavir. Second, metabolic abnormalities and/or drug interactions associated to ritonavir boosting have been ameliorated using cobicistat. Third, adding safer accompanying nucleos(t)ides, such as tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), have minimized further toxicity concerns of PI. Finally, the unique barrier to resistance and new single-tablet regimen (STR) presentation makes DRV, especially attractive for long-term therapy. The recent coformulation of DRV, cobicistat, TAF, and emtricitabine (DRV/c/TAF/FTC) within a single pill to be given once daily (Symtuza®) has positioned PI again at the frontline of HIV therapeutics. In this review, we discuss the results of studies that have assessed the efficacy and safety of the newest STR. In view of the current data, it seems worthy expanding the consideration of Symtuza® for a wider range of clinical scenarios, beyond the treatment of antiretroviral failures including first-line therapy and switching of otherwise virologically suppressed patients. The good tolerability and robust resistance profile should reward Symtuza® and position it among the preferred contemporary STRs.",

Despite the availability of efficacious treatment strategies, implementation of guideline advocated preventive therapy, such as lipid-lowering therapy with statins, is hampered by perceived, expected, and real side effects as well as by expected interactions with combination antiretroviral therapy. These obstacles to optimal treatment have resulted in a large gap between the number of patients in whom lipid-lowering therapy is indicated and those actually taking lipid-lowering medication. In the past few years, research has shown that the majority of patient-reported side effects is not causally related to statin therapy but is attributable to the nocebo effect. Furthermore, excessive caution due to expected drug interactions between statins and antiretroviral therapy is often unnecessary, especially with novel classes of antiretroviral therapy. The main aim of this review is to discuss the causes and consequences of this lipid-lowering treatment gap in HIV-infected patients together with a practical guide on how to overcome these obstacles. In addition, new treatment options on the optimal cardiovascular management focusing primarily on novel classes of antiretroviral therapy and lipid-lowering medication will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "As the HIV epidemic has evolved, so too has the role of the clinical pharmacist (CP) in the management of people living with HIV (PLWH). The modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) era has resulted in PLWH living normal life spans with resulting increased comorbidities. CPs have long been a part of the multidisciplinary management of ART. However, with the changing demographics of PLWH and health-care system dynamics, CPs have had the opportunity to expand their role. This includes involvement in managing increasing comorbidities with expanding and more complicated medication regimens, drug interaction monitoring, and optimizing transitions of care, all while recognizing and addressing barriers to successful HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment. In addition, with the expansion of HIV prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) services, CPs have the opportunity to be involved in HIV prevention. This study summarizes the literature evaluating the impact of CPs in the management of PLWH in the era of modern ART. We conducted a literature search to identify studies that assessed the CP role in HIV clinical practice since 2006. The identified studies were grouped into two categories. The first was HIV related outcomes, including interventions on regimen selection, adherence, regimen optimization, and management of treatment failure. The second group of studies pertained to aging and vulnerable populations, including management of comorbidities, transitions of care, medication-assisted treatment, hepatitis C, and HIV screening and PrEP. We concluded that the evidence supports the expanding role of CPs to positively impact a variety of aspects related to the care of PLWH. (",

However, the underlying mechanisms of abnormal hematopoiesis in HIV infection are still not completely understood. Recent studies on hematopoietic microenvironment provide new insights on HIV-1 pathogenesis. Based on these studies, we summarized the detrimental influences of HIV, mainly HIV viral proteins Gag, Tat, Gp120, and Nef, on hematopoietic microenvironment. These viral proteins interfere with the development of HSCs and hematopoiesis by affecting mesenchymal stem cells, osteoblasts, endothelial cells, and related signaling factors within the microenvironment. At the same time, we introduced the research progress of targeted therapy for HIV viral proteins and tried to solve the hard-to-correct hematopoietic abnormalities after ART by combining targeted therapy with HIV viral proteins from the direction of hematopoietic microenvironment. Our manuscript will not only enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV infection from the root of blood cell development but also have important implications for the functional cure of HIV infection.",

    "abstract": "Castleman disease (CD) comprises a heterogeneous group of rare lymphoproliferative disorders characterized by similar morphological features in nodal biopsies. Since Benjamin Castleman's initial description in 1956, our understanding of CD has progressed substantially. The intricate mechanisms underlying the four recognized subtypes of multicentric CD (MCD) have been studied thoroughly during recent decades. Major disease contributors include the identification of certain viral infections, namely human herpes virus-8 (HHV-8) and HIV; and the discovery of molecular and genetic mechanisms driving disease development and progression and the consequent development of biological targeted therapies, notably siltuximab and rituximab. The CD has been associated with autoimmune, autoinflammatory, and hematological disorders. Along with epidemiological data, the current classification of CD encompasses unicentric CD and MCD. MCD is further subdivided into HHV-8-associated MCD, polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, skin (POEMS)-associated MCD, and idiopathic MCD (iMCD), which includes thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, reticulin TAFRO-iMCD, and iMCD-not-otherwise-specified (iMCD-NOS). While these subtypes share common histological and similar clinical manifestations, they represent distinct conditions. In this review, we discuss the differences in epidemiology, pathophysiology, histology, clinical presentation, and treatment for all distinct CD subtypes. We focus on the role of viral infections in CD development and epidemiology. We finally end by acknowledging areas where further research is needed to uncover the complex nature of CD.",

Extrinsic factors, such as long-term use of immunosuppressive drugs and chronic diseases, can also affect immune responses, leading to a state of SID.

    "abstract": "The molecular evolution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is reviewed from the viewpoint of the rate of nucleotide substitution, which is defined as the number of nucleotide substitutions per site per year. The rate of nucleotide substitution is useful not only for estimating the origin and history of HIV-1 epidemics, but also for detecting natural selection operating at the amino acid sequence level. The RNA viruses may be classified into two groups, the rapidly and slowly evolving RNA viruses, according to their rates of nucleotide substitution; 10-3-10-4 and 10-6-10-7 per site per year for the former and the latter, respectively. HIV-1 is a member of the rapidly evolving RNA viruses, with the rate of 10-3 per site per year, which is several million times faster than the eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes. The linear regression analysis of a large number of HIV-1 sequences revealed that HIV-1 has a weak molecular clock. The latest divergence time between human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) was estimated as about 30 years ago, and that between HIV-1 and SIV as several hundred years ago. These observations, as well as the inconsistency between the topologies of phylogenetic trees reconstructed for primate lentiviruses and for their host species, indicate that the interspecies transmission occurred during the evolution of primate lentiviruses. The intrahost evolution of HIV-1 has been studied to elucidate the mechanisms of producing immune escape mutants and drug resistant mutants for HIV-1. In particular, the comparison of the rate of non-synonymous substitution with that of synonymous substitution clarified that positive selection is operating on the third variable region of the envelope glycoprotein, which is known as the major target of the immune response and determinant of cell tropism. An asymmetric pattern of nucleotide substitutions for HIV-1, represented by the G to A hyper-mutation, predicts a decrease in the GC content and an increase in the AT content in the HIV-1 genome. The extremely high rate of nucleotide substitution for HIV-1 provides us with a unique opportunity to test evolutionary theories using this virus. Further examination of the mechanisms of molecular evolution for HIV-1 is required for developing effective therapies and vaccines against HIV-1 infection.",

    "abstract": "Human genetic variation may directly or indirectly influence response to modern antiretroviral therapies for HIV. It is already known that some immunogenetic and other human genetic variations affect the natural history of HIV disease progression where individuals are untreated, but less information is available as to whether these differences are still relevant in the context of HAART. Antiretroviral therapy adds additional opportunities for human genetic contributions to affect variable prognosis--in particular for those genes which influence pharmacokinetics and/or adverse events. To date, the majority of studies investigating the influence of human genetic variation on HIV disease and treatment outcome have focused on single nucleotide polymorphisms or a small number of polymorphisms within a single gene. Reports to date have generally described small effect sizes, and have often been contradictory. Thus, while simple genetic markers relevant to HIV disease or treatment response have indeed been identified (e.g. CCR5delta32 in the context of untreated HIV disease, or HLA-B*5701 allele on the abacavir hypersensitivity reaction in the context of HAART), it is more likely that HIV disease and treatment outcomes are influenced by a multitude of interacting genotypes and phenotypes, a hypothesis that will become increasingly possible to investigate as improvements in molecular and computational technologies are made.",

    "abstract": "The immunopathogenic mechanisms that result in the depletion of CD4+ T-cells after HIV-1 infection remain controversial. We consider here mechanisms that have been suggested, and propose a data-supported model in which CD4+ T-cells undergo apoptosis that is signaled by the binding of viral gp120 to cellular CD4.Blood leucocytes from HIV-1-uninfected donors, including CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, monocytes, myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) were cultured with either infectious or noninfectious HIV-1. The cultures were tested for expression of interferon-alpha, TRAIL, DR5 and apoptosis. Inhibitors of IFNalpha, TRAIL, DR5 and gp120/CD4 binding were added to the cultures. Ex vivo studies were performed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HIV-1-infected patients to test the validity of our in vitro findings.Both infectious and noninfectious HIV-1 induced pDC to produce IFNalpha, which induced expression of TRAIL by CD4+ but not CD8+ T-cells. CD4+ T-cells expressed the TRAIL death receptor 5 (DR5), upon HIV-1 binding to CD4. Antibodies against TRAIL and DR5 partly inhibited apoptosis. However, soluble CD4 (sCD4-IgG) efficiently blocked IFNalpha production, TRAIL and DR5 expression and apoptosis of T helper cells. Studies of HIV-1-infected patients' PBMC indicated increased plasma TRAIL production and CD4+ T-cell DR5 expression, which correlated directly with viral load and inversely with CD4 count.Noninfectious interactions between HIV-1 and CD4 are major contributors to CD4+ T-cell death via IFNalpha-induced TRAIL expression and HIV-1-induced DR5 expression on CD4+ T-cells. Since noninfectious as well as infectious HIV-1 induces the death cascade resulting in selective apoptosis of CD4+ T-cells, these HIV-1/CD4-dependent binding events would not necessarily be reflected in HIV-1 RNA and DNA expression by the CD4+ target T-cells. Because each step of this model leading to apoptosis requires the binding of gp120 to CD4, we suggest that molecules which block this very early event in virus/target cell interaction will be effective in preventing or reducing the depletion of CD4+ T-cells during progression to AIDS. The above mechanisms and the effect of sCD4-lgG are summarized in our proposed model.",

In developed countries, nearly 30% of new HIV diagnoses occurred at advanced stages of the disease, and it is important because advanced HIV disease has been associated with worse clinical outcomes, including lower rates of virological response, higher morbidity, and higher mortality. However, there are scarce data regarding which is the best antiretroviral regimen in these patients. Nowadays, integrase inhibitor-based regimens are widely recommended as the best initial therapy for treatment-naïve HIV-infected patients by all international guidelines. However, these guidelines hardly mention the recommended regimens in individuals with advanced HIV disease. Otherwise, recent data indicating a higher risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome associated to the use of integrase inhibitors have raised concerns on the use of these drugs in patients with advanced HIV disease. The aim of this article is to review the available evidence from randomized clinical trials for the best treatment in patients with advanced HIV disease.",

Recent research on health care costs of HIV/AIDS and the occupational situation of HIV+ people are discussed. In high-income countries, there is an incipient change in trends that indicate that an increasing percentage of the intermediate-age HIV+ population will age prematurely, presenting more frequently comorbidities and becoming more exposed to frailty situations. Accordingly, health-care systems should have to plan their resources to accommodate new determinants of healthcare costs in the HIV+ population. On the occupational side, the decreased life expectancy of HIV+ persons, coupled with more severe health issues, on average may prompt early -retirement of this population from the labor market.",

This study aims at exploring the global and historical evolution of literature and suggesting the most frequent research topics and research gaps in relation to the use of HBT in HIV/AIDS. A cross-sectional analysis of global HIV/AIDS bibliography was conducted through Web of Science (WoS) up to December 31, 2017. We utilized exploratory factor analysis to test the likelihood of research domains and landscape from the abstracts. A total of 29,997 papers in 153 HIV-related research areas were retrieved from the WoS database. This study suggests that HIV/AIDS research based on HBTs is increasing, and mainly focuses on elucidating traditional HIV driven factors and consonant with western perspectives most HBTs tend to be individually focused. Despite its important advancement, more research based on HBTs is essential to provide cultural background, social value, and contextualized factors where the HIV pandemic is dynamic; where new cases are transmitted from high-risk subgroups to the general population; and where epidemiological, social, and behavioral transitions change new infection routes, new perspectives for health service delivery especially non-medical services, and resource allocation.",

In this review, we estimated the HIV-1 molecular evolution over the past 40 years (1980-2019) in Angola to help guide affordable strategies for HIV-1 epidemic surveillance. We searched for studies written in English or Portuguese on HIV-1 diversity and DRMs carried out in Angola and published between 1980 and 2019. This review yielded eight studies describing a total of 493 samples. No HIV-1 Group N, O, and P were identified, whereas a ll non-B subtypes f rom Group M were identified. About 66% of HIV-1 subtypes were pure subtype and 34% recombinant strains. The frequency of recombinant strains increases from 1980 to 2019 (23.6%-41.4%, p<0.001). The subtypes C, F1, CRF02_AG, and the recombinant U/H were the most frequent. One DRM in the PIs was found (I54 M), 22 in the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and 18 in the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). The major DRM in the NRTIs was the M184V, whereas the G190A, K103N, and Y181C were the major DRMs in the NNRTIs. Over the past 40 years, the frequency of the DRM M184V (50-64.3%, p=0.363), G190A (17.2-46.2%, p=0.021), and K103N (34.5-42.3%, p=0.551) increased, while the frequency of Y181C (17.2-7.7%, p=0.289) decreased. The current review shows an increase in HIV-1 genetic complexity and DRMs in Angola. Our findings suggest the need to include PIs or integrase strand transfer inhibitors in the first-line antiretroviral therapy regimens in Angola.",

There is still insufficient data to discuss the effects of the new generation drugs, namely integrase inhibitors and fusion inhibitors, on skeletal muscle.

STLV-I clades and HTLV-I cladesdo not cluster according to species of origin, but rather according to geographicorigin of the host.Within PTLV-I, the oldest phylogenetic lineages are found inAsian macaques, and the African HTLV-I subtypes Ib, Id, Ie and If have closelyrelated simian relatives.The Melanesian/Australian HTLV-Ic and cosmopolitan Iasubtypes are also separated from the other subtypes by simian clades.Therefore,the different HTLV-I subtypes most probably each have a separate simian origin.HTLV-Ic most probably originated through interspecies transmission fromIndonesian macaques to humans migrating to Melanesia and Australia around 50000 years ago.The African human and simian T-cell lymphotropic lineages aroselater as a consequence of host migrations from Asia to Africa.The transmission ofAsian PTLV-I to African simians and humans, resulted in an explosive spread ofthis virus in Africa.The cosmopolitan HTLV-Ia, originating in Africa, was spreadover the world due to post-Columbian human migrations.Within PTLV-II, human andsimian viruses are phylogenetically well separated and it is not clear yet ifinterspecies transmissions took place within this PTLV type. Both clades have anAfrican origin.Three HTLV-II subtypes exist, HTLV-IId is found in Efe pygmies fromCongo and HTLV-IIa and IIb are found in Amerindian tribes, drug users and a fewAfricans. Most probably HTLV-IIa and IIb were brought from Africa to America as aresult of the migrations of the human host over the Bering strait, 10 000 to 35 000years ago, and were only recently introduced into injecting drug users. STLV-L alsohas an African origin, but whether PTLV originated in Africa or in Asia can not beconcluded form the available information.What is clear now is that this T-celllymphotropic virus repeatedly jumped from simians to humans, raising concernsabout xenotransplantation.Key wordsHTLV.

    "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent in patients with HIV infection and appears to be more severe than in HIV-uninfected patients. Both metabolic (e.g., obesity and insulin resistance) and HIV-related factors (e.g., antiretroviral treatment and inflammation) play a role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD in this population. Accordingly, all patients with HIV infection should be evaluated for the presence of NAFLD. Ultrasound is the first-line diagnostic procedure, but non-alcoholic steatohepatitis has to be diagnosed with liver biopsy. However, non-invasive methods, including serological markers and transient elastography, might also be useful in this population. Lifestyle changes represent the cornerstone of treatment. Bariatric surgery, pioglitazone, and vitamin E can be considered in patients with significant fibrosis or at high risk for progression of NAFLD, including those with type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, elevated transaminases, or pronounced necroinflammation. However, there are no studies that evaluated the safety of efficacy of diet, exercise, or pharmacotherapy in this population. Therefore, research is needed to identify safe and effective pharmacological treatments for NAFLD in patients with HIV infection. (",

    "abstract": "Advances in antiretroviral therapy have led to dramatic improvements in survival of HIV-infected persons. However, HIV cure remains elusive and lifelong treatment is needed. Attempts for reducing long-term drug exposure, toxicities, and cost, while maintaining viral suppression, have led to explore whether maintenance strategies with less than triple therapy could be feasible using the newest more potent antiretrovirals. While monotherapies have failed to do so with selection of drug resistance, some dual combinations have proven its efficacy when used sequentially in patients with viral suppression under standard triple regimens. Furthermore, the advent of coformulations makes easier long-term drug adherence. Herein, we review the current experience with the new single tablet regimen of dolutegravir (DTG) and rilpivirine (RPV) (Juluca®). It is the first approved two-drug single-tablet regimen and the first dual nuc-sparing coformulation. Two randomized, non-inferiority clinical trials (SWORD-1 and -2) and five observational studies have evaluated DTG-RPV in treatment-experienced patients. Despite distinct inclusion criteria, more than 95% of patients kept plasma HIV-RNA undetectable for at least 48 weeks. Along with virological efficacy being non-inferior to triple regimens, the tolerance of DTG-RPV was good, being discontinuations due to adverse events only 0.8-7.9%. Moreover, improvements were seen in lipid profiles in patients switched from protease inhibitors, and in renal and bone biomarkers in those switched from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Finally, resistance is rare failing on DTG-RPV. In summary, DTG-RPV is a novel two-drug coformulation that can be effectively and safely used in treatment-experienced patients with viral suppression if the virus is fully susceptible to both drugs. Its unique features make this drug one of the best options as long-term regimen or lifelong maintenance HIV therapy.",

    "abstract": "Dual therapy refers to combinations of two antiretroviral drugs applied in different clinical settings; they are considered and studied due to possibly reduced drug toxicities. In antiretroviral-naive patients, dual combinations have lower virologic efficacy than standard therapy; the sole efficacious regimen is lamivudine plus lopinavir/ritonavir. Due to a higher possibility of virologic failure, these regimens are generally not allowed in this clinical setting. In antiretroviral-experienced patients, dual regimens are examined in studies with a small sample size, centered on clinical practice, and should be ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor-based. These combinations have a good virological efficacy; combinations with the integrase inhibitor raltegravir have small sample size and demonstrated efficacy only with etravirine. Virological aspects involving dual therapy should always consider genetic barriers, particularly in simplification strategies, and ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors are mandatory. As far as immunological aspects are concerned, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-sparing regimens have some encouraging data, probably due to the bone marrow toxicity of this class. Combinations with maraviroc were effective in reducing inflammation, but data about immunological recovery are conflicting. The choice of regimen should focus on specific class toxicity since dual regimens are studied in particular for improving safety and tolerability. This review will analyze different dual regimens in the clinical setting, with a peculiar focus on ameliorating toxicities and improving quality of life.",

Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) from concomitant use of multiple drugs increase the risk of drug toxicities, sub-optimal therapy, and drug resistance. With the increase in polypharmacy, involving antiretroviral (ARV), and anticancer drugs, there is a greater need for an appreciation of clinically relevant DDIs. Anticancer and ARV drugs studied in this review were from The World Health Organization's Model List of Essential Medicines 2017. We reviewed; drug package inserts, www.drugbank.ca and www.UpToDate.com, to evaluate pharmacokinetic interactions with cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and ABCB1. The DDIs between drugs were assessed using the University Of Liverpool, UK HIV Drug Interactions Checker, and the LexiComp Drug Interaction tool of www.UpToDate.com. About 70% of ARVs studied interact with CYP450, all involve CYP3A4, and 55% interact with ABCB1. About 65% of anticancer drugs interact with CYP450, 44% of which do so through CYP3A4. About 75% of anticancer drugs interact with ARV drugs, with nine absolute contraindications to concomitant therapy. There exist a substantial number of DDIs between ARV and anticancer drugs, primarily mediated through CYP450 enzymes. Dolutegravir based regimens offer the safest DDI profile for concurrent use with anticancer drugs. However, there are substantial gaps in our knowledge, and this study serves to highlight the need for additional research to better define these interactions and their effect on drug exposure, as attention to these DDIs is a relatively simple intervention that could lead to optimizing disease treatment.

    "abstract": "The prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically in recent decades worldwide. An increase in the prevalence of obesity has also been observed among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in high and low incomes countries. Antiretroviral therapy (ART), by controlling the viral load (VL) and restoring cellular immunity, has improved the health status and life expectancy in PLHIV. However, the risk of developing non-AIDS events (NAEs) remains higher than the general population. Therefore, specific attention is given to managing risk factors associated with NAEs during the follow-up of PLHIV, including obesity. Factors related to weight gain in PLHIV include demographic factors, HIV disease-related factors, and ART-associated factors. In naive PLHIV, weight gain after the initiation of ART is expected. The weight gains observed are generally not severe even if there appear to be risk factors such as the advanced stage of disease (low CD4 cells count and high VL), female sex, black race, and taking integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI) associated or not with tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF). The role of each antiretroviral drug per-se remains to clarify. As INSTI ± TAF has been associated with significant weight gain, further research is needed to identify the individual-level factors predictive of weight gain, the mechanisms of ART-associated weight gain and the clinical relevance of this weight gain. As PLHIV survive longer on effective ART, the prevention and management of NAEs will remain a challenge for healthcare providers.",

The PubMed electronic database and gray literature were searched from inception until March 2020. Studies were included if they reported the levels of immune activation and reconstitution at baseline and post-treatment. The random-effect model was used to calculate effect sizes. We included a total of ten studies comprising of 1 553 PLWH with an average age of 38.02 ± 10.10 years and a male/female ratio of 3.76. Pooled estimates showed a modest increase in the level of immune activation post-treatment (SMD: 0.64 [95% CI: -1.34, 2.63]; I2 = 98%, pH < 0.00001). In addition, treatment with ART significantly reconstituted the immune system (SMD: 0.70 [95% CI: 0.27, 1.44]; I2 = 68%, pH = 0.009). Notably, the level of immune reconstitution was independent of viral load or the treatment duration but dependent on the class of ARV drugs. Consequently, protease inhibitors were associated with the highest degree of immune restoration, followed by chemokine antagonists and lastly integrase inhibitors. In conclusion, immune activation persists in PLWH despite viral suppression and the degree of immune reconstitution is dependent on the drug class. Therefore, inclusion of protease inhibitors in ART may be of great benefit in immune restoration in patients with very low CD4 count.",

    "abstract": "Since 1996 and the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapies, multiple drugs have been developed. The best choice of drugs to start with still remains debated, especially regarding the choice between protease inhibitor-based or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based regimens. Regarding the regimen's ability to control viral replication, both have been proven to be very efficient in large settings of patients. Regarding short-term tolerability, both classes are responsible for various side effects in 10-25% of patients. Regarding long-term tolerability, protease inhibitor-based regimens may be responsible for metabolism abnormalities (hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes), although the role of the associated nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor is not always clear. Patient adherence to the regimen is the cornerstone of efficacy. Resistance acquisition in case of poor adherence leading to treatment failure is a key issue regarding the ability to build future efficient regimens. Failure while using protease inhibitor-based regimens seldom leads to acquired resistance. Failure while using nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based regimens leads to resistance, but the new available nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors do not share the same patterns of resistance, so that the well-known class resistance in case of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor failure is no longer valid. Drug-drug interactions are frequent with all antiretrovirals and require close monitoring. In conclusion, protease inhibitor-based and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based regimens each have many advantages. The best choice will essentially be made taking into account the patients' characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Exosomes are nanovesicles that can be released into the extracellular medium by different cell types and are considered an important system of intercellular communication. In some instances, on secretion, exosomes break down and release their content into the extracellular space. Alternatively, intact exosomes can interact with other cells and discharge their content directly into the target cell cytoplasm. Exosomes are rich in endosome-associated proteins (i.e., the tetraspanin family) but also carry different molecules in their lumen including proteins, RNAs (i.e., microRNAs), and pathogenderived cargo. Indeed, the different biological functions of exosomes might depend on their cargo components. Several recent publications have identified exosomes as new players in the pathogenesis of HIV infection. This is an emerging field of growing interest that deserved a satellite symposium at the 9th IAS Conference held in Paris in July 2017, sponsored by the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (EVs). Although the role of exosomes in HIV infection is not yet clarified, accumulating data suggest that exosomes may act at different levels of HIV pathogenesis by modulating immune responses, infectivity, or even by activating the latent viral reservoir. However, there are still methodological limitations that need to be resolved to advance our understanding of the role of exosomes in HIV infection. One particular limitation is to define an accurate and reproducible procedure for their isolation. A new strategy to separate exosomes from HIV-1-infected cells was proposed at this symposium. Martin-Jaular and colleagues (Institut Curie, France) used velocity centrifugation gradients and antibody labeling of specific endosome-associated protein markers (i.e., CD45+ and AChE+) to isolate pure exosomes from complex preparations of EVs. Separately, Arakelyan and colleagues (NIH, USA) used flow cytometry coupled with magnetic nanoparticles to characterize the antigenic composition of EVs and demonstrate that EVs carrying HIV envelope proteins facilitated HIV infection. This is an interesting observation that could lead to the discovery of new antiviral drugs targeting EVs that contain HIV-Env. Exosomes might also have an effect on the viral reservoir. Kashanchi et al. (George Mason University, USA) presented interesting results demonstrating how exosomes from HIV-uninfected cells could reactivate latent HIV-1 in infected cells. They proposed a mechanism in which exosomes might increase RNA polymerase II loading onto the HIV-1 promoter in the infected cells, thereby facilitating transcription and leading to an increase of cellular activation. These presentations represent just a small piece of the growing body of research focused on the role of exosomes in HIV infection. We stand at the beginning of a new source of knowledge of HIV pathogenesis that may provide novel strategies to control HIV infectivity, regulate HIV-reactive immune responses, and act against the HIV reservoir. The impact of exosomes on HIV infection at all these levels should be considered in ongoing and future approaches to achieve HIV remission and cure.",

In 1981, the first cases of AIDS were reported and wide diagnostic testing helped to characterize high-risk groups and the global burden of the epidemic. With Coronavirus Disease (COVID)-19, everything has happened too fast and both cases and fatalities are huge but still uncertain in most places. Diagnostic testing of active and past SARS-CoV-2 infections needs to expand rapidly, ideally using rapid tests. COVID-19 deaths are highly concentrated in the elderly population, with a large proportion of fatalities being \"with\" rather than \"by\" SARS-CoV-2 infection. They are often the result of inadequate health care due to overwhelming demands. To date, there is no specific therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several antivirals are being tested clinically, including remdesivir, at this time the most promising. For others such as lopinavir/ritonavir, neither significant virological nor clinical benefit has been shown. Given the characteristic pulmonary cytokine storm underlying the pathogenic mechanism of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress, antiinflammatory agents are being investigated. The benefit of corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, etc., is limited. Monoclonal antibodies targeting different pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin 6 agent, are being tried with encouraging results. Ultimately a protective vaccine will be the best response for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. (AIDS Rev.",

World Health Organization QOL HIV (WHOQOL HIV-BREF) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were used to assess QOL and depression in PLWHA, respectively. The study population was divided into five groups on the basis of Cluster of Differentiation 4 (CD4) count as follows: Group A [< 50 cells/μL], Group B [50-199 cells/μL], Group C [200-349 cells/μL], Group D [350-499 cells/μL], and Group E [>500 cells/μL]. The lowest mean scores were noted under Group A [< 50 cells/μL] in physical and psychological domains and the highest mean scores were noted under Group E [> 500 cells/μL] in physical and environment domains. PHQ9 scores negatively correlated with QOL domains and the correlation was statistically significant (p < 0.001) with the highest negative correlation was found in relation to the psychological domain (r = -0.739). The PHQ9 score in those who do not have opportunistic illnesses (7.23 ± 6.14) was lower in comparison to those who had opportunistic illnesses (9.81 ± 6.40) and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). We observed that there was almost a chronological increase in the individual QOL domain score and a decrease in the PHQ9 score with an increase in CD4 count. Our result supports the implementation of routine screening for depression in antiretroviral therapy centers and multidisciplinary interventions to improve outcomes among depressed PLWHA.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease has been frequent in HIV-infected patients both before and after the advent of antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The pathogenic basis for the increase of cardiovascular disease, in particular myocardial lesions, may involve HIV-1 itself or other mechanisms including endothelial dysfunction, activation of proinflammatory cytokines, and changes in platelets, which lead to atherosclerotic lesions of blood vessels. In the last decade, among the proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin 18 seems to play a central role in the inflammatory cascade, leading to development of atherosclerotic disease and the occurrence of ischemic heart disease in uninfected HIV-1 people. Increased levels of interleukin 18 were observed in HIV-1 infected patients. This review attempts to evaluate the role of interleukin 18 in cardiovascular disease, especially in myocardial infarction, in HIV-1 infection, as well as the relationship between interleukin 18 and atherosclerotic plaque formation. Two other characteristic aspects in HIV-1 infection, metabolic syndrome and lipodystrophy, will be evaluated in light of activity of interleukin 18. Moreover, the role of platelets and interleukin 18 as an important linkage between chronic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and atherogenesis will be highlighted. Finally, experimental an animal model of rhesus macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus clearly demonstrates the involvement of interleukin 18 in myocardial lesions, and that circulating levels of interleukin 18 are important predictors of coronary heart disease. In conclusion, interleukin 18 may be considered a partner in crime with other factors, including endothelial dysfunction, increased expression and production of adhesion molecules and proinflammatory cytokines in determining cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "The huge success of current antiretroviral therapy is mediated by a triple effect: (i) Halting progression to AIDS in infected persons; (ii) reducing the risk of transmission to contacts (treatment as prevention); and (iii) minimizing the risk of HIV acquisition treating uninfected persons at risk (pre-exposure prophylaxis). However, UNAIDS has estimated that only 70% of infected people globally are diagnosed, only 53% are treated, and overall 44% have undetectable viral load, which is the necessary request for ensuring any antiretroviral benefit. Thus, with 37 million people currently living with HIV worldwide and more than 2 million new infections per year, the prospects for global HIV eradication are far on the horizon. Over the past couple of years, rapid development has been seen for technologies enabling modification of gene expression, either by direct inhibition by RNA interference (RNAi) or by genomic modification at DNA level. In particular, genome-editing endonucleases have significantly improved our ability to make precise changes in the DNA of eukaryotic cells. Notably, firstgeneration genome-editing technologies (i.e., ZFNs and TALENs) have been replaced by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR/Cas9), which work with a short guide RNA (gRNA) to hybridize to a target DNA site and recruit the Cas9 endonuclease. Once integrated into the host genome, HIV gene expression is regulated by the LTR promoter. Hypothetically, gene editing of the HIV promoter might have the potential to deactivate viral transcription by the introduction of mutations or fragment excision. HIV gene therapy progressed very slowly until recent breakthroughs in gene-editing methods using CRISPR/Cas9 (Liao et al. Nat Commun 2015;6:6413). Using a shorter version of the Cas9 endonuclease ensembled into an adenoviral vector, critical segments of thAQ!e viral DNA genome spanning between the LTR and gag regions were successfully removed in HIV transgenic mice. Excision was confirmed in all examined tissues as well as in circulating lymphocytes and resulted in a drastic reduction of HIV-RNA (Kaminski et al. Gene Ther 2016;23:690-5). Moreover, using latently infected CD4+ T lymphocytes from HIV-infected persons, lentiviral-delivered CRISPR/Cas9 precisely removed the entire HIV genome spanning between the 50 and 30 LTRs of integrated HIV proviral DNA (Kaminski et al., Sci Rep 2016;6:22555), providing a proof of concept of the high potential of genome-editing technologies. Before moving to the clinic, the CRISPR/Cas9 technology must solve several major issues in the HIV scenario. First, generation of resistance is a major concern. Mutations may occur surrounding the targeted site and result in the selection of strains that are no longer recognized nor cleaved by CRISPR (Badia et al. Curr Opin Virol 2017;24:46-54). The efficacy of the anti-HIV CRISPR/Cas9 strategy is highly dependent on the gRNA sequence, yet some mutant viral strains show poor or no cleavage at all. Higher CRISPR/Cas9 pressure could delay but not eliminate viral replication when using a combination of distinct gRNAs targeting distinct HIV proviral genes. In this case, although the reading frame may remain unaltered, an accumulation of insertions and/or deletions may occur in the target sequence, rendering new viral strains insensitive to CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage. Finally, double-strand breaks resulting from CRISPR/Cas9 activity and subsequent cellular non-homologous end joining machinery may introduce mutations in sequences that are no longer recognized by the gRNA, and therefore not susceptible to Cas9 cleavage. A second consideration is a need for developing safe and effective mechanisms of delivery. Adenoviral vectors have long been studied in gene therapy and represent an ideal viral vector for transduction at different tissues. However, the packaging size of adenoviral vectors is a limiting factor, especially for CRIPSR/Cas9. Third, HIV has a genome of about 10 kb while a gRNA generally only targets 20 bp of the DNA molecule, which means that there are thousands available targeting sites for the provirus in latently infected cells. To date, there is no platform established solely for gRNA candidate evaluation in HIV provirus eradication. A final consideration is an access to all tissues and cells potentially harboring the HIV provirus, including reservoirs as the central nervous system. In this regard, efforts are being focused in the development of Cas9/gRNA nanoparticle formulations. To overcome these problems, a group in Florida recently developed human transgenic cells that may be used for gene-editing studies and as platform for high-throughput screen of HIV provirus disrupters (Huang et al. Sci Rep 2017;7:5955). Of note, Cas9 protein instead of a Cas9 plasmid was used. Compared to a plasmid introduction, Cas9 protein agents could be easily quantitatively applied and standardized, mimicking better real clinic scenarios. In summary, RNAi-based technologies have widely dominated gene therapy research during the past decade, with overall slow progress. However, the advent of new gene-editing technologies, and especially the CRISPR/Cas9 system, has revolutionized the field. In the HIV context, CRISPR/Cas9 applications might go further than those of RNAi, for example, enabling excision of segments of integrated proviral DNA from latently infected cells and allowing complete provirus elimination, or it may be used to reverse HIV latency. Although important challenges still need to be overcome, a promising pathway to HIV cure seems to have been found.",

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the association of U. urealyticum and M. hominis with HIV infection. We searched seven databases to retrieve articles reporting the prevalence of genital mycoplasmas among HIV-infected patients. Pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and displayed by forest plots. Cochran Q and I2 statistics were applied to assess heterogeneity. In addition, a funnel plot with an Egger's test was performed to evaluate potential publication bias. Of the 1123 articles identified, 12 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. Our results revealed that HIV-infected patients had higher colonization rates by U. urealyticum and M. hominis (single infection) than the control group (OR = 1.526; 95% CI: 1.202-1.937; p = 0.001 and OR = 2.610; 95% CI: 1.890-3.604; p = 0,000, respectively). However, coinfection seemed to be not associated with HIV infection (OR = 1.311; 95% CI: 0.744-2.311; p = 0.348). A subgroup analysis showed that study design and geographical origin were a source of heterogeneity in the studies that reported coinfection among HIV-infected patients. However, there was no statistical evidence of publication bias. Our study revealed that genital mycoplasmas were more frequent in HIV-infected patients than healthy individuals, resulting from a decline of natural immunity due to HIV. More effort should be dedicated to the screening, prevention, and treatment of genital mycoplasmas, to curb the spread of HIV.",

    "abstract": "There is a widespread practice of using 'sex' and 'gender' interchangeably. The World Health Organization considers that they are not. It defines sex as a set of chromosome-dependent biological variables that show unique hormone profiles and anatomy. Conversely, gender refers to socially constructed sex attributions with differential roles, behavioral expressions, identity, etc. Researchers and institutions have proposed guidelines to ensure that good science is not compromised by ideologies, media or social pressures, morality, religion or economic interests. Sex differences are immune to any ideology or socio-cultural interest, because they are governed by biologically determined genetic parameters. Considering men and women to be alike is very valuable from a moral or social perspective, but ignoring differences could be wrong and unacceptable from a biomedical perspective. The organization of health and/or research systems that does not consider the different morbidity, evolution or treatment response depending on sex would generate biases and mistakes. To work on medical innovation with a gender perspective should need to take sex differences into account and integrate them properly, recognizing diversity. The controversy is not just about sex or gender, but about sex and gender and how they may influence each other. Maintaining a scientific and academic approach will help both to advance science and enrich laws and/or ideologies.",

This ambitious goal can be achieved by combining at least two fully active antiretroviral drugs with an optimized background regimen according to genotypic and phenotypic resistance testing. This favorable situation has been accomplished by the advent of new compounds in already known drug classes (e.g. second-generation protease inhibitors and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) as well as thanks to the development of new drug classes with a different mode of action (e.g. fusion inhibitors, integrase inhibitors, and coreceptor antagonists). Moreover, new diagnostic tools have been developed to better predict virologic response and tolerability of a given regimen in the individual patient, such as weighted mutation scores, virtual phenotypes, viral tropism assays, pharmacogenetics and pharmacokinetic analyses. This new array of therapeutic and diagnostic tools requires a highly specialized training of the treating physician to achieve the ultimate goal of halting disease progression. The purpose of this review is to introduce the new drugs and drug classes, and discuss their safety and use in combination therapy of multidrug-resistant viruses, guided by new diagnostic tools.",

Both HIV infection and melanoma share common immune-pathological pathways: immune checkpoints are being targeted for melanoma immunotherapy and investigated as a \"shock and kill\" strategy for latency reversion among HIV-positive individuals. Nevertheless, a substantial lack of information exists on epidemiology, clinical features, and management of MM in HIV, due to compartmentalized approaches and poor awareness about the problem. In this narrative review, we aimed at analyzing available data regarding MM in PLWHA to point out key knowledge gaps and future opportunities from an integrated dermatology, oncology, and infectious diseases standpoint. To date, a strong association between HIV infection and MM risk still needs to be effectively demonstrated; nevertheless, once this cancer has developed in HIV-positive people, it shows more aggressive course, worse prognosis, and seemingly peculiar clinical and histological features.

    "abstract": "The huge success of current antiretroviral therapy is mediated by a triple effect: (i) Halting progression to AIDS in infected persons; (ii) reducing the risk of transmission to contacts (treatment as prevention); and (iii) minimizing the risk of HIV acquisition treating uninfected persons at risk (pre-exposure prophylaxis). However, UNAIDS has estimated that only 70% of infected people globally are diagnosed, only 53% are treated, and overall 44% have undetectable viral load, which is the necessary request for ensuring any antiretroviral benefit. Thus, with 37 million people currently living with HIV worldwide and more than 2 million new infections per year, the prospects for global HIV eradication are far on the horizon. Over the past couple of years, rapid development has been seen for technologies enabling modification of gene expression, either by direct inhibition by RNA interference (RNAi) or by genomic modification at DNA level. In particular, genome-editing endonucleases have significantly improved our ability to make precise changes in the DNA of eukaryotic cells. Notably, firstgeneration genome-editing technologies (i.e., ZFNs and TALENs) have been replaced by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR/Cas9), which work with a short guide RNA (gRNA) to hybridize to a target DNA site and recruit the Cas9 endonuclease. Once integrated into the host genome, HIV gene expression is regulated by the LTR promoter. Hypothetically, gene editing of the HIV promoter might have the potential to deactivate viral transcription by the introduction of mutations or fragment excision. HIV gene therapy progressed very slowly until recent breakthroughs in gene-editing methods using CRISPR/Cas9 (Liao et al. Nat Commun 2015;6:6413). Using a shorter version of the Cas9 endonuclease ensembled into an adenoviral vector, critical segments of thAQ!e viral DNA genome spanning between the LTR and gag regions were successfully removed in HIV transgenic mice. Excision was confirmed in all examined tissues as well as in circulating lymphocytes and resulted in a drastic reduction of HIV-RNA (Kaminski et al. Gene Ther 2016;23:690-5). Moreover, using latently infected CD4+ T lymphocytes from HIV-infected persons, lentiviral-delivered CRISPR/Cas9 precisely removed the entire HIV genome spanning between the 50 and 30 LTRs of integrated HIV proviral DNA (Kaminski et al., Sci Rep 2016;6:22555), providing a proof of concept of the high potential of genome-editing technologies. Before moving to the clinic, the CRISPR/Cas9 technology must solve several major issues in the HIV scenario. First, generation of resistance is a major concern. Mutations may occur surrounding the targeted site and result in the selection of strains that are no longer recognized nor cleaved by CRISPR (Badia et al. Curr Opin Virol 2017;24:46-54). The efficacy of the anti-HIV CRISPR/Cas9 strategy is highly dependent on the gRNA sequence, yet some mutant viral strains show poor or no cleavage at all. Higher CRISPR/Cas9 pressure could delay but not eliminate viral replication when using a combination of distinct gRNAs targeting distinct HIV proviral genes. In this case, although the reading frame may remain unaltered, an accumulation of insertions and/or deletions may occur in the target sequence, rendering new viral strains insensitive to CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage. Finally, double-strand breaks resulting from CRISPR/Cas9 activity and subsequent cellular non-homologous end joining machinery may introduce mutations in sequences that are no longer recognized by the gRNA, and therefore not susceptible to Cas9 cleavage. A second consideration is a need for developing safe and effective mechanisms of delivery. Adenoviral vectors have long been studied in gene therapy and represent an ideal viral vector for transduction at different tissues. However, the packaging size of adenoviral vectors is a limiting factor, especially for CRIPSR/Cas9. Third, HIV has a genome of about 10 kb while a gRNA generally only targets 20 bp of the DNA molecule, which means that there are thousands available targeting sites for the provirus in latently infected cells. To date, there is no platform established solely for gRNA candidate evaluation in HIV provirus eradication. A final consideration is an access to all tissues and cells potentially harboring the HIV provirus, including reservoirs as the central nervous system. In this regard, efforts are being focused in the development of Cas9/gRNA nanoparticle formulations. To overcome these problems, a group in Florida recently developed human transgenic cells that may be used for gene-editing studies and as platform for high-throughput screen of HIV provirus disrupters (Huang et al. Sci Rep 2017;7:5955). Of note, Cas9 protein instead of a Cas9 plasmid was used. Compared to a plasmid introduction, Cas9 protein agents could be easily quantitatively applied and standardized, mimicking better real clinic scenarios. In summary, RNAi-based technologies have widely dominated gene therapy research during the past decade, with overall slow progress. However, the advent of new gene-editing technologies, and especially the CRISPR/Cas9 system, has revolutionized the field. In the HIV context, CRISPR/Cas9 applications might go further than those of RNAi, for example, enabling excision of segments of integrated proviral DNA from latently infected cells and allowing complete provirus elimination, or it may be used to reverse HIV latency. Although important challenges still need to be overcome, a promising pathway to HIV cure seems to have been found.",

    "abstract": "There are no standardized criteria to characterize confirmed protocol-defined virological failure (PDVF) nor the inclusion criteria for the resistance analysis population (RAP) in Phase III randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of initial antiretroviral therapy (ART). We assessed the clinical impact of mismatching between virological non-response (HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL), confirmed PDVF (48 weeks), and RAP definition in studies with the newest first-line ART. A systematic review of all Phase III RCTs was performed, including preferred once-daily ART (EACS European AIDS guidelines) or recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. We identified 16 treatment arms (14 RCTs) with 6175 participants treated with dolutegravir, bictegravir, elvitegravir/cobicistat, raltegravir, darunavir/cobicistat, rilpivirine, or doravirine. Plasma HIV-1 RNA thresholds for PDVF or RAP ranged from 40 to 50, 200, 400, and 500 copies/mL. This led to discrepancies between trials regarding the participants defined as virological non-responders, PDVF, or included in RAP. Overall, 85/296 (29%) patients with PDVF were not genotyped. There was a linear correlation between the threshold of HIV RNA chosen to perform genotyping and rates of participants with PDVF but not genotyped. Only eight treatment arms genotyped all participants with PDVF. Most of the remaining eight arms genotyped roughly < 50% of those with PDVF. In summary, the absence of standardized definitions of VF and criteria for resistance testing in pivotal Phase III RCTs of the first-line ART leads to the possibility of underreporting of resistance mutations when genotypes are only performed at higher viral load cutoffs. Stringent homogeneous criteria should be defined to ensure that all participants with PDVF (e.g., confirmed HIV RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL and the second > 200 copies/mL) undergo genotyping.",

The current treatment guidelines continue the convention of preferred cART based on combining a dual nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone with a third \"anchor\" agent, such as a ritonavir (r)- or cobicistat (c)-boosted protease inhibitor (PI), a non-NRTI (NNRTI), or an integrase inhibitor (INI) boosted or unboosted. However, due to toxicities of NRTIs, sparing NRTI regimen has been studied for a long time with moderate success due to low efficacy (especially in patients with high viral load and low CD4) compare to standard triple therapy. New strategy with lamivudine (3TC) plus a boosted PI or INI showed promise results and indicated that modern two-drug regimens might now, in fact, become a reliable treatment for HIV-infected naïve patients.

    "abstract": "Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been shown to be an effective approach to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections; however, implementation of the service remains challenging. This global bibliometric analysis aims to describe the current trends in HIV research prevention through PrEP to reveal the potential gaps of knowledge and to put forward recommendations for future research. A bibliometric analysis was conducted through Web of Science from 1990 to 2017. Exploratory factor analysis was also employed to find research domains emerging from the abstracts' contents. Latent Dirichlet allocation, which is a topic modeling algorithm, was utilized to perform text mining and determine relationships among text documents. A total of 4852 papers regarding HIV PrEP research were retrieved. The number of papers and their impact has significantly increased. Preventing sexual transmissions, improving access, and quality of health-care services for current users, as well as men who have sex with men, pregnant women and children, were the research domains most related to PrEP. We found a data gap in research regarding sex workers, potential side effects of PrEP, and misjudgment toward PrEP users. Despite the growth in research about HIV PrEP, there exist barriers to scaling up the implementation of PrEP worldwide and for such intervention to reach its fWull potential. International research collaboration efforts to investigate the potential safety concerns of PrEP and develop strategies to eliminate social misjudgment against PrEP users are warranted. Addressing these knowledge gaps might facilitate the development of effective global implementation strategies for PrEP in the future.",

    "abstract": "The continuous rising of HIV drug resistance in low- and middle-income countries and its impact on treatment failure is a growing threat for the HIV treatment response. This review aimed to document pre-antiretroviral therapy (ART) CD4 counts, emerging drug resistance, and treatment failure in HIV-infected individuals initiating ART. We performed an online search in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, African Index Medicus, Cochrane library, and The National Institute for Health Clinical Trials Registry of relevant articles published from January 1996 to June 2019. Of 1755 original studies retrieved, 28 were retained for final analysis. Treatment failure varied between 5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.7-7.4) and 72% (95% CI: 55-89.6), while resistance varied between 1% (95% CI: 0.47-1.5) and 48% (95% CI: 28.4-67.6). Participants with a pre-ART CD4 count below 200 cell/μl and low adherence showed higher percentages of resistance and failure, while those with CD4 count above 200 showed lower resistance and failure regardless adherence levels. Most frequent resistance mutations included the M184I/V for the nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), K103N, and Y181 for the non-NRTIs (NNRTIs), and L90M for the Protease inhibitors. Pre-ART CD4 count and adherence to treatment could play a key role in reducing drug resistance and treatment failure. The increased access to ART in resources limited settings should be accompanied by regular CD4 count testing, drug resistance monitoring, and continuous promotion of adherence. In addition, the rising of resistance mutations associated with NRTIs and NNRTIs, suggest that alternative ART regimens should be considered. (AIDS Rev. 2020;22:<FP>-0).",

Facing the cost-effectiveness and the health-related issues encountered with antiretroviral treatments, scientists have imagined and conceived gene therapies to tackle HIV infection. The success of such an approach was proved with the \"Berlin\" patient then recently reiterated in the \"London\" patient. In fact, the recent progress made in HIV gene therapy could provide a rapid emergence of powerful strategies to treat and totally cure the infection. Based on their principles, these approaches can be separated in three strategies that are (1) engineering HIV target cells to render them resistant to HIV replication, (2) generating genemodified cells able to secrete antiviral proteins that interfere with HIV entry, and (3) modifying cytotoxic T cells to selectively target and eliminate infected cells. Herein, we proposed to review these approaches, their safety and their benefits as reported in recent publications.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 infection usually progresses to AIDS within 10 years in antiretroviral therapy untreated individuals, but there is a group of infected individuals, known as controllers, who maintain low plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and normal CD4+ T-cell counts for many years. Evidence suggests that the mechanisms of viral control in these individuals are heterogeneous. In this review, we highlight the viral and host factors, particularly host immunological and immunogenetic factors that are associated with controller status. Despite the broad heterogeneity within controllers, there is compelling evidence that cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocyte responses act as the main driver of control in the majority of these individuals, especially in those with protective HLA-I alleles. Further investigation of controllers without protective HLA-I alleles is required as it seems that this subset exhibits more durable control of HIV-1 disease progression. Understanding the immune defense mechanisms in controllers provides hope for harnessing these responses in the general population, either for protective or therapeutic vaccines or to achieve a functional cure in infected individuals.",

Researchers and scientists have made tremendous progress in basic and clinical research on HIV. In particular, the widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has made it less of a deadly disease today and more of a manageable one. In the post- ART era when ART can significantly improve the immunity of people living with HIV (PLWH) and extend their life, the incidence of non-AIDS-defined cancers is greatly increased. Factors related to immunosuppression do not seem to explain this problem sufficiently. This suggests that besides immunosuppression, there are other mechanisms that may also contribute to the increased incidence of cancer in PLWH. Here, we summarized and discussed four possible mechanisms for the increased incidence of cancers in PLWH: immunosuppression, oncogenic viral infection, chronic infection, inflammatory damage, and the direct impact of HIV.",

Nine hundred and sixty (960) patient's record were included in analysis. More than half (63%) of patients were enrolled at primary care level while 37% were at tertiary level. Sixty one percent (n = 587) were female while 39% (n = 373) were males. There were no statistically significant differences in viral load suppression after 12 months of treatment between patients enrolled at tertiary level and primary care level, x2 = 0.75, p value = 0.56. Time to initiation was longer at tertiary (median = 126) compared to primary are level (median = 18), p < 0.001.

Thus, in the most recent study from 2012, the prevalence of HTLV-2 among IVDU in Stockholm was 3.2%. However, much of the epidemiological data on HTLV in Sweden stems from studies conducted primarily between the 1990s and 2007, and the impact of migration to Sweden during the past 15 years has not been evaluated. Despite Sweden's status as a country with generally low prevalence of HTLV, it is prudent to anticipate and prepare for several potential challenges associated with HTLV infection in the future. Proactive measures to enhance awareness, alongside strategies to curtail transmission and mitigate complications, are crucial for addressing this relatively rare, but significant health issue.

    "abstract": "The introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the 1990s has fundamentally transformed the landscape of HIV medicine, greatly improved disease morbidity and mortality, and reduced transmission rates across all demographic groups. Central to this success was the idea that to achieve best disease outcomes and minimize the development of drug resistance, at least antiretroviral agents should be used for HIV treatment. This therapeutic strategy is a core tenet of HIV medicine, backed by incontrovertible scientific evidence, and made easy to deploy by the high compliance levels with once-daily coformulations, which have generally been well tolerated. However, there has been increasing support for a paradigm shift toward dual therapy in recent years, particularly during the maintenance therapy phase of treatment. This concept advocates that once virologic suppression has been achieved with at least antiretroviral drugs during the treatment initiation phase, a switch to a two-drug regimen should be possible. The results of Phase III of the SWORD trials (Llibre et al., Abstract 44LB) and LAMIDOL trial (Joly et al., Abstract 458) presented at the 2017. Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections earlier this year seemed to lend support this hypothesis. More new evidence was recently presented at the 2107 International HIV/AIDS Society (IAS) meeting in Paris that adds to the growing body of evidence in favor of a two-drug regimen approach in maintenance therapy. The LATTE-2 study (Eron et al., Abstract 5628) was of major interest because of the exciting new therapeutic options that long-acting injectable antiretroviral agents may bring in the near future. However, than that, the findings of comparable response between a traditional three-drug oral regimen and a novel injectable two-drug regimen at 96 weeks were quite noteworthy. In this Phase II, multicenter open-label study of 286 HIV-infected ARTnaive patients, once-daily oral cabotegravir/abacavir/lamivudine achieved virologic suppression in 84% of study participants. In comparison, 87% in the injectable cabotegravir/rilpivirine once every 4-weekly group and 94% in injectable cabotegravir/rilpivirine once every 8-weekly group remained suppressed at 96 weeks. Crucially, no drug resistance mutations were seen in study participants who remained on their regimen. While the idea of a two-drug regimen has been entertained for maintenance therapy, there may be little willingness to push this further into the area of antiretroviral treatment initiation, for the justifiable concerns that exist around the emergence of drug resistance. Despite this, new data presented at the IAS 2017 showed that the idea is not without merit. In a proof of concept, the ACTG A5353 single-arm pilot study of 120 treatment naive HIV-infected participants with high viral load (VL ≥1000 and >500,000 copies/mL), showed that once-daily dolutegravir/lamivudine had virologic efficacy of 90% at 24 weeks, with 96% of the as-treated study population achieving VL >50 copies/mL (Taiwo et al., Abstract MOAB0107LB). The regimen was well tolerated, with no reported drug resistance mutations while on treatment. There are many real-world advantages to a two-drug regimen approach, among them lower costs (crucial in resource-limited settings where affordability may be a limiting factor), fewer adverse effects or drug toxicities, and possibly improved compliance. These are all important considerations, given that improved mortality now means patients are going to stay on ART treatment for much longer than previously seen. But how the two-drug regimen approach will hold up against firmly held norms and tradition is far from clear, and it is almost certain that the understandable nervousness that surrounds this idea will continue to last. Until the case for the two-drug regimen approach is made convincingly in ongoing and future trials, the three or more rule will reign, not only as the orthodoxy but also as the cornerstone of good clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Since its emergence, HIV has been linked to metabolic alterations with an impact on the distribution of fat and the weight of people living with HIV. While extreme weight loss and processes such as lipodystrophy were of concern at first, in recent years, and with the appearance of increasingly effective and better tolerated drugs, an abnormal weight gain is paradoxically taking place among people living with HIV. Although this weight gain is a multifactorial process in which lifestyle habits, physical exercise or diet have a great impact, antiretroviral treatment has been recently considered as one of the key causes of this increase according to different clinical trials and real-life cohorts. The use of integrase inhibitors, specifically dolutegravir or bictegravir, and being female and/or from African/American origin appear to contribute to weight gain. In contrast, drugs such as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate would be protective factors. Even though different mechanisms of action have been proposed by which these agents would cause weight gain, the exact processes remain unclarified. Efforts are currently focused on knowing not only these mechanisms, but, more importantly, on finding the clinical relevance that this abnormal weight gain could have in other pathologies such as diabetes or cardiovascular events.",

    "abstract": "The brief symptom inventory (BSI), a 53-item measure that assesses psychological distress, is a popular tool for measuring mental health symptoms among youth living with HIV (YLH) in the United States (US); however, it has been used inconsistently with this population. This scoping review summarizes discrepancies in the use of the BSI to identify opportunities to improve systematism and make recommendations for clinicians and researchers, and highlights correlates of psychological distress among YLH as measured by the BSI. Databases searched included PsycINFO, PubMed, and CENTRAL. Eligible studies that assessed psychological distress using the BSI among YLH, were conducted in the US, and were written in English. Of the 237 articles identified, 57 were selected for inclusion. Studies investigated associations between BSI scores and several variables, including pre- versus post-highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) era, ART adherence, sexual risk behavior, substance use, stigma, social support, self-efficacy, mode of HIV infection, and sexual orientation. There was variation in BSI elements used as outcome measures, sample age ranges, and reporting of mean scores and cutoff t-scores. 89.5% (n = 51) of studies did not report which BSI norms were used in their data analysis, and 68.4% of studies (n = 39) did not report the cut-off t-score value used. Variability in study objectives restricted this study to a scoping review rather than a meta-analysis. Generalizability to non-US settings is another limitation. More consistency in how the BSI is used among YLH is needed to accurately identify distress among YLH and provide tailored interventions to address their unique challenges.",

    "abstract": "HIV infection has been reported to cause bone loss and a higher risk of fracture. Under normal conditions, bone metabolism is regulated by mesenchymal cells, osteoclasts differentiated from mononuclear macrophages, osteoblasts, and their expression of regulatory factors, such as receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL), M-SCF, and transforming growth factor-beta. The balance between bone resorption and osteogenesis depends on the balance between osteoclasts and osteoblasts. In addition, some immune cells, such as B-cells, T-cells, and other non-immune cells expressing RANKL, can contribute to osteoporosis under inflammatory conditions. HIV proteins consist of three types: regulatory proteins, accessory proteins, and structural proteins, which contribute to HIV-mediated bone loss partly by upregulating NF-κB expression, tumor necrosis factor alpha content, and release of inflammatory cytokines. Even worse, although antiretroviral therapy has reduced HIV infection mortality and successfully transformed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome into a chronic disease, its impact on bone loss should not be overlooked, especially when the drug contains tenofovir. This review analyzes some reports focusing on the overall osteolytic situation due to imbalances in osteogenesis and bone resorption due to HIV infection and antiviral therapy. The intrinsic mechanism of bone loss provides a reference for researchers to analyze the risk factors for HIV patients complicated with bone loss and helps clinicians to provide ideas for the intervention and prevention of bone loss during clinical treatment and chronic disease management of HIV patients.",

    "abstract": "People living with HIV (PLWH) constitute a vulnerable population for acquiring additional sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This study was conducted to provide a summary of the evidence on the global prevalence of STIs in PLWH with an emphasis on infectious agents, diagnostic methods, and related risk factors. PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were systematically searched to include records published from January 01, 1990, to January 31, 2022, and the Google Scholar search engine was used to check the search strategy. In total, 132 eligible studies reporting STIs in PLWH were included, enrolling subjects from 35 countries across five continents. The pooled proportion of STIs was estimated to be 30.23% (95% CI, 26.1-34.45%) in PLWH and 20.01% (95% CI, 17.17-23.01%) in HIV-negative patients. Our meta-analysis indicated that in PLWH, the pooled OR of STIs compared to HIV-negatives was 1.77 (95% CI: 1.58-1.98) (p < 0.0001). The pooled OR of STIs by viral infectious agents was highest in PLWH (52.19% [95% CI: 43.88-60.43]) compared with fungal (22.19% [95% CI: 15.64-29.53]), bacterial (19.07% [95% CI: 13.59-26.63]), and parasitic (14.05% [95% CI: 11.88-16.38]) infections. Our findings show that there is a rather significant frequency of STIs among PLWH. This study highlights the need for new programs for the detection, treatment, and prevention of STIs in this at-risk population.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of the use of marijuana throughout the world is substantial. In light of ongoing increases in accessibility to marijuana, safety and efficacy must be established to guide recommendations for safe use. Of particular interest is at-risk populations such as persons living with HIV (PLWH) in whom there are higher rates of marijuana use and inherent risks of comorbid conditions. Databases and reference lists were searched for relevant studies investigating marijuana or cannabinoid use, HIV, and/or pulmonary diseases. The effect of marijuana on the human body is complex and not yet fully understood. The principal components, tetrahydrocannabinol, and cannabidiol interact with cannabinoid receptors. As some cannabinoid receptors are located in the immune system, many have investigated the effect of marijuana on the immune system. Although marijuana would appear to have anti-inflammatory properties, there are conflicting findings on its immune effect in PLWH. In the lung, marijuana smoke is thought to cause harm. Marijuana smokers have shown increased rates of respiratory symptoms, and a variety of changes on lung function has been reported. Limited data are available specific to the safety of marijuana on the lung, cognition, malignancy risk, and cardiovascular disease in PLWH who are already at increased risk of chronic diseases. Marijuana use is common in PLWH, but significant research gaps exist with regard to its safety and efficacy. Until further evidence on its safety is available, recommendations should be to avoid the use in PLWH.",

    "abstract": "Tremendous progress has been made over the past three decades in the fight against the HIV epidemic; however, children experienced substantial physical and psychosocial effects of HIV infection. To inform services and policy development, we analyzed research growth and current trends in studies on children with HIV/AIDS. A total of 17,598 research papers and reviews in English, which were published on Web of Science, were downloaded. VOSviewer was used to generate an author keyword cooccurrence network and a network illustrating the connection among countries by shared coauthorships. Exploratory factor analysis was employed to identify research domains emerging from the abstracts' contents. The number of papers and their impacts had grown significantly in the past decade. The majority of study settings were in African countries. Research topics related to HIV in children were robust in areas of prevention of mother-to-child transmission and HIV and comorbidities treatments. Although psychosocial and behavioral disorders were recognized in previous studies, the number of interventions in these fields is still limited or not sustained. This study presents the global research trends and interests, points out research gaps of available publications and suggests several implications for services and intervention programs for children infected with HIV/AIDS. While preventions of mother-to-child transmission have been extensively studied, more efforts should be made to fulfill the lack of research on young people who are at risk of being infected or who are already infected with HIV. System thinking approach is needed in the design and implementation of future studies.",

The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has induced a marked reduction in the viral load and an increase in the CD4 cell count, thereby changing the course of the disease from an acute life-threatening condition to chronic disease. Accordingly, need and demand for oral rehabilitation in HIV positive population have increased in recent years. However, few drugs used in the HAART regimen have also known to be associated with osteopenia and osteoporosis. Although HAART reduces the morbidity in HIV patients, it remains unknown to what extent the therapy influences the implant healing. Few scientific literatures have identified osteoporosis and HIV infection as an unconducive milieu for dental implant placement and survival but demonstrated favorable outcomes in short-term assessments.

Recently, long-term control of HIV infection has been demonstrated through the bone marrow transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), in which the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) gene is mutated innately. However, it is very difficult to obtain CCR5 mutant HSC that match human leukocyte antigen between donor and recipient. To solve this problem, this review will summarize and discuss various reports related to the generation of patient-specific CCR5 geneedited HSC. The fusion of current gene editing (zinc-finger nuclease, transcription activator-like effector nuclease, and clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats) and cellular reprogramming technology (somatic cell nuclear transfer, induced pluripotent stem cells technology, and direct phenotypic conversion) enables the generation of patient-specific CCR5 edited HSC.

A panel of 30 physicians with wide experience in the field of antiretroviral therapy and/or resistance testing convened in a full-day session. Available clinical and laboratory data reported in the medical literature, conferences, and panel expert opinion were presented and discussed in an open fashion. The panel agreed to identify situations in which resistance testing should be recommended, others in which it might be considered, and others in which it should not be used. In summary, drug resistance testing should be recommended in HIV-positive pregnant women, in children (infected) born to treated mothers, in primary HIV infection or recent seroconversion, in early virological treatment failures, and before introducing a salvage regimen in heavily pre-treated subjects. Two situations were recognized in which resistance testing might be considered: in chronic naive infected subjects before beginning therapy, and in post-exposure prophylaxis. Lastly, testing should not be recommended when no treatment options exist for a given patient, or when plasma viremia is below the limit of detection. In summary, specific situations have been identified in which drug resistance testing might be of value for choosing antiretroviral therapy either in naive or pre-treated subjects. The advantages of this new tool remain controversial in any other circumstances.",

The viral suppression rate of dual cART was non-inferior to triple cART at 24 weeks (risk difference [RD], -0.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.02-0.01), at 48 weeks (RD, -0.01; 95% CI -0.02-0.01), and at 96 weeks (RD, -0.01; 95% CI -0.02-0.00). Sub-analysis results were consistent with the overall results. With regard to other outcomes (CD4T counts, lipids, any AEs, and AEs grade ≥ 3), there was no significant statistical difference between the two regimens. DTG-based simplified dual cART was non-inferior to triple cART in terms of efficacy and safety. This finding provides strong support for current consensus guidelines recommended the dual regimen as first-line treatment.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of hepatitis C virus in monoinfected and HIV-coinfected patients has greatly changed over recent years as a result of the introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), which have revolutionized clinical outcomes and led to sustained virological response rates above 90-95%. The discovery of new molecules and the subsequent competition between pharmaceutical companies, together with the negotiated price policies pursued by many national health systems, have led to a gradual reduction in the cost of DAAs, and expand their use to an increasing number of patients, including those with mild liver damage. However, the cost of branded DAAs is still too high for many developing countries, and many patients are still left without therapy. In this context, the availability of generic DAAs certainly provides a major opportunity for further cost savings in industrialized countries and will ensure broader access to treatment elsewhere. However, their more widespread use must not lead to a reduction in pharmaceutical quality because this could result in serious clinical consequences, including high rat failures, and selection of drug resistance. It is therefore essential that all generic formulations of DAAs are pre-qualified by the World Health Organization, and that real-life studies are carried out to verify their pharmacokinetic bioequivalence (ideally in patients, and not just in healthy volunteers) and clinical effectiveness. In this regard, lessons from expanding access programs in the HIV field would be very helpful.",

Here, we examine the policy and programmatic gaps in HIVDft surveillance, the affected populations and settings, and implications for clinical practice. The expert authorship of this review convened to identify gaps in HIVDR surveillance, with a particular focus on specific regional variations within and between Europe and Asia, to highlight directions tor research and implementation. Further, evidence was gathered from a review of published studies, guidelines, and current practices. This review found that despite recent progress in the development, harmonization, and implementation of guidelines on H/VDft reporting and surveillance, programmatic, and policy gaps reflect the regional variability in HIV epidemics, clinical practice, and resources. The need for representative surveillance was identified as a key gap that has the potential to inform management policies. Monitoring must keep up with the evolution of transmission routes to adapt appropriately, and this will be further impacted by migration from areas with increasing levelsol resistance. Analysis of the latest clinical data, regional practice, policy, and guidelines has identified a number of gaps in HIVDR population monitoring and surveillance. More efforts are needed to align surveillance platforms with harm reduction and patient education, particularly in vulnerable subgroups. Addressing these gaps will facilitate research into and progress in the management of HIV across a wide range of health-care settings.",

To date, this has only occurred in one person after he received allogeneic stem cell transplants from a CCR5 ∆32 homozygous donor in addition to chemotherapy and radiation to treat his acute myelocytic leukemia. The general consensus is that achieving a sustained remission of infection in the absence of antiretroviral therapy will involve a combination of strategies that involve both the targeting of the latent proviral genome and the induction of more effective anti-HIV-1 immune responses. Efforts to reverse HIV-1 proviral DNA integration in the host cell genome and those to enhance anti-HIV immunity have been disappointing thus far. The lack of clinically validated assays to measure both effects has hampered the development of effective therapies. We suggest the consideration of genome editing as a new approach to reduce the latently integrated proviral genome. In addition, new approaches to therapeutic immunization, alterations of immunoregulatory pathways, anti-HIV-1 antibodies, and anti-HIV-1 chimeric antigen receptor T lymphocytes are in development.",

    "abstract": "Cytotoxic T lymphocytes, or CD8+ T cells, play an important role in the control of replication of HIV. Inducing effective and durable HIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses are, therefore, a major objective in prophylactic and curative strategies for HIV infection. To evaluate such strategies, reliable immunological assays are needed that measure the capacity of CD8+ T cells to exert their effector functions and control viremia. Classical immunological assays such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunospot or intracellular cytokine staining measure the production of one or several effector molecules but do not actually show suppression of viral replication. Perhaps unsurprisingly, these assays do not correlate with either prevention of infection or lower viral set-points after infection. Therefore, more relevant assays are needed which directly measure the viral inhibitory activity (VIA) of CD8+ T cells and are more likely to predict success or failure of different immune interventions. The present review discusses the methodology of the VIA in detail as well as the practical implications of the several variations that have been described. We then go onto discuss existent literature on the relationship between VIA and HIV control, give an overview of examples where VIA has been induced or boosted in vivo or in vitro, and finally discuss observed associations between VIA and other immunological parameters. We conclude that while VIA is complex and laborious, it provides functional information about CD8+ T cells that no other assay can deliver.",

    "abstract": "Although HIV-1 has evolved from a deadly to a chronic disease over the past 20 years, an HIV-1 cure is still lacking due to the presence of persisting cellular viral reservoirs which are spread throughout the body in different anatomical compartments. Hence, the identification and characterization of these HIV-1 reservoirs were the focus of many studies during the past decades. In this review, a systematic literature screening and text mining approach were implemented to assess the evolution in experimental design of these HIV-1 reservoir studies. For this purpose, the online databases PubMed, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov were consulted and 1768 articles were identified, of which 106 are included in this review. We observed several evolutions that indicate a more structured approach of recent HIV-1 reservoir studies. This includes the use of well-characterized patient cohorts, tissue sampling at several time points and anatomical compartments, the inclusion of patients with different treatment status (on and off antiretroviral therapy), and the implementation of state-of-the-art research techniques such as single genome sequencing. In addition, there is an increased interest and sampling of lymphoid tissues and cerebrospinal fluid together with methods to investigate cellular subsets and HIV-1 sequences. Overall, this review describes an observed shift from detecting and quantifying HIV-1 toward a qualitative in-depth assessment of anatomical reservoirs and cellular subsets playing a role in HIV-1 persistence/latency. These trends coincide with the evolution in focus from controlling HIV-1 replication by currently available antiretroviral therapy toward HIV-1 curative strategies.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 infection poses a major threat to the public health worldwide. The antiretroviral agents that are currently used to treat HIV-1 infection target viral reverse transcriptase, integrase and protease, or block the fusion of viral envelop and cell membrane. Studies have shown that the HIV-1 encoded protein Nef plays an important role in the pathogenesis of viral infection. Nef ensures efficient counterattack against host immune responses as well as long-term evasion of immune surveillance. In addition, Nef, expressing at a high level early in the viral life cycle, is required for maintaining a high viral load in the persistent infection in vivo and for full pathologic potential. Therefore, Nef may be an excellent target to treat HIV-1 infection. In this manuscript, we reviewed five potential Nef inhibitors, namely, DLC27-14, t ightly bound hydroxypyrazole HIV-1 Nef inhibitor B9, 2c-like inhibitors, N-(3-aminoquinoxalin-2-yl)-4-chlorobenzenesulfonamide and compound 1[(7-oxo-7H-benzo[anthracene]-3-yl)amino]anthraquinone, and their working mechanisms. These drugs may be further developed into new regimens for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.",

With the national government's response to HIV so severely weakened by the ongoing humanitarian emergency, Venezuelan civil society organizations and international allies have stepped in to fill the void. The three prongs of their agenda have been community-led service delivery, health system monitoring, and advocacy. Our long experience in the HIV field tells us that the Venezuelan HIV community's capacity to respond to the collapse of the health system is not exceptional. HIV civil society organizations and networks of people living with HIV in countries worldwide are well-suited to help maintain health system functionality in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is imperative for the global community to capitalize on their skills.",

The burden of these diseases is particularly significant in Nigeria due to the high TB and HIV/AIDS prevalence. This meta-analysis for the 1st time addressed the TB/HIV coinfection prevalence in Nigeria at the regional level. A total of 58 relevant publications comprising 80 studies (n = 44,508) were obtained from PUBMED, ScienceDirect, African Journals Online, and Cochrane Library databases using carefully constructed keywords combinations. The PRISMA guideline was followed for this meta-analysis. Two independent reviewers conducted the publication screening, data extraction and methodological quality appraisal with a third reviewer serving as arbitrator. The pooled estimates were calculated using the random effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q and I 2 statistic. Univariate and multivariate meta-regressions were done to predict sources of between-study heterogeneity. Overall, the pooled prevalence of TB/HIV coinfection was 25.8%. The highest coinfection prevalence of 34.3% was recorded among the North Central States of Nigeria, while the least prevalence of 19.3% was recorded among the Southeastern states of Nigeria. There was a paucity of published articles from the Northeastern states of Nigeria. There was a significant heterogeneity between studies (I2 > 90%, p < 0.001), but meta-regression analysis only explained < 10% of it. This study has shown that the prevalence of TB/HIV coinfection remains significantly high in Nigeria. Constant surveillance should be rigorously implemented with special attention given to the Northeast due to the ongoing crises that are compounding the problem.",

The \"Health Goals for Me\" framework, an individualized approach to HIV care, provides a framework to assess HrQoL. We analyzed several patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to develop a practical toolkit to facilitate shared physician-patient decision-making. HrQoL subdomains, actionable in the clinical setting and measurable as PROMs, were selected. PROMs were collated through systematic literature searches, scored by the authors on usability, validation, and availability, after which practical recommendations were made. Nine subdomains were selected across physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains; 46 validated PROMs were identified. After pre-screening, from 39 evaluated PROMs, we recommended PROMs in the following subdomains: fatigue/energy loss, frailty/resilience, sleep disturbance, substance use, anxiety/depression, cognition, sexual function and desire, and stigma. Using this toolkit, healthcare professionals and PLHIV can collaborate and mutually agree on individual care objectives. Following the \"Health Goals for Me\" framework, appropriate care interventions can be implemented and reviewed in a continuous cycle. We discussed how eHealth interventions, which will have increasing importance in the post-COVID era, can facilitate improved HrQoL for PLHIV by utilizing toolkits such as the one described here. Implementation of this practical framework and the PROMs toolkit could provide a useful approach to assessing HrQoL in PLHIV and could enhance the physician's ability to gain valuable insights into the patient's daily life across a broad range of HrQoL issues.",

    "abstract": "There has been an increase of fertility desire among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) thanks to the advancement of HIV treatment and prevention of mother-to-children transmission programs. However, the development of research focusing on this topic over the past three decades is not well documented. We aimed to explore the trend of global publications regarding fertility desires among PLWH and identify their contents through the natural language processing technique. Dataset from 1992 to 2019 was downloaded using the Web of Science Core Collection. Bibliometric indicators such as change in total publications, citations, and countries' collaboration were examined. Main topics of selected publications were determined using the latent Dirichlet allocation. There were 303 articles published during the period 1992-2019, with a rapid increase in the number of publications in the past 5 years. Common themes included determinants of fertility desire, HIV prevention for adolescents, and safer conception for couples affected with HIV. However, publications on HIV care and antenatal care for women with HIV had been still limited. Findings suggested a call for the future support and collaborations for fertility intention, as well as the promotion of HIV care and service for adolescents and pregnant women with HIV, especially in countries with poor resources and a high burden of HIV/AIDS.",

    "abstract": "Although the world is currently focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, HIV/AIDS remains a significant threat to public health. To date, the HIV/AIDS pandemic has claimed the lives of over 36 million people, while nearly 38 million people are currently living with the virus. Despite the undeniable success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in controlling HIV, the medications are not curative. Soon after initial infection, HIV integrates into the genome of infected cells as a provirus, primarily, within CD4+ T lymphocytes and tissue macrophages. When not actively transcribed, the provirus is referred to as a latent reservoir because it is hidden to the immune system and ART. Following ART discontinuation, HIV may emerge from the replication-competent proviruses and resumes the infection of healthy cells. Thus, these latent reservoirs are a major obstacle to an HIV cure, and their removal remains a priority. A vital aspect in the development of curative therapies is the demonstration of efficacy in an animal model, such as the humanized mouse model. Therefore, optimization, standardization, and validation of the humanized mouse model are a priority. The purpose of this review article is to provide an update on existing humanized mouse models, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each as they pertain to HIV cure studies and to review the approaches to curative therapies that are under investigation.",

Prevalence, intervention, and meta-analysis studies investigating sarcopenia or muscle mass and function in people living with Human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) were selected. We identified reports of high prevalence and increased risk for sarcopenia due to factors such as prolonged exposure to antiretroviral drugs, lack of physical activity, central obesity, drug use, and other sociodemographic factors, as well as disease duration. HIV should be considered a risk factor for sarcopenia, and evaluation of sarcopenia should be included as part of the comprehensive medical care of PLHIV. Forceful actions are required to prevent muscle weakness, especially in stages before old age with actions aimed at preserving strength and function.",

    "abstract": "Viruses cause a large burden of human infectious diseases. During the past 50 years, antivirals have been developed to treat many pathogenic viruses, including herpesviruses, retroviruses, hepatitis viruses, and influenza. Besides being used as treatment, antivirals have shown efficacy for preventing certain viral infections. Following the success in the HIV field, a renewed interest has emerged on the use of antivirals as prophylaxis for other viruses. The development of formulations with extended half-life has pushed further this consideration in persons at risk for a wide range of viral infections. In this way, long-acting antivirals might behave as \"chemovaccines\" when classical vaccines do not exist, cannot be recommended, immune responses are suboptimal, escape mutants emerge, and/or immunity wanes. Five main caveats would temper its use, namely, selection of drug resistance, drug interactions, short- and long-term side effects, potential teratogenicity in women of child-bearing age, and high cost. Herein, we discuss the prospects for long-acting antivirals as prophylaxis of human viral infections other than HIV.",

    "abstract": "Efavirenz- and protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimens remain viable options across the globe. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness of efavirenz-based regimens relative to PI-based regimens. EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched for randomized controlled trials conducted between 1987 and 2018 comparing efavirenz- with PI-based regimens. This was followed by title, abstract, and full-text screens. The quality of selected studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Meta-analysis of the odds of virological suppression was conducted using the robust variance estimation approach. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria and totaled 6712 patients (efavirenz arm = 3339; PI arm = 3373), of which 1610 (24.0%) were females. Follow-up ranged from 24 to 144 weeks. Mean/median age ranged from 33 to 44 years. Mean/median baseline CD4 count ranged from 32 to 557 cells/mL while mean/median baseline viral load ranged from log10 4.5 to log10 5.5 copies/mL. Meta-analysis showed that patients receiving efavirenz-based regimens had 37% higher odds of virological suppression compared to PI-based regimens (odds ratio = 1.37, 95% confidence interval = 1.06-1.77, p = 0.02). The Egger test suggested the presence of publication bias (B = 0.927, t = 2.214, p = 0.033). The main threat to the quality of evidence was attrition bias. Regarding virological suppression, efavirenzbased regimens were more effective than PI-based regimens and, therefore, might be ideal for the management of treatment naïve patients with HIV in settings where NNRTIs and PIs are used.",

    "abstract": "The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly infectious RNA coronavirus responsible for the pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Recent advances in virology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and clinical management of COVID-19 have contributed to the control and prevention of this disease, but re-positivity of SARS-CoV-2 in recovered COVID-19 patients has brought a new challenge for this worldwide anti-viral battle. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen is widely used in clinical diagnosis, but a positive RT-PCR result may be multifactorial, including false positive, SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragment shedding, reinfection of SARS-CoV-2, or re-activation of COVID-19. Re-infection of SARS-CoV-2 or re-activation of COVID-19 is an indicator of live viral carriers and isolation/treatment is needed, but SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragment shedding is not. SARS-CoV-2 RNA is recently reported to integrate into the host genome, but the far-reaching outcome is currently unclear. Therefore, it is critical for appropriate manipulation and prevention of COVID-19 to distinguish these causal factors of SARS-CoV-2 re-positivity. In this review article, we updated the current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 re-positivity in discharged COVID-19 patients with a focus on re-infection and re-activation. We proposed a hypothetical flowchart for handling of the SARS-CoV-2 re-positive cases.",

This review aimed to holistically examine the concept of adherence in the light of current research evidence and to provide a basic and adaptable conceptual framework for investigating and influencing adherence behavior among various HIV populations. We reviewed published journal articles and gray literature within the period from 2000 to 2017. A comprehensive search from major online databases and repositories such as PubMed, Scopus, Medline, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was conducted using focused search terms that included \"social cognition models\" or \"theories and models of health behavior change\" or \"behavior change in health psychology\" or \"theory-based interventions\" or \"behavioral frameworks\" and \"adherence behavior\" or \"medication adherence,\" and \"HIV patients\" or \"HIV/AIDS.\" Only papers published in English were included in this study. We found varied and extensive literature evidence supporting the use of psychobehavioral models to promote conceptual understanding of adherence behavior among HIV-positive patients globally. We observed that certain approaches at investigating nonadherence worked better among certain populations and epidemics than others, largely because of contextual differences in barriers and burden of non-adherence among these populations. We synthesized the evidence and applied social cognition models in explaining and providing a basic, evidence-based and adaptable conceptual framework for investigating and influencing adherence behavior among HIV-positive populations around the world, regardless of geographical and HIV epidemiological context.",

Quantification of HBsAg is useful in differentiating carriers from active hepatitis in HBeAg negative patients, and current guidelines ecommend monitoring of pegylated interferon alpha treatment in CHB infection. However, there are only few studies about the role of quantitative HBsAg (qHBsAg) monitoring in HIV-HBV coinfected patients. Studies have shown that tenofovir based antiretroviral therapy regimen leads to a very slow decline in HBsAg levels and a predicted time of 10-42 years to lose the HBsAg, in majority of patients. Rapid drop in HBsAg levels and gain in CD4 within the 1st year of treatment and low baseline HBsAg level are associated with faster seroconversion. The reported rate of HBsAg loss in this population is less than 15%. In this review, we discuss tility of qHBsAg in monitoring disease activity and treatment in HIV-HBV coinfected population.",

The present study aims to systematically review the prevalence and risk factors of HIV infection in truck drivers globally. A comprehensive search of the databases of Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science was carried out. The original papers reporting statistics on the prevalence and risk factors of HIV infection among truck drivers were included. In this study, 23 original articles that met the eligibility criteria were reviewed. All articles were cross-sectional studies in which a total number of 16,315 truck drivers were studied to estimate the prevalence and risk factors of HIV infection. Findings indicated high HIV seroprevalence among truck drivers, with the highest prevalence of 56% in South Africa. HIV/AIDS awareness and condom use among truckers were reported low. Having sex with other men, circumcision status, time away from home, marital status, years working as a truck driver, education, income, and drug/alcohol use are the most important risk factors for HIV in truck drivers. Longer time on the road can increase the risk of infection by creating conditions for unsafe sex, in particular, having sex with other men. Low socioeconomic status exacerbates the condition. HIV risk-reduction interventions for long-distance truck drivers are necessary to enhance the awareness of sexually transmitted infections and introduce protective measures such as condoms.",

    "abstract": "Smoking among persons living with HIV infection (PLWH) is estimated to be 2-3 times greater than that in the general population. Data suggest that cigarette smoking is more common among PLWH because of several factors, including lower socioeconomic status, previous, or concurrent illicit drug and alcohol use, younger age, lower education level, and concomitant depressive symptoms. Cigarette smoking among PLWH has been associated with a higher risk of certain cancers and infections as well as lowered response to antiretroviral therapy. Randomized controlled trials on behavioral interventions for tobacco use among smokers with HIV were searched in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases. The retrieval period was from the inception of databases to November 2023. Network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed using the Stata 18.0 software with 19 studies (3190 subjects), of which 15 reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence and seven of which reported continuous abstinence. The NMA results showed that compared with general advice plus self-help brochure, text messaging (relative risk [RR] = 4.60, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-18.81) and cell phone counseling (RR = 3.29, 95% CI, 1.71-6.32) were the most effective for 7-day point prevalence abstinence among smokers with HIV infection. Moreover, the meta-analysis showed that compared with smoking counseling and self-help brochures, continuous abstinence was statistically significantly enhanced after behavioral interventions (RR = 2.52, 95% CI, 1.51-4.20). The study revealed very low-to-high-quality evidence that text messaging, telephone counseling, and smoking cessation websites were effective for smokers with HIV infection.",

    "abstract": "Simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) infecting chimpanzees (SIVcpz) and sooty mangabeys (SIVsm) are, respectively, the biological precursors of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) Types 1 and 2. Former French colonies in West Africa are the regions where retroviruses first jumped from primates to humans. Ivory Coast is nowadays a country of over 29 million people, being 2% (580,000) persons living with HIV (PLWH). However, one-quarter remains undiagnosed. Heterosexual transmission is by far the most frequent mechanism of HIV acquisition and women exhibit higher rates of infection than men. Despite preventive measures, HIV infection in children throughout breastfeeding remains significant. The proportion of PLWH carrying HIV-1 is rising whereas conversely HIV-2 carriers are steadily declining. A nationwide survey conducted on earlier 2024 showed that a total of 188,880 PLWH were on follow-up. HIV-1 infection was found in 163,947, HIV-2 in 5,114, and coinfection in 3,182. HIV type was not reported for 7,500. Antiretroviral therapy with tenofovir, lamivudine, and dolutegravir is by far the most frequently prescribed regimen in Ivory Coast (n = 168,543). Viral suppression is recognized in 94.3% of treated PLWH, despite one-third acknowledging unwanted treatment interruptions after failure of stock supplies. Given shared transmission routes with HIV, coinfection with other human retroviruses such as Human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) and/or hepatitis viruses B, C, and delta are frequent in Ivory Coast. Coinfections remain largely undiagnosed and poorly managed. In summary, the HIV pandemic caused by both HIV-1 and HIV-2 is a major public health challenge in Ivory Coast, where strategies for expanding diagnosis, sustain antiretroviral treatment, and manage coinfections warrant further efforts.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) occurs more frequently in patients with HIV infection than in general population. The predictive value of HIV-related factors and traditional cardiovascular factors with PAH is inconsistent across studies. The objective is to determine the roles of HIV-related risk factors and traditional cardiovascular risk factors in the development of PAH in adults with HIV. We searched Pubmed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify studies published between January 1, 2000 and February 23, 2021 on risk factors associated with PAH among people living with HIV (PLWH). Ten studies were included for final analysis. PLWH with PAH had higher mean age (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 2.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31 ~ 4.24), and lower mean CD4 cell count (WMD = -95.8, 95% CI -153.41 ~ -38.2). Meanwhile, they were more likely to have detectable viral load (odds ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI 1.16 ~ 1.60), to accompany arterial hypertension (OR = 2.02, 95% CI 1.51 ~ 2.71) and less likely to receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) (OR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 ~ 0.99). Besides, more intravenous drug users were observed in HIV-infected adults with PAH (OR = 2.25, 95% CI 1.51 ~ 3.33). HIV infection itself and ART impact PAH in two opposite ways. Traditional cardiovascular factors such as arterial hypertension, and older age are also important to the development of PAH. Screening HIV-related factors and traditional cardiovascular factors may help to target and manage patients at risk.",

    "abstract": "Tobacco smoking undermines the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy (ART) among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and potentially associates with other health problems. This study aimed to analyze the growth and content of research on smoking among PLWHA on Web of Science Database. Co-occurrence analysis and Jaccard's' similarity index calculation were performed to identify and visualize networks of countries collaboration, keywords co-occurrence, and research topics. Exploratory factor analysis was applied to the abstracts' contents to uncover research domains and landscapes. The number of publications increased by 14.55% annually in the period of 1991-2017, with 74% of total papers published within 2007-2017. A wide range of topics have been covered, notably co-morbidities, interventions on smoking abstinence and cessation, and the enforcing relationship of smoking cessation with antiretroviral treatment adherence. A shortage of studies on smoking among PLWHA in low- and middle-income countries, limited collaborations between countries outside of close geographical proximity and a lack of discussion on local contexts and psychosocial factors were found. Smoking among PLWHA has been being studied more extensively in recent years, enhancing our knowledge and awareness of the significant and specific effects smoking have on PLWHA, which, in turn, assisting the proposals and implementations of suitable solutions. However, more efforts should be made to examine and understand contextualized aspects, including culture and beliefs specific to each nation or smaller sub-population within a country, especially those currently under-researched, as well as psycho-behavioral factors to implement more effective interventions to reduce smoking among PLWHA.",

Advanced anal cancer has an aggressive treatment, with a high risk of producing an impaired quality of life. In cases of late diagnosis, mortality remains elevated. Based on these findings, it is a priority to carry out a systematic screening to detect earlier and prevent the disease. In this review and based in our experience at the Infectious Diseases outclinic at Hospital de la Santa Creu and Sant Pau in Barcelona, Spain, we propose a series of actions carried out by trained nurses. We recommend a coordinated set of multidisciplinary activities on HIV + MSM focused on HPV immunization and periodic anal cytology screening. A good implementation of the program will provide significant benefits, since at this time, the best care for anal cancer relies in HPV prevention and early diagnosis of HPV oncogenic lesions.",

    "abstract": "HIV emerged silently taking time to spread and become visible only through geographically isolated clusters of life-threatening immunodeficiency, known as AIDS since the early 80s. The clusters of infection expanded, overlapping to evolve into a pandemic that is ongoing and almost as silent. Phylogenetic analysis places the emergence of HIV-1 group M, the subtype responsible for the pandemic, in the human population more than 100 years ago. Once established, the rate and direction of spread of HIV-1 from local, to national, to contemporary pandemic proportions have varied over time and place. The literature presents many theories on the emergence and drivers of the spread of the virus over the past century. Here, historical evidence and phylogenetic models are reviewed to seek clarity on the emergence, geographic spread and key world events that mark the progression of the HIV-1 pandemic. This narrative review places particular focus on: war (both its direct and indirect affects), trade and economic expansion, changes in sexual behaviors, and public health policy. Investigating the impact of major world events and policy on the emergence and spread of HIV-1 may aid better understanding of what influences the viruses transmission dynamic. By identifying multilateral targets that influence transmission, up-scaled efforts to effectively control, if not remove, HIV-1 from the human population become a possibility. Suggestions for revisions in HIV-1 global public health policy are discussed. Refocused efforts to tackle HIV-1 transmission and replace the need to manage the pathology of this terrible disease are both ethically and economically just.",

    "abstract": "The human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) was first described in 1980. It is spread in highly endemic regions in the world, such as the Southwestern part of Japan, sub-Saharan Africa and South America, Caribbean, Middle East, and Australo-Melanesia regions. HTLV-1 causes adult T cell leukemia and is associated with many inflammatory conditions, most notably HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropic spastic paraparesis. HTLV-2, first isolated in 1982, was recognized as a common infection in intravenous drug users, but a clear association with disease remains elusive. The first estimate of HTLV-1-positive individuals worldwide, in 1993, was around 10-20 millions. Due to the lack of global population-based prevalence studies, this is considered an underestimate at the moment. Furthermore, HTLV-1 prevalence in Europe is impacted by changing migration flows. Particularly, no data on HTLV-1 prevalence in the general population in Italy are available. Here, we report a systematic literature review of studies conducted in Italy on HTLV-1/2 from 1980 to 2023. Based on the criteria we adopted a total of 426 publications were found (64 reviews, 99 epidemiological, and 263 translational studies). The contents of some representative publications are summarized and discussed. Moreover, an approximate estimation of about 26,000 HTLV-1 positive foreigners living in Italy was obtained from updated data of foreigners from each single country officially registered as resident in Italy and from data on HTLV-1 prevalence among the general population in the corresponding countries.",

Would a direct divine intervention be needed for other singular events, such as the origin of life? Taking apart the human being, created to image and resemblance of God, we argue that current scientific knowledge allows us to rationally admit a continuity between the origins of the universe and the emergence of life on Earth. Although the irruption of living beings from inert matter is a leap or discontinuity in creation, a direct intervention of God would not be indispensable. The initial impulse of creation, with matter and energy in a space-time imbalance, could have triggered reactions between the different elements and a self-organization of metabolites, in accordance with natural physical-chemistry laws. This paradoxical increase of complexity ended with a transition from chemistry to biology. It happened when independence, metabolism, heritability, and life cycle took place in a protocellular unit. In this way, the emergence of life on earth could be part of an evolutionary dynamic of the timeless God's creative act.",

We analyzed articles that studied PrEP users with the outcome of acquired syphilis. The eligibility criteria were studies retrieved from the United States National Library of Medicine (Pubmed), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (Lilacs), Embase and Scopus databases, published between 2012 and 2023, in English, Spanish or Portuguese. We performed the descriptive synthesis and quality analysis of selected studies using the Newcastle Ottawa scale or Cochrane scale. We also used random-effects models to generate pooled rate estimates for syphilis before PrEP and during follow-up. A total of 4412 studies were found and 35 were selected, all in English, and almost all with high or satisfactory quality. The review found a PrEP syphilis rate of 6.0%. A summary of three studies estimated a 2.34-fold increased risk of syphilis acquisition during PrEP, with an incidence rate of 8.89 cases/100 person-years. These findings warrant caution due to study heterogeneity. Compared to HIV-positive individuals, PrEP users exhibit potentially higher syphilis rates, particularly among those aged 33-38 years, and factors such as age ≥ 35 years, MSM status, prior sexually-transmitted infections, and longer PrEP duration (every 6 months) are associated. Future research should further investigate these PrEP-related factors contributing to heightened syphilis risk.",

    "abstract": "HIV epidemics still exist as a major global public health burden, especially in middle- and low-income countries. Given the lack of approved vaccines, antiretroviral therapy (ART) remains the primary approach to reduce the mortality and morbidity linked to this disease. Effective treatment for HIV-1 requires the simultaneous administration of multiple drugs. However, the virus can show resistance to antiretroviral drugs, resulting in treatment failure. Therefore, this study focused on assessing the prevalence of mutations within the Indian HIV-positive population. After assessing the data, we intended to identify the most effective highly active ART (HAART) regimens for individuals with drug-resistant variants. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a spectrum of HIV mutations, with varying effects on protein stability. The significance of this analysis lies in its potential to optimize HAART selection for HIV-positive individuals by accounting for both prevalence and stability-altering mutations. By considering mutation effects on protein stability, we can modify treatment regimens, increasing the likelihood of therapy success and diminishing the risk of resistance. Moreover, this study contributes to the broader field of drug repurposing, offering insights into the rational design of antiretroviral therapies.",

    "abstract": "CCR5 is the main coreceptor used by macrophage (M)-tropic strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2), and is therefore essential for transmission of the disease. CXCR4 is the coreceptor for (T)-tropic strains. CCR5 binds a number of CC-chemokines, including MIP-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES, MCP2 and MCP-3, while CXCR4 has only a single ligand, SDF-1. A number of genetic variants of genes encoding coreceptors and their ligands have been described, and some of these variants have been associated with resistance to HIV infection and/or disease progression. We review here the data accumulated so far concerning the variants of the CCR5, CCR2, SDF-1 and RANTES genes. For some of these variants, there is strong experimental evidence linking the modification of gene function with the phenotype of HIV resistance. In other cases, no functional alteration of the encoded proteins has been found, and the link between genotype and associated phenotype has not been demonstrated so far. The best characterized mutant is the ∆32 deletion mutant of the CCR5 gene, resulting in a non-functional protein that is not transported to the cell surface. Homozygotes for the ∆32 allele exhibit a strong, although incomplete, resistance to HIV infection. Heterozygotes were shown to display retarded progression to AIDS in most studies. Many other mutations of CCR5 have been described, some of which lead to non-functional receptors. These variants are, however, relatively rare and are incompletely characterized so far. Sequence variants in the CCR5 gene promoter have been reported, but the link with CCR5 expression is not clearly established, and the influence of these variant alleles on HIV infection and AIDS progression will require confirmation. A variant allele of CCR2 (CCR2-64I) was associated to delayed AIDS progression. This association was confirmed in several (but not all) studies, but the link between a fully functional variant of a minor coreceptor and the observed phenotype is presently unclear. A variant of the SDF-1 gene affecting a single nucleotide in the 3’ non-coding region of the transcript was associated with delayed progression in homozygotes. This association was, however, not found in several other studies, and no modification of gene function could be demonstrated so far. A recently reported variant of the RANTES gene promoter, providing retarded progression, will also require confirmation in independent studies. As a rule, care must be taken before taking an apparent association between a genotype and a phenotype for granted, until functional data supporting a causality link between the variables is clearly established.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 is a retrovirus capable of establishing viral reservoirs that remain stable for extended periods under suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). Immune dysfunction and latency are well known to contribute to this longevity, but the respective roles of viral replication and latently infected (LI) cell proliferation under suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) have long been controversial. This historical review critically appraises the body of evidence regarding possible viral replication and proliferation of infected cells under ART. An ever-growing body of genetic and phylogenetic studies has demonstrated that HIV-infected cells are able to proliferate and contribute to the longevity of the reservoir in ART-treated patients. The role of ongoing replication remains controversial: it has been well established that HIV does not undergo evolution during ART or develop drug resistance, but some genetic, phylogenetic, and in vivo imaging studies have suggested that there may be ongoing replication despite this. The respective roles of viral replication and cellular proliferation in maintaining the LI reservoir remains an area of controversy. Elucidating these processes may allow us design interventions to reduce the size of the LI reservoir, increasing the length of treatment interruptions during which the virus will remain adequately suppressed, bringing us closer to a functional cure. Novel experimental techniques such as immuno-PET and digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) are increasingly being employed, and these, along with rapid particle sorting techniques currently in develop-ment, will be necessary to fully answer this question.",

    "abstract": "Many innovations, such as long-acting agents, new delivery modalities (injectable and nanoparticles), and novel paradigms (immunotherapy or dual therapy), have been introduced to facilitate the administration of antiretroviral treatment (ART) to patients infected with HIV and improve their adherence and quality of life without altering the drugs' effectiveness. Studies have investigated the use of intermittent treatment, especially weekends-off ART in HIV-suppressed patients. In this review, we analyzed data concerning intermittent ART to help determine if this strategy is reasonable for the management of patients living with HIV. The results of early studies, in 2007-2015, were encouraging, but the studies were flawed because of the small number of patients included, the absence of a control arm, and random designs with variable patterns of ART administration. From 2016, studies have included more patients, and some are prospective, randomized controlled studies. While non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors have been most studied, treatment with integrase inhibitors also has been reported, with the findings that viral resistance did not appear when treatment failed with dolutegravir but not with raltegravir. The most recent study, QUATUOR, found that a 4-day on, 3-day off pattern was non-inferior to the continuous pattern (7 days on). Better-quality studies with long-term follow-up (96 weeks or more) are needed to determine the validity of intermittent treatment and the optimal regimens and monitoring to be used in the management of viro-logically suppressed patients living with HIV.",

    "abstract": "Dual therapy refers to combinations of two antiretroviral drugs applied in different clinical settings; they are considered and studied due to possibly reduced drug toxicities. In antiretroviral-naive patients, dual combinations have lower virologic efficacy than standard therapy; the sole efficacious regimen is lamivudine plus lopinavir/ ritonavir. Due to a higher possibility of virologic failure, these regimens are generally not allowed in this clinical setting. In antiretroviral-experienced patients, dual regimens are examined in studies with a small sample size, centered on clinical practice, and should be ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor-based. These combinations have a good virological efficacy; combinations with the integrase inhibitor raltegravir have small sample size and demonstrated efficacy only with etravirine. Virological aspects involving dual therapy should always consider genetic barriers, particularly in simplification strategies, and ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors are mandatory. As far as immunological aspects are concerned, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitorsparing regimens have some encouraging data, probably due to the bone marrow toxicity of this class. Combinations with maraviroc were effective in reducing inflammation, but data about immunological recovery are conflicting. The choice of regimen should focus on specific class toxicity since dual regimens are studied in particular for improving safety and tolerability. This review will analyze different dual regimens in the clinical setting, with a peculiar focus on ameliorating toxicities and improving quality of life. (AIDS Rev.",

PLWH are highly vulnerable to nutritional problems resulting from agingrelated deterioration, disease itself, and adverse effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The comprehensive nutritional assessments are necessary to perform routinely in this population to monitor and provide appropriate interventions to reduce comorbid conditions. In this review, we focus on the untoward impacts of malnutrition and nutritional assessments on the morbidity and mortality in the older PLWH. Some predictive factors of nutritional status in this group of patients are discussed. We propose the important components for nutrition assessment tool for older PLWH on ART. Highlighted issue is the need for developing uniform standardized tools for the early diagnosis of malnutrition in this population. Applications of the nutritional assessments, proper nutritional interventions, and regular monitoring of nutritional status in older PLWH liv-ing in every clinical setting may help the patients get better well-being.",

    "abstract": "There is no correlation between HIV per se and other risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease. Pivotal studies have shown that vaccination is one of the effective ways to prevent severe COVID-19 illness in the general population. Studies on people living with HIV (PLWH) are scarce. The majority of these studies with mRNA (BNT126b2 and mRNA-1273) and adenovirus vector (Ad26.COV2.2 and ChAdOx1) vaccines with a low number of patients included shows that PLWH on antiretroviral treatment and with CD4 count > 200/mm³ has a robust immune response. These vaccines are thus effective in preventing severe infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in PLWH. However, PLWH with a CD4 count of < 200/mm³ and uncontrolled viral load (VL) seems to have a lower immune response. COVID-19 vaccines are safe in PLWH; adverse effects are mild or moderate, and their incidence is similar to non-HIV people (NHP). The CD4 count decreased significantly and transiently, and the VL rebounded insignificantly in a few patients. A complete vaccination including a third dose is, therefore, recommended. A booster dose with an mRNA vaccine is recommended in PLWH with an advanced stage of their disease.",

    "abstract": "Integrase strand-transfer inhibitors (INSTI) are the latest class of antiretrovirals registered in Mexico. They include raltegravir (RAL), elvitegravir/cobicistat (EVG/c), dolutegravir (DTG) and bictegravir (BIC). Along with international guidelines, Mexico adopted the use of INSTI about two years ago as initial antiretroviral therapy (ART). This is partially due to the increase in the pre-treatment resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), mainly efavirenz (EFV). Furthermore, INSTI depict greater efficacy, safety and less drug-drug interactions than NNRTI and protease inhibitors (PI). DTG is a second generation INSTI with a high barrier to resistance. It is recommended in international and national guidelines in a wide variety of clinical scenarios for persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PLWHIV), including treatment-naïve, first-line NNRTI treatment failure, simplification switch in suppressed patients, pregnancy, women with childbearing potential, adolescents and children over 6 years of age. DTG is mostly metabolized by the liver UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, and exhibits low drug-drug interactions overall; on the other hand, it has an extremely low renal elimination, therefore may be used in PLWHIV with advanced kidney disease without dose modification. Tuberculosis is a common coinfection in Mexico that requires rifampin-based anti-tuberculosis therapy, which requires increasing DTG to double dosing (50 mg BID). In Mexico, DTG-based regimens are likely to be cost-effective in many scenarios, given its acquisition costs and the particularities of the HIV population and associated clinical conditions, including a relatively high proportion of the following: i) new HIV diagnoses presenting at acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) stage; ii) high rate of tuberculosis coinfection; iii) frequent first-line NNRTI treatment failures; and iv) relatively high proportion of infected children and adolescents.",

    "abstract": "The safety of using different antiretroviral therapies (ART) in pediatric HIV/AIDS patients is not well-established. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the safety of ART in children. A systematic review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) was conducted to assess the safety of ART used by pediatric patients living with HIV/AIDS. The electronic search was conducted in PubMed and Scopus, in addition to a manual search. Studies were included if they assessed the safety of ART compared to placebo or another ART. Direct and indirect meta-analyses were conducted regarding safety outcomes. The systematic review included 21 RCTs. The studies included more than 5500 participants, and age ranged from 3 months to 18 years. The drugs evaluated were nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI); non-NRTI; and protease inhibitors. The predominant route of infection was vertical. Direct meta-analyses were performed for the outcomes sleep disorders, hepatobiliary disorders, respiratory disorders, hypertransaminasemia, neutropenia, hospitalization, and death. For these outcomes, no statistically significant differences were found. Indirect meta-analyses were performed for the outcomes anemia, gastrointestinal disorders, liver disorders, severe adverse events (AE), AE that led to changes in treatment, fever, and skin manifestations. However, no statistically significant differences were found for these outcomes. In this study, non-significant differences were detected in the safety of different ART used in pediatric individuals. The choice of appropriate therapy should be based on its efficacy and the individual characteristics of each patient.",
