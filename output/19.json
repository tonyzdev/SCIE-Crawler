    "abstract": "The measurement of trace-element concentration in soil, sediment and waste, is generally a combination of a digestion procedure for dissolution of elements and a subsequent measurement of the dissolved elements. “Partial” and “total” digestion methods can be used in environmental monitoring activities. To compare measurement results obtained by different methods, it is crucial to determine and to maintain control of the bias of the results obtained by these methods. In this paper, ICP-MS results obtained after matrix digestion with modified aqua regia (HCl+HNO3+H2O2) method and two “total” digestion methods (microwave aqua regia+HF and HNO3+HF) are compared with those obtained by instrumental neutron activation analysis, a non-destructive analytical method for the determination of the total mass concentrations of inorganic components in environmental matrices. The comparison was carried out on eight agricultural soil samples collected in one test area and measured by k0-INAA and ICP-MS to determine As, Co, Cr, Sb and Zn mass concentration. The bias of results for As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Sb and Zn of the three digestion methods were assessed using selected measurement standards. This paper highlights that the digestion procedure is an integral part of the measurement and can affect the measurement result in environmental analysis.",

Previously, these requirements were addressed in ISO Guide 34:2009, originally developed by the ISO Committee on Reference Materials (ISO/REMCO). The need for an International Standard was triggered as several accreditation bodies could not accredit to a guide, at all, while in other countries ISO Guide 34 could only serve as accreditation standard in combination with ISO/IEC 17025. For the transformation into a conformity assessment standard of the ISO/IEC 17000 series, the ISO Committee on Conformity assessment (ISO/CASCO) and ISO/REMCO joined forces. A Joint Working Group, formed by experts and stakeholders from both committees, finalised the transformation within 2 years. During the transformation, the structure of ISO 17034 has been aligned with other ISO/IEC 17000 series standards and the content of ISO 17034 has been harmonised with the recent editions of other relevant ISO Guides. Requirements for the production of reference materials (RMs) were elaborated on more clearly in the new standard, specifying the requirements for (non-certified) reference materials and the additional requirements for certified reference materials. The new International Standard ISO 17034:2016 supersedes ISO Guide 34:2009.",

It is shown that with 1 H-qNMR it is possible to certify the purity of organic reference materials (expressed as mass fraction) with relative expanded uncertainties of &lt;0.1 % for a 95 % confidence interval ( k = 2). Following well-defined selection criteria, a set of twelve different chemical compounds is evaluated and certified to serve as internal references for 1 H-qNMR measurements. A series of comparison measurements is made amongst a subset of the selected compounds. The purity of maleic acid is determined by six different 1 H-qNMR measurement series, and all results show full consistency. All the six mean values are covered within the range of ±0.05 %. In two more measurement series, four different nuclei are analysed within the same sample against one calibrator. Even with non-optimised signal intensity ratios and varying signal pattern, a high consistency was obtained. Therefore, the validity and robustness of 1 H-qNMR measurement results are demonstrated. 1 H-qNMR measurement results are directly traceable to a variety of internationally accepted primary reference materials, and therefore, traceability to SI units is obtained. All experiments are performed under ISO/IEC 17025 and ISO Guide 34 accreditation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nowadays, Quality Management tools such as failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) are widely used throughout the aeronautical, automotive, software, food services, health care and many other industries to sustain and improve quality and safety. The increasing complexity of scientific research makes it more difficult to maintain all activities under control, in order to guarantee validity and reproducibility of results. Even in non-regulated research, scientists need to be supported with management tools that maximize study performance and outcomes, while facilitating the research process. Frequently, steps that involve human intervention are the weak links in the process. Risk analysis therefore gives considerable benefit to analytical validation, assessing and avoiding failures due to human error, potential imprecision in applying protocols, uncertainty in equipment function and imperfect control of materials. This paper describes in detail how FMEA methodology can be applied as a performance improvement tool in the field of non-regulated research, specifically on a basic Life Sciences research process. We chose as “pilot process” the selection of oligonucleotide aptamers for therapeutic purposes, as an example of a complex and multi-step process, suitable for technology transfer. We applied FMEA methodology, seeking every opportunity for error and its impact on process output, and then, a set of improvement actions was generated covering most aspects of laboratory practice, such as equipment management and staff training. We also propose a useful tool supporting the risk assessment of research processes and its outputs and that we named “FMEA strip worksheet.” These tools can help scientists working in non-regulated research to approach Quality Management and to perform risk evaluation of key scientific procedures and processes with the final aim to increase and better control efficiency and efficacy of their research.",

    "abstract": "The approach presented in this article refers to the modification of a method for the detection and quantitative determination of chromium species in water by high-performance liquid chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The main aim of this work was to establish a detailed validation of the analytical procedure and an estimation of the budget of measurement uncertainty which was helpful in recognizing the critical points of the presented method. As a result of the method validation experiment, the obtained limit of quantification, repeatability and intermediate precision were satisfied for the quantification Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in water matrices. The trueness of the method was verified via an estimation of the recovery of the spiked real samples. The recovery rate of both determined analytes was found to be between 93 and 115 %. Considering that the validation of the method and the evaluation of measurement uncertainty are crucial for quantitative analysis, the above-mentioned assessment of the uncertainty budget was performed in two different ways: a modelling approach and a single-laboratory validation approach. The measurement uncertainties of the results were found to be 4.4 and 7.8 % for Cr(III), 4.2 and 7.9 % for Cr(VI) using the classical concept and method validation data, respectively. This paper is the first publication to presenting all the steps needed to evaluate the measurement uncertainty for the speciation analysis of chromium species. In summary, the obtained results demonstrate that the method can be applied effectively for its intended use.",

    "abstract": "Sampling is an integral part of nearly all chemical measurement and often makes a substantial or even a dominant contribution to the uncertainty of the measurement result. In contrast with analysis, however, the uncertainty contribution from sampling has usually been ignored. Indeed, far less is known about sampling uncertainty, although in some application sectors it is known to exceed the analytical uncertainty, especially when raw materials (natural or industrial) are under test. In 1995 the authors of this paper proposed a framework of concepts and procedures for studying, quantifying, and controlling the uncertainty arising from the sampling that normally precedes analysis. Many of the ideas were based on analogy with well-established procedures and considerations relating to quality of analytical measurement, ideas such as validation of the sampling protocol, sampling quality control and fitness for purpose. Since that time many of these ideas have been explored experimentally and found to be effective. This paper is a summary of progress to date.",

    "abstract": "A method for simultaneous ICP-MS determination of 13 elements in three types of honey from Poland is described. The method was validated, and the uncertainty budget was set up. The results obtained for the relative expanded uncertainties U rel (k = 2) were 15.1% for Al, 18.6% for B, 18.8% for Ba, 7.9% for Ca, 24.4% for Cd, 7.24% for Cu, 7.9% for K, 4.8% for Mg, 8.3% for Mn, 12.7% for Na, 14.9% for Ni, 12.5% for Pb and 13.4% for Zn. Traceability of the measurement results was established based on the use of the corn flour CRM INCT-CF-3 and the apple leaves CRM SRM 1515 and by analyzing spiked samples. Recovery rates between 94% (Zn) and 107% (Na) were found. The detection limits of all elements studied showed the suitability of the procedure for routine analyses. Summarizing it can be concluded that the described analytical procedures to measure the mass fractions of 13 elements in honey samples with established traceability and evaluated uncertainty allow to obtain reliable and internationally comparable results.",

Herein, the interlaboratory comparison as final validation step involving 12 expert laboratories from Germany and Switzerland is described. Two groundwaters, two surface waters, a drinking water, a rainwater, and two fortified groundwater samples displayed relative repeatability standard deviations between 3 and 7% and relative reproducibility standard deviation between 6 and 20% and were included in the draft standard DIN 38407-53.",

    "abstract": "Tests and/or test items can sometimes be expensive, unique, or only performed in a few laboratories. There can be cases where assigned values are unknown, there is no information, or only poor information on the probability density function attributed to the test result. Sometimes there are neither reference materials nor the ability to establish consensus values due to a lack of experts. It can be impossible to repeat a test on the same item because it is destroyed during the test itself, or the homogeneity of tested items is unknown and no criteria can be established. Specified technical requirements concerning proficiency testing and interlaboratory comparison schemes are generally not applicable in this situation. However, interlaboratory comparison could allow laboratories to have more confidence in their results. The present paper discusses three statistical methods of assessing interlaboratory comparison results obtained in such conditions. Two methods are based on an assigned value determined from participant results through robust analysis. The third is based on the compatibility of results assessed using the ζ parameter. This paper focuses on an interlaboratory comparison for two laboratories, each testing three samples. The use of statistical methods turns out to be high risk, particularly in terms of falsely accepting results. Additionally, is shown that methods dedicated to small samples are also not efficient in detecting discrepancies of test results.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Over the years, risk management gains significant importance in laboratories of every kind. The safety of workers, the accuracy and reliability of laboratory results, issues of financial sustainability as well as the protection of the environment play an important role in decision-making in both industry and services. In order a laboratory to be considered as reliable, safe, and therefore competitive, it is recommended to comply with the requirements of international standards and other regulatory documents as well as to use tools and risk management procedures. In this paper, information is summarized concerning the terms “risk” and “risk management” which are then approached through the latest ISO 9001, ISO/IEC 17025, and ISO 14001 standards. The process of risk management based on the ISO 31000 standard is described, the options for treatment and the techniques that can be applied in the risk management process based on the latest ISO 31010 standard are grouped and indicated. Additionally, information from the literature is referred to the reasons that led the laboratories to integrate in their quality system risk management techniques, the most common mistakes that occur in the various phases of laboratory tests, their causes, their consequences as well as the proposed treatments. The aim of this work is to highlight significant challenges concerning the need to implement management procedures in the daily routine, to warn, raise awareness and inform about existing ways of risk management that can be implemented, methodologically and technically, to laboratories, under internationally recognized and updated standards.",

    "abstract": "Different approaches to the philosophy and description of measurement have evolved over time, and they are still evolving. There is not always a clear demarcation between approaches, but rather a blending of concepts and terminologies from one approach to another. This sometimes causes confusion when trying to ascertain the objective of measurement in the different approaches, since the same term may be used to describe different concepts in the different approaches. Important examples include the terms \"value,\" \"true value,\" \"error,\" \"probability\" and \"uncertainty.\" Constructing a single vocabulary of metrology that is able to unambiguously encompass and harmonize all of the approaches is therefore difficult, if not impossible. This paper examines the evolution of common philosophies and ways of describing measurement. Some of the differences between these approaches are highlighted, which provides a rationale for the entries and structure of the August 2006 draft of the 3rd Edition of the International Vocabulary of Metrology – Basic and General Concepts and Associated Terms (VIM3) [1].",

Nevertheless, standards such as ISO/IEC 17025, ISO 15189 and ISO 17034 that specify requirements for laboratories to enable them to demonstrate they operate competently, and are able to generate valid results, require that measurement uncertainty is evaluated and reported. In response to this need, a European project entitled “Advancing measurement uncertainty—comprehensive examples for key international standards” started in July 2018 that aims at developing examples that contribute to a better understanding of what is required and aid in implementing such evaluations in calibration, testing and research. The principle applied in the project is “learning by example”. Past experience with guidance documents such as EA 4/02 and the Eurachem/CITAC guide on measurement uncertainty has shown that for practitioners it is often easier to rework and adapt an existing example than to try to develop something from scratch. This introductory paper describes how the Monte Carlo method of GUM (Guide to the expression of Uncertainty in Measurement) Supplement 1 can be implemented in R, an environment for mathematical and statistical computing. An implementation of the law of propagation of uncertainty is also presented in the same environment, taking advantage of the possibility of evaluating the partial derivatives numerically, so that these do not need to be derived by analytic differentiation. The implementations are shown for the computation of the molar mass of phenol from standard atomic masses and the well-known mass calibration example from EA 4/02.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement (GUM) has been the enduring guide on measurement uncertainty for metrologists since its first publication in 1993. According to the GUM, a measurement should always be accompanied by a reasoned and defensible expression of uncertainty, and the primary such expression is the standard uncertainty. In this article, we distinguish between the use of an expression of uncertainty as information for the recipient of a measurement result and its use when propagating uncertainty about inputs to a measurement model in order to derive the uncertainty in a measurand. We propose a new measure of uncertainty, the characteristic uncertainty , and argue that it is more fit for these purposes than standard uncertainty. For the purpose of reporting a measurement result, we demonstrate that standard uncertainty does not have a meaningful interpretation for the recipient of a measurement result and can be infinite. These deficiencies are resolved by the characteristic uncertainty, which we therefore recommend for use in reporting. For similar reasons, we advocate the use of the median estimate as the measured value. For the purpose of propagating uncertainty in a measurement model, we propose simple propagation of the median and characteristic uncertainty and show through some examples that this characteristic uncertainty framework is simpler and at least as reliable and accurate as the propagation of estimate, standard uncertainty and effective degrees of freedom according to the GUM uncertainty framework.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Uncertainties arising at different stages of a measurement process can be estimated using analysis of variance (ANOVA) on duplicated measurements. In some cases, it is also desirable to calculate confidence intervals for these uncertainties. This can be achieved using probability models that assume the measurement data are normally distributed. However, it is often the case in practice that a set of otherwise normally distributed measurement values is contaminated by a small number of outlying values, which may have a disproportionate effect on the variances calculated using the ‘classical’ form of ANOVA. In this case, robust ANOVA methods are able to provide variance estimates that are much closer to the parameters of the underlying normal distributions. A method using bootstrapping to calculate confidence intervals from robust estimates of variances is proposed and evaluated and is shown to work well when the number of outlying values is small. The method has been implemented in a visual basic program.",

The GUM is known for its detailed discussions on the concepts of true value and error and their relation to measurement uncertainty. However, the GUM statements on true value and error have been a source of conceptual controversies, sometimes leading to inconsistent or unclear descriptions on true value, error, and uncertainty. Here, we discuss that such controversies arise from an unclear distinction between two views of measurement with fundamentally different premises. In one of the views, called the realist view, measurement is regarded as an activity of estimating or determining the true value, in which case measurement uncertainty represents the dispersion of reasonable estimates of true values. In the other view, called the instrumentalist view, measurement is regarded as an activity of assigning values to a measurand, in which case measurement uncertainty represents the dispersion of values that could reasonably be assigned to a measurand. By examining the philosophy of measurement in each view, we show that a clear understanding of the two views is critical for understanding the GUM.",

When automated equipment is not set up or operated properly, large quantities of non-conformances are generated, which must be considered in the overall quality performance. Consequently, achieving the best results with automated equipment requires extensive use of mistake-proofing. Furthermore, unless we understand what to automate and the best method of automation, significant resources will be wasted, with disappointing results. Jidoka (the Japanese word for Automation with a Human Touch) provides key insights into the best attributes of automation.",

    "abstract": "A definition of biological activity is proposed that is superficially analogous to the equation relating the thermodynamic activity of a solute to its concentration via an activity coefficient. The biological activity of a molecular entity is defined as A=cf, where A is the activity, c the amount-of-substance concentration, and f is a parameter designated as \"inherent activity.\" Units and dimensions are determined by the type of activity, catalytic (katal) or binding (mol−1 L). The measurand is described by a chemical equation that identifies the entity for which an activity is being monitored. This definition of biological activity has the advantage of separating the chemical characterization of the entity in terms of structure and amount from the assessment of biological activity. Ideally, a homogeneous entity is used for the measurement of f. In instances where impure materials are used or the chemical equation defining the activity is unknown, the evaluated parameter should be designated as f′ to denote its empirical nature. Any measurement of f or f′ should be qualified with an appropriate estimate of measurement uncertainty.",

The discussion also considers the effect of a limited population of PT participants N p on statistical assessment of the PT results for a given sample of N responses from this population. When N p is finite and the sample fraction N/N p is not negligible, a correction to the statistical parameters may be necessary.

    "abstract": "Many, possibly most, analytical measurements are carried out to assess compliance with a specification or a regulation, for example in the control contaminants in food or the detection of performance enhancing substances in sport. When making an assessment of compliance the presence of unavoidable measurement uncertainty introduces the risk of making incorrect decisions, that is of accepting a batch of material which is outside the specification or rejecting one that is within. This often leads to controversy over whether or not the compliance decision is correct. How to make reliable assessment decisions is described in the EURACHEM/CITAC Guide \"Use of uncertainty information in compliance assessment\". The key is the use of decision rules that lead to an unambiguous interpretation of the measurement result and its uncertainty. These decision rules need to be designed to ensure that requirements of the specification or regulation are met and that the risk of making an incorrect decision is acceptable. Ideally they should form part of the specification or regulation.",

    "abstract": "Advances in DNA sequencing technology provide the possibility to analyse and characterize the genetic material from microbial populations (the microbiome) as a whole. Such comprehensive analysis of a microbiome using these 'metagenomic' approaches offers the potential to understand industrial, clinical and environmental microbiology to a level of detail that is unfeasible using conventional molecular or culture-based methods. However, the complexity offered by metagenomic analysis is also the weakness of this method and poses considerable challenges during analytical standardisation. In this manuscript, we discuss options for developing control materials for metagenomic analysis and describe our preliminary work investigating how such materials can be used to assist metagenomic measurements. The control materials we have developed demonstrate that, when performing 16S rDNA sequencing, different library preparation methods (incorporating adapters before and after the PCR) and small primer mismatches can alter the reported metagenomic profile. These findings illustrate that metagenomic analysis can be heavily biased by the choice of method and underpin the need for control materials that can provide a useful tool in informing choice of protocol for accurate analysis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) provides a framework for evaluating analytical data and characterizing their dispersion in a consistent manner. This is of eminent importance in the case of reference materials and their recommended values that are used for calibration of further measurements. The proper propagation of uncertainties for those data is essential. Guidance is provided in the GUM on how to calculate the combined standard uncertainty for a mean value or central value based on multiple individual measurements including their calibration uncertainty. However, according to published data, the guidance provided by GUM is not always properly applied in practice. Several published studies show calculated uncertainties much lower than those of input quantities. This may be caused by improper handling of the propagation of uncertainty components, thereby breaking the traceability chain for reported values. A simple check method using conventional statistical means is proposed to detect and to avoid such mistakes related to calibration uncertainties. It is intended to help to ensure a proper uncertainty propagation, to maintain a system of reliable and traceable reference materials. A spreadsheet is provided for the implementation of such a check. Example calculations for published data are presented.",

    "abstract": "The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the backbone of contemporary DNA/RNA analysis, ideally enabling detection of one or just a few target molecules. However, when analysing food or forensic samples the analytical procedure is often challenged by low amounts of poor quality template molecules and complex matrices. Applying optimised and validated methods in all steps of the analysis workflow, i.e. sampling, sample treatment, DNA/RNA extraction and PCR (including reverse transcription for RNA analysis), is thus necessary to ensure the reliability of analysis. In this paper, we describe how in-house validation can be performed for the different modules of the diagnostic PCR process, providing practical examples as tools for laboratories in their planning of validation studies. The focus is analysis of heterogeneous samples with interfering matrices, with relevance in food testing, forensic DNA analysis, bioterrorism preparedness and veterinary medicine. Our objective is to enable rational in-house validation for reliable and swift quality assurance when results are urgent, for example in the event of a crisis such as a foodborne outbreak or a crime requiring the analysis of a large number of diverse samples. To that end, we explain the performance characteristics associated with method validation from a PCR and biological sample matrix perspective and suggest which characteristics to investigate depending on the type of method to be validated. Also, we include a modular approach to validation within the PCR workflow, aiming at efficient validation and a flexible use of methods.",

    "abstract": "Internal markets as well as the globalization of trade, industry and society require comparability of calibration, measurement and test results through traceability to the International System of Units (SI), which represents the coherent and long-term stable fixed anchor points in measurement. Internal markets, trade and accreditation agreements also require that non-tariff barriers to trade are removed. The removal of Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) and implementation of Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary (SPS) measures should lead to a situation where ‘once measured or tested, everywhere accepted’. To achieve this situation, a credible, transparent metrology agreement needs to be implemented under the Inter-Governmental Treaty of the Metre Convention. The need for a reliable world metrology system is driven not only by trade requirements but equally by societal requirements. Improvement of the quality of life is highly served by reliable, traceable and more accurate measurements, particularly in areas such as health care, food safety and nutritional content, environmental and pollution control and climate change, forensics and security. In addition, credible ‘soft/perceptive’ measurements, such as smell, taste, colour, glance, form, among others, will contribute to the quality of life. Sustainable competitiveness and innovation require accurate, traceable measurement results, not only in the ‘classical’ field of physical measurements, but also in the fields of chemical analysis, advanced materials and material properties and in new fields like nano-metrology and biotechnology. These new areas of metrology also require the development of new measurement technologies. The wide application of information technology, in the form of fully automated, remote-controlled and monitored measurement systems, also requires new innovative approaches. In as much that accurate, comparable measurements are essential for a fair and safe society, it is evident that the authorities have formulated and are increasingly formulating regulations that contain requirements with respect to traceability and measurement uncertainty. The economic interest in good measurements is well demonstrated by the fact that global trade in commodities amounts to more than 12 trillion USD, of which 80% is affected by standards and regulation. The compliance costs are estimated to be about 10% of the production costs. The global markets of clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine and pharmaceuticals have a value of some 300 billion USD per year. Annual savings as a consequence of comparable, more accurate measurement results with a smaller measurement uncertainty will easily amount up to many billions of U.S. dollars.

    "abstract": "Abstract It is now widely accepted that the measurement process usually begins when the primary sample is taken. The uncertainty of measurement (MU) must therefore include contributions that arise from the primary sampling, and also from any physical preparation of the sample which often occurs before the sample reaches the laboratory. Guidance on how to estimate MU that includes that arising from sampling (UfS) has been widely applied to a wide range of application sectors (e.g. food, feed, water, sediment, soil, gases). Recent revision of ISO/IEC 17025:2017 ( https://www.iso.org/standard/66912.html ) has also recognised the inclusion of sampling within the measurement process. This recognition has implications for the validation of measurement procedures that include sampling (VaMPIS). The scope of method (or procedure) validation has therefore to be expanded and reassessed, in order to include all of these components. The uncertainty of the measurement value (MU) is a key parameter that encompasses the effects of all the other operating characteristics of the analytical procedure that is traditionally considered during its validation. It has the further advantage that it can also incorporate the uncertainty due to sampling and physical sample preparation, thus providing a single value of uncertainty that derives from the entire measurement procedure. The fitness for purpose (FnFP) of the whole measurement procedure, which is required for validation, can be judged by comparing the estimated MU (including UfS), against a Target MU, however that is set. A case study for the determination of nitrate in glasshouse lettuce shows how this VaMPIS approach can be applied to a whole measurement procedure. The experimental MU is estimated using the Duplicate Method and compared against a Target MU set using the Optimised Uncertainty (OU) method. The measurement procedure published in EU guidance is shown not to be fit for purpose (FFP). However, this approach identifies how that sampling procedure can be modified to achieve FnFP for the whole procedure, by increasing the number of sample increments per batch from 10 to 40.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Measurement uncertainty (MU) arising at different stages of a measurement process can be estimated using analysis of variance (ANOVA) on replicated measurements. It is common practice to derive an expanded MU by multiplying the resulting standard deviation by a coverage factor k. This coverage factor then defines an interval around a measurement value within which the value of the measurand, or true value, is asserted to lie for a desired confidence level (e.g. 95 %). A value of k = 2 is often used to obtain approximate 95 % coverage, although k = 2 will be an underestimate when the standard deviation is estimated from a limited amount of data. An alternative is to use Student’s t- distribution to provide a value for k , but this requires an exact or approximate degrees of freedom (df). This paper explores two different methods of deriving an appropriate k in the case when two variances from an ANOVA (classical or robust) need to be combined to estimate the measurement variance. Simulations show that both methods using the modified coverage factor generally produce a confidence interval much closer to the desired level (e.g. 95 %) when the data are approximately normally distributed. When these confidence intervals do deviate from 95 %, they are consistently conservative (i.e. reported coverage is higher than the nominal 95 %). When outlying values are included at the level of the larger variance component, in some cases the method used for robust ANOVA produces confidence intervals that are very conservative.",

    "abstract": "Clinical chemistry is subject to the same principles and standards used in all branches of metrology in chemistry for validation of measurement methods. The use of measuring systems in clinical chemistry is, however, of exceptionally high volume, diverse and involves many laboratories and systems. Samples for measuring the same measurand from a certain patient are likely to encounter several measuring systems over time in the process of diagnosis and treatment of his/her diseases. Several challenges regarding method validation across several laboratories are therefore evident, but rarely addressed in current standards and accreditation practices. The purpose of this is paper to address some of these challenges, making a case that appropriate conventional method validation performed by the manufacturers fulfils only a part of the investigation needed to show that they are fit for purpose in different healthcare circumstances. Method validation across several laboratories using verified commercially available measuring systems can only be performed by the laboratories—users themselves in their own circumstances, and need to be emphasised more by the laboratories themselves and accreditation authorities alike.",

However, both the definition of appropriate ‘performance indicators’ and their statistical analysis vary across EQA providers. Typically, performance scores have an unknown statistical distribution and hence arbitrary thresholds are used to measure performance. In this paper, we introduce a scoring system based on well-known statistical principles. The system is simple, flexible and easy to interpret. It can be used to measure performance for single samples or across a panel so providing useful and meaningful information to participants in EQA programmes. The score is illustrated using the 2005 QCMD Hepatitis B Virus Proficiency programme.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In situ measurements are made without the removal of a physical sample and have many advantages over traditional ex situ measurements, made on a removed sample usually in a remote laboratory. The quality of ex situ measurements is usually expressed primarily in terms of their measurement uncertainty, including that arising during the sampling process. However, estimates of uncertainty for in situ measurement values have not usually included this uncertainty from sampling (UfS). It is argued that the making of an in situ measurement inevitably includes the taking of an ‘undisturbed sample’ that generates UfS, which should be included in the estimate of measurement uncertainty. Because undisturbed samples are not prepared or mixed, as is usual for removed samples, the heterogeneity of the analyte concentration in the sampling target is the primary source of UfS. Existing methods for estimating UfS for ex situ measurements can broadly be applied to in situ measurements. However, four extra challenges that limit the design and uptake of uncertainty estimation for in situ methods are identified, and possible solutions and actions required are discussed. Examples of in situ measurements considered include Pb in top soil by hand-held PXRF, 137 Cs at a nuclear site by portable gamma-ray spectrometry, and bilirubin in new-born infants by hand-held reflectance photometry.",

The test materials were used as samples in two inter-laboratory comparisons. The materials were composed of natural mineral water and model suspended particulate matter (SPM) containing the target compounds at ng L−1 levels. The expanded uncertainty of the estimated mass concentrations in the final test materials was obtained by combining contributions from the homogeneity, the stability and the model SPM characterization. The whole water materials were sufficiently homogeneous and stable at 4 °C for their intended use. In total, 12 out of 15 investigated target parameters could be assessed to be present with a relative combined expanded uncertainty below 25 %. The outcome of the two inter-laboratory comparisons confirmed the good quality of the test materials and the level of uncertainties associated with the estimated mass concentrations. These findings are an important contribution towards the development of whole water matrix reference materials certified for PAH, PBDE and TBT in support of the Water Framework Directive of the European Union.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A range of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) are present in the atmosphere as a result of direct emissions and as products of atmospheric oxidation. Long-term measurements are important to understand changes to these emission sources and atmospheric oxidation processes. Accurate and stable traceable gaseous primary reference materials are needed to underpin rigorous quality assurance and quality control at monitoring stations such as those organised by the World Meteorological Organization Global Atmosphere Watch (WMO-GAW) programme. The development of a capability for providing traceable primary reference materials (PRMs) of OVOCs is of paramount importance due to the increasing prevalence of these compounds in the urban atmosphere and also because there is currently no Central Calibration Laboratory (CCL) for these components within the WMO-GAW programme. This EURAMET bilateral comparison demonstrates the measurement compatibility (≤ 3%) for three OVOCs (methanol, ethanol and acetone) at nominally 5 µmol mol −1 between two National Metrology Institutes: the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), UK and the Van Swinden Laboratorium (VSL), the Netherlands. The comparison shows that a gravimetric method for value assignment is applicable to acetone but that a more complicated procedure must be employed to value assign methanol and ethanol due to corrections for adsorption effects, which can be as large as 10 % of the nominal value. This work demonstrates the importance of making appropriate corrections to ensure the accuracy of these reference materials. NPL and VSL used different approaches to make these corrections providing confidence and independent verification. This work supports new calibration and measurement capabilities for methanol, ethanol and acetone in the range of 1 μmol mol −1 –10 μmol mol −1 with expanded uncertainties of 6.9 % (3 %), 7.3 % (3 %) and 1.7 % (2 %) for NPL (VSL), respectively, to be realized in the key comparison database and supports the development of the required traceability infrastructure to underpin long-term global measurements of these OVOCs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Biomethane is expected to be important in meeting Europe’s greenhouse gas reduction target. The composition of biomethane varies, therefore, depending on the feedstock and process parameters. The European standards EN 16723 specify requirements for injecting biomethane into natural gas networks and its use as vehicle fuel. Ensuring that biomethane composition complies with the requirements set in the standards requires rigorous quality control processes and validated analytical methods. Method validation for parties lacking practical experience or training can be a complex process involving numerous steps and requires adequate guidelines, which were lacking for biomethane. The BiometCAP project has, therefore, developed a standardized protocol for evaluating gas analyzers in biomethane applications with detailed procedures for assessing instrument performance and ensuring accurate and reliable measurements. This article describes how to use the validation protocol with practical applications for evaluating the limit of detection and limit of quantification, the working range and linearity, the precision, the bias and finally to calculate the measurement uncertainties using the analytical method described in ISO 2620:2024 as an example. This method based on TD-CG/MS-FID can therefore be considered fit-for-purpose, providing reliable, precise and sensitive measurements for the analysis of VOCs as demonstrated for 3-carene, dichloromethane and hexamethyldisiloxane. Finally, the article also summarizes the measurement uncertainties obtained during an extensive evaluation exercise organized between seven NMIs across Europe. For any future validation work, measurement uncertainties of 1 to 10% relative for any regulated compounds can be used as reference.",

    "abstract": "Dutch hospitals are in the midst of a transition towards process-oriented organisation to realise optimal and undisturbed care processes. Between 2004 and 2007, the University Hospital of Maastricht conducted a case study implementing process-oriented in-hospital stroke unit care. The case study consisted of four steps: (1) process analysis; (2) identification of bottlenecks; (3) setting goals for process-oriented care, and selection of coordination measures; and (4) implementation and evaluation. Implementation of process-orientation via the coordination measures chosen streamlined the process and led to a better performance of in-hospital stroke unit care; the length of stay was reduced from 12 to 7 days, and the percentage of patients who could not be admitted to the stroke unit was reduced from 31% to 2%. The implementation of coordination measures is a useful means of controlling the activities of the stroke care process from a process point of view. The coordination measures used will not automatically be applicable to other care processes because of the specific nature of each care process. Nevertheless, the general principles of visual representation, bottleneck reduction, and elimination of waste and uncertainty would be applicable in many settings.",

This article focusses on the field of clinical biochemistry and discusses the different properties of a material and the benefits and limitations of using real or synthetic material. However, the overarching principles should be able to be applied to all sectors within the laboratory. Whilst genuine/real material would appear to be the preferred matrix, this is not always practicable, and synthetic material may be a suitable alternative. Synthetic material covers a wide range of material, be it that the material is 100% artificial to real material being used as a ‘base’ item, which is manipulated either by the addition of further real material from a different source or by the addition of exogenous analyte. A number of real-life cases are presented to demonstrate the impact of material matrix, storage conditions, volume, and interferences.",

Intended for an audience of analysts in the field, the theme of the symposium drew inspiration from the series of books by Douglas Adams “The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy”. An introduction to basic concepts of metrological traceability is followed by a discussion of practical steps to ensure metrological traceability of field measurement results. The relationship between metrological traceability and comparability of measurement results is discussed. To achieve metrological traceability in the field, the use of appropriate certified reference materials for calibration is recommended. Examples of atmospheric carbon dioxide and roadside breathalyzer measurements are given.",

    "abstract": "Storing and transporting of urine samples for doping analysis, as performed by the anti-doping organizations associated with the World Anti-Doping Agency, does not include a specific protocol for cooled transport from the place of urine sampling to the doping laboratory, although low cost cooling facilities can easily be made available. As a result, microbial and thermal degradation of the chemical substances in the urine may occur, which may lead to false negative or false positive results in the subsequent doping analysis. This scientifically and morally unacceptable practice is still maintained in spite of publications demonstrating that immediate cooling is an absolute requirement. Given the enormous societal consequences of positive tests, the lack of a controllable chain of custody during transport should be outlawed. This paper proposes a simple method, based on immediate cooling and cooled transport, which can easily be implemented in developed countries at low cost.",

    "abstract": "The International System of Units (SI) follows a concept that goes back to Maxwell. At that time, a logic sound foundation of mathematics was not yet available. This has lead to concepts and terms that are contradictory and in conflict with today's standard mathematical concepts. The inconsistencies that have evolved in metrology due to the lack of appropriate notions are pointed out. This is most important, as the metrology is a field that is internationally well organized under the umbrella of the Meter Convention, an international treaty for acting on all matters relating to units of measurement. Committees and working groups under the Meter Convention have a leading role in the elaboration of important metrological guides, among others the International Vocabulary of Metrology. Therefore, it is highly desirable that their publications use well-founded concepts and terminology. It is consensus that it is desirable to find a system of units on invariant properties of nature and not on human artifacts, e.g., the prototype of the kilogram. However, the current proposals to improve that are in conflict with standard scientific concepts. It is shown in the paper how these inconsistencies can be avoided. The argumentation is based on the interpretation of numbers developed by mathematicians like Cantor, Dedekind, Peano, and others that have led the logic foundation of mathematics with set and number theory. This foundation excludes dogmas that have been forwarded in the last century under the umbrella of the Meter Convention.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Conducting proficiency tests with large numbers of participants are not a problem because the ISO standard 13528:2015 describes many indicators that allow for proper assessment. However, there are proficiency testing (PT) schemes that involve only few participants. In such situations, the same difficulties exist for the selection of proper indicators and the criteria for assessing the participants' achievements. The Institute for Chemical Processing of Coal in Zabrze, Poland organised a round of PT of the determination of gypsum parameters. The results from six participants from Polish research entities and independent laboratories and methodology for the organisation this PT are presented. The performance evaluation criteria were determined using participants results due to the inability to use the metrologically valid procedure. The performance of the participants was evaluated using z ′ and zeta scores.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There is a broad consensus on the importance and advisability of testing laboratories adopting a Quality Management System (QMS) to support their work, no matter they are industrial or research oriented. However, laboratories involved in R&amp;D have specific difficulties to implement a QMS due to the peculiar nature of their activity. This paper analyzes the main challenges and difficulties found by professionals when implementing a QMS in a research testing laboratory, based on the literature review and a questionnaire with 86 laboratories participating performed in collaboration with RedLab (Red de Laboratorios de la Comunidad de Madrid). After this analysis, a set of requirements for the competence of research testing laboratories based on ISO/IEC 17025 and UNE 166002 is defined, and an agile methodology for the fulfilment of these requirements is proposed.",

It was a follow-up of a similar meeting held in 2009. The objective of the meeting was to exchange information about ongoing publicly funded reference material (RM) production, identify areas of interest for future specific RMs, including certified reference material (CRM) developments, investigate potential areas of collaboration, and to identify areas which may be of a lower importance in the future for a specific RM producer. The benefit of exchanging such information is to avoid duplication of efforts in RM production, make better use of public funds by potentially matching competencies, and to address problems that are common to publicly funded RM producers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A feasibility interlaboratory comparison (ILC) was organised by the European Commission’s (EC) Joint Research Centre (JRC) on the determination of the mass fraction of total cow’s milk protein in baked cookies. The ILC was organised to support Commission Regulation (EU) 1169/2011 on the provision of food information to consumers, including the mandatory allergen food labelling and the harmonisation of measurement procedures used for food allergen analysis. An incurred baked cookie was prepared at the JRC and samples were sent to participants for analysis. The laboratories were asked to report their results as “mass fraction of total cow’s milk protein in baked cookies”. This common well-defined measurand was used for the first time in such an ILC to assess the equivalence of measurement results. Homogeneity and stability of the test material were demonstrated to be adequate. An indicative assigned value was established using the JRC single-laboratory validated method based on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC–MS), independently from the results reported by the participants. Twenty-three laboratories from the European Network of Food Allergen Detection Laboratories (ENFADL), representing 20 European Union (EU) Member States, reported results. Their laboratory performance was assessed using the percent difference D i score. The participating laboratories applied either enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) or LC–MS. Even though the majority of the laboratories used commercially available ELISA test kits, a significant scatter of all the reported results was observed. This indicates that further harmonisation is required for measurement procedures aiming to determine potentially allergenic constituents in food.",

    "abstract": "A way of uncertainty calculation from test sample preparation in the laboratory was presented on the example of feeds. The essence of the proposal lies in separating two components of results' variability expressed as coefficient of variation CV p: analytical variability CV a (repeatability) and technical variability CV h corresponding with the inhomogeneity of a component. The law of Gauss's error propagation was used. Analytical variability CV a was calculated from the range of duplicate analyses, following Nordtest Handbook. It was assumed that the coefficient of technical variability CV h is the measure of the standard uncertainty from sample preparation in the uncertainty budget of a method u s+h, and expanded uncertainty U s+h for k = 2 (P = 95 %) can be easily calculated as U s+h = 2 u s+h. Calculated uncertainties with uncertainties from sample preparation for loose feed and no ground premixture have increased from 4 to 125 % and were higher than analytical uncertainties calculated acc. to GUM during validation of methods. In the case of granulated feed mixture, the obtained uncertainties were similar. Grinding the premix results in lower uncertainties. Uncertainty from sample preparation should be taken into account in the uncertainty budget of a test method, especially in the case of inhomogeneity of tested materials.",

The PTs include gaseous (organic and inorganic) and particulate matter (heavy-metal-doped dust) emissions. A unique challenge arises when ISO 13528 is applied to these PTs: While homogeneity of the used gases, liquids, and dusts can easily be demonstrated, the equivalence of measurement points along the stack emission chimney is a completely different matter. Since each test item batch (in this case the pollution-doped ESA exhaust gas) only exists during one measurement, the standard procedure for determination of homogeneity (in this case equivalence of the sampling openings) is not applicable to determine compliance to the standard. To demonstrate the equivalence of the measurement points on our ESA, we devised a modified homogeneity check based on ISO 13528 annex B. This modified homogeneity check was successfully applied to our stack emission PT and should be applicable to sampling PTs in general.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic posed new and manifold challenges to organizations and their operations worldwide. Conformity assessment bodies (CABs), such as testing or medical laboratories, certification, and inspection bodies, were also affected by the associated disruptions. Their role in this crisis is highly relevant, as CABs are essential pillars of the quality infrastructure: their activities ensure that products and services meet requirements as defined in standards and regulations, thereby contributing to their safety and reliability. The question arises of how CABs and their operations were affected by the pandemic and how they responded. To this end, we present the results of an international survey of 986 CABs of all types in Germany, the UK, Italy, and New Zealand. Overall, CABs reported, on average, a reduction in demand for their services during the pandemic, facing restrictions in all countries. In addition, the pandemic had an overall negative impact on the CABs' investment and innovation activities. However, investments in digital infrastructure were increased as a countermeasure, with CABs reporting a higher need for digitalization. The paper highlights and discusses results from in-depth analyses relevant to policymakers and industry alike.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This work aimed to assess the efficiency of a portable total mercury (Hg) analyzer (Lumex RA-915 +) that employs direct thermal decomposition atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) to liberate Hg from a sample matrix as well as validate the quantification method of total Hg in different materials that are used in cement production. Regarding the solid matrix of the samples, the approaches included matrix-matched certified reference materials (CRM) calibration and adding a standard calibration solution to the solid samples. While both calibration approaches were suitable for the instrumentation employed, the uncertainty of the Hg mass fraction in a CRM and the need to include several matrix CRMs that differed in analyte content added to the complexity of the case. Spiked calibration is an acceptable alternative to calibration because it provides a lower expanded uncertainty at 15 %, 15.5 %, and 21.7 %, for the highest (&gt; 200 ng), middle (50–150 ng), and lowest (&lt; 50 ng) concentration ranges, respectively, compared to matrix CRM calibration. The obtained expanded uncertainty, the minimal requirements for sample preparation, easy and straightforward calibration and measurement, and high sample output indicate that the quantification of total Hg with thermal decomposition coupled with AAS is suitable for materials that are used in cement production.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, a lot of time and resources are used to determine the quality of goods and services. As a consequence, the quality of measurements themselves, e.g., the metrological traceability of the measured quantity values is essential to allow a proper evaluation of the results with regard to specifications and regulatory limits. This requires knowledge of the measurement uncertainties of all quantity values involved in the measurement procedure, including measurement standards. This study shows how the uncertainties due to the preparation, as well as the chemical and compositional stability of a chemical measurement standard, or calibrator, can be estimated. The results show that the relative standard uncertainty of the concentration value of a typical analytical measurement standard runs up to 2.8% after 1 year. Of this, 1.9% originates from the preparation of the measurement standard, while 2.0 and 0.53% originate from the chemical and compositional stability during storage at −20 °C. The monthly preparation of working calibrators stored at 4 °C and used on a weekly basis, results in an additional standard uncertainty of the analyte concentration value of 0.35% per month due to compositional stability. While the preparation procedure is the major contributor to the total measurement uncertainty, the uncertainties introduced by the stability measurements are another important contributor, and therefore, the measurement procedure to evaluate stability is important to minimize the total measurement uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "On the basis of long-standing proficiency testings (PTs) for the small number of PT participants p (7 ≤ p ≤ 30), laboratory bias and uncertainty were calculated by applying inter-laboratory experimental approaches. Uncertainty was estimated in two ways, according to Eurolab TR No 1/2007 and Nordtest TR 537 (2012). In the case of 24 tested feed components (basic nutrients, macro- and microelements, undesirable elements and some feed additives including vitamins A and E, lysine, threonine, methionine and urea) in the large variety of feed samples, differences between the expanded uncertainties calculated according to Eurolab TR No 1/2007 and Nordtest TR 537 did not exceed 1.4 % for all tested feed and analytes in wide concentration ranges. In order to get a reliable evaluation of bias and uncertainty, minimum of 6 PT rounds and a sufficient number of laboratories participating (p ≥ 10) are recommended. When the above parameters are applied and the standard deviation of the bias s bias ≤ 5 %, the expression s bias 2 /n can be omitted while calculating bias. Generally, both approaches fit the purpose of feed evaluation and the calculated uncertainties can be used for compliance assessment.",

    "abstract": "Certified water reference materials are currently not available for most of the hydrophobic organic pollutants listed in the EU Water Framework Directive. To find the most suitable container type for subsequent reference material productions, feasibility studies for the preparation of waters with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and tributyltin (TBT) close to environmental quality standards in water have been performed. Due to the hydrophobic nature of these compounds and their tendency to adsorb onto container walls, an adequate selection of the most appropriate material for containment, storage and transport of water reference materials is crucial. Three different materials (aluminium, amber glass and fluorinated polyethylene, FPE) and three volumes (500/600 mL, 1000/1200 mL and 2000/3000 mL, depending on commercial availability) were tested at ng L−1 level of the target compounds. FPE shows by far the highest loss of analytes due to adsorption onto the container walls for all compounds studied. Aluminium and glass are equally suited for PAHs and PBDEs, but aluminium is unsuitable as container material for TBT due to acid cleaning requirements. The volume of the containers had no dramatic effect on the adsorption behaviour of target compounds for the different volumes tested.",

Proficiency testing is considered to be one of the most reliable ways to verify and coordinate analytical results. As a French national reference laboratory in plant pathology, the Anses Plant Health Laboratory organizes proficiency tests in order to ensure that officially approved laboratories (certified by government services) are capable of producing reliable analytical results for the detection of plant pathogens. Proficiency tests in plant pathology have a number of notable features including the processing of qualitative results. This paper presents the experience of the Anses Plant Health Laboratory's Unit for Tropical Pests and Diseases (LSV-RAPT) as an organizer of proficiency tests in plant pathology. The LSV-RAPT has gained recognition for the methodology it has developed in the form of accreditation as a proficiency testing provider according to the ISO/IEC 17043. The methodology can be applied to many other disciplines that use qualitative detection methods.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A goal of the cooperative agreement between the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Center for Tobacco Reference Products (CTRP) at the University of Kentucky was to produce a standard reference cigarette for researchers to further tobacco science. The 1R6F certified reference cigarette for analytical testing was developed to be typical of an American blend cigarette. The cigarettes have been used in proficiency testing (PT) schemes under the supervision of the CTRP since 2016 for a variety of parameters. Data were compared from 8 rounds of PT schemes submitted by participating laboratories, which include various international stakeholders comprised of academic institutions, federal research/regulatory laboratories, tobacco product manufacturers, and independent contract testing laboratories. Evaluation of the datasets for harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) within the mainstream smoke of the 1R6F certified reference cigarette included tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNA), tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide (TNCO), and Benzo[ α ]pyrene (B α P). Of the datasets evaluated, less than 5 % resulted in either a warning or alert, and less than 2 % resulted in an alert. Comparisons across multiple PT rounds revealed no significant differences in the consensus means of the tested parameters. Evaluation of data submitted by participating laboratories for multiple proficiency test rounds shows that the 1R6F certified reference cigarette is an acceptable material as a control reference for the analysis of HPHCs which is imperative since some stakeholders may be required to participate in, and receive satisfactory results, from PT for accreditation purposes.",

    "abstract": "When routine laboratories merge or are taken over by larger entities, their quality management systems usually need to be integrated. In many laboratories, quality management systems according to ISO/IEC 17025 are in place. The integration of the quality management systems is often advantageous in terms of efficiency of operations, reduction in number of processes and consequently amount of quality documentation. However, a number of practical problems, some of them hard to overcome, may be encountered. Examples are: how to deal with multi-site activities showing technical and/or cultural differences, how to merge historically different ways of working and how to overcome psychological resistance to change from laboratory staff. This paper demonstrates a way of working used in our organisation to integrate successfully the quality management systems of several laboratories under one quality management system. The laboratories were located in two different countries (Belgium and Italy) and had activities under ISO/IEC 17025, ISO/IEC 17043 and ISO Guide 34 accreditation. Involvement of the laboratory staff was essential for obtaining a fast and efficient integration.",

It allows identifying and monitoring traffic and use of batches of raw materials, waste products, and finished products in the entire supply chain. The case study concerning a traceability system was conducted during BRCv7 (British Retail Consortium, Issue 7) audit made for packaged soybean oil. The analysis was based on the SOP (Standard Operating Procedure), HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) procedure and records, including those concerning CCP (Critical Control Point), as well as the data from internal software Manufacturing WHM (WebHost Manager) Inquiries Version 5.2.8. and Traceability 2.1.0. for tracing batches of raw materials, additives, finished products, and clients. Verification revealed non-conformity in routine tests of the system, which was put on the list of corrective actions. Their correction was a prerequisite for meeting requirements of the standard and for system improvements. The corrective actions included complementation of the operational procedure for traceability of production and related documents with the records of supervision and verification of raw materials and packaging. The changes were introduced in the control procedure of machines and appliances in order to reduce the loss incurred while during packing oil. The employees were trained with regard to the changes introduced in the procedures, and the effectiveness of these actions was confirmed, which proved the necessity of the corrective actions undertaken.",

The method was optimized and validated by measurement of three certified primary buffer solutions (CRMs) with nominal pH values of 4.005, 6.865 and 9.180 at 25 °C. The method was applied to assess homogeneity and stability of phosphate buffer solution with nominal pH of 7.000 at 25 °C which will be used as test item in proficiency testing schemes for pH measurement of testing laboratories. The experiments carried out and described in this article proved that this particular design of secondary differential potentiometric cell requires small volume of solutions, is fast, accurate and precise and is suitable for the characterization of secondary buffer solutions and assessment of homogeneity and stability of buffer solutions.",

From 2012 to 2018, the Proficiency Exercise Program offered 20 proficiency tests or interlaboratory comparison exercises focused on veterinary analytes of interest. The program evaluated performance of laboratories, individual analysts, and the methods used. Over the six-year period, the program improved exercise schemes, as well as offered network laboratories exercises with analytes not routinely seen such as animal tissue with naturally occurring residues. Animal diagnostic laboratories can use performance results to assist with accreditation, demonstrate proficiency, and improve diagnostic capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Accreditation of healthcare services is recommended to ensure operation according to the highest quality standards. Various initiatives, such as legislation or accreditation by ISO or JCI, may be active to support and improve quality. The growing trend toward JCI hospital accreditation raised the concern of redundancy between JCI requirements for the use of referral laboratories and the ISO 15189 accreditation for medical laboratories. This would result in needless administrative efforts for hospital laboratories to collect and maintain required documentation, as the JCI quality requirements would be guaranteed given that the referral laboratory is ISO 15189 accredited for those examinations. A consensus meeting was organized by the Working Group for Hospital Accreditation of the Belgian Zorgnet-Icuro network, the University Hospitals of Leuven and the Red Cross to discuss the avoidance of any redundancy between both standards and to issue best practice guidelines for referral laboratories. It was concluded that JCI measurable elements for referral laboratories are covered by the ISO 15189 accreditation scope. The article substantiates the consensus that JCI and ISO quality requirements are harmonized and that accurate knowledge and interpretation of prevailing quality standards are essential to avoid redundancy in quality measures.",

It is especially important for measurement of the environmental samples, like soil, which is a very complex matrix. A certified reference materials (CRMs) should be routinely used for this purpose. The paper discusses the procedure for preparation of the soil samples for certification as CRM. As for agricultural reasons there is a growing demand for CRMs regarding a nitrogen mass fraction in the Polish soil, we prepared such a material and established the reference value with associated measurement uncertainty. Homogeneity and stability of the material were shown to be appropriate for the intended purpose. The presented approach can also be used in a process of manufacture of a laboratory reference material, which can be used for a routine quality control.",

Paul’s insights and incisive criticism were as illuminating and as provocative as in all other areas that he looked into—from counting to consensus building, from the validity of common statistical assumptions to the impact of model uncertainty. This memorial contribution briefly revisits some of these concerns illustrated by examples from interlaboratory comparisons and proposes an optimistic outlook for how the statistical arts practised in close collaboration between chemist and statistician will continue to add value to the chemical sciences.",

In this paper, a new method for the SI-traceable quantification of selected FAMEs in biodiesel and its validation are described. This method has the potential to be a reference method for applications requiring structurally defined measurands and traceability to the SI as it allows direct comparisons to well-characterised calibrants through the use of isotopically labelled analogues of the analytes as well as establishing a full uncertainty budget. The method is based on gas chromatography–isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Its performance is demonstrated through its implementation and validation in two independent laboratories and is shown to provide reliable and traceable results for selected FAMEs in biodiesel test samples.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article is a response to the preceding paper by Huang, who considers a recent result of Willink (Measurement: Sensors, 24:100416, 2022) and who describes the result as a paradox. The result implied that a set of information or a “state of knowledge” about a measurand cannot be identified with a unique probability distribution for the measurand, contrary to what seems suggested in the literature surrounding the revision of the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement . The result is restated and viewed in the context of CIPM Recommendation INC-1, which was foundational in the original development of the Guide . It is argued that the result is a proof, not a paradox, and that it will only appear paradoxical to those who have adopted an incorrect premise about probability. The idea of having “information” about the true value of a measurand is discussed and contrasted with the idea of having “belief” about it. The material supports the view that the analysis of measurement uncertainty is to be based on classical statistical principles.",

    "abstract": "During the period 2021–2023, the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) organised, in collaboration with the Italian Health Ministry, proficiency testing (PTs) for about 22 Italian and other EU laboratories involved in the monitoring programmes for Plant Protection Products (PPPs). The aim of the PTs was to determine the amount of active ingredient in various formulations of PPPs. Overall, the type of formulations to be analysed were soluble concentrate (SL), suspension concentrate (SC), capsule suspension (CS), emulsion water oil (EW), soluble water granule (SG), dustable powder (DP), water dispersible granule (WDG) and emulsion concentrate (EC). In 2021, the ISS organised PTs for the determination of Imazamox, Fenhexamid and Trinexapac-ethyl in three different PPPs as soluble concentrate (SL), suspension concentrate (SC), and capsule suspension (CS), respectively. In 2022, PTs for the determination of Bentazone, Spinosad and Tau-Fluvalinate were organised. For this PTs, commercial PPPs were obtained from the Italian market as SC, emulsion oil water (EW) and soluble water granule (SG). In 2023, the PT was organised to determine the active ingredient Trifloxystrobin, Deltamethrin and Cyprodinil in the commercial product as water dispersible granule (WDG), dustable powder (DP) and emulsion concentrate (EC), respectively. Homogeneity and stability, performed for all PT samples, fulfilled the acceptability criteria. The Jarque–Bera test was used to verify the hypothesis of normality of the data distributions before to calculate the z-score values. Laboratory performances, expressed in terms of z-scores, were satisfactory for almost all participants for all substances.",

    "abstract": "The key comparison (KC) studies of the Consultative Committee for Amount of Substance—Metrology in Chemistry help ensure the reliability of chemical and biochemical measurements relevant to international trade and environmental-, health-, and safety-related decision making. The traditional final evaluation of each measurement result reported by a KC participant is a \"degree of equivalence\" (DEq) that quantitatively specifies how consistent each individual result is relative to a reference value. Recognizing the impossibility of conducting separate KCs for all important analytes in all important sample matrices at all important analyte levels, emphasis is now shifting to documenting broadly applicable critical or \"core\" measurement competencies elicited through a series of studies. To better accomplish the necessary synthesis of results, data analysis and display tools must be developed for objectively and quantitatively combining individual DEqs. The information detailed in the 11 KCs of primary method pH measurements publically available as of 2013 provides an excellent \"best case\" prototype for such analysis. We here propose tools that enable documenting the expected primary pH measurement performance of individual participants between pH 1 and pH 11 and from 15 °C to 37 °C. These tools may prove useful for other areas where the uncertainty of measurement is a predictable function of the measured quantity, such as the stable gases. That results for relatively simple measurement processes can be combined using relatively simple analysis and display methods does not ensure that similarly meaningful summaries can be devised for less well understood and controlled systems, but it provides the incentive to attempt to do so.",

    "abstract": "Reliable measurements are needed for the verification measures of States’ declarations of their nuclear activities in line with international agreements and the EURATOM Treaty. Laboratories carrying out measurements of nuclear material need to follow stringent quality control concepts and are required to demonstrate their measurement capabilities on a regular and timely basis to legal and safeguards authorities. This includes participation in interlaboratory comparisons (ILCs). In the frame of the Regular European Interlaboratory Measurement Evaluation Programme (REIMEP), a new ILC (REIMEP-17) was jointly organized by the EC—Joint Research Centre—Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (JRC-IRMM) and EC—Joint Research Centre—Institute for Transuranium Elements (JRC-ITU) for EURATOM and IAEA safeguards laboratories, nuclear plant operators and nuclear material laboratories. The focus in REIMEP-17 was on measurements of the uranium and plutonium amount contents and isotope amount ratios in synthetic dissolved spent nuclear fuel solutions. Participants received two test samples, REIMEP-17A and REIMEP-17B, with different uranium and plutonium amount contents. Laboratories were requested to report the results with associated uncertainties applying their standard measurement procedures and had the possibility to benchmark those results against the independent assigned (reference) values and the ones listed in the International Target Values for Measurement Uncertainties in Safeguarding Nuclear Materials (ITV2010). It can be concluded that the participants in REIMEP-17 performed well for the measurements of uranium and plutonium amount content in compliance with the respective ITV2010 values. In particular, the measurement performance for the isotope amount ratios was very satisfactory for both REIMEP-17 test samples. This confirms the measurement capabilities of laboratories in the field of nuclear material analysis and demonstrates that the stringent ITV2010 values are achievable targets under state-of-practice conditions. On the other hand, the spread of results for the minor uranium isotope amount ratios was larger. Moreover, for some of the measurands, differences in the measurement uncertainty estimations provided by laboratories were observed even when using the same instrumental technique. A summary of the participant results is presented and discussed in this paper.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Direct monitoring of volatile organic compounds emitted from industrial sources as well as the monitoring of ambient levels thereof in the atmosphere play an important role in providing data for various legislative requirements. There are many volatile organic compounds emitted to the atmosphere, from biomass burning, power stations, and many other sources. Primary reference gas mixtures of volatile organic compounds containing six components, namely benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, o -xylene, m -xylene, and p -xylene (BTEX) were prepared by gravimetric methods at nominal amount of substance fractions of 10 µmol/mol. The preparation was performed using the stainless steel (loop) method and direct liquid injection method using gas tight syringe connected to a dedicated syringe heater for comparison purposes. The results of the gravimetric values for both methods were within 1 % of the nominal amount of substance fraction. After the preparation, comparison was achieved by analysis of the BTEX gas mixtures using gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection (GC-FID) and showed comparability to within 2 % of the gravimetric values. The contributions to the uncertainty of measurement were from weighing stainless steel tubes, syringes, and gas cylinders, as well as purity data. The contribution to the uncertainty of measurement from the analysis by GC-FID were repeatability and reproducibility. The combined expanded uncertainty of measurement was between 1.09 % and 3.51 %. The larger deviation from the gravimetric values and associated uncertainty was observed for benzene due to its higher volatility compared to the other components. The BTEX reference gas mixtures prepared in this study are currently being used as a source of traceability in South Africa for air pollution monitoring purposes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Biomethane may contain trace components that can have adverse effects on gas vehicles performances and on the pipelines when injected in the gas grid. Biomethane quality assurance against specifications is therefore crucial for the integrity of the end-users’ appliances. Analytical methods used to assess biomethane conformity assessment must be validated properly and possibly, new methods specifically for biomethane should be developed. This paper provides an overview of the biomethane quality assurance infrastructure and the challenges faced with focus on sampling, analysis methods, reference gas mixtures, and performance evaluation. Currently, requirements for analytical method validation and fit-for-purpose assessments do not exist for biomethane. The industry is in urgent need of a protocol to evaluate the fit-for-purpose of methods in a harmonized manner. Reference gas mixtures to check the accuracy of the instrument and to determine the traceability of the measurement are also urgently required.",

A complementary performance evaluation, based on the ζ score and the assessment of the measurement uncertainty, is therefore highly recommended. This work presents an intuitive graphical tool (the Naji2 plot) that combines z and ζ scores together with the reported measurement uncertainties. This tool allows a comprehensive assessment of the laboratory performance and enables to identify the need for corrective actions. The concerned laboratory should then perform a root cause analysis and investigate their bias and/or their measurement uncertainty evaluation.",

The plot consists of a measure of agreement—the significance level of a test for significant pairwise difference, adjusted for multiple comparisons—plotted as an image in which significance is represented by colour or intensity. This provides an easily interpretable graphical presentation in which the degree of consensus can be judged and in which anomalies are easily visible. The construction of the plot is discussed, with attention to the choice of adjustment for the size of the data set in checking for anomalies. The advantage over visual inspection using error bars is discussed, and some examples from metrology comparisons are presented.",

This paper summarises the validation and initial results from the model, looking at the effect of varying the uncertainty of the reference method used to calibrate the analyser. The legislation allows the reference method an uncertainty of up to 20 %, but this will influence the quality of the calibration of the analyser. The results illustrate the problem and highlight that it becomes a significant issue when the reference method’s uncertainty is greater than 15 %, with the analyser failing its calibration almost half of the time due to poor reference performance at 20 % uncertainty. The model can be used to test future changes to legislation and can help operators to ensure that they would be able to meet such future measurement challenges.",

    "abstract": "Abstract External quality assessment (EQA) is an essential part of performance monitoring for molecular laboratories. At the moment, a national law regulates participation in EQA schemes for clinical biology and pathology in Belgium. This study aimed (1) to get insights on how laboratories organize their EQA participation, (2) to poll satisfaction with the current situation (selection of EQA programs in advance by a governmental body), (3) to provide guidance for choosing the most relevant EQA provider and (4) to propose a new model for national performance monitoring. A survey was sent to Belgian laboratories performing molecular tests in the field of microbiology, hematology and pathology with (1) general questions on how they select an EQA provider and (2) their satisfaction of each provider. In total, 25 molecular laboratories [microbiology ( N = 13), hematology ( N = 8) and pathology ( N = 4)] from 14 different hospitals completed the survey regarding their EQA organization. All three laboratory groups indicated to prefer EQA schemes using real patient materials as well as those with varying targets and concentrations. For molecular microbiology and hematology, schemes with a syndromic approach are sought. Since annual participation in EQA becomes burdensome in most laboratories, this paper also offers a risk-based strategy for determining the participation frequency. Based on the needs of Belgian laboratories, three proposals were made: (1) for the proper selection of an EQA scheme, (2) for determining the minimal participation frequency and (3) for the national organization of EQA schemes.",

    "abstract": "Coccidiostats are a group of pharmacologically active substances widely used in veterinary practice. Their residues are detected relatively often in poultry tissues and egg samples analyzed as part of official residue control programs in the European Union. Therefore, accuracy of quantitative results needs to be monitored through internal and external quality control studies. In addition, the use of materials containing incurred residues would be welcome to for ongoing monitoring of the method accuracy. Unfortunately, in the field of veterinary drug residues, certified reference materials are often unavailable. Therefore, in-house quality control material of incurred lyophilized eggs containing narasin and nicarbazin has been produced and characterized. The eggs originated from hens receiving feed with coccidiostat premix Maxiban were mixed to obtain presumed concentrations of residues and freeze-dried. Homogeneity of the material was verified by the duplicate analysis of ten random samples, and the results proved that the between samples variation was negligible in comparison with the method repeatability. No measurable loss of analytes was observed within 1 year; the slope of the regression line of the results of stability measurements was not significantly different from zero. The assigned values were expressed as medians of the results of inter-laboratory comparison performed in four different European laboratories; the uncertainty of the material was estimated, taken into consideration all above tests, resulting in (14.4 ± 2.53) µg/kg for nicarbazin and (7.91 ± 1.52) µg/kg for narasin.",

    "abstract": "With some analytical parameters, certified reference materials are lacking and the reference method shows limited performance. Somatic cell counting in milk is a clear example. It is one of the most frequently performed measurements, estimated at over 500 000 000 tests/year world wide. It serves as an indicator for the udder health status of lactating animals, is relevant in food legislation, in payment of raw milk, and also has a considerable impact for farm management and animal-breeding programs. The analytical performance of nowadays fluoro-opto-electronic routine methods in terms of precision is superior to the reference method based on microscopy. Laboratories have therefore adopted various solutions for anchoring their counting level. It is there that a reference system approach can serve to optimally safeguard comparability of routine testing results in laboratories world wide. A reference system is characterized as a systematically developed anchoring system that is fed by different types of information from various sources, that is, measurements on reference materials, reference method analysis, and routine method results. A joint Project Group of the International Dairy Federation and the International Committee on Animal Recording has been given the task to design a workable global reference system for somatic cell counting in milk. This paper describes the structure and the functioning of such a reference system, a plan for the implementation and the responsibilities of the involved stakeholders in safeguarding its functioning. After approval in IDF and ICAR, the resulting proposal is to be offered for adoption by concerned governmental and non-governmental bodies worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Accreditation is one of the pillars of a national Quality Infrastructure, as the competence of conformity assessment bodies is assured through accreditation performed by accreditation bodies. To compare the operation of accreditation bodies in Europe and to identify best practices, a management tool, the Process Maturity Benchmarking Tool , was developed and validated by applying it to European accreditation bodies. The benchmarking project comprised two major phases: in the first phase, the processes of accreditation bodies were systematically analyzed. A process map was developed, and processes of special relevance were identified and underpinned by indicators. In the second phase, the practical applicability of the theoretical model was demonstrated by analyzing the processes of eight European accreditation bodies. The results of this comparative assessment were subsequently discussed in a workshop with experts from those accreditation bodies, giving the opportunity to identify best practices. This article has a twofold objective. First, to present a method to benchmark European accreditation bodies, based on the European Foundation for Quality Management excellence model. The successful application of the Process Maturity Benchmarking Tool gives evidence that it is a suitable and capable management tool to assess the processes of the European accreditation bodies and to benchmark them. Second, the article presents the results of the first adaption of the Process Maturity Benchmarking Tool . A general trend of process maturity was identified: while processes based on stakeholder involvement tend to have an overall lower maturity on average, internal processes are more mature.",

    "abstract": "This article discusses the accuracy of the gravimetric measurement method of total particulate matter concentration in waste gases where the basic assumption is that sample collection of dust-laden gas is done in a grid with a finite number of points in the conduit’s measurement plane. In this standard approach, the sample is assumed to be representative for dust-laden gas in the conduit, and consequently, the total particulate matter concentration measured for the sample is considered the mean concentration in the conduit. The article investigates this assumption against the standard-imposed number of sampling points and in view of spatial distributions of particulate matter concentration in industrial plants which—being continuous—are not identified in measuring practice. Possible distributions were simulated both for particulate matter concentration and for gas velocity in rectangular conduits, and the following were calculated: (a) an accurate mean particulate matter concentration in the measurement plane, based on its definition employing continuous distributions of particulate matter concentration and gas velocity and (b) the concentration in a sample, i.e. measured concentration. Measurement deviation between those concentrations was determined, which is specific for cumulative gas sampling. Using the obtained set of possible deviations, an estimation method was suggested for the relevant uncertainty component of the gravimetric method, which so far has not been taken into account in the industrial measurement accuracy analyses. It turns out that the level of this uncertainty component for measuring the mean particulate matter concentration in the conduit (resulting from “measurement discretization”) is not to be ignored.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This short article discusses the units of rate constants as used in chemical kinetics and, in particular, the aspect of non-integral powers of base units, which some might find unusual for units in the SI system. In many ways the fact that the units of the rate constants as usually defined convey information about the order of the reaction or reactions involved is very useful, but in other ways having the same (or at least very similar) quantity that has different units under different conditions is not so desirable. Furthermore, just as with chemical equilibrium constants, taking functions of the rate constant (such as the logarithm when representing the Arrhenius equation in the form ln $$k\\,{\\text {vs.}}\\,1/T$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mi>k</mml:mi> <mml:mspace /> <mml:mtext>vs.</mml:mtext> <mml:mspace /> <mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mo>/</mml:mo> <mml:mi>T</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> ) needs special attention. Here we examine a possible alternative definition of rate constants in terms of an explicit ratio to the concentration standard state and although we acknowledge that this approach unlikely to be adopted by the community, it serves as a basis to discuss the meaning of rate constants.",

    "abstract": "The somatic cell count (SCC) of milk is one of the main indicators of the udder health status of lactating mammals and is a hygiene criterion of raw milk used to manufacture dairy products. An increase in SCC is regarded as one of the primary indicators of inflammation of the mammary gland. Therefore, SCC is relevant in food legislation as well as in the payment of ex-farm raw milk and it has a major impact on farm management and breeding programs. Its determination is one of the most frequently performed analytical tests worldwide. Routine measurements of SCC are almost exclusively done using automated fluoro-opto-electronic counting. However, certified reference materials for SCC are lacking, and the microscopic reference method is not reliable because of serious inherent weaknesses. A reference system approach may help to largely overcome these deficiencies and help to assure equivalence in SCC worldwide. The approach is characterised as a positioning system fed by different types of information from various sources. A statistical approach for comparing proficiency tests (PTs) by assessing them using a quality index P Q and assessing participating laboratories using a quality index P L, both deriving from probabilities, is proposed. The basic assumption is that PT schemes are conducted according to recognised guidelines in order to compute performance characteristics, such as z-scores, repeatability and reproducibility standard deviations. Standard deviations are compared with the method validation data from the ISO method. Input quantities close to or smaller than the reference data of the method validation or the assigned value of the PT result in values for P Q and P L close to the maximum value. Evaluation examples of well-known PTs show the practicability of the proposed approach.",

Most procedures recommended for this estimation are based on statistically demanding weighted regression. This article proposes a statistically less demanding procedure. The s 0 and s r parameters are estimated from selected subsets of absolute and relative differences of duplicates measured at low to medium concentrations and high to medium concentrations, respectively. The estimates are obtained by iterative calculations from the root mean square of the differences with a correction for the influence of the second parameter. This procedure was verified on Monte Carlo simulated datasets. The variability of the parameter estimates obtained by this proposed procedure may be similar or slightly worse than that of the estimates obtained by the best regression procedure, but better than the variability of the estimates obtained by other tested regression procedures. However, a selection of the duplicates from an inappropriate concentration range may cause a substantial increase in variability of the estimates obtained.",

    "abstract": "The UV–Vis spectra of the f-elements, especially the lanthanides, are known for their rather sharp absorption bands showing systematic and reproducible changes upon coordination with suitable ligands. These absorption bands have been used as indicators allowing interpretation of the processes in solution. Modern absorption spectrometers in combination with digital recording of the spectra allow a precise collection of a large number of absorptions for many samples. The number of absorption thus collected easily amounts to several thousands of individual data. Chemometric techniques, especially factor analysis, are occasionally used to extract information from these data sets on basis of Bouguer–Lambert–Beer law. Recent studies indicate the sensitivity of parameter values obtained from uncritical use of chemometric techniques to various influence and nuisance factors. On the basis of selected examples, the effects of parameter correlations, residual correlations, and measurement uncertainty introduced by volume operations are demonstrated. Using the ISO Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty as a convention for assessing measurement uncertainty, formation constants lg K derived from UV–Vis spectra of f-elements should be associated with a measurement uncertainty u of at least u = 0.15 (k = 1).",

    "abstract": "Key to sound validation studies is the formalization and harmonization of procedures for design of experiment and interpretation of results. International guidelines (ISO 5725, ENGL) are available for the validation of GMO detection methods, and ad-hoc validation statistics (e.g. per cent bias, repeatability and reproducibility) are used for in-house and inter-laboratory testing and decision-making. Acceptability criteria have been set but not every situation can be covered by a preset rule; the interpretation of results in validation largely depends on expert judgement being a matter of professional judgment and expertise. Fuzzy logic-based techniques may be used to summarize the information obtained by independent validation statistics and are helpful in such respect. A comprehensive indicator of method performance permits direct comparison between methods and facilitates the evaluation of multiple, yet contradictory statistics. The European Union Reference Laboratory for GM Food and Feed has already proposed the fuzzy principle in the context of method validation. Other studies have also proved its applicability in other areas of GMO analysis, but the application has been limited hitherto. In this article, we review the fuzzy logic principle and its potential to support the continuous progress of GMO science and routine laboratory analyses.",

    "abstract": "Measurement uncertainty is an integral part of a measurement result. Without a statement of uncertainty a measurement result is not complete. Concluding about compatibility with other measurement results obtained for the same measurand or with compliance limits is not possible and the measurement result does therefore, not serve its purpose. The measurement uncertainty is a quality criterion, which is important for the use of the result, in particular if decisions are to be based on that result. The Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM), ISO 1995, and the CITAC/EURACHEM document Quantifying Uncertainty in Analytical Measurement (QUAM), 2001, an introduction to the GUM for chemists, are useful guides for evaluating measurement uncertainty in chemical analysis. These guides and their recommendations on how to report measurement results together with the associated uncertainty serve as the basis for the following. The final measurement result obtained after corrections for all known systematic effects is regarded as the best estimate y of the measurand Y within the range of values which could reasonably be attributed to the measurand under the given conditions of measurement. It is reported in the form: Y 1⁄4 y U with U 1⁄4 kuðyÞ",

The objective is to describe the quality of clinical microbiology results of the participants in the study period (2010–2021). This analysis includes the results of genus and species identification and proper reporting of both Gram staining and susceptibility testing. Data from 195 laboratories, which processed 31 bacteria, were analyzed. In this study, 32 % of laboratories were classified as good because they successfully determined the genus and species, 36 % fair, 12 % poor, and 20 % critical, to which recommendations for improvement were sent as part of the reports. In the analysis conducted for concordance between Genus, Morphology, and Gram, the success rates obtained are between 83 % and 94 %. Regarding antibiograms, the performance observed in Gram-positive bacteria ranges from 57 to 98 %, while in Gram-negative bacteria, it is between 82 and 98 %. The descriptive tools to explain external quality assessment results in clinical microbiology are limited to the percentage of successes in each item to be reported. For the analysis of the population data set, in this article, we propose to use contingency tables (including estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values) and equality of proportions tests as techniques that facilitate the interpretation of the data. On the other hand, the statistical analysis described here can be used as an analysis methodology for similar studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We report details of a proficiency testing (PT) scheme for laboratories undertaking the analysis of diesel engine particulates (DEP) collected on workplace air filter samples. Within this occupational hygiene setting, the established approach is to measure the elemental carbon (EC) content within DEP as a specific marker of workers’ exposure to engine emissions. Measuring EC is undertaken in laboratories using combustion-based analysers. To date six, PT rounds have been completed with participation ranging between thirteen and twenty-three laboratories. In each round participants received four quartz fibre filter samples (plus blank filters) loaded with DEP with indicative EC mass loadings in the range 9–204 µg/filter. Round assigned values and standard deviation for performance assessment values were calculated by consensus from returned participant data following outlier removal. On this basis, it was determined that on average 81 % of the returned data was deemed satisfactory, i.e. returning a z (or z ’) score ≤ 2. The use of two operationally defined analytical protocols, namely NIOSH 5040 and EN 16909, now dominate but they give different EC values so the preparation of reference air filter samples with preordained EC values determined using both protocols for use in future interlaboratory comparisons is therefore recommended.",

Under this mandate, WADA regularly distributes urine and blood test samples to anti-doping laboratories to continuously monitor their proficiency. Over the years, WADA has employed classical, generic statistical methods, in accordance to ISO 13528, to evaluate quantitative EQAS results. Here, we set out the rationale for a modern statistical approach that recognizes and addresses the particular features of the measurement results typically obtained in such tests and present an approach involving Bayesian measurement models and statistical data analysis that is tailored specifically to anti-doping testing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Proficiency testing (PT) in chemical analysis ideally provides participants with feedback on all aspects of laboratory performance. In the field of analysis of elements in food, analyte levels in test items are often close to the legal limits. Performance criteria such as those in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 333/2007 also refer to maximum values for limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantification (LOQ), as well as to selectivity and control of contamination. Therefore, PTs with analyte levels in the range of LOD and LOQ are also very beneficial, as at these low levels, insufficient selectivity or contamination during sample preparation are more likely to affect the analytical results. Since 2017, our unit has provided 7 PTs, each with at least one parameter (e.g. an element prone to contamination such as arsenic or mercury) with very low mass fractions. In these cases, the datasets showed a significant proportion of results reported as “&lt; LOQ”, together with quantitative results as well. If the “&lt; LOQ”-values are predominant, calculation according to ISO 13528 is not feasible. Due to the wide range of the individual LOQs, the numerical use of the LOQs or a percentage of them is not appropriate. Therefore, we decided to sort the quantitative results and the “&lt; LOQ” results numerically. We then determined the median and evaluated all quantitative results above the median as “false positive”, while all other results were evaluated as “true statement”. In this way, laboratories affected by contamination, for example, received appropriate feedback.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Veterinary diagnostic laboratories (VDLs) play a critical role in screening both human and animal samples for SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 detection methods used by VDLs, a proficiency test was performed by the US Food and Drug Administration’s Veterinary Laboratory and Investigation and Response Network in collaboration with two other organizations. Thirty-two sets of 12 blind-coded samples were prepared by fortifying Molecular Transport Medium (MTM) or feline feces with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant or non-SARS-CoV-2 equine coronavirus RNA at various concentrations and shipped to 32 participants for blinded (unbiased) analysis. Results were analyzed according to the principles of International Organization for Standardization 16140-2:2016 using two approaches such as establishing the rate of detection (ROD) and the success rate by applying the analysis of binary outcome by logit approach. ROD provided the overall assessment of laboratories performance, whereas the novel logit approach provided an insight to more specific analysis based on the complexity of each sample. The ROD was 83% and 98% for MTM samples at 200 and 20000 genome copies per 100 µL, respectively. Fecal samples were classified as challenging exploratory, and results were not included in the assessment of performance but discussion purposes only. Fecal samples exhibited matrix interference impacting the performance. The ROD was 44% and 89% for fecal samples at 2000 and 20000 genome copies per 100 µL, respectively. The non-COVID coronavirus RNA, which was used to address the specificity, did not interfere with methods used. Establishing the success rate by evaluating the qualitative results (detected/not detected) applying a logit approach revealed that, out of thirty-two participants, twenty-eight had satisfactory results, one participant had unsatisfactory results, and three participants had questionable results for MTM samples. For fecal samples, three participants out of thirty-two did not meet the expectations at higher concentrations. Lower concentrations of fecal samples were excluded from this analysis. Again, the fecal samples were considered as challenge samples and the results were provided to assist participants in their continuous efforts to improve their performance and not to evaluate their performance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We report an inter-laboratory comparison of analytical laboratories involved in the quantification of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) collected by sampling organisations from industrial stacks (e.g. waste incinerators). Four reference solutions were prepared containing nominally 10 ng/ml, 50 ng/ml, 200 ng/ml and 500 ng/ml of naphthalene, benzo[a]anthracene, chrysene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene and dibenzo[a,h]anthracene prior to despatch to five analytical laboratories with quantification requested in accordance with ISO 11338-2. Across four of the laboratories (the 5th returned unusable data), significant deviations from the reference concentrations were found frequently in excess of the benchmarks of 37 %—from the validation data in ISO 11338-2—and 21 %—from the Environment Agency for England’s Monitoring Certification Scheme. Also, much of the variance was systemic in nature indicating a possible issue with the quality of some of the stock solutions used by the laboratories for calibration. Whilst more proficiency testing would be welcomed to monitor and improve performance, this should be provided in addition to more support for analytical laboratories. A key mechanism of support is the standards themselves and there is a timely opportunity in that ISO/TC 146/SC 1 are due to revise ISO 11338. Possible improvements include full validation of high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry methods (to better understand what performance can reasonably be expected from laboratories), a requirement to correct results to individual laboratory PAH extraction efficiency, and a required uncertainty stipulated for the overall method (also aiding setting pass/fail criteria for proficiency testing).",

    "abstract": "Abstract Uncertainty intervals for many measurement results are typically reported as symmetric intervals around the measured value. However, at large standard uncertainties (&gt; approx. 15 %–20 %), it is necessary to consider asymmetry of the uncertainty intervals. Here, an expression for calculating uncertainty intervals handling asymmetry when the relative standard uncertainty is independent of the measurand level is presented. The expression is based on implementation of a power transformation ( $${x}^{B}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:msup> <mml:mrow> <mml:mi>x</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> <mml:mi>B</mml:mi> </mml:msup> </mml:math> ) for transformation of measurement results in order to achieve results that have a symmetric and approximate normal distribution. Uncertainty intervals are then calculated in the transformed space and back-transformed to the original space. The transformation includes a parameter, B , that needs to be optimized, and this can be based on real results, modelling of results, or on judgement. Two important reference points are B equal to 1 that corresponds to an approximate normal distribution of the original measurement results, and B approaching 0 that corresponds to an approximate log-normal distribution of the original measurement results. Comparisons are made with uncertainty intervals calculated using other expressions where it is assumed that measurement results have a normal distribution or a log-normal distribution. Implementation of the approach is demonstrated with several examples from chemical analysis.",

Acceptance implies redefinition of the dalton exactly in terms of the kilogram. The redefined, exact dalton is useless in mass spectrometry, and hence, a new quantity for the carbon-12 reference mass would have to be established—against the principle of Ockham’s razor. In order to remove the roots of this awkward concept, the kilogram based on the Planck constant, and the mole, consisting of a particular number of entities equal to the inexactly determined numerical value of gram-to-dalton mass ratio, should be included in the new SI system. Some controversies related to the concept of mole have been also briefly outlined.",

    "abstract": "The historic city of Istanbul, known for where the East meets the West, became the meeting place for the global proficiency testing (PT) and external quality assurance (EQA) community for 4 days in October 2011. This was the 7th international PT workshop on Proficiency Testing in Analytical Chemistry, Microbiology and Laboratory Medicine organized by the EURACHEM Proficiency Testing Working Group in association with EQALM and CITAC. The workshop was supported locally by several Turkish organizations including the Middle East Technical University (METU), the Petroleum Research Center, EURACHEM-Turkiye, TUBITAK UME and TURKAK. The wonderful setting on the coast of the Sea of Marmara provided the perfect location for this successful workshop which once again provided an excellent opportunity for providers, users and regulators of PT/EQA to come together to discuss a wide range of key issues across the three disciplines of analytical chemistry, microbiology and laboratory medicine. The 233 delegates attending from 54 different counties ensured a truly global perspective. Since the last (6th) PT workshop held in Rome during October 2008, there have been a number of developments in the field of proficiency testing, one of the most notable being the publication of ISO/IEC 17043, the new international standard for the competence of PT/EQA providers, addressing the requirements for the development and operation of PT/EQA schemes. This new standard has been adopted by the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) as the requirements against which PT/ EQA providers should be accredited. With the publication and its subsequent adoption by ILAC, this has led to an increase in the number of PT/EQA providers being accredited around the world. This workshop, therefore, specifically addressed the experiences of implementing ISO/IEC 17043 both from the views of the PT/EQA providers and the accreditation bodies. In addition to addressing the implementation of ISO/IEC 17043, this workshop focused on further developments in performance assessment in microbiology and qualitative schemes, the status and needs of PT/EQA in developing areas of the world and advancements in preand postanalytical PT/EQA. These important topics addressed at this workshop were explored and discussed through a series of lectures and working group discussions. The diverse range of international delegates attending from different sectors provided a beneficial environment for the cross-fertilization of ideas. The workshop was enriched further with 52 poster contributions covering a wide range of topics and experiences concerned with PT/EQA. In conjunction with the workshop, training sessions on ‘‘Establishing Traceability and Uncertainty of Assigned Values’’ and ‘‘Assisting Participants to Assess/Estimate Their Measurement Uncertainty Using PT Results’’ were provided. This latest workshop once again proved a great success thanks to the hard work of the local organizers, the quality of the presentations and posters and just as importantly the active participation of all the delegates leading to lively debate and fruitful discussions. We are pleased to provide the papers on many of the presentations, posters and working group discussions in this Topical Focus on PT/ EQA issue of the Journal. B.

    "abstract": "Abstract To analyze and statistically compare common errors in the evaluation of measurement uncertainty in medicine and health field, using literature research and comparison with national standards, in order to understand the current status of measurement uncertainty evaluation in the medicine and health field. Using Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) as the sample population, Stratified Proportional Sampling (PPS) was used to extract journal articles related to measurement uncertainty in the field of medicine and health. The articles were compared with the Eurachem/CITAC Guide QUAM to analyze measurement uncertainty errors. Academic attention to measurement uncertainty in the field of medicine and health in the CNKI literature database has shown explosive growth since 2005. Seven common errors in measurement uncertainty evaluation were identified. None of the 30 journal articles analyzed were error-free, with a total error rate of 44 %. The error rate for ignorance of blank uncertainty was 87 %, improper evaluation of standard curve was 67 %, improper significant figures were 60 %, and insufficient information for Type B evaluation was 50 %. The error rate for provincial and higher-level institutions was 48 %, while the error rate for institutions below the provincial level was 43 %. The difference between the two error rates was not statistically significant ( p = 0.523). There is an urgent need to improve the rationality of measurement uncertainty evaluation in medicine and health field, and to strengthen the education and academic communication through national and international cooperation.

    "abstract": "Safety issues related to the design, production and distribution of simulated specimens for microbiology external quality assessment (EQA) have occupied scheme organisers for many years. Since the anthrax attacks in Washington, USA in October 2001, there has been heightened awareness in the public domain regarding the transport of infectious substances. For instance, in direct response to the anthrax incident in the US, microbiology institutes in the UK that handle dangerous pathogens (like the Health Protection Agency) are registered with the national police force and are inspected regularly to ensure compliance with current legislation covering the control of these pathogens. The fear of a complete ban on the movement of infectious substances following the anthrax incident has not yet been realised, but remains a serious risk. Many countries such as the UK, USA, and Australia have introduced measures for the control, transportation, and health and safety aspects of handling and distribution of infectious materials. The national postal services of many countries do not accept infectious materials by mail. There are a limited number of courier services willing to transport dangerous goods, especially division 6.2 (infectious substances) and these services are costly. Measures can be implemented by scheme organisers to ensure best practice; for instance, by having sufficient and trained staff, with knowledge, expertise and use of computerised systems in the shipping/export department. Ensuring compliance with national and international health and safety legislation by providing safety data sheets and by carrying out product risk assessments is required to ensure transparency and to demonstrate duty of care. Organisers of microbiology EQA face uncertainty about the future survival of schemes in the current climate. It is imperative that practices and procedures are put into place that meet with the legislation and enable us to continue to support quality in laboratory medicine.",

    "abstract": "In order to reduce analysis cost and save samples, the homogeneity study of two titanium-certified reference materials was combined with the interlaboratory characterisation of that material. Samples were selected using a random-stratified sampling scheme and were sent to nine and 11 laboratories, respectively. The data were normalised to screen for trends in the production sequence, outliers and normality of the distribution of sample means. The non-normalised data were screened for outlying variances, and the uncertainty of homogeneity was evaluated using two-way analysis of variance. The uncertainty contributions determined were in all cases significant, but did usually not dominate the uncertainty of the assigned value. The findings were confirmed by a homogeneity study with a limited scope on one of the two materials. While the assessment of homogeneity using the approach was successful, the goal of reducing the consumption of samples and reducing analytical cost was only partially realised: a similar number of samples were consumed and 5 % – 10 % lower analytical cost than in a classical, separate homogeneity and characterisation study set-up was incurred.",
