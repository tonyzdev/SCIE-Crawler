    "abstract": "To illustrate the potential of mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSC-Exos) in mitigating septic lung injury by reducing the excessive formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a mouse model of septic lung injury was induced through cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The mice received intraperitoneal injections of MSC-Exos. Post injection, pathological alterations of the lung tissue were evaluated through HE staining, and the levels of inflammatory markers in each mouse group at various time points were assessed using ELISA kits. The presence of NETs markers in lung tissue (colocalization of CitH3 and MPO) was determined via immunofluorescence, and the levels of dsDNA in mouse serum were measured using a dsDNA kit. The findings indicated noticeable damage in the sepsis group postsurgically, whereas the severity of lung tissue damage was significantly diminished in mice of the MSC-Exos group. By the 72-h mark after the CLP procedure, there was an elevation in TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-10. Compared to the CLP group, the inflammatory factors in the serum of mice from the CLP + MSC-Exo group were higher at 12 and 24 h but decreased at the 72-h point. Furthermore, the fluorescence intensity of CitH3 and MPO and the dsDNA content increased in the CLP group mice over different time intervals, with MSC-Exos reversing these changes. In summary, MSC-Exos effectively suppressed sepsis-induced NETs formation and ameliorated lung injury.",

This is a prospective, multicenter study of the Register of Severe Asthma of the Region of Murcia (RE-ASGRAMUR) Group performed under routine clinical practice conditions. We present a series of 57 patients who completed at least 6 months of treatment with tezepelumab. The exacerbations decreased from a baseline mean of 2.63 in the previous year to a mean annual rate of 0.38 after 6 months of tezepelumab (85.6% decrease). The Asthma Control Test score increased by 5.3 points, and the Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score increased by 0.94 points. Regarding lung function, we obtained a significant increase of 188 mL in forced expiratory volume in 1 s and 166 mL in forced vital capacity. Finally, type-2 (T2) biomarkers, such as eosinophils and nitric oxide, showed a significant decrease. We compared the results in patients with or without previous biological treatment as well as in patients with or without allergy sensitization, and we did not obtain significant differences in any variable. Tezepelumab is an effective treatment for severe asthma, lessening exacerbations, controlling the disease, and improving quality of life and lung function in patients with and without high T2 biomarkers, regardless of previous biological treatment.",

    "abstract": "Background: Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) is a singularly grievous and life-threatening syndrome. Its pathogenesis is closely related to inflammatory response, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and ferroptosis. Cation transport regulator-like protein 1 (CHAC1), as a proapoptic factor, may be involved in apoptosis, oxidative stress, and ferroptosis. This study aimed to explore the role of CHAC1 in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced the human renal proximal tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells. Methods: HK-2 cells were challenged with LPS to construct a model of sepsis-induced AKI in vitro. The role of CHAC1 in the LPS-induced HK-2 cells was explored using Western blot assay, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), flow cytometry, and colorimetric assays. Additionally, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) was incubated with HK-2 cells to define deeply the relation between oxidative stress and apoptosis or ferroptosis. Results: The expression of CHAC1 was enhanced in the kidney tissues of mice with sepsis--induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), through the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE60088 microarray dataset), and in the LPS-induced HK-2 cells. The cell viability was significantly reduced by LPS treatment, which was at least partly restored by the transfection of siCHAC1#1 and siCHAC1#2 but not siNC. In addition, down-regulation of CHAC1 counteracted the LPS-induced reactive oxygen species level and malonaldehyde concentrations while restored the LPS-induced glutathione concentrations. Meanwhile, interference of CHAC1 neutralized LPS-induced apoptosis rate, and the relative level of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)/PARP, and cleaved caspase-3/caspase-3. In addition, silencing of CHAC1 recovered the LPS-induced enhanced protein level of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) whereas antagonized the LPS-induced relative protein level of ACSL4 and that of iron. Moreover, application of NAC inverted the effect of CHAC1 on apoptosis and ferroptosis in HK-2 cells. Conclusion: CHAC1 exacerbated ferroptosis and apoptosis by enhancing oxidative stress in LPS-induced HK-2 cells.",

This review aimed to verify the association of UPF with inflammatory diseases, especially allergic diseases. To identify relevant articles, an extensive literature search was conducted using the two most important search sites - PubMed and Google Scholar. Specific Medical Subject Headings (MeSHes) such as \"food additives and health,\" \"food additives and immune system,\" and \"food additives and diseases\" were used to conduct an advanced search. Emulsifiers have been, particularly, implicated in disrupting intestinal barrier function, modifying gut microbiota, and promoting inflammation, which may contribute to the development of food allergies and inflammatory diseases. While food additives serve various functions in the food industry, concerns regarding their impact on health, particularly in systemic autoimmune and metabolic conditions, have been raised. Common additives have been associated with allergic reactions, intolerances, and sensitivities.",

    "abstract": "Background: In the perioperative period, patients are exposed to many agents that may cause hypersensitivity reaction; so, finding the culprit drug is important for patient safety in the event of the need for repeat anesthesia. Aim: Our aim was to share demographic data, clinical features, and diagnostic tests of patients who developed perioperative hypersensitivity (POH) and in whom the culprit drug was identified. Methods: Patients evaluated for POH between 2016 and 2024 were retrospectively analyzed. Results of anesthesia notes, agents used in anesthesia, skin prick test, and intradermal test (IDT) to determine the culprit drug were examined. Patients were interviewed by telephone and questioned about their reanesthesia status. Results: The files of 167,688 patients were analyzed; 405 patients were referred and tested for POH and 330 patients were excluded from the study because they had no history of POH or the culprit drug could not be identified. The study was completed with 75 patients. POH developed during the induction of anesthesia (I) in 18, maintenance (M) in 34, and at the end (E) in 23 patients. The median age was 48, out of which 89.3% (n = 67) were females. Reactions developed during genitourinary system surgery in 33.3% (n = 25), ear-nose-throat surgery in 17.3% (n = 13), and abdominal surgery in 17.3% (n = 13); anaphylaxis developed in 56% (n = 42) (I: 9; M: 21; E: 12); cutaneous involvement in 73.3% (n = 55); cardiovascular involvement in 41.3% (n = 31), respiratory system involvement in 56% (n = 42), and gastrointestinal involvement in 4% (n = 3); Brown grade 1 in 44% (n = 33) and grade 3 in 38.7% (n = 29); Ring and Messmer classification, grade 1 in 44% (n = 33); and cardiac arrest in five patients. For the distribution of culprit drugs: neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) in 22.7%, opioids in 21.4%, hypnotics in 17.3%, and antibiotics in 14.6%. In four patients, multiple agents were determined. Skin prick test was positive in 35.1% and IDT positivity was found in 98.6%. Surgery was cancelled in 40% (n = 30), but it was determined that 50 patients (66.7%) underwent surgery after drug tests. All of them tolerated surgery. Conclusıon: A large number of patients were evaluated because we are a reference hospital. The most common culprit drug group in POH is NMBA; reanesthesia situations are safe after allergist evaluation.",

Nonetheless, the specific mechanisms by which THBS1 operates in pneumonia remain unclear. We treated 16HBE cells as an in vitro pneumonia model with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and conducted a series of experiments to examine markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. LPS induces an increase in THBS1 expression in 16HBE cells. Knockdown of THBS1 reversed LPS-induced release of inflammatory factors [tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β]. Knocking down THBS1 reversed the LPS-induced increase in ROS and MDA and the decrease in SOD and GSH-Px. Inhibition of LPS led to the reversal of NF-κB pathway activation in response to LPS. Suppression of THBS1 hindered the NF-κB signaling cascade, resulting in a decrease in inflammation and oxidative stress triggered by LPS.",

    "abstract": "Sesame is a traditional oilseed comprising essential amino acids. However, the presence of allergens in sesame is a significant problem in its consumption; thus, this study attempted to reduce these allergens in sesame oilseeds.The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of cold plasma processing on structural changes in proteins, and thereby the alteration of allergenicity in sesame milk. Method: Sesame milk (300 mL) was processed using atmospheric pressure plasma bubbling unit (dielectric barrier discharge, power: 200 V, and airflow rate: 16.6 mL/min) at different exposure times (10, 20, and 30 min).The efficiency of plasma-bubbling unit as measured by electron paramagnetic resonance in terms of producing reactive hydroxyl (OH) radicals proved that generation of reactive species increased with exposure time. Further, the plasma-processed sesame milk subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and differential scanning calorimetery analysis revealed that plasma bubbling increased the oxidation of proteins with respect to bubbling time. The structural analysis by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and circular dichroism revealed that the secondary structure of proteins was altered after plasma application. This change in the protein structure helped in changing the immunoglobulin E (IgE)-binding epitopes of the protein, which in turn reduced the allergen-binding capacity by 23% at 20-min plasma bubbling as determined by the sandwich-type enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. However, 30-min plasma bubbling intended to increase allergenicity, possibly because of increase in IgE binding due to the generation of neo epitopes.These changes proved that plasma bubbling is a promising technology in oxidizing protein structure, and thereby reducing the allergenicity of sesame milk. However, increase in binding at 30-min bubbling is to be studied to facilitate further reduction of the binding capacity of IgE antibodies.",

    "abstract": "Psoriasis is a prevalent inflammatory skin disease characterized by excessive proliferation and abnormal differentiation of keratinocytes, and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the epidermis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Tectorigenin is an active ingredient in traditional medicines and has anti-inflammatory activity. This research explored the effects of tectorigenin on the anti-inflammatory property, autophagy, and the underlying mechanisms in M5 ([IL-22, IL-17A, oncostatin M, IL-1α, and TNF-α])-stimulated HaCaT cells.The in vitro model of mixed M5 cytokines-stimulated HaCaT keratinocytes was established to investigate the phenotypic features in psoriasis. Cell viability was assessed by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, cell proliferative rate by EdU (5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine) assay, and autophagy was detected by immunofluorescence staining. After M5 exposure, the proliferative rate, protein expression of autophagy, and signaling activities of NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) were measured. The latter were quantitated using quantitative PCR and western blot, respectively. The inflammatory response was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Tectorigenin exerted a protective effect in ameliorating the hyperproliferation and inflammation of HaCaT keratinocytes induced by M5 cytokines. Furthermore, tectorigenin on keratinocytes seemed to inactivate NLRP3 inflammasome and inhibit cell proliferation and inflammation response via suppression of TLR4/NF-κB pathway.This study proves that tectorigenin may be a potential therapeutic candidate for psoriasis treatment in future.",

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic inflammation, airway obstruction, and lung damage, often triggered by cigarette smoke. Dysregulated autophagy and inflammation are key contributors to its progression. Although double-stranded RNA-binding protein Staufen homolog 1 (STAU1), a multifunctional protein primarily involved in mRNA transport and localization, is identified as a potential biomarker, its role in COPD pathogenesis remains unclear. This study investigates the effects of STAU1 knockdown on inflammation and autophagy in an in vitro COPD model. We found that STAU1 expression was significantly elevated in the in vitro COPD model. Knockdown of STAU1 led to a marked reduction in inflammation in cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced non-tumorigenic human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B). Additionally, STAU1 knockdown suppressed autophagy in CSE-induced BEAS-2B cells. Mechanistically, it inhibited the activation of the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase-mechanistic target of rapamycin (AMPK/mTOR) pathway. In summary, STAU1 knockdown inhibits inflammation and autophagy by modulating the AMPK/mTOR axis. Targeting STAU1 could provide new avenues for the treatment of COPD.",

Asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR), atopic dermatitis (AD), and allergic conjunctivitis (AC) have different prevalences and different risk factors in infancy. Although boys present allergies more often in childhood, it quickly changes during girls’ sexual development, leading to lifelong female predominance of allergic diseases. This can be explained by the influence of sexual hormones, different lifestyles adopted by men and women, microbiota diversity, diet distinctions, professional options, and adherence to treatment, among others. Gender-related aspects should become essential parameters in allergology to diagnostic and therapeutic stratification, associated with molecular, genetic, and epigenetic patterns. Longitudinal studies would be interesting to evaluate possible mechanisms underlying these differences in prevalence. Sex- and gender-specific observations beyond 14 years of age are scarce and further allergic multimorbidity studies in different populations, especially in adults, are necessary.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: The prevalence of allergic diseases is increasing worldwide, affecting about 30% of the population in low to middle-income countries. Research trends on allergic diseases within rural pediatric populations of Latin American countries is scarce. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of allergic diseases (allergic rhinitis, asthma, and atopic dermatitis) and their associated factors using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood-III (ISAAC-III) questionnaire in school-aged children from two rural municipalities in Colombia.Materials and methods: This is a cross-sectional study. The ISAAC-III questionnaire was applied to school-aged children attending elementary schools in the municipalities of Soracá and Palmas del Socorro during 2018. The questionnaires were applied to adolescents aged 13–14 years and the parents of 6–7 years old children. Associations were estimated via bivariate and multivariate analysis. Results: Among 261 school-aged children (58.2% adolescents), the prevalence of allergic dis-eases was: allergic rhinitis 11.49% (95% CI: 8.05–15.78), asthma 8.81% (95% CI: 5.82–12.7), and atopic dermatitis 6.13% (95% CI: 3.69–9.53). Associated factors for allergic rhinitis included: female sex (PR: 2.68, 95% CI: 1.17–5.26), asthma (PR: 4.69, 95% CI: 1.96–8.31), atopic dermatitis (PR: 3.55, 95% CI: 1.09–7.83), and higher maternal education (PR: 4.16, 95% CI: 1.45–8.25).Conclusions: The prevalence of allergic diseases in this rural pediatric population was lower compared with that of the previous reports from urban populations. Associated factors found in this study support previous studies. Research addressing modifiable environmental associ-ations is so far scarce in Latin America; further studies are needed to reduce the burden of these diseases in rural populations.",

    "abstract": "Background: The purpose of this meta-analysis is to systematically evaluate the efficacy of probiotics on allergic rhinitis (AR). Methods: Collecting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with probiotics as intervention measures for AR, two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted the data and evaluated the methodological quality of the included studies, and used RevMan 5.3 software for meta-analysis to observe the effects of probiotics on Rhinitis Quality of Life (RQLQ) scores, Rhinitis Total Symptom Scores (RTSS), blood eosinophil count, total and antigen-specific serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels by using the fixed- or the random-effects model to calculate the pooled risk for significant heterogeneity. Results: A total of 2708 patients were included in 30 RCTs. Meta-analysis results showed that the RQLQ global scores (mean difference [MD] = −9.43; P &lt; 0.00001), RQLQ nasal scores (MD = −1.52; P = 0.03), and RTSS nasal scores (MD = −1.96; P = 0.02) significantly improved in the probiotic group when compared with those in the placebo group. There was no significant difference in blood eosinophil count (MD = −0.09; P=0.82), RQLQ eye scores (MD = −1.45; P = 0.07), RTSS global scores (MD = −2.24; P = 0.26), RTSS eye scores (MD = −0.39; P = 0.31), total and antigen-specific serum IgE levels (MD = −0.04; P = 0.7 and MD = −0.08; P = 0.81) between the probiotic and the placebo group. Conclusion: Compared with the placebo group, the quality of life and symptoms of patients with AR significantly improved in the probiotic group, thus providing a new potential method for the application of probiotics in AR. However, because of the limited evidence for the current study outcomes, the heterogeneity of research, and the differences in research results, more high-quality studies are needed to in the future.",

Humans usually contract anisakiasis through ingestion of raw or undercooked seafood containing Anisakis larvae. Once Anisakis has been ingested, patients may develop disease driven directly by Anisakis larvae and/or by allergic reaction due to this nematode. The capability of inducing allergic reactions depends on the expression of specific antigens by nematodes and host factors. This study aims to resume actual knowledge about AS and Anisakiasis with regard to epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment. Particular attention is paid to Anisakis allergens and their cross-reactivity on available diagnostic methods, and defining a diagnostic pathway for Anisakis allergy.

    "abstract": "Sepsis is a systemic organ dysfunction caused by infection, and the most affected organ is the lungs. Rosavin, a traditional Tibetan medicine, exerts an impressive anti--inflammatory effect. However, its effects on sepsis-related lung damage have not been investigated.This study aimed to investigate the effects of Rosavin on cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced lung injury.The sepsis mouse model was established by CLP, and the mice were pretreated with Rosavin to explore whether it contributed to the alleviation of lung injury. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) stain and lung injury score were used to assess the severity of lung injury. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α], interleukin-6 [IL-6], IL-1β, and IL-17A) were detected by ELISA. The number of neutrophils in BALF was detected using flow cytometry. The immunofluorescence assay was used to detect histone and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in lung tissues. Then, the western blot was performed to detect the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (extracellular regulated kinase [ERK], p-ERK, p38, p-p38, Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 [JNK1/2], and p-JNK1/2) in lung tissues.We found that Rosavin significantly attenuated sepsis-induced lung injury. Specifically, Rosavin significantly inhibited inflammation response by decreasing the secretion of inflammatory mediators. The level of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and MPO activity in CLP were decreased after administration with Rosavin. Moreover, the western blot showed that Rosavin could suppress NETs formation by inhibiting the MAPK/ERK/p38/JNK signaling pathway.These findings demonstrated that Rosavin inhibited NETs formation to attenuate sepsis-induced lung injury, and the inhibitory effect may be exerted via deregulation of the MAPK pathways.",

    "abstract": "Background: Asthma control is the goal of asthma management. A nationwide study on this aspect was launched by the Italian Society of Paediatric Allergy and Immunology (ControL’Asma study). Objective: To define variables associated with different asthma control grades in a nationwide population of asthmatic children and adolescents. Methods: This cross-sectional real-world study included 480 asthmatic children and adolescents (333 males, median age 11.2 years) consecutively enrolled in 10 third level pediatric allergy clinics. According to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) document, history, medication use, perception of asthma symptoms assessed by visual analog scale (VAS), clinical examination, lung function, childhood asthma control test (cACT)/asthma control test (ACT), and asthma control level were evaluated. Results: Considering GINA criteria, asthma was well controlled in 55% of patients, partly controlled in 32.4%, and uncontrolled in 12.6%. Regarding cACT/ACT, asthma was uncontrolled in 23.2%. Patients with uncontrolled asthma had the lowest lung function parameters and VAS scores, more frequent bronchial obstruction and reversibility, and used more oral and inhaled corticosteroids (CS). Conclusions: The ControL’Asma study, performed in a real-world setting, showed that asthma in Italian children and adolescents was usually more frequent in males. Asthmatic patients had an early onset and allergic phenotype with very frequent rhinitis comorbidity. Uncontrolled and partly controlled asthma affected about half of the subjects, and the assessment of asthma symptom perception by VAS could be a reliable tool in asthma management.",

    "abstract": "The current systematic review presented and discussed the most recent studies on acute cough in pediatric age. After that, the Italian Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology elaborated a comprehensive algorithm to guide the primary care approach to pediatric patients, such as infants, children, and adolescents, with acute cough. An acute cough is usually consequent to upper respiratory tract infections and is self-resolving within a few weeks. However, an acute cough may be bothersome, and therefore remedies are requested, mainly by the parents. An acute cough may significantly affect the quality of life of patients and their family.Several algorithms for the management of acute cough have been adopted and validated in clinical practice; however, unlike the latter, we developed an algorithm focused on pediatric age, and, also, in accordance to the Italian National Health System, which regularly follows the child from birth to all lifelong. Based on our findings, infants from 6 months, children, and adolescents with acute cough without cough pointers can be safely managed using well-known medications, preferably non-sedative agents, such as levodropropizine and/or natural compounds, including honey, glycerol, and herb-derived components.",

T-helper 2 lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils play an active role during the late-phase immune response after exposure to allergen.We aimed to investigate the usefulness of inflammatory parameters of neutro-phil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), eosinophil-to-neutrophil ratio (ENR), and eosinophil-to- lymphocyte ratio (ELR) as markers for distinction between intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis.This was a double-center, retrospective study. Patients were enrolled after diagnosed with AR according to the Allergic Rhinitis and Its Impact on Asthma guidelines. Individuals with an active infection were excluded. A cohort of healthy subjects acted as a control group. NLR, ENR, and ELR were calculated using the results obtained from the patients' complete blood count. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed for all studied variables.In all, 205 AR patients and 49 healthy individuals were included. AR patients had significantly higher levels of absolute eosinophils, ENR, and ELR, and significantly lower levels of NLR than the healthy controls (P < 0.05). A total of 160 (78%) patients with persistent AR had significantly higher levels of absolute eosinophils, ENR, and ELR, and significantly lower levels of NLR than patients with intermittent AR (P < 0.05).Currently, classification of severity of AR is based on the patient's anamnesis. It has been shown in this study that serum eosinophil levels in persistent AR patients could be used as traceable parameters in evaluating severity of the disease by looking at the proportions of ENR and ELR. We anticipate that in the future this issue would be supported by a larger number of studies.",

    "abstract": "Background: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of impaired vision as well as some earlier effects, such as reading and face recognition. Oxidative damage and inflammation of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are major causes of AMD. Additionally, autophagy in RPE cells can lead to cellular homeostasis under oxidative stress. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor X1 (NLRX1) is a mysterious modulator of the immune system function which inhibits inflammatory response, attenuates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and regulates autophagy. This study attempted to explore the role of NLRX1 in oxidative stress, inflammation, and autophagy in AMD. Methods: An in vitro model of AMD was built in human retinal pigment epithelial cell line 19 (ARPE-19) treated with H2O2. The cell viability, NLRX1 expressions, levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GHS), and ROS, concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), expressions of NLRX1, p62, LC3-II/LC3-I, FUNDC1, and NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome were expounded by cell counting kit-8, colorimetric, enzyme-linked immunosorbent serologic assay (ELISA), and Western blot assay. Results: H2O2 treatment notably reduced the relative protein expression of NLRX1. Meanwhile, H2O2 incubation decreased cell viability, diminished SOD and GSH concentrations, accompanied with the increased level of ROS, enhanced IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1 concentrations, and aggrandized the relative protein expression of p62 with reduced LC3-II/LC3-I ratio. Moreover, these results were further promoted with knockdown of NLRX1 and reversed with overexpression. Mechanically, silencing of NLRX1 further observably enhanced the relative levels of phosphorylated FUNDC1/FUNDC1, and NLRP3 inflammasome-related proteins, while overex-pression of NLRX1 exhibited inverse results in the H2O2-induced ARPE-19 cells. Conclusion: NLRX1 suppressed H2O2-induced oxidative stress and inflammation, and facilitated autophagy by suppressing FUNDC1 phosphorylation and NLRP3 activation in ARPE-19 cells.",

The effects of resveratrol on thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP)-mediated atopic march remain unclear. Purpose: To explore the potential role of resveratrol in TSLP-mediated atopic march. Methods: The atopic march mouse model was established by topical application of MC903 (a vitamin D3 analog). Following the treatment with resveratrol, airway resistance in mice was discovered by pulmonary function apparatus, and the number of total cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was counted. The histopathological features of pulmonary and ear skin tissues, inflammation, and cell infiltration were determined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of TSLP, immunoglobulin E, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 were measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The protein expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling-associated molecules (p-p65, p65, p-I kappa B kinase alpha (IκBα), IκBα, Nrf2, and TSLP) in lung and ear skin tissues were assessed by Western blot analysis. Results: Resveratrol attenuated airway resistance and infiltration of total cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils in both lung and ear skin tissues. Resveratrol ameliorates serum inflammatory markers in allergic mice. Moreover, the phosphorylation levels of NF-κB pathway-related proteins were significantly reduced by administration of resveratrol in allergic lung and ear skin tissues. Similarly, the protein expression of TSLP in both lung and ear skin tissues was reduced by resveratrol, and Nrf2, a protector molecule, was increased with resveratrol treatment. Conclusion: Resveratrol attenuates TSLP-reduced atopic march through ameliorating inflammation and cell infiltration in pulmonary and ear skin tissues by inhibiting the abnormal activation of NF-κB signaling pathway.",

However, there is a lack of biological markers for asthma, especially in children. This study aimed to analyze the changes in periostin levels in children with uncontrolled asthma after 12 months of optimized management. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the changes in symptoms, exacerbations, and other biomarkers after 12 months of follow-up. Methods: This was an observational, prospective study of children aged 5 to 14 with uncontrolled asthma who visited the Hospital Materno Infantil of Badajoz’s Allergy Unit between September 2015 and June 2016. At the first visit and after a 12-month follow-up, lung function, asthma control test (ACT/cACT), quality of life by PAQLQ (Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire), blood eosinophils, total and specific IgE, and serum periostin levels were assessed. Periostin levels were also analyzed in a control group. Results: After the 12-month follow-up, the percentage of symptoms, the proportion of patients with FEV1 &lt;80%, and the levels of blood eosinophils decreased, whereas ACT and PAQLQ increased. Children with uncontrolled asthma showed high serum periostin concentrations on their first visit (901.48 ng/ml), which decreased after 12 months (67.93 ng/ml) (p&lt;0.001). In the control group, periostin levels were 56.12 ng/ml. The sensitivity and specificity of periostin were 77.8% and 54.8%, respectively, for the diagnosis of controlled and uncontrolled asthma. Conclusion: Our study showed that periostin levels in children with uncontrolled asthma decreased with the correct treatment after asthma control.",

    "abstract": "Background: Asthma, a chronic inflammatory lung disease, is one of the leading causes of disability, demands on health resources, and poor quality of life. It is necessary to identify asthma-related risk factors to reduce the presence and development of symptoms. Objective: This study aimed to explore the association of multiple possible factors with asthma symptoms in two subpopulations, children, adolescents, and adults, in six cities in Colombia. Materials and methods: This was an observational analytical case-control study based on a cross-sectional study conducted as a secondary analysis of the prevalence of asthma and other allergic diseases in Colombia during 2009 and 2010. Weighted logistic regressions were conducted for each population. Results: Out of the 5978 subjects in the cross-sectional survey, 747 were identified as cases, and 3109 were identified as controls. The prevalence of asthma was 30.8% in the child and adolescent population and 14.7% in the adult population. Among the various factors studied, those associated with asthma symptoms in children/adolescents were: a family history of asthma (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.3–4.7) and rhinitis (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.1–3.6); acetaminophen consumption at least once a month (OR 3.6; 95% CI 2.1–6.2); and the presence of birds at home (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.1–3.8). Regarding food consumption: fruit consumption (OR 3.8; 95% CI 1.1–12.7). In adults, the factors that showed significant association were: a family history of allergic diseases (rhinitis OR 3.3; 95% CI 2.3–4.6), atopic eczema (OR 4.4; 95% CI 2.8–7.0), or asthma (OR 1.8;95% CI 1.3–2.6); acetaminophen consumption at least once a month (OR 2.0; 1.5–2.8); the presence of dogs at home (OR 1.4;95% CI 1.03–1.8), exposure to second-hand smoke (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.2–2.2), and exposure to exhaust fumes during the day (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.04–2.7). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that different cultural, environmental, and family factors are associated with asthma symptoms in children and adolescents, and these associations are evident in both males and females.",

The clinical course of the disease is characterized by fever and serositis attacks. While defects in the innate immune system are known to play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease, the impact of the adaptive immune system remains unclear. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to analyze the adaptive immune system cells in FMF patients and investigate their relationship with the disease. Methods: Our study includes 88 FMF patients with confirmed MEFV gene mutations. The demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, genetic profiles, treatment methods, and any accompanying diseases of the patients were thoroughly examined. Additionally, lymphocyte subpopulations were analyzed using flow cytometry, and inflammatory markers and immunoglobulin levels were evaluated. Results: Significant differences were observed in the distribution of adaptive immune system cells in FMF patients compared to the healthy reference group. In the analysis of lymphocyte subgroups, levels of CD3, CD4, CD19, CD16+56+, CD3CD4CD45RACD31, CD4+CD45RA+, CD8+CD45RA+, CD19+CD27+IgD+IgM+, CD19+CD27+IgD-IgM-, and CD19+CD38+CD21 were found to be lower compared to healthy individuals. Additionally, CD8, CD19+CD27-IgD+, and CD3/CD8/TCRGD cells were found to be higher. Moreover, in FMF patients with accompanying diseases, CD3, CD4, and CD19 values were statistically lower (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: This study reveals that adaptive immune system cells are affected in FMF patients, suggesting their significant role in the disease’s pathophysiology. Immunological evaluations should be prioritized in the management of FMF, enabling personalized treatment plans for more effective outcomes.",

A total of 190 children with bronchial asthma admitted to our hospital from August 2020 to August 2024 were retrospectively analyzed. The children were randomly divided into the training cohort (133 cases) and validation cohort (57 cases) in a ratio of 7:3. The children in the modeling set were divided into an allergic rhinitis group (n=44) and a nonallergic rhinitis group (n=89) depending on the presence or absence of concomitant allergic rhinitis. A total of 62 cases in 190 children with bronchial asthma had complications with allergic rhinitis, with an incidence of 32.63%. In the training cohort, compared with the children in the nonallergic rhinitis group, percentage of smokers in the household, C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC), and neutrophils/lymphocytes (NLR) were significantly higher in the allergic rhinitis group (P &lt; 0.05). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that smokers in the household; IgE; early use of antibiotics; and elevated CRP, WBC, and NLR were all risk factors for the complication of allergic rhinitis in children with bronchial asthma (P &lt; 0.05). A nomogram prediction model was constructed based on the above risk factors. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.919 (95% CI: 0.742–0.934) and 0.841 (95% CI: 0.773–0.902) for the training cohort and validation cohort, respectively. The Hosmer–Lemeshow test results of the training and validation cohorts were both P &gt; 0.05, suggesting a good model fit. The results of DCA showed that the training and validation cohorts had good threshold probability and clinical net benefit.

Ulcerative colitis is a nonspecific inflammatory bowel disease with unknown etiology. The potential of Aca.B as a therapeutic agent for ulcerative colitis is also unknown and remains an area for future investigation. In this study, we established both in vitro and in vivo models to investigate ulcerative colitis, utilizing Llipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated MODE-K cells and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice, respectively. The progression of ulcerative colitis was evaluated through histologic analysis, body weight monitoring, and assessment of disease activity index assessment. Furthermore, the effects on pyroptosis were detected through immunoblot analysis. We found that Aca.B treatment significantly ameliorated LPS-induced injury in MODE-K cells, as evidenced by increased cell viability and inhibition of inflammatory response. Moreover, the Aca.B treatment attenuated pyroptosis-specific protein expression, caspase-1 activation, and inflammatory cytokine secretion. In the animal study, Aca.B administration improved bowel symptoms in DSS-induced colitis mice model. This was accompanied by reductionsreduced inweight, colon shortening, inflammatory cell infiltration, and cell pyroptosis in vivo. Furthermore, Aca.B diminished the accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGE), resulting in a decrease in the expression of the receptor of AGE (RAGE) and downstream phosphorylated P65 expression. e.The inhibition of the inflammatory response and pyroptosis by Aca.B depends on suppressing the AGE/RAGE pathway. This study confirms the effects of Aca.B on pyroptosis and ulcerative colitis, providing a fundamental evidence for translating Aca.B into clinical applications as an anti-inflammatory medicine.",

Despite the growing interest in the connection between asthma and endometriosis, the current literature remains inconclusive. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to consolidate the available evidence and provide a comprehensive understanding of the association between asthma and endometriosis. Materials and Methods: We searched Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify studies that met our criteria. The random effects model was used to calculate the pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for individuals with endometriosis and non-endometriosis controls who have asthma. Additionally, we performed subgroup analyses based on geographic region to identify potential sources of heterogeneity. The research protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024567249). Results: Six eligible case-control studies involving 66,997 cases and 3,253,658 controls were used to examine the association between asthma and endometriosis. Through a comprehensive search and analysis of relevant studies, a significant association between asthma and endometriosis was identified (OR: 1.786, 95% CI: 1.511-2.111, P &lt; 0.001). The correlation showed significant heterogeneity in the study (I² = 75.709; P-value = 0.001), with geographic region identified as a significant factor contributing to this variation. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis demonstrates a significant link between asthma and endometriosis, highlighting the need for comprehensive management that addresses both conditions.",

    "abstract": "Histamine, classified as a biogenic amine, plays a crucial role in both pro-inflammatory and immune regulatory processes, thereby establishing itself as a key mediator in allergic diseases and immune responses. This review provides an exhaustive analysis of the structure, function, and regulation of histamine, with particular emphasis on its interaction with four receptor subtypes: histamine H1 receptor (H1R), histamine H2 receptor (H2R), histamine H3 receptor (H3R), and histamine H4 receptor (H4R), all of which are instrumental in mediating a variety of physiological processes, including neurotransmitter release, modulation of immune responses, and gastric acid secretion. The review explores intracellular signaling pathways mediated by the activation of these receptors, highlighting the complex cascades involved in immediate- and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. It also examines the broad spectrum of histamine-induced complications, focusing on their effects on the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems, and emphasizes histamine’s potential to cause vascular dysfunction and other pathological changes. Furthermore, the role of histamine in inflammation and immune responses is explored, particularly in the context of allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. The review also covers pharmacological interventions targeting histamine receptors, including the use of antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers, which are critical for the treatment of symptoms and the inhibition of the progression of histamine-related conditions. Finally, the review addresses emerging research and future directions, identifying potential areas for innovation and improved therapeutic strategies. This comprehensive overview not only deepens understanding of histamine’s multifaceted roles in health and disease, but also underscores the importance of developing advanced diagnostic tools and targeted treatments for histamine-associated disorders.",

    "abstract": "Allergic diseases are on the increase worldwide, incurring a high socioeconomic burden on patients, families, and healthcare systems. As a permanent cure for most allergies is still lacking, prevention is of paramount importance. So far, several strategies, including nutritional interventions, have been proposed to halt this phenomenon with inconclusive results. The use of partially hydrolyzed formulas (pHFs) for non-exclusively breastfed infants has been proposed by several scientific bodies; however, most have withdrawn this suggestion based on the concept of insufficient evidence. During the last few years, emerging evidence suggests that specific pHFs may reduce the risk of allergies in individuals at high risk for allergy development based on their heredity. In this article, we review the role of pHFs and propose that in non-exclusively breastfed infants at high-risk for allergy, the use of pHFs remains one of the most targeted interventions, as consistent data indicate a possible role in allergy prevention.",

    "abstract": "Background: Both articular and extra-articular structures are affected by rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic inflammatory rheumatic illness that results in severe joint destruction, disability, and death. To increase the response rate and provide RA patients more options, there is an unmet need for the development of innovative treatment drugs. Evaluation of cellular, cytokine, genomic, and transcriptome profiles that would predict therapeutic response to biologic or targeted disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) with various action modes is necessary for a customized therapy plan in RA. Owing to the development of new biologic medicines that target distinct mechanisms of action, the treatment algorithm for RA has undergone significant modification during the last one to two decades. More patients are now able to undergo biologic therapy early in the progression of their illness, thanks to the availability of less expensive biosimilars. Objective: To summarize the efficacy and safety of biologic or targeted syntheticb/ts DMARDs in RA treatment based on the publications in the past year. Material and Methods: We compiled the most recent findings from original research publications of 2024 about the effects of b/tsDMARDs on the treatment of RA. In addition, this review article also concluded the recent findings from original research publications of the year 2024 about the effects of b/tsDMARDs biosimilars for treating RA. Conclusion: This article summarizes the evidence and safety of biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) or targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs) in the management of RA, including those that target tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, B cells, T-cell co-stimulation, and Janus kinase (JAK) from original research articles published in 2024.",

Tripartite Motif Containing 22 (TRIM22) is a protein involved in various cellular processes, such as cell growth and inflammatory responses. However, the role and mechanism of TRIM22 in LN are still unclear. The aim of this study was to reveal the role of TRIM22 in LN and uncover the potential mechanisms. We discovered that TRIM22 is notably upregulated in renal tissues from patients with LN. Functionally, the knockdown of TRIM22 in lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice results in significant alleviation of LN symptoms, characterized by reduced proteinuria and improved renal function, as indicated by the lower serum levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. Additionally, the intervention markedly decreases the deposition of immune complexes in the kidneys, further supporting the therapeutic potential of targeting TRIM22. Mechanically, the depletion of TRIM22 inhibits the NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway in mice with LN, but collectively, the knockdown of TRIM22 alleviates inflammation and renal injury in mice with LN via the NF-κB/NLRP3 axis.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease, characterized by airway inflammation, hyperresponsiveness, and remodeling. Oxidative stress and autophagy play pivotal roles in asthma pathogenesis. Excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) worsens airway damage and inflammation, and impaired antioxidant defenses in patients with asthma further increase ROS production, leading to tissue damage. Environmental factors, such as allergens and air pollution, and inflammatory cells, such as macrophages and eosinophils, contribute to elevated ROS levels, thereby intensifying the disease. Autophagy, a key mechanism for eliminating damaged organelles and maintaining cellular homeostasis, plays a dual role in asthma. While autophagy activation mitigates oxidative stress, dysregulated or excessive autophagy worsens airway remodeling and inflammation. This review examines the interplay between oxidative stress and autophagy in asthma and discusses emerging therapeutic approaches targeting autophagy to improve disease outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Cashew nut (CN) allergy is becoming increasingly prevalent and represents a major cause of tree nut-induced anaphylaxis in Korean children. This study investigated the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of CN allergy in Korean children. Patients and methods: Sixty-four children with a history of CN ingestion, who underwent serum CN-specific immunoglobulin E (CN-sIgE) measurements from January 2013 to February 2023, were enrolled through a retrospective medical record review. The demographic characteristics, clinical profiles, and laboratory findings were evaluated. Result: Thirty-five patients had immediate-type reactions after exposure to CN (CN-allergic group), whereas 29 showed no symptoms after ingesting CN (CN-tolerant group). Over 60% of patients in the CN-allergic group were allergic to ≥ 1 other tree nuts and 17.1% had peanut allergies. In the CN-allergic group, cutaneous symptoms were most common (94.1%), followed by respiratory (35.3%), gastrointestinal (32.4%), and cardiovascular (2.9%) symptoms. Anaphylaxis due to CN exposure was observed in 51.4% of patients in the CN-allergic group. The median CN-sIgE level of the CN-allergic group was significantly higher than that of the CN-tolerant group (5.5 kUA/L vs. 0.06 kUA/L, P &lt; 0.001). The optimal cutoff level for distinguishing the CN-allergic group from the CN-tolerant group was 0.55 kUA/L (sensitivity 94.29%, specificity 93.10%). Conclusion: Co-allergies to other tree nuts were common in children with CN allergy and more than 50% of patients with CN allergy experienced anaphylaxis. The optimal cutoff level for distinguishing between the CN-allergic and CN-tolerant groups was 0.55 kUA/L.",

The mother breastfed the infant from birth and had introduced only fruits and vegetables into his diet. After the first dose of Ferplex® (iron protein succinylate), the infant had an immediate moderate systemic reaction that required emergency care and treatment with intramuscular epinephrine. The drug was indicated for the treatment of acute anemia. Skin prick test and specific IgE were done, confirming sensitization to cow’s milk and egg proteins. It was determined that the baby was sensitized to cow’s milk proteins, without prior ingestion, and experienced an anaphylactic reaction after taking Ferplex®, a pharmaceutical product that contains casein as part of its active ingredients. The presence of succinylated casein was confirmed, without pertinent information on the amount in the technical sheet or package insert. Existing pharmaceutical industry regulations should be modified in order to declare food allergens present in excipients and in active ingredients to avoid potential risks for allergic patients. A detailed food history is important in young children who are gradually being introduced to new foods, and in those that have not yet been introduced, recordings should be made to avoid this type of allergic reaction.",

    "abstract": "In recent times, the medical science has developed by leaps and bounds, however, the molecular mechanism of pediatric pneumonia is still unclear. Although prior researches have shown that methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) is up-regulated in a variety of inflammatory diseases, its role and mechanism has been rarely studied in pediatric pneumonia, and need to be defined elaborately.In this study, the related molecular mechanism of METTL3 on inflammation and cell apoptosis in a pediatric pneumonia was investigated.Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot assays were employed to examine the mRNA and protein expression level of METTL3 and EZH2 in peripheral blood monocytes from pediatric pneumonia patients or cell model (WI-38). Then, qPCR and ELISA assay were applied to verify the inflammatory response in LPS-treated WI-38 cell lines after knockdown of METTL3. Besides, MTT cell viability assays, flow cytometry, and western blot assays were applied to examine the cell viability and cell apoptosis of LPS-treated WI-38 cell after knockdown of METTL3. Further, the western blot assays were employed to examine the protein expression levels of p-JAK2, JAK2, p-STAT3, STAT3, and EZH2 in LPS-treated WI-38 cell after knockdown of METTL3. Finally, ELISA and western blot were applied to verify the inflammatory response and cell apoptosis of LPS-treated WI-38 cell after knockdown of METTL3 and overexpression of EZH2.In this study, the results showed that METTL3 and EZH2 were highly expressed in pediatric pneumonia patients and cell models (WI-38), respectively. Besides, downregulation of METTL3 inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory response and cell apoptosis. Then, the fact that METTL3 regulates the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway through EZH was proved. Furthermore, downregulation of METTL3 inhibits inflammation and apoptosis through EZH2.This study found that METTL3 promotes inflammation and cell apoptosis in a pediatric pneumonia model by regulating EZH2.",

The model rats were then administrated with MCPs. Defecation frequency, fecal water content and abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) score were then recorded. Pathologic changes in the colonic tissues were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Inflammation was detected by ELISA and qRT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry was used to assess intestinal mucosal permeability.First, IBS-D of mice wasIBS-D ratsmice exhibited many abnormal clinical manifestations, including increased frequency of defecation, fecal water content, and abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) score. Second, the mice were administrated with MCPs, which reduced frequency of defecation, fecal water content, and AWR score, and 100-mg/kg MCPs indicated therapeutic effect on IBS-D mice equivalent to rifaximin. Moreover, MCPs also ameliorated pathologic changes in the colonic tissues of IBS-D mice. Third, inflammatory response in IBS-D mice was also suppressed by MCPs through up-regulation of Interleukin (IL)-10, and down-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Interleukin(IL)-1β, and IL-6. MCPs enhanced levels of occludin (OCLN) and zona occludens protein-1 (ZO-1) in IBS-D mice to improve intestinal mucosal permeability. Finally, phosphorylation of p65 in IBS-D mice was reduced by MCP treatment.MCPs ameliorated intestinal permeability and repressed intestinal inflammation to attenuate IBS-D by inactivating nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling.",

UA was also injected intraperitoneally. Lung tissues in each group were examined by histological analysis. Autophagy, inflammation, and oxidative stress were assessed by enzyme-linked--immunosorbent serologic assay and immunoblot analysis. Moreover, pyrophosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress were also evaluated by immunoblot analysis.UA alleviated lung inflammation in mice, and inhibited cell pyrophosis. In addition, UA A relieved both oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Furthermore, we found that UA alleviated pneumonia damage by inducing protective autophagy.UA induced protective autophagy to alleviate inflammation, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum stress in pediatric pneumonia.",

Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) has been reported to reduce pulmonary injury and pulmonary fibrosis.The present study investigated the specific role of SIRT3 in BPD by establishing hyperoxia-induced BPD rat and cell models. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to observe pathological changes in lung tissues.The expression levels of SIRT3 and forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1), as well as its acetylation levels, were detected in hyperoxia-induced lung tissues and cells by Western blot analysis and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Levels of reactive oxygen species, superoxide dismutase, and malondialdehyde were assessed by using biochemical kits. Following SIRT3 overexpression, the levels of inflammatory cytokines were assessed by RT-qPCR. Apoptosis was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nickend labeling (TUNEL) and Western blot analysis. Upon FOXO1 knockout, cell inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis were evaluated again.Compared to the control group, the SIRT3 and FOXO1 expression levels were decreased and the FOXO1 acetylation levels were increased in hyperoxia-induced lung tissues and cells. In addition, SIRT3 reduced hyperoxia-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in A549 cells, and inhibited FOXO1 acetylation to activate FOXO1. However, FOXO1 knockdown reversed the effects of SIRT3 overexpression in hyperoxia-induced A549 cells.SIRT3 relieved alveolar epithelial cell damage caused by BPD via deacetylation of FOXO1, suggesting that SIRT3 could be a therapeutic target in BPD.",

However, the results on the effect of their supplementation during infancy to the incidence of allergic rhinitis or asthma, are conflicting.The study was designed to bring to light the potential effects of pro-, pre-, and synbiotics supplementation in early childhood with regard to the future occurrence of allergic diseases.Method: The results of randomized controlled trials were searched for in several medical data bases. The study protocol was prepared in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and applied a Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. Two writers were designed to perform studies selection.Results: Eleven randomized controlled trials, among 1659 children (525 in the probiotic group, 342 in prebiotic group, 128 in synbiotic group and 833 in control groups) were analyzed. There was no difference in asthma risk development between the groups that received probiotics or placebo. We observed lower risk of asthma in children receiving prebiotic and synbiotic than in control groups.Conclusion: The current study indicates that probiotics supplementation in the first months after birth does not decrease the risk of asthma development in the first years of life in high-risk children, although prebiotics and synbiotics may be the potential preventive factors that reduce the incidence of asthma in children.",

    "abstract": "Although there is increasing evidence showing that infants with viral bronchiolitis exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity, a core uncertainty shared by many clinicians is with regard to understanding which patients are most likely to benefit from bronchodilators such as albuterol. Based on our review, we concluded that older infants with rhinovirus (RV) bronchiolitis, especially those with a nasopharyngeal microbiome dominated by Haemophilus influenzae; those affected during nonpeak months or during non-respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) predominant months; those with wheezing at presentation; those with clinical characteristics such as atopic dermatitis or a family history of asthma in a first-degree relative; and those infants infected with RSV genotypes ON1 and BA, have the greatest likelihood of benefiting from albuterol. Presently, this patient profile could serve as the basis for rational albuterol administration in patients with viral bronchiolitis, at least on a therapeutic trial basis, and it could also be the starting point for future targeted randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on the use of albuterol among a subset of infants with bronchiolitis.",

The number of children suffering from adenovirus pneumonia (AP) has significantly increased. AP can be accompanied by Mycoplasma pneumoniae in children. This study aimed to investigate the association of M. pneumoniae and identify the risk factors for coinfection on hospitalized patients with AP. The patients were classified into two groups by etiologic analysis (single AP and AP with M. pneumoniae coinfection groups). The clinical manifestations, clinical medication, and laboratory and imaging findings of the two groups were compared and analyzed. The coinfection group (n = 125) had a significantly longer duration of fever than the single AP group (n = 171; P = 0.03). Shortness of breath (P = 0.023) and pulmonary imaging findings, such as pulmonary consolidation, atelectasis, pleural effusion, and multilobe lesions (P < 0.05), were more common in the coinfection group. The patients with coinfection had more severe symptoms, significantly longer hospitalization time and an increased proportion of using glucocorticoids and/or immunoglobulin needing oxygen inhalation (P < 0.05). The incidence of AP with M. pneumoniae coinfection is high. The prolonged fever duration and pulmonary imaging findings could be used as prediction factors to predict M. pneumoniae coinfection in children with AP. Patients with AP coinfected with MP may easily develop severe illness. Hence, a reasonable change in the treatment is necessary.",

There is an urgent requirement to clarify the underlying mechanism of pediatric pneumonia and definite its potential therapeutic targets. Tri-domain protein 27 (TRIM27) is one of the TRIM protein family members which widely participated in multiple cellular processes.To assess whether TRIM27 protects against pediatric pneumonia.A lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation injury model was constructed. The level of TRIM27 in LPS-induced cells was examined. The effects of TRIM27 in cell apoptosis and inflammatory response was evaluated. Moreover, the involvement of TLR4/NF-κB pathway were detected by Immunoblot.We established a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation injury model. Our data confirmed that LPS-treated WI-38 cells demonstrated a down-regulated expression of TRIM27. Overexpression of TRIM27 effectively reduced apoptosis and up-regulated the inflammatory factors in LPS-treated WI-38 cells. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway acted as a key point in LPS-mediated inflammation injuries, and overexpression of TRIM27 remarkably inhibited the activity of TLR4/NF-κB pathway, indicating the anti-inflammatory effect of TRIM27.In conclusion, TRIM27 protects WI-38 cells against LPS-induced inflammation injuries by inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB pathway.",

    "abstract": "Background: As a systemic inflammatory reaction, sepsis is associated with various organ dysfunctions. The capillary leakage and the imbalance between T helper 17 and regulatory T (Th17/Treg) cells are associated with sepsis-induced lung injury. Taxifolin (TXL) has been found to play a vital role in regulating this diverse disease. However, the detailed functioning and mechanism of TXL in regulating sepsis-induced lung capillary leak remain elusive. Methods: Balb/c mice were used to establish sepsis-induced lung injury model through administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The structure of lung tissues was observed by using hematoxylin &amp; eosin staining. Protein level and total cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were measured by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit and hematimetry assay, respectively. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were employed to detect the level of inflammatory cytokines. The content of Th17 and Treg cells were measured by flow cytometry analysis. Western blot assay was used to determine the protein level of retinoid-related orphan receptor-γt (RORγt), Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), phospho(p)-JAK2, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and phospho(p)-STAT3. Results: Taxifolin effectively prolonged the survival period of sepsis mice and alleviated LPS-induced lung injury in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, TXL reduced LPS-induced increase in protein levels and T cell content in BALF, and effectively restored the wet:dry ratio of lung tissue and tissue permeability. Treating with TXL notably inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by sepsis and influenced the balance between Th17 and Treg cells. Furthermore, TXL treatment suppressed the activation of JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion: Our findings revealed that TXL alleviated sepsis-induced capillary leak in the lungs of mice by regulating JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Asthma, characterized by dysfunction of airway epithelial cells, is regarded as a chronic inflammatory disorder in the airway. Ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8) belongs to ubiquitin proteasome system and mediates the stability of E3 ligases. The anti-inflammatory effect of USP8 has been widely investigated in distinct diseases, while the role of USP8 in asthma remains elusive. Firstly, human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) were treated with lipopolysaccharide, which reduced the cell viability of BEAS-2B and induced the secretion of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Moreover, the expression of USP8 was downregulated in BEAS-2B post lipopolysaccharide treatment. Secondly, overexpression of USP8 enhanced cell viability of lipopolysaccharide-treated BEAS-2B, and reduced the LDH secretion. USP8 overexpression also attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced upregulation of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β in BEAS-2B. Thirdly, lipopolysaccharide treatment promoted the expression of NLRP3 (NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3), N-terminal domain of gasdermin D (GSDMD-N), caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18 in BEAS-2B, which was inhibited by USP8 overexpression. Lastly, USP8 overexpression decreased the phosphorylation of NF-κB, while it increased the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT in lipopolysaccharide-treated BEAS-2B. In conclusion, USP8 inhibited lipopolysaccharide-triggered inflammation and pyroptosis in human bronchial epithelial cells by activating PI3K/AKT signaling and inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway.",

APDS2 is defined as a primary antibody deficiency, developmental abnormalities within the B and T lymph cell compartments, and immune dysregulation. The genetic defect of APDS2 is shared with that of the SHORT syndrome, characterized by short stature, joint hyperextensibility, ocular depression, Rieger anomaly, and delayed tooth eruption. LOF variants in an intronic splice site (c.1425+1G.C/A/T) in the PI3KR1 gene have been identified in patients affected with both APDS2 and SHORT syndrome. Herein, we report a novel c.1644-1648del (p.Asp548Glufs*6) variant in a pediatric patient with the APDS2-related immunodeficiency, who presents with mild phenotypic features of the SHORT syndrome, congenital chest wall deformity, and IgE-mediated food allergy. The same variant was also identified in the patient’s hitherto asymptomatic mother, implicating an incomplete penetrance. Regular monitoring by a multidisciplinary team under the pediatric clinical immunologist’s supervision to implement appropriate diagnostic procedures and treatment modalities is of paramount importance. Further studies are required to better define the genotype-phenotype correlation in patients with the PIK3R1 gene mutations and to better delineate the mutual relationship between APDS2 and the SHORT syndrome.",

The mechanisms of AR are complex and considered generally caused by the immune tolerance deficiency. Regulatory B cells (Bregs) are immunosuppressive cells that can modulate immune responses by the secretion of IL-10, IL-35, and tumor growth factor-β (TGF-β) and via the interaction of membrane surface molecules. However, Bregs are numerically deficient and/or dysfunctional in airway allergic diseases such as AR and allergic asthma, and the related mechanisms remain unclear. In this review, we summarize the role of Bregs in AR pathogenesis and highlight the importance of Bregs in maintaining immune tolerance. It is believed that further research on Bregs will contribute to developing new treatments and finding specific biomarkers that could help to predict disease progression.",

Climate change affects the social and environmental determinants of good health, such as clean air, stable ecosystems, safe drinking water, and sufficient and safe food, and they seem to be closely related to air pollution. Objectives: This article aims to review the evidence of how extreme weather events and indoor and outdoor pollution are associated with insufficient lung growth in early life, changes in lung function, and the increase in respiratory infections, favoring the development of allergic respiratory diseases. Material and Methods: Non-systematic review of English, Spanish, and Portuguese articles published in the last ten years in databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, and SciELO. The terms used were air pollution OR climate changes OR smoke, AND health OR allergic disease. Results: Climate change and air pollution are the leading contributors to health emergencies around the world. On a global scale, those most at risk of adverse health effects associated with climate change include children, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups. Climate change and air pollution have adverse impacts on respiratory allergies, and the mechanisms are complex and interactive. Conclusion: Health professionals must receive information and education necessary to establish effective mitigation and adaptation strategies to minimize the effects of climate changes on the respiratory health of their patients.",

The main aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of FA in school-aged children in the Kingdom of Bahrain. A cross-sectional design was used on a randomized sample of school-aged children in Bahrain. An electronic questionnaire inquiring about demographic data and history of FA and its details was administered through school administrations between October and December 2020. Data was obtained from 1370 participants, comprising 822 males and 548 females. The prevalence of a reported history of FA in school-aged children in Bahrain was calculated as 15.5%. Furthermore, 9.9% of children reported a current FA. The most common experienced symptoms were skin symptoms followed by gastrointestinal symptoms. Moreover, 7% of children reported experiencing anaphylaxis, low blood pressure, or shock. This research concluded that the reported prevalence of FA history among school-aged children in Bahrain was higher than that observed in other studies estimating at 15.5%, with 9.9% persisting up to the time of the study. The most common single food allergen was found to be egg. The findings of this study provide a baseline for future larger studies to obtain more in-depth results.",

    "abstract": "Dupilumab is a new biological drug approved for the treatment of type 2 inflammatory diseases, such as asthma. Dupilumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that acts against both interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 receptors. This study evaluated the time--dependent effect of dupilumab on asthma exacerbations and quality of life in adolescents with uncontrolled severe asthma.Five adolescents suffering from uncontrolled severe asthma and treated with dupilumab were recruited. All subjects were evaluated for 4, 12, and 24 weeks after the first dose of dupilumab. Outcome measures included lung function, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, asthma control and quality of life assessed by validated questionnaires (Asthma Control Test and Asthma Control Questionnaire).The quality of life improved quickly after 4 weeks of treatment and 80% of adolescents halved the dose of inhaled corticosteroids necessary to control asthma symptoms. These results were still maintained for 24 weeks after start of the therapy. None of the patients had any asthma exacerbation during the study period.Results of this study demonstrated that dupilumab was quickly effective to reduce asthma exacerbation and ameliorate quality of life in severe asthmatic adolescents.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) are defined by recurrent infections, allergies, autoimmunity, and malignancies. Neurologic symptoms are one of the major components of some immunodeficiency syndromes, such as Ataxia-Telangiectasia (AT), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency, which are considered as the primary involvement. Various pathological mechanisms, DNA repair disorders, metabolic abnormalities, and autoimmune phenomena have also been linked with neurological conditions. Materials and method: We retrospectively assessed the neurological involvement in 108 patients out of 6000 with PID in this study. Results: The female/male ratio of the cases was 49/59, and the median age was 13 years (min = 1; max = 60). Neurological problems were detected at a median age of 7 years (min = 0.5; max = 30). Di George Syndrome (DGS) and CVID (common variable immunodeficiency) were the most common diseases in our cohort (n = 31, 30% and n = 30, 27%, respectively). The most frequent outcomes were cognitive delay (n = 63, 58%), epilepsy (n = 25, 23%), and ataxia (n = 20, 18%). Central nervous system involvement was found in 99% of the patients (n = 107), and peripheral nervous system complication was found in only one patient with CVID and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CDIP). Cranial MRI was found to be abnormal in 74% (n = 80) of the patients. MRI findings included cerebellar atrophy (n = 33, 34%), white matter lesion (n = 27, 28.4%), cerebral atrophy (n = 21, 22.3%), gray matter lesion (n = 6, 6.3%), hydrocephalus (n = 5, 5,3%), and pituitary gland lesion (n = 3, 3.2%), intracranial hemorrhage (n = 3, 3%), intracranial vasculitis (n = 3, 2.7%), and arterio-venous malformation (n = 1, 0,9%). Primary involvement (a component of the disease) was 60% (n = 65), and secondary (infection or autoimmunity) and tertiary involvements (structural or incidental lesions) contributed 20% (n = 20) each in the patients. Conclusion: In this study, we describe the various neurologic findings of patients with PID. The neurologic presentation may represent the initial manifestation of certain types of PID. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent or reduce further neurologic damages.",

    "abstract": "The post-viral acute cough is the most common symptom in childhood. Consequently, the use of cough relievers is frequent. Many products for treating cough contain natural compo-nents. An ancient tradition has always established herbal medicine and honey as effective and safe means to relieve cough. Nevertheless, very few studies adequately investigated the real effectiveness and safety of natural products in treating acute cough. There is some evidence, provided by pediatric randomized controlled trials, about honey, one multicomponent product (containing Plantagolanceolata, Grindelia robusta, Helichrysum italicum, and honey), and Pelargonium sidoides. Other group of substances, including glycerol and isolated natural compounds, can help manage cough but robust evidence still lacks in children. There is an urgent need to perform rigorous studies that confirm the natural products’ efficacy and safety for relieving post-viral acute cough.Key points: Acute post-viral cough is prevalent in childhood and adolescence. There is a grow-ing interest concerning the use of natural remedies for post-viral cough. Many herbal medicines could be used satisfactorily for this issue.",

There were 262 (11.8%) challenge failures. The transfer to the emergency department was required 3 times (1.1%). None of the failed challenges resulted in death or hospitalization and 13.3% challenges did not require any treatment.Our findings confirm that food challenges can be performed safely in a specialized setting by well-trained personnel; all food challenge reactions, even the most serious, were reversible, thanks to a prompt recognition and treatment that generally did not worsen over time.",

The identified downregulation of lncRNA n337374 was validated using fluorescence RT-qPCR. LncRNA n337374-overexpressing DCs and RSV-exacerbated asthmatic mouse models were established. Airway hyper-reactivity and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were examined, and pathological changes in lung tissues were observed in mice. Surface molecules in DCs were detected by flow cytometry and RT-qPCR and the expression of CD86 and mitogen-activated protein kinases was determined by western blot.In an RSV-exacerbated asthmatic mouse model, the airway wall was thickened, luminal stenosis was observed, a large number of inflammatory cells were infiltrated in the lung tissue, lung function was impaired, and counts of inflammatory cells in the BALF were increased. The overexpression of lncRNA n337374 ameliorated these pathological changes and improved impaired lung function and inflammation in an asthmatic mouse model. In DCs co-cultured with RSV-infected human airway epithelial cells, CD86 expression was promoted and ERK was markedly phosphorylated. When lncRNA n337374-overexpressing DCs were used in the co-cultures, the expression of CD86 and phosphorylated ERK was decreased.The results suggest that lncRNA n337374 overexpression may suppress DC maturation by downregulating the CD86 and ERK pathway, subsequently relieving the symptoms of RSV-induced asthma. LncRNA n337374 may be a promising target in the treatment of RSV infection-induced asthma.",

At presentation, 15 patients were found sensitised to the offending food. Fish was the most frequent eliciting food, followed by cow's milk and egg. Tolerance acquisition was earlier for cow's milk, followed by egg and fish, while found not to be protracted in atypical cases. Resolution was not achieved in half of the fish subjects during the 10-year follow-up time. Sensitisation to food was not related to infantile eczema or culprit food, but was related to sensitisation to aeroallergens. In the long-term evaluation, persistence of the FPIES or aeroallergen sensitisation was significantly associated with an increased hazard risk of developing early asthma symptoms.Sensitisation to food was related neither to eczema or culprit food nor to tolerance acquisition but rather to the development of allergic asthma through aeroallergen sensitisation. In addition to an IgE profile at an early age, FPIES persistence may also trigger mechanisms switching FPIES cases to a T-helper 2 cells immune response later in life, predisposing to atopic respiratory symptoms; albeit further research is required.",

    "abstract": "Pneumonia is a kind of inflammatory disease characterized by pathogen infection of lower respiratory track. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the main bioactive component of Gram-negative bacteria responsible for inflammatory response. Recently, coniferyl aldehyde (CA) has been reported to play a crucial role because of its anti-inflammatory activity. However, the effect and mechanisms of CA in ameliorating symptoms of acute pneumonia remain unknown. Evaluating and identifying the value and exploring the mechanisms of CA on LPS-mediated WI-38 apoptosis and inflammation were the aims of this study. Here, CCK-8 cell viability assay was applied on WI-38 after treatment with or without LPS at different doses of CA to verify that CA can increase LPS-induced cell viability. Then, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assays (ELISA) suggested that LPS treatment dramatically decreased the expression level of IL-10 (anti-inflammatory factor) while strikingly increasing the expression levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α; proinflammatory factor) whereas CA treatment attenuates LPS-induced inflammation of WI-38. Further, flow cytometry and Western blot assay verified that LPS treatment dramatically promoted apoptosis of WI-38 cells, while administration of CA notably inhibited apoptosis of WI-38 cells. Moreover, the Western blot assay hinted that CA could inactivate LPS-induced JAK2-STAT1 signaling pathway. These findings indicated that CA could alleviate LPS-mediated WI-38 apoptosis and inflammation injury through JAK2-STAT1 pathway in acute pneumonia.",

This study aimed to investigate the role of lnc-THRIL and miR-125b in detecting AR risk, and to further explore their correlation with disease severity and cytokines released from T helper type (Th) 1 and Th2 in AR patients.A total of 160 AR patients and 80 subjects with severe snoring symptoms (as controls) were recruited. Nasal mucosa samples were collected to measure the expressions of lnc-THRIL, miR-125b, and Th1 and Th2 cytokines by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction.The expression of lnc-THRIL decreased while that of miR-125b increased in AR patients when compared with that of controls, and further receiver operating characteristic curve showed that both could well distinguish AR patients from controls. Furthermore, lnc-THRIL negatively correlated with miR-125b in AR patients. lnc-THRIL was negatively correlated with Individual Nasal Symptom Score (INSS) (including nasal rhinorrhea score, sneezing score, and congestion score) and Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS), and miR-125b was positively associated with INSS (including itching score, sneezing score, and congestion score) and TNSS. Moreover, lnc-THRIL was correlated with increased Th1 cytokines (interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin (IL)-2) but with decreased Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10), while miR-125b exhibited opposite trends in AR patients.lnc-THRIL and its target (miR-125b) relate to disease risk, symptom severity, and Th1/Th2 imbalance of AR, suggesting their potential as biomarkers for AR management.",

    "abstract": "Pneumonia is a continuous and widespread disease with higher incidence, the effects of it on human life can be fearful. Tricin has been demonstrated to take part in the progression and development of diseases. However, the function of Tricin and its related regulatory pathways remain unclear. This study was planned to investigate the effects of Tricin on severe pneumonia.The cell viability was detected through CCK-8 assay. The TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels were assessed through ELISA and RT-qPCR. The levels of MDA, SOD and GSH were tested through corresponding commercial kits. The protein expressions were examined through western blot.In our study, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was firstly used to stimulate cell model for severe pneumonia. We discovered that Tricin had no toxic effects on BEAS-2B cells and the decreased cell viability induced by LPS was relieved by a dose-dependent Tricin treatment. Additionally, through ELISA and RT-qPCR, it was uncovered that Tricin reduced the LPS-induced inflammation through regulating TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. Furthermore, Tricin relieved LPS-induced oxidative stress through reducing MDA level and enhancing SOD and GSH levels. Finally, it was demonstrated that Tricin retarded LPS-activated AKT and MAPK pathways.Our findings revealed that Tricin attenuated the progression of LPS induced severe pneumonia through modulating AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. This discovery might afford one novel sight for the treatment of severe pneumonia.",

    "abstract": "Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is a promising approach to cow's milk and egg allergies, but reactions are frequent and some patients cannot be desensitized.To evaluate long-term OIT outcomes with omalizumab (OMZ) in paediatric patients with severe egg and/or milk allergies.This retrospective real-life study analysed findings in children with Immunoglobulin E-mediated allergy to cow's milk and/or hen eggs refractory to conventional OIT, who underwent OIT with OMZ in our department between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2015.In all, 41 patients were included (median age: 7 years; interquartile range [IQR]: 5.5-9.5); 26/41 (63.4%) underwent OIT for milk, 8/41 (19.5%) for egg and 7/41 (17.1%) for both. The median time between initiation of OMZ and OIT was 27 weeks (IQR: 22-33). Forty (97.56%) patients reached the maintenance phase (200 mL of cow's milk and 30 mL of raw egg or 1 cooked egg) in a median time of 27 weeks (IQR: 18-37). The median total time with OMZ was 117 weeks (IQR: 88-144). During the OMZ period, 2.44% (1/41) of patients presented anaphylaxis. After discontinuation of OMZ, 29.3% (12/41) presented anaphylaxis, 50% of them had a poor adherence to daily ingestion. One patient (2.44%) was diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis after 2 years of discontinuation of OMZ. Currently, after a median time of 9 years (IQR: 7-10) since the initiation of OMZ, 75.6% (31/41) are desensitized (27/31 without OMZ).Omalizumab allows desensitisation of children with severe allergies to cow's milk and/or egg without developing severe reactions while receiving this treatment. However, discontinuation of OMZ leads to severe allergic reactions, and hence must be monitored carefully.",

More than 85% of lung cancer cases are NSCLC patients. Further exploration of the pathogenesis of lung cancer is of great significance. In this study, functions of far upstream element-binding protein 1 (FUBP1) on the proliferation and tumor immunity of LUSC cells were evaluated.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis were used to examine the overexpression levels of FUBP1 in LUSC and paracancerous tissues, LUSC cell line, and human normal lung cell line. Then, Western blot assay was employed to validate the transfection efficiency of FUBP1 knockdown in SK-MES-1 cells. Cell counting kit-8 and colony formation assays were used to detect the viability and proliferation of SK-MES-1 cells. Transwell assay was used to examine the migrative and invasive abilities of SK-MES-1 cells. Finally, the xenograft tumor mice model was applied to explore the role of FUBP1 in vivo. IHC assay was used to determine the expression levels FUBP1, PD-L1, and Ki-67. Flow cytometry technology was employed to detect the proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ cells in short sequence negative control (sh-NC) and sh-FUBP1 groups.Collectively, the results first indicated that FUBP1 was up-regulated in LUSC tissues and cells. It was also demonstrated that knockdown of FUBP1 suppressed cell migration, invasion, and proliferation in lung squamous carcinoma cells. Finally, knockdown of FUBP1 regulated tumor immunity in vivo.This research suggested that FUBP1 promotes the proliferation of LUSC cells and regulates tumor immunity through programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).",

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a familiar airway disease characterized by chronic immune response in the lungs. More and more evidences have assured that cigarette smoking is the primary reason for the progression of COPD, but its related regulatory mechanism requires further clarification. The α-B-crystallin (CRYAB) has been identified to exhibit vital functions in different diseases, and is down-regulated in the alveoli of mice mediated by cigarette smoke extract (CSE).The messenger RNA expression of CRYAB was assessed by reverse transcription--quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The proteins' expressions were tested using Western blot method. The cytotoxicity was measured by lactate dehydrogenase assay. The levels of malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, catalase, myeloperoxidase, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 were assessed through enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay (ELISA).In this study, it was discovered that the expression of CRYAB was markedly decreased with the increased time of cigarette smoking. Moreover, CRYAB overexpression increased cell viability and decreased cell apoptosis induced by cigarette smoke. In addition, the strengthened oxidative stress and inflammation mediated by CSE treatment was relieved after overexpression of CRYAB. Eventually, results OF Western blot method confirmed that CRYAB retarded the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Ak strain transforming (PI3K-Akt) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways.Our results manifested that CRYAB reduced cigarette smoke-induced inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress in normal and diseased bronchial epithelial (NHBE) and human bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells by suppressing PI3K/Akt and NF-κB signaling pathways, which highlighted the functioning of CRYAB in preventing or treating COPD.",

However, only a few studies have analyzed AOAD, particularly the studies that compared differences in intestinal flora between AOAD and persistent AD patients.To investigate main specificities of intestinal microbiota in AOAD patients, particularly comparing with persistent AD patients.A comprehensive taxonomic and functional analysis of gut microbiota in 10 healthy, 12 AOAD, and 10 persistent AD patients was done by using bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene analysis. Chao1 and Shannon diversity indices were measured to analyze alpha diversity, and the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) algorithm was applied to identify differences in genus.The alpha diversity of gut microbiota in AOAD patients was decreased, with Escherichia-shigella (15.8%) being the predominant genus of AOAD group. Agathobacter and Dorea in AOAD patients were significantly reduced, whereas the relative level of Bacteroides pectinophilus group was remarkably elevated compared with healthy volunteers and persistent AD patients.The present study revealed differences in intestinal flora between AOAD, healthy adults, and non-adult onset of AD, and explored differential dominant bacteria between AOAD and persistent AD patients.",

This study aims to provide new data regarding the atmospheric pollen and fungi content of a Mediterranean region (Western Thrace/North-East Greece) and discuss seasonal trends, differences in pollen grains and fungi spores' circulation over the years, and correlations with climate parameters.A 7-day continuously running volumetric trap was used to collect circulating pollen grains and fungi spores. Pollen taxa and fungi were characterized by standard protocols and counted as grains /m3 and average total grains and spores. The primary allergenic pollen season was discovered, and their 10-day averages were measured over time. Correlations with temperature, rain, and humidity were assessed by single linear regression analysis.Pollen grains from nine pollen families were identified, including five arboreal, two nonarboreal taxa, and spores from two fungi species. The three most prevalent taxa were Oleaceae, Poaceae, Pinaceae, and Cladosporium in the fungi. Peak pollen concentrations were detected during April and May, with daily averages exceeding 170 grains/m3. Poaceae presented the longest pollen season of 342 days and Oleaceae the shortest, extending to only 110 days, during the 3years. Cladosporium was the fungus with the highest spore concentration (180,129.9 spores) compared with Alternaria (28,026.1 spores). Correlations with meteorological parameters showed variable associations among different taxa, with rainfall and relative humidity being the most significant determinants.In this study, the pollenic and fungal spectrum of a Mediterranean region and information that can be proved clinically significant for the appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic approach of allergic patients was presented.",

    "abstract": "Background: Anaphylaxis is a systemic, life-threatening reaction and its prevalence is rising amongst adolescents and young adults (AYA) with food allergies. The likelihood of fatal anaphylaxis is disproportionately high in this population. The effective management of anaphylaxis can be done by adhering to various food allergy-related self-care behaviours, namely avoidance of allergens, carriage and use of adrenaline auto-injectors (AAI). Unfortunately, compliance of AYA to these behaviours is believed to be suboptimal and the likely reason behind their increased rates of fatal anaphylaxis. Methodology: To evaluate the adherence to food allergy-related self-care behaviours amongst adolescents and young adults with anaphylaxis an electronic search was conducted utilizing PubMed, MEDLINE, and CINAHL plus to identify relevant studies. 175 article abstracts were screened, and 26 remained which were read in full to determine which best satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Ultimately, 10 articles were selected for this review. Results: The compliance to food allergy-related self-care behaviours amongst AYA founded to be suboptimal. AAI design, peer influence, and emotional attitudes of AYA were found to be the most significant factors influencing AYA compliance to self-care behaviours. Conclusions: The adherence of AYA to food allergy-related self-care behaviours is suboptimal and evidence on the factors affecting AYA compliance has been largely contradictory. AAI design, peer influence, and emotional attitudes are significant factors influencing AYA adherence. Therefore, further research directed at these factors is imperative in facilitating the design of guidelines to maximize the adherence of AYA to food allergy-related self-care behaviours.",

Methods: The model of chronic eczema was established by using 2-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), and the composition and content of volatile oil in Zanthoxylum schinifolium and Zanthoxylum bungeanum was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The antipruritic effect by (EASI) score of eczema area and severity index and scratching times was then evaluated. Then, the contents of histamine, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), interleukin-4 (IL-4), and immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum of rats was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The tissue morphology was observed by HE staining. The expressions of H1R, PAR-2, TRPV1, TRPA1, and GRPR was then detected by immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and QRT-PCR. Results: The results revealed that there were differences in the composition of volatile oil between Zanthoxylum bungeanum and Zanthoxylum schinifolium. Compared to the model group, the medium-dose group of Zanthoxylum bungeanum and Zanthoxylum schinifolium group significantly increased the difference of EASI score and scratching times, significantly decreased the concentrations of IL-4, IgE, GRP, and histamine, and significantly decreased the expression levels of H1R, PAR-2, TRPV1, and GRPR. The degree of inhibition on the pathological manifestations of chronic eczema was evident. There was no significant difference in antipruritic effect between the two groups. The expression of TRPA1 was inconsistent at the protein and gene level, which needs to be further researched. Conclusion: The volatile oil of Zanthoxylum bungeanum and Zanthoxylum schinifolium can reduce the expression of H1R, PAR-2, TRPV1, and GRPR. The mechanism may be through the H1R and PAR-2-mediated GRPR pathway intervention to achieve the effect, both of which have the same antipruritic effect.",

    "abstract": "Psoriasis is one of the chronic and autoimmune skin diseases. It is important to uncover the mechanisms underlying the psoriasis. Transcription factor activator protein (TFAP-2) gamma, also known as AP2-gamma, is a protein encoded by the TFAP2C gene. Immune-mediated pathophysiological processes could be linked to psoriasis, but the mechanism is still unclear. Therefore, to date the cause of psoriasis has not been understood completely.Psoriasis is a complex disease triggered by genetic, immunological, and environmental stimuli. Keratinocytes play an important role in both initiation and maintenance phases of psoriasis. A psoriatic keratinocyte model was established by stimulating high sensitivity of human epidermal keratinocytes (HaCaT) to topoisomerase inhibitor cell lines using the accumulation of M5 cytokines comprising interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-22, oncostatin M, IL-1α, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). The TFAP2C and transcriptional enhanced associate domain 4 (TEAD4) genes expression was evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Western blot analysis was used to examine protein expression. Cell viability (quantitative) of keratinocytes, including cytotoxicity, proliferation, and cell activation, was evaluated by the MTT assay. The relative percentage values of interleukin (IL)-17a, interferon gamma, and IL-4+ cells were measured by flow cytometry. Accordingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays were applied to evaluate the binding affinity of TFAP2C and TEAD4 promoter.Level of the TFAP2C gene was elevated in the lesional skin of psoriasis patients. On the other hand, silencing of the TFAP2C gene suppressed the proliferation and inflammatory response in M5-induced keratinocytes. In addition, inhibition of TFAP2C alleviated imiquimod (IMQ)-induced skin injury in mice model. We also observed that suppression of TFAP2C inhibited the activation of T-helper 17 (Th17) and Th1 cells in IMQ-induced mice model. Mechanically, TFAP2C promoted TEAD4 transcriptional activation.TFAP2C exacerbated psoriasis-like inflammation by increasing the activation of Th17 and Th1 cells by regulating TEAD4 transcription. This finding clearly indicated that TFAP2C could be considered a valuable biomarker for the prevention and treatment for psoriasis.",

In addition, it was determined that mothers of children with food allergies had higher levels of anxiety, depression, and caregiving burden than mothers of the control group (P < 0.0001).In order to develop a multidisciplinary approach for children with food allergies, we conceived as appropriate to inform their families about the difficulties of caregiving and psychosocial disorders that could develop over time. They also must be informed to take preventive measures as well as the medical aspects of their children's disease.",

    "abstract": "Background: The aim of this study is to present the current views of a diverse group of experts on the diagnosis and treatment of Cow’s Milk Protein Allergy (CMPA) in children under 2 years of age in Mexico. Material and methods: The study, led by a scientific committee of five experts in CMPA, was divided into six phases, including a modified Delphi process. A total of 20 panelists, all of whom were pediatric specialists, participated in administering a comprehensive 38-item questionnaire. The questionnaire was divided into two blocks: Diagnosis and Treatment (20 items each). Results: Consensus was reached on all the proposed items, with an agreement rate of over 70% for each of them. As a result, a diagnostic and treatment algorithm was developed that emphasized the reduction of unnecessary diagnostic studies and encouraged breastfeeding whenever possible. In cases where breast milk is not available, appropriate use of hypoallergenic formulas was recommended. In addition, recommendations on treatment duration and gradual reintroduction of cow’s milk protein were provided. Conclusions: The recommendations endorsed by 20 Mexican pediatricians through this study are applicable to everyday clinical practice, thereby enhancing the diagnosis and treatment of children under 2 years of age with CMPA. This, in turn, will foster improved health outcomes and optimize the utilization of healthcare resources.",

    "abstract": "Delayed anaphylaxis after ingestion of red meat because of galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal) syndrome has increased in recent years. The mechanism involves an immunoglobulin E reaction to alpha-gal, a molecule found in mammalian meat, dairy products, medications and excipients containing mammalian-derived components, and tick salivary glycans. Sensitization occurs due to the bite of a lone star tick and the transmission of alpha-gal molecules into person's bloodstream. We describe a case of alpha-gal syndrome with severe food, drug, and perioperative allergy in which anaphylaxis with hypovolemic shock occurred immediately after an emergency surgical procedure, when a gelatin-containing drug was injected. This case study confirms that the clinical manifestations of alpha-gal syndrome could be different depending on the route of administration, with immediate reactions if an alpha-gal-containing drug is injected and delayed type allergic manifestations occurring several hours after oral intake. The purpose of this report is to highlight the importance of risk communication in case of exposure to medical products and surgical procedures of patients with alpha-gal syndrome and to encourage drug manufacturers to indicate clearly the origin of excipients in product literature.",

    "abstract": "Background: Pulmonary fibrosis is a pathological hallmark of lung injury. It is an aggressive disease that replaces normal lung parenchyma by fibrotic tissue. The transforming growth factor-beta–mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (TGF-β1–Smad3) signaling pathway plays a key role in regulating lung fibrosis. Decorin (DCN), a small leucine-rich proteoglycan, has a modulatory effect on the immune system by reversibly binding with TGF-β and reducing its bioavailability. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy is a new strategy that has an immune-modulatory capacity. Objective: The aim of this study was to introduce a new therapeutic approach to harness remodeling in injured lung. Material and Methods: Bone marrow MSCs were isolated and transduced by decorin gene. Lung injury was induced by bleomycin and mice were treated with MSCs, MSCs–decorin, and decorin. Then, oxidative stress biomarkers, remodeling biomarkers, bronchoalveolar lavage cells, and histopathology study were conducted. Results: Reduced catalase and superoxide dismutase increased due to treatments. Elevated malondialdehyde, hydroxyproline, TGF-β levels, and polymorphonuclear cells count decreased in the treated groups. Additionally, the histopathology of lung tissues showed controlled inflammation and fibrosis. Conclusion: Transfected decorin gene to MSCs and used cell therapy could control remodeling and bleomycin-induced lung injury.",

    "abstract": "Background: The prevalence of allergic disorders is on the rise, affecting about 10% of the population. In this retrospective cohort, we investigated prevalence of allergic disorders, associated risk factors, and the outcome of food allergies. Material and methods: We analyzed data from birth cohorts of two university hospitals’ well-child outpatient clinics. Factors related to onset and type of allergic diseases were assessed from demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical data. Results: Analyses were performed on 949 (431F/518M) infants at a mean current age of 28±6 months. Any allergic disease was established among 177 cases (22%); atopic dermatitis in 123 (12.8%), respiratory allergies in 55 (5.7%), and food allergy in 41 (4.3%). The risk for allergic disorders was found to be significantly increased for male gender (OR: 2.31, 95% CI; 1.54–3.46), and positive parental atopy (OR: 1.94, 95% CI; 1.31–2.86). The risk of food allergies was significantly higher in the male gender (OR: 2.47, 95% CI; 1.21–5.02), who consumed egg-white between 6 and 12 months (OR: 2.34, 95% CI; 1.22–4.48), and who were formula-fed before 6 months (OR: 2.16, 95% CI; 1.14–4.10). We found no significant association between the rate of food allergy outgrowth or food induced-anaphylaxis with regards to the timing of introducing egg-white into the diet. Conclusions: Although the introduction of egg-white into infant diet at 6–12 months of life appeared as an independent risk for any food allergy, none of the patients developed anaphylaxis. Age at symptom onset and outgrowing food allergy were similar compared to those introduced egg-white after 12 months. We recommend promoting exclusive breastfeeding during the first 6 months of life, and avoidance of prolonged restrictive diets for children with food allergy.",

    "abstract": "Eosinophils are the major inflammatory cells which play a crucial role in the development of allergic and non-allergic asthma phenotypes. Eosinophilic asthma is the most heterogeneous phenotype where activated eosinophils are reported to be significantly associated with asthma severity. Activated eosinophils display an array of cell adhesion molecules that not only act as an activation marker, suitable for assessing severity, but also secrete several tissue factors, cytokines and chemokines which modulate the clinical severity. Eosinophil activations are also strictly associated with activation of other hetero cellular populations like neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, and platelets which culminate in the onset and progression of abnormal phenotypes such as bronchoconstriction, allergic response, fibrosis instigated by tissue inflammation, epithelial injury, and oxidative stress. During the activated state, eosinophils release several potent toxic signaling molecules such as major basic proteins, eosinophil peroxidase, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and lipid mediators, rendering tissue damage and subsequently leading to allergic manifestation. The tissue mediators render a more complex manifestation of a severe phenotype by activating prominent signaling cross-talk. Here, in the current review with the help of search engines of PubMed, Medline, etc, we have tried to shed light and explore some of the potent determinants regulating eosinophil activation leading to asthma phenotype.",

    "abstract": "The current systematic review presented and discussed the most recent studies on pediatric chronic cough. In addition, the Italian Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology elaborated a comprehensive algorithm to guide the primary care approach to a pediatric patient with chronic cough.Several algorithms on chronic cough management have been adopted and validated in clinical practice; however, unlike the latter, we developed an algorithm focused on pediatric age, from birth until adulthood. Based on our findings, children and adolescents with chronic cough without cough pointers can be safely managed, initially using the watchful waiting approach and, successively, starting empirical treatment based on cough characteristics. Unlike other algorithms that suggest laboratory and instrumental investigations as a first step, this review highlighted the importance of a “wait and see” approach, consisting of parental reassurance and close clinical observation, also due to interprofessional collaboration and communication between general practitioners and specialists that guarantee better patient management, appropriate prescription behavior, and improved patient outcome. Moreover, the neonatal screening program provided by the Italian National Health System, which intercepts several diseases precociously, allowing to treat them in a very early stage, helps and supports a “wait and see” approach.Conversely, in the presence of cough pointers or persistence of cough, the patient should be tested and treated by the specialist. Further investigations and treatments will be based on cough etiology, aiming to intercept the underlying disease, prevent potentially irreversible tissue damage, and improve the general health of patients affected by chronic cough, as well as the quality of life of patients and their family. Further high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to validate this algorithm’s performance in real clinical practice.",

Regulation of inflammatory mediator and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels could be a potential therapeutic approach to treat inflammatory injury. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether epalrestat (EPS), which is used for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy, suppresses inflammatory response in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells.The effects of EPS at near-plasma concentration on the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators was examined using by MTS assay, quantitative RT-PCR analysis, and western blotting in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells.EPS suppressed mRNA and protein expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα, in RAW264.7 cells stimulated with LPS. EPS also affected inflammatory mediators such as iNOS and NF-κB in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells.In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that EPS suppresses inflammatory response in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. From these results, we propose that targeting the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and inflammatory mediators by EPS is a promising therapeutic approach to treat inflammatory injury. It is expected that EPS, whose safety and pharmacokinetics have been confirmed clinically, would be useful for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.",

The key immune defect is disruption of the action of cytokine IL-17, whose most common genetic etiology is STAT1 gene gain-of function (GOF) mutations. The initial appropriate treatment for fungal infections is with azoles. However, frequent occurrence of drug resistance is the main limitation. Therefore, identification of the underlying inborn error if immunity in CMC may allow widening therapeutic options aimed at restoring immunological function. Type I and II Janus Kinase -inhibitors have been shown to control CMC in cases associated with STAT1 GOF. In this review, we delve into the pathogenesis of CMC and the underlying immune mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Background: Multiple food allergies (MFAs) affect 30% of the child population with food allergy. The current treatment is the exclusion diet, which frequently affects the quality of life for these patients. The objective of the study was to describe the effect of omalizumab treatment in children diagnosed with MFAs who experienced frequent anaphylactic reactions and the impact on their quality of life.Material and methods: A descriptive observational study. Patients with severe food restrictions and high-risk due to multiple episodes of anaphylaxis were included. The allergy was confirmed by compatible clinical, skin tests, positive specific IgE and oral food challenges (OFCs). Omalizumab treatment was initiated and the impact on the life quality of patients and their families was assessed using the validated Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire-Parent Form.Results: Five patients with an average age at diagnosis of 3.58 years (range between 1.5–7.9 years), were diagnosed with MFAs. All patients presented with anaphylaxis. All patients were treated with omalizumab between 2013 and 2019. Omalizumab treatment was initiated at a mean age of 6.05 years (range between 4.5–8.25 years). All patients have undergone OFC to reintroduce food successfully. 2 patients had their dose of omalizumab reduced by half, and 1 patient has had the time interval extended between administrations due to the maintenance of food tolerance. No immediate local or systemic adverse reactions were documented. Two patients have commenced omalizumab administration at home without incident.Conclusions: Children with MFAs who are treated with omalizumab do not show reactions in response to most of the foods to which they previously had anaphylaxis. Consequently, these patients were able to significantly expand the variety of their diet, improving the life quality and avoid anaphylaxis following the inadvertent intake of these foods.",

The aim of this study was to assess the influence of VD supplementation on the severity of AD.Methods: Pre–post interventional study with prospective data collection in patients younger than 14 years. The severity of AD was determined through SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis) and classified as mild (SCORAD &lt; 25), moderate (≥25 and &lt;50), and severe (≥50). Skin prick test was performed in all patients. Serum VD levels were classified as sufficient (≥30 ng/mL), insufficient (29 to 21 ng/mL), and deficient (≤20 ng/mL); and those with inadequate levels received oral supplementation of VD for 3 months, and were reassessed after treatment.Results: A total of 152 patients were included. Patients with sufficient vitamin levels had lower SCORAD values (p = 0.04). Further, 116 patients (76.3%) received VD supplementation and after 3 months, VD levels were significantly higher (35.9 ng/mL) compared to baseline levels (23.7 ng/mL, p &lt; 0.001). At the same time, a reduction in the SCORAD index was observed (19.4 before vs 12.3 after supplementation, p &lt; 0.001). Considering other factors that could influence the decrease in AD severity after VD supplementation, female gender was associated with a worse treatment response (p = 0.02).Conclusion: Vitamin D supplementation could be an adjuvant in reducing the severity of atopic dermatitis.",

Participants were sub-grouped into three groups; healthy (H), those with unconfirmed food hypersensitivity reactions (FA-) and children with a confirmed diagnosis by a physician IgE-mediated food allergy (FA+). Food habits, family health history and lifestyle factors were assessed and groups' outcomes were compared with each other.For the study, 202 questionnaires were completed and returned; 31 children (19 FA- and 12 FA+) reported an adverse food reaction. Significant risk factors for developing FA+ were being the first born or having siblings with asthma, attended a day nursery, but also maternal alcohol drinking during pregnancy, parental smoking and parental occupation in food processing or use of latex gloves. The presence of children in the kitchen during cooking showed a protective role. Dietary habits of FA+ children were significantly diminished in terms of variety and frequency of consumption in comparison to the rest, in which had a greater overlap.Further research is required for the interesting risk or protective factors revealing from the current investigation. The negative effect of food allergy in the dietary habits of food allergic children documented in the literature, is strongly supported herein.",

The mouse model of AR was established by ovalbumin (OVA).The animal models were intervened with miR-224 agomir, negative control agomir, and saline respectively. The symptoms of sneezing and nasal rubbing were recorded. The expressions of miR224, CDK9, and cytokines in the nasal mucosa of different groups were analyzed by rt-PCR or western blotting. Enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) was used to evaluate the levels of IgE and Histamine (HA) in the serum. The infiltration of inflammatory cells in the nasal mucosa was studied by immunohistochemistry. The expression and distribution of CDK9 in the nasal mucosa of mice were revealed by immunofluorescence.In the nasal mucosa of the animal models, the level of miR-224 was downregulated, while that of CDK9 was upregulated. The upregulation of miR-224 by miR-224 agomir reduced the frequencies of nasal rubbing and sneezing, the expression of CDK9, the levels of cytokines, and the concentrations of IgE and HA. Moreover, miR-224 appeared to attenuate the infiltration of inflammatory cells and hypersecretion of glands in the nasal mucosa. The expression of CDK9, which was distributed under the mucosa, especially in the submucosa interstitial tissue, was significantly reduced.MiR-224 affected the pathogenesis of AR by targeting CDK9. It proves that miR-224 could be a novel potential therapeutic target for AR.",

Effectiveness was measured by the degree of control (CAN questionnaire), number of hospitalizations per year, number of exacerbations per year, and maintenance treatment and lung function (FEV1). Some adverse reactions occurred (AAI-EAACI-WAO guidelines).The retrospective study included 29 patients up to 18 years of age with severe asthma with OM plus AIT treatment. AIT treatment was started in a cluster schedule when patients treated with OM achieved disease control. Before starting AIT, patients were treated with OM for 1 year for achieving asthmatic control. AIT to mites (51%), Alternaria (37.9%), or pollens (10.3%) was administered. After one year with OM plus AIT,statistically significant differences in CAN scores and FEV1 measures were observed (P < 0.001). No patients under treatment with OM plus AIT required hospital admission. During the clustering schedule, only 3/64 doses showed systemic adverse reactions. During the AIT maintenance treatment, 348 doses were administered, with no significant adverse reactions.In this population-based study in children with severe asthma, the combined treatment with OM plus AIT was safe and effective. This strategy allows these pediatric patients to be safely treated with AIT.",

    "abstract": "Background: Allergic diseases represent a major global health issue with more than one-third of the global population affected by at least one allergic condition. Allergic conditions can not only cause life-threatening anaphylactic reactions but also impact daily life with a significant influence on mental health and the quality of life (QoL). Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the health-related QoL and depression severity among patients presenting in a tertiary care allergy center. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 596 patients presenting with allergic symptoms or previously diagnosed allergies between October 2018 and April 2019. Patients were screened for depression and the QoL impairment by using three validated scales: the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Dermatologic Life Quality Index (DLQI), and the three-level version of the EuroQol 5-Dimensional (EQ-5D-3L) scale. Results: One-third (34.8%) of the study population was male and two-thirds (65.2%) were female. About 73.7% (n = 427/579) of the patients suffered from at least one previously diagnosed allergic disease, most frequently to pollen (37.0%, n = 214/579) and food (27.3%, n = 158/579), and 20.0 % (n = 116/579) suffered from urticaria. About 19.3% of the total population suffered from depression. Urticaria, as well as insect venom, food/food additives, and drug allergies significantly affected the QoL and depression severity (p &lt; 0.001), reflected by higher DLQI and BDI scores, and lower scores in the EQ5D-3L index. Conclusion: Our results provide evidence for a possible correlation of allergies (e.g. against insect venom, food/food additives, and drugs) and/or urticaria with a reduced QoL and a higher depression rate. Patients particularly indicated restrictions for the dimensions, pain/discomfort as well as anxiety/depression. It might be beneficial to implement a standardized questionnaire as a regular screening method for evaluating the mental health status of patients with allergies and/or urticaria.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary fibrosis in general is the final common outcome of various interstitial lung diseases. In recent years, the incidence of pulmonary fibrosis has been rising with poor prognosis. 6-gingerol is deemed as a functional polyphenol of ginger. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of 6-gingerol, on pulmonary fibrosis. Mice were randomly divided into four groups: control, bleomycin, bleomycin + 6-gingerol 100 mg/kg, bleomycin + 6-gingerol 250 mg/kg, and the survival rates of the groups were recorded. Pathological and fibrotic changes in the lungs were identified by H&amp;E and Masson staining, respectively. The levels of hydroxyproline and protein deposited in lung tissues were then, respectively, determined by colorimetry and western blotting. Subsequently, the proportion of cells and inflammatory factors in the alveolar lavage fluid were estimated. Following the identification of the possibility of Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) in the pharmacological mechanism through molecular docking and western blotting, human embryonic lung fibroblasts MRC-5 were treated with TGF-β1 and SIRT1 inhibitor to study the role of SIRT1 in the regulatory effect of 6-gingerol. From the results, 6-gingerol was found to increase the survival rate of mice and reduce lung pathology and fibrosis in mice. And, it significantly reduced the levels of hydroxyproline and the proteins deposited in lung tissues. Moreover, the number of neutrophils, basophils, monocytes, and the levels of inflammatory factors in the alveolar lavage fluid were also reduced. SIRT1 inhibitor blocked the function of 6-gingerol to inhibit fibrosis. To sum up, 6-gingerol relieves pulmonary fibrosis via activating SIRT1. This finding expands the pharmacological effect of 6-gingerol, and it is expected to advance the development of treatments for pulmonary fibrosis.",

In this study, network pharmacology was used for exploring the anti-epileptic multi-target mechanism of Rhizoma Coptidis. The possible protein targets of Rhizoma Coptidis were predicted by constructing the pathway and network of drug targets. Then, the interaction of the main active components of Rhizoma Coptidis and predicted candidate targets were verified using molecular docking technology. Finally, nine active compounds were selected from Rhizoma Coptidis. A total of 68 targets associated with Rhizoma Coptidis treating epilepsy. The key targets were AKT1, IL6, VEGFA, and TP53. According to GO functional enrichment analysis, 289 items of biological process, 33 items of cellular component, and 55 items of molecular function were obtained. A total of 89 signaling pathways were identified through KEGG pathway enrichment analysis (P < 0.05), and HIF-1, TNF, and T-cell receptor signaling pathways were mainly related to epilepsy. Molecular docking showed quercetin and (R)-canadine combined well with the key targets. The active ingredient in Rhizoma Coptidis can regulate various signaling pathways, and have therapeutic effects on epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Background and objective: The incidence of food allergy among children is on the rise. Children who are diagnosed with a food allergy receive long-term treatment for allergy management from allergy specialists, nurses and dieticians. This management may include the prescription of an adrenaline autoinjector (AAI) if the child is at risk of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). Therefore, it is important that parents of children with allergies are trained in the recognition of anaphylaxis and in the correct administration of an AAI. However, many parents are unable to correctly administer an AAI when assessed. The aim of this study is to review the current literature on caregiver’s and paediatric patients’ ability to use an AAI. Methodology: An electronic search to evaluate AAI technique in caregivers and children with food allergy was conducted. A total of 323 articles were screened in which 10 studies were reviewed. Results: Seventy-eight percent of parents who had never been trained in the use of an AAI were unable to trigger it. In studies where paediatric patients’ ability to use an AAI was assessed, a mean score of 7.78/9 was derived for AAI knowledge among adolescents. Conclusion: Caregivers and patient’s ability to use an AAI was inconclusive, and further research should address the validation of an assessment tool for AAI use. A significant improvement in AAI use was found after an educational intervention. This highlights the need for improved education for allergic individuals and their caregivers, and further study should explore what are the best educational methods to meet these needs.",

    "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic multisystemic inflammatory disease with inflammatory cell infiltration, hyperproliferation of keratinocytes in skin lesions, and epidermal barrier dysfunction. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) were stimulated with interleukin 17A (IL-17A). The expression levels of sirtuin-5 (SIRT5) were analyzed by RT-qPCR and western blot assay. The proliferation levels of NHEKs were assessed by EdU staining. The expression of ELOVL1 and ELOVL4 was analyzed by RT-Qpcr, and the expression levels of filaggrin, loricrin, and aquaporin-3 were analyzed by RT-qPCR and western blot. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activator t-butylhydroquinone was used to activate ERK1/2. Here, we show that SIRT5 overexpression reduces cell viability and cell proliferation, and improves barrier dysfunction in IL-17A-treated human epidermal keratinocytes, this effect of which is significantly blunted by the ERK1/2 activator. In epidermal keratinocytes, SIRT5 decreases cell proliferation and inflammation and improves barrier dysfunction via ERK/STAT3. This study reveals the role of SIRT5 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, epidermal hyperplasia, keratinocyte-mediated inflammatory responses, and barrier dysfunction, the role of which is mediated by ERK/STAT3.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a hackneyed chronic inflammatory disease of the airway. Chryseriol (CSR) is a kind of flavonoid, and has the effect of bronchiectasis, indicating its potential application for treating respiratory diseases. However, the functions of CSR in asthma have not been reported till now.The histopathologic changes of the lung tissues were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The cell apoptosis was identified through terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling assay. Total numbers of eosinophils, neutrophils, and macrophages were assessed under microscope. The levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 were detected by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay. The airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) was evaluated by the whole body plethysmography. The levels of methane dicarboxylic aldehyde, superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase, and glutathione in lung homogenates were confirmed by using corresponding commercial kits. The protein expressions were examined by Western blot analysis.The ovalbumin (OVA) was utilized to establish asthma mouse model. At first, it was revealed that CSR treatment reduced lung injury in OVA-stimulated mice. Moreover, cell apoptosis was enhanced after OVA stimulation but was attenuated by CSR treatment. In addition, CSR treatment decreased the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the production of inflammatory factors in OVA-treated mice. Further investigations demonstrated that CSR treatment relieved AHR in OVA-stimulated mice. The oxidative stress was strengthened in OVA-treated mice, but these effects were relieved by CSR treatment. Lastly, it was discovered that CSR treatment retarded nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)/hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) pathways in OVA-triggered asthma mice.Our findings proved that CSR attenuated the progression of OVA-induced asthma in mice through inhibiting NF-κB/HIF-1α and MAPK/STAT1 pathways. This work might highlight the functions of CSR in the treatment of asthma.",

Using network meta-analysis, we evaluated the efficacy of different surgical methods in the treatment of AR. Methods: PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CBM, Wan Fang Data, and CNKI databases were searched to collect clinical randomized controlled trials of AR with different surgical methods that met the inclusion criteria. After two investigators independently screened literature, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies, R software was used to evaluate inconsistency using the node splitting method, and Stata15.1 was used to estimate the ranking probability of treatment. Results: A total of 47 randomized control studies involving 17 surgical schemes and 4144 participants were included. The results showed that after excluding surgical methods that did not form a closed loop, in AR patients without chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps, surgical efficiency and symptom score ranked the same, which were posterior nasal neurectomy (PNN), Vidian neurectomy (VN), anterior ethmoid neurectomy (AEN), nasal septal reconstruction (NSR), and bilateral inferior turbinoplasty (BIT). In AR patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, the effective rate (OR = 5.06; 95% CI = 2.75–9.32) and symptom and sign scores (MD = -3.80; 95% CI = -6.50–1.09) of PNN + FESS (functional endoscopic sinusitis surgery) were higher than FESS, and there was a significant difference. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that PNN is the best single operation for patients with AR and without chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps, and the combination of multiple procedures may be better than a single operation. FESS + PNN is more effectual in AR patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.",

Nevertheless, the role of SHP2 in ALI remains unknown.The in vivo and in vitro lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI models were successfully established. The histopathological changes were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The vascular permeability of lungs was assessed by Evans blue assay. The expression of ACSL4 and SHP2 was detected by western blot and qRT-PCR assay. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA), iron, and glutathione (GSH) levels were measured by commercial kits.The SHP2 was upregulated in LPS-induced ALI mice and LPS-stimulated MLE-12 cells. In loss-of function experiment, the knockdown of SHP2 attenuated LPS-induced lung injury, microvessels damage, pulmonary edema, and increase of lung vascular permeability in vivo. Mechanically, shSHP2-rescued LPS induced increase in LDH activity, MDA, and iron levels, and decrease in GSH levels, as well as the accumulation of reactive oxygen species in vivo and in vitro, leading to an alleviation of LPS-induced ferroptosis. Notably, shSHP2 reduced the expression of Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain 4 (ACSL4). In the rescued experiments, overexpression of ACSL4 abolished the shSHP2-induced reduction of LDH activity, MDA, and iron levels, and increase in GSH levels, thereby aggravating the LPS-induced ferroptosis.These findings concluded that the knockdown of SHP2 attenuated LPS-induced ferroptosis via downregulation of ACSL4 expression in ALI, providing a novel sight for ALI treatment.",

This study explored the regulatory role and mechanism of high mobility histone box 1 protein (HMGB1) on pulmonary fibrosis (PF) after ALI in rats through nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptor protein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome.PF rat models after ALI were established by induction of bleomycin. Degree of fibrosis was assessed by Masson staining and Ashcroft scoring. Hydroxyproline (Hyp) contents in lung tissues and rat lung tissue morphology were detected by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay (ELISA) and hematoxylin and eosin staining. The levels of NLRP3, major proteins of NLRP3 inflammasome (NLRP3/ASC/caspase-1), and downstream inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-18 were determined using immunohistochemistry, Western blotting analysis, and ELISA. The nuclear/cytoplasmic nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) levels and HO-1 levels were measured by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blotting analysis. Rats was injected with lentivirus carrying short hairpin (sh)-HMGB1 and zinc protoporphyria (ZNPP) (HO-1 inhibitor) to assess the effects of HMGB1 and HO-1 on PF and NLRP3 inflammasome activation.Bleomycin induced PF after ALI in rats, manifested as patchy fibrosis, atelectasis, and excessive expansion, and increased Aschcroft score and Hyp content. Bleomycin treatment enhanced levels of NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, IL-1, and IL-18 in rat lung tissues, which promoted activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. HMGB1 was up-regulated in bleomycin-induced rats. HMGB1 knockdown partially reversed NLRP3 inflammasome activation and PF progression. HMGB1 knockdown promoted Nrf2 nuclear translocation and up-regulated HO-1. Suppression of HO-1 partially reversed inhibition of HMGB1 knockdown on NLRP3 inflammasome activation and PF.HMGB1 can activate NLRP3 inflammasomes and promote PF by inhibiting the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.",

    "abstract": "The oral food challenge (OFC) in IgE mediated food allergy causes anxiety both in parents and in patients due to its inherent risks.Documentation of the rate, spectrum, and predictors of positive reactions is instructive.Children, who underwent OFC between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2019 were analyzed.A total of 1361 OFCs in 613 cases were reviewed. Most of them were performed in preschool children (≤2 years 50%) and 55% of them had more than one OFC. Mainly considered food groups were cow's milk (31.8%), hen's egg (28.5%), tree nuts (20%), legumes (7%), seeds (4.9%), and wheat (2.7%). The overall OFC positivity was 9.6%, whereas 6.7% with cow's milk, 4.9% with hen's egg, 16.1% with tree nuts, 21.6% with wheat, and 32.8% with seeds. The severity scoring revealed grade I (24.4%), II (45.8%), and III (29.7%) reactions. Fifty (38%) cases required epinephrine and four cases required hospitalization. OFCs with sesame seeds (odds ratio [OR]: 7.747, [confidence interval (CI) 95%: 4.03-14.90]), wheat (OR: 3.80, [CI: 1.64-8.84]), and tree nuts (OR: 2.78, [CI: 1.83-4.23]) predicted a positive OFC while a concomitant asthma (OR: 3.61 [CI: 1.27-10.28]) was more likely to elicit anaphylaxis.In OFC practice, priority is given to basic nutritional sources and the most frequent food allergens, where preschool children with multiple sensitizations are the primary subjects. Increased risks of positive reactions with sesame, tree nut, and wheat and increased risk of anaphylaxis with concomitant asthma should be considered while performing OFC.",

Objective: To investigate the effect of myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2C) on acute lung injury (ALI) with sepsis and its possible mechanism.The cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis rat model was established. The lung injury was determined by lung wet-dry weight ratio, the concentration of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Interlukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and IL-10, were measured by the enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay kit. The cell apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining assay.Interestingly, MEF2C was down-regulated in this model. Moreover, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-MEF2C treatment markedly suppressed TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 concentrations but promoted IL-10 concentration in serum in CLP-challenged rats. Besides, overexpression of MEF2C alleviates CLP-induced lung injury. Interestingly, AAV-MEF2C treatment was confirmed to suppress apoptosis in CLP-induced sepsis rats as well as promote aquaporin APQ1 expression. Mechanistically, the rescue experiments indicated that MEF2C alleviated CLP-induced lung inflammatory response and apoptosis via up-regulating AQP1.In summary, overexpression of MEF2C suppressed CLP-induced lung inflamma-tory response and apoptosis via up-regulating AQP1, providing a novel therapeutic target for sepsis-induced ALI.",

    "abstract": "Guizhi Jia Shaoyao decoction (GSD) is widely used in the clinical treatment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this study was to explore functional mechanisms of GSD in treating KOA by utilizing network pharmacology-based approaches.Candidate components and targets of GSD were retrieved from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology database. NCBI, Genecards, Drugbank, and Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) were used to establish a target database for KOA. Then, an interactive network diagram of \"drugs-active components-targets\" was plotted with Cytoscape open source bioinformatics software. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed and related protein interaction relationships were analyzed based on the STRING database. Gene ontology analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway-enrichment analysis were conducted based on intersected targets. Molecular docking provided an assessment tool for verifying binding of components and targets. It was performed by AutoDock molecular modeling simulation software.In all, 103 active components were successfully identified, and corresponding 133 targets were searched for treating KOA. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that GSD exerts its pharmacological effect in treating KOA by regulating multiple pathways, such as PI3K-Akt, tumor necrosis factor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), and nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathways. Molecular docking analysis depicted that representative components bound firmly to key targets.This study revealed the synergistic effects of multiple components, targets, and pathways of GSD for treating KOA. This would enhance the understanding of potential molecular mechanisms of GSD for treating KOA and lay a foundation for further experimental research.",

Semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A) participates in diverse biological processes, including cell migration, angiogenesis, and inflammation. The effect of SEMA3A on hyperoxic lung injury of neonatal rats with BPD was investigated in this study.Neonatal rats with BPD were established through hyperoxia treatment. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to evaluate histopathological analysis in lung tissues. SEMA3A expression was assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot assay. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated over-expression of SEMA3A (AAV-SEMA3A) was administrated into hyperoxia-induced rats, and apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL staining. Levels of inflammatory cytokines were investigated by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay (ELISA).Hyperoxia-induced histopathological changes in lung tissue reduced alveolar number and enhanced alveolar interval and alveolar volume. SEMA3A was downregulated in lung tissue of hyperoxia-induced rats. AAV-SEMA3A injection attenuated hyperoxia-induced cell apoptosis in lung tissues by increasing Bcl-2 and decreasing Bax and cleaved caspase-3. Moreover, the enhanced levels of Interleukin (IL)-1β, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in hyperoxia-induced rats were restored by AAV-SEMA3A injection by the downregulation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) phosphorylation. AAV-SEMA3A injection also ameliorated histopathological changes in lung tissues of hyperoxia-induced rats by increasing the number of radial alveolar count and decreasing the volume of mean linear intercept. Besides, the protein expression levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation were reduced in hyperoxia-induced rats post-AAV-SEMA3A injection.Ectopical expression of SEMA3A suppressed hyperoxia-induced apoptosis and inflammation in neonatal rats, and ameliorated the histopathological changes through inactivation of ERK/JNK pathway.",

Cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) has the potential to be used as a useful, simple, and cheaper tool to assess T-cell (T lymphocyte) function. Methods: Seventeen patients with CVID, a rare disease, received two doses of the mRNA-based Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Humoral Immune Response (HIR) was determined by measuring specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, and Cellular Immune Response (CIR) was evaluated using an ex vivo interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) and in vivo by DTH skin test. Results: Two weeks after the second dose of the vaccine, 12 out of 17 CVID patients have high optical density (OD) ratios of specific anti-spike protein (S) IgG whereas five patients were negative or low. Ex vivo CIR was considered positive in 14 out of 17 S1-stimulated patients. Unspecific stimulation was positive in all 17 patients showing no T-cell defect. A positive DTH skin test was observed in 16 CVID patients. The only patient with negative DTH also had negative ex vivo CIR. Conclusions: The use of DTH to evaluate CIR was validated with an optimal correlation with the ex vivo CIR. The CIR after vaccination in patients with antibody deficiencies seems to have high precision and more sensitivity to antibodies-based methods in CVID. Clinical Implications: There is a remarkable correlation between cutaneous DTH and ex vivo IGRA after COVID vaccination. A COVID-specific skin DTH test could be implemented in large populations. Capsule Summary: Cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity has the potential to be used as a useful, simple, and cheaper tool to assess T-cell functioning.",

The present study intended to uncover the protective effects of SEV on sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (SI-AKI) and its possible mechanism. Human renal tubular epithelial cell HK-2 was treated with 10 μg/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to construct SI-AKI cell model. LPS-induced HK-2 cells were pretreated with SEV in the absence or presence of EX527, an inhibitor of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), after which were the detection of cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Our results demonstrated that LPS caused decreased cell viability, increased LDH release, improved cell apoptosis along with decreased expression of Bcl2 and enhanced expressions of Bax, cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase, enhanced production, and protein expressions of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), but contributed to declined activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). LPS inhibited SIRT1 and IκBα expressions but up-regulated p-NF-κB p65 and acetyl-p53 expressions as well. However, SEV pretreatment abolished all above-mentioned effects of LPS on HK-2 cells, while EX527 significantly reversed the effects of SEV. In conclusion, SEV effectively protected HK-2 cells against LPS-induced apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress, and these effects may depend on the increase of SIRT1 expression, thereby inactivating NF-κB signaling.",

Questionnaires were collected from 6–7-year-old 2388 children and analyzed in particular for their diet and asthma symptoms as part of this study. The prevalence of current asthma (CA) was 9%, doctor-confirmed asthma (DCA) was 7%, and current severe asthma (CSA) accounted to 2.9%. Two Mediterranean Diet Scores (MDS) were performed to evaluate adherence of these children to the Mediterranean diet. Principal component analysis generated four dietary patterns. The relationship between asthma and each food type, MDS, and dietary patterns was assessed using multivariate adjusted logistic regression. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet by Salamanca’s children and prevalence of asthma in Salamanca were similar to the findings of coastal located centers of other studies. High punctuation in MDS was associated with high prevalence of asthma. Higher scores for the pattern “Fats and sugar” was associated with less current asthma but not with DCA or CSA. These findings might be due to improvement in the diet of asthma children, reverse causation factor, how the questionnaire collected information about diet, and perhaps the manner in which the scores were constructed. The complexity of interconnections between nutrients, foods, and dietary patterns, and the heterogeneous nature of asthma, makes it difficult to identify single factor that affected its development. Our findings require corroboration by additional studies.",

    "abstract": "Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is an abnormal immune response caused by milk proteins and is most common in infancy and early childhood. Statistics revealed up to 7.5% of children suffered from milk allergy. Its clinical symptoms were characterized by diversity, non-specificity, and can affect multiple systems, including the digestive tract, skin, and respiratory tract. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of IL-12, IL-16, and IL-17A on diagnosing and monitoring CMPA in children for clinical treatment.A total of 158 infants with CMPA and 89 healthy babies were recruited and evaluated. Demographic and clinical information of all participants were recorded. An extensive analysis of inflammatory cytokine levels, including IL-12, IL-16, and IL-17A, was performed in blood samples from 247 infants younger than 9 months. Meanwhile, the serological specificity immunoglobulin E (sIgE) levels were evaluated. In addition, the area under the curve (AUC) values of IL-12, IL-16, and IL-17A in differentiating CMP from healthy babies were measured by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Finally, the correlation between sIgE and IL-12, IL-16, and IL-17A levels were detected using Spearman correlation analysis.Compared with healthy control, infants who developed CMPA had decreased IL-12, increased IL-16, and IL-17A. Moreover, a significant correlation between serum IL-12, IL-16, IL-17A and sIgE levels was observed in the CMPA group. In addition, AUC values of IL-12, IL-16, and IL-17A in discriminating CMPA from healthy infants were 0.8425, 0.9196, and 0.8813, respectively. Finally, IL-12 was increased while IL-16 and IL-17A levels were decreased in the CMPA group after three months of milk avoidance treatment.We found that IL-12, IL-16, and IL-17A levels in children with CMPA were associated with SCORAD scores, sIgE levels, and disease severity, functioning as valuable disease-monitor markers in CMPA.",

    "abstract": "Background: Chronic urticaria (CU), characterized by daily wheals and/or angioedema lasting more than 6 weeks, is a common skin disease. CU is classified as spontaneous or inducible. Because of Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, face-to-face visits were reduced, and many centers started remote consultations to minimize hospital admissions and risk for viral diffusion. Telemedicine became a valuable tool for evaluating and monitoring patients with chronic diseases, such as CU. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of telemedicine as a means for the follow-up of patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we collected data related to CSU evolution and treatment by remote consultation. Moreover, we specifically investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination on CSU in relapsing or worsening of such a disease. Methods: The electronic charts were reviewed for patients diagnosed with CSU, who were referred to the allergy unit of Meyer Children’s Hospital, Florence. For each patient, a review of demographic characteristics, diagnostic workup, efficacy, and tolerability of the treatment was performed. Patients with a physical agent triggering CU were excluded from the study. Disease activity was monitored using the Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7). In addition, when the COVID-19 pandemic started, follow-up continued through telemedicine after an initial face-to-face visit when possible. Approximately 1 year after the diagnosis of CSU, patients were recontacted to investigate whether they had experienced a relapse or worsening of urticaria during a possible COVID-19 or immediately after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Results: From January 2020 to March 2021, 84 cases of CSU were identified, with 71 (84.5%) of these being evaluated via televisit (remote consultation). During the remote follow-up period, 38/71 (53.5%) patients who were evaluated via televisit recovered completely from CSU, while 24 (33.8%) made therapy adjustments, and 9 (12.7%) had to discontinue follow-up through remote visits and return to face-to-face visits. In February 2022, we recontacted the 71 patients with CSU, and 50 (70.4%) of them answered by phone call interview. Four (19.2%) of the 26 patients who had COVID-19 showed CSU relapse, while 1 (3.8%) had a CSU worsening. Instead, 1 (3.8%) patient of the 26 who were vaccinated had a relapse of CSU, and 1 (3.8%) had a worsening of CSU, both after the first dose. Conclusion: Our data showed that telemedicine can be an effective tool for the follow-up of patients with CSU. Moreover, COVID-19, as well as COVID-19 vaccination, may trigger CSU relapse or worsening, but both are unspecific triggers, and urticaria shows a very short duration in most cases.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects about 6% of women worldwide. It is associated with reproductive and metabolic dysfunction. Caffeine is naturally found in tea, cocoa, and coffee. It has been shown that caffeine can change hormonal profiles, stimulate ovulation, and enhance fertility. Therefore, in this study, the effects of caffeine on rats with PCOS were investigated. For this purpose, 40 female rats were divided into five groups: (1) control group (without any intervention), (2) sham group (administration of olive oil as a caffeine solvent), (3) PCOS group (injection of 2 mg of estradiol valerate for each rat), (4) caffeine group (administration of 37.5 mg/kg caffeine for each rat), and (5) PCOS + caffeine group. After 21 days of treatment, the ovaries of rats were removed and prepared for further evaluations, including hematoxylin and eosin staining, TUNEL assay, real-time PCR, and biochemical analysis. Administration of caffeine in PCOS mice considerably reduced both the volume of the ovary (P < 0.05) and follicular clusters (P < 0.01). However, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase were dramatically active in the PCOS + caffeine group compared to others (P < 0.05). Besides, caffeine treatment in PCOS mice led to Bax reduction and increased Bcl-2 expression. On the other hand, the expression of IL-6 and TNF-α in PCOS + caffeine group was high compared to other groups. We found that caffeine can reduce apoptosis and inflammation in PCOS ovaries and enhance the unpleasant symptoms of PCOS.",

Protopine isolated from different plants has been investigated to understand its special functions on varied diseases. However, the regulatory effects of protopine on the progression of IBD remain unclear. Our study is aimed to explore the effects of protopine on the progression of IBD and its underlying regulatory mechanism of action.The cell viability was assessed through MTT colorimetric assay. The protein expressions of genes were examined by Western blot analysis. The cell apoptosis and reactive oxygen species level were measured using flow cytometry. The levels of inflammation and oxidative stress-related proteins were tested through enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay. The intracellular Ca2+ concentration and mitochondrial membrane potential were measured through immunofluorescence assay.First, different concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were treated with NCM460 cells to establish IBD cell model, and 5-μg/mL LPS was chosen for followed experiments. In this study, we discovered that protopine relieved the LPS-induced inhibited intestinal epithelial cell viability and enhanced cell apoptosis. Moreover, protopine attenuated LPS-stimulated inflammation activation and oxidative stress. Further experiments illustrated that the increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential stimulated by LPS were reversed by protopine treatment. Finally, through Western blot analysis, it was demonstrated that protopine retarded the activated NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways mediated by LPS.Protopine alleviated LPS-triggered intestinal epithelial cell injury by inhibiting NLRP3 and NF-κB signaling pathways to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress. This discovery may provide a useful drug for treating IBD.",

    "abstract": "Acute lung injury (ALI) is a critical clinical syndrome with high rates of incidence and mortality. However, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. The current work aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms of ALI by identifying different expression genes (DEGs) and candidate drugs using a combination of chip analysis and experimental validation.Three microarray datasets were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to obtain DEGs. We conducted a Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway-enrichment analyses of overlapping DEGs among three databases. The expression level of key gene was verified by Western blotting analysis in LPS-treated ALI cell models. Finally, we predicted the candidate drugs targeting the key gene that might be effective for ALI treatment, and the role of candidate drug in treating ALI was verified by investigation.A total 29 overlapping DEGs were up-regulated in LPS-induced ALI groups. They were enriched in inflammation and inflammation-related pathways. Serpin family A member 3 (SERPINA3) was defined as a key gene because it was associated with inflammation pathway and up-regulated in microarray datasets in LPS-induced ALI. In LPS-induced human bronchial epithelial cells transformed with Ad12-SV40-2B (BEAS-2B) cells, SERPINA3 was enhanced. Pyridoxal phosphate as an upstream drug of SERPINA3 could improve cell viability and reduce expression inflammatory factors in LPS-treated BEAS-2B cells.Our study suggested that pyridoxal phosphate could be a candidate drug targeting SERPINA3 gene in LPS-induced ALI. It has protective and anti-inflammatory effects in BEAS-2B cells, and may become a potential novel treatment for ALI.",

Cell viability and apoptosis in response to LPS and decursin in BEAS-2B and HPAEC cells were, respectively, evaluated by MTT colorimetric and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays. The oxidative stress and inflammatory response in LPS-treated BEAS-2B and HPAEC cells were detected by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay. In addition, the role of decursin in nuclear -factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation was analyzed by immunoblot and immunofluorescence assays.Our data revealed that decursin could alleviate the viability of LPS-induced BEAS-2B and HPAEC cells. Decursin could also reduce LPS-induced oxidative stress in BEAS-2B and HPAEC cells. In addition, it could reduce LPS-induced inflammation in BEAS-2B and HPAEC cells.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that the up-regulation of microRNA miR-328-3p expression increases seasonal allergy and asthma symptoms in children, but the specific mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the role and mechanism of -miR-328-3p in transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-induced airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs).The effect of TGF-β1 on the expression of miR-328-3p in ASMCs was examined by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cells proliferation, migration, and inflammatory factors in TGF-β1-induced ASMCs were measured by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), transwell, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Besides, TargetScan was used to predict phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), the downstream target of miR-328-3p; double-luciferase reporter assay, western blot, and qRT-PCR were used to verify the targeting relationship between miR-328-3p and PTEN; western blot was also used to examine the effects of PTEN and miR-328-3p knockdown on the expression levels of PTEN, Akt, and p-Akt proteins.The expression of miR-328-3p was up-regulated in TGF-β1-induced ASMCs. Knockdown of miR-328-3p significantly inhibited proliferation, migration, and inflammation of ASMCs induced by TGF-β1 and decreased levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β. The dual--luciferase reporter assay results confirmed that PTEN was a target gene of miR-328-3p. Moreover, inhibition of PTEN expression reversed the inhibitory effect of low miR-328-3p expression on -TGF-β1-induced ASMC's proliferation, migration, and inflammation. In comparison to the knockdown of miR-328-3p alone, the simultaneous knockdown of miR-328-3p with PTEN decreased PTEN protein expression levels and increased p-Akt/Akt ratio in TGF-β1-induced ASMCs.Through regulating the expression of PTEN and the activity of Akt signaling pathway, miR-328-3p promotes TGF-β1-induced proliferation, migration, and inflammation of ASMCs.",

    "abstract": "Pediatric asthma is a common chronic disease of childhood with airway inflammation. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB) plays a significant role in the transcription of proinflammatory genes, but its role in pediatric asthma has remained unclear. Herein, we investigated the functions of CREB in pediatric asthma.Eosinophils were purified from the peripheral blood of interleukin 5 (IL5) transgenic (IL5T) neonatal mice. The contents of CREB, long-chain fatty-acid-CoA ligase 4, transferrin receptor protein 1, ferritin heavy chain 1, and glutathione peroxidase 4 in eosinophils were examined by Western blot analysis. The viability of eosinophils, and the mean fluorescence intensity of Siglec F, C-C motif chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3), and reactive oxygen species were examined by flow cytometry. The concentration of iron in eosinophils was assessed by a commercial kit. The contents of malondialdehyde, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, IL-5, and IL-4 were discovered by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay. The C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into four groups: sham, ovalbumin (OVA), OVA+Ad-shNC, and OVA+Ad-shCREB. The bronchial and alveolar structures were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Leukocytes and eosinophils in the blood were measured using a HEMAVET 950.The abundance of CREB in eosinophils was enhanced by CREB overexpression vector transfection, but reduced by short hairpin (sh)CREB transfection. Downregulation of CREB triggered the cell death of eosinophils. Knockdown of CREB could obviously contribute to ferroptosis of eosinophils. In addition, downregulation of CREB facilitated dexamethasone (DXMS, a type of glucocorticoid)-induced eosinophils death. Moreover, we established an asthma mouse model by OVA treatment. The CREB was upregulated in OVA group mice, but Ad-shCREB treatment obviously downregulated CREB level. Downregulation of CREB diminished OVA-induced asthmatic airway inflammation by reducing the number of inflammatory cells and the levels of proinflammatory factors. Downregulated CREB enhanced the anti-inflammatory effect of DXMS in OVA-induced mice.Inhibition of CREB promoted the effect of glucocorticoids on airway inflammation in pediatric asthma through promoting ferroptosis of eosinophils.",

    "abstract": "Background: Globally, pneumonia has been associated as a primary cause of mortality in children aged less than 5 years. Dihydrokaempferol (DHK) has been proposed for being correlated with the process of various diseases. Nevertheless, whether DHK has a role in the progression of infantile pneumonia remains unclear. This study aimed at exploring whether DHK was involved in the progression of infantile pneumonia. Methods: Human fibroblast cells WI-38 were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The viability of WI-38 cells was measured via Cell counting kit-8. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate the levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Western blot analysis revealed the protein levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, Bax, and cleaved-caspase 3. Flow cytometry was applied for exploring the apoptosis of WI-38 cells. The concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were assessed via enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay. Results: DHK modulated the viability of WI-38 cells in infantile pneumonia. Furthermore, we identified that DHK treatment inversely changed LPS induction-mediated elevation on the levels of inflammation biomarkers. Besides, DHK counteracted LPS-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in WI-38 cells. DHK also decreased LPS-induced elevation of WI-38 cells apoptosis and mediated the levels of apoptosis-associated indexes. Moreover, modulating sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) protein level was lowered by the induction of LPS, and was reversed by DHK treatment. In addition, DHK counteracted LPS induction-mediated elevation of p-p65 and phosphorylated inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit alpha (p-IκBα) protein levels. Conclusion: DHK alleviated LPS-induced WI-38 cells inflammation injury in infantile pneumonia through SIRT1/NF-κB pathway. The results shed light on the implications of DHK on the prevention and treatment of infantile pneumonia.",

This study evaluates our experience with Tezepelumab for those patients who received the indicated drug off-label prior to its commercialization. Methods: We conducted a real-life observational study on three patients from the Severe Asthma Unit of the Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada, Spain, who received Tezepelumab off-label before its official approval. We analyzed symptoms control based on ACT, exacerbations, reductions in the doses of oral corticosteroid, lung function, blood changes and safety at 3 months of treatment. Results: Tezepelumab demonstrated efficacy in improving asthma control and a notable reduction in emergency department visits. OCS use decreased, with one patient halving their prednisone dose. Lung function, particularly FEV1 and FEV1/FVC parameters, improved, but no significant changes were observed in FeNO levels, blood eosinophil counts and total IgE. The treatment exhibited a favorable safety profile with no reported adverse effects during the study period. Conclusions: In this preliminary real-world experience prior to the official approval of tezepelumab in Spain, this monoclonal antibody showed promising results and suggests its potential as a valuable alternative for the treatment of severe asthma.",

    "abstract": "Background: Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is one of the most prevalent forms of primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID). CVID is characterized by failure in the final differentiation of B lymphocytes and impaired antibody production but the pathogenesis is not known in the majority of patients. We postulated that the expression pattern of miRNAs in unsolved CVID patients might be the underlying epigenetic cause of the disease. Therefore, we aimed to assess the expression of hsa-miR-210-5p and FOXP3 transcription factor in CVID cases in comparison with healthy individuals. Methods: Eleven CVID cases with no genetic defects (all PID known genes excluded) and 10 sex and age-matched healthy individuals were enrolled in the study. T lymphocytes were purified from PBMC, and expression levels of miR-210-5p and FOXP3 mRNA were evaluated by real-time PCR. Results: We demonstrated that miR-210 expression in patients was significantly higher than the control group (P = 0.03). FOXP3 expression was slightly lower in patients compared with healthy controls (P = 0.86). There was a negative correlation between miR and gene expression (r: −0.11, P = 0.73). Among various clinical complications, autoimmunity showed a considerable rate in high-miR patients (P = 0.12, 42.8%), while autoimmunity was not observed in normal miR-210 patients. Conclusions: Our results suggest a role for miR-210 in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity in CVID patients. Further studies would better elucidate epigenetic roles in CVID patients with no genetic defects.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Globally, since the outbreak, more than seven million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported. The rapid spread and increase in the number of new cases is due to person-to-person transmission. To further control its transmission, early laboratory diagnosis of both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients is crucial. Presently, the COVID-19 diagnosis of infected individuals is dependent on computed tomography scanning and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The latter is considered more sensitive and efficient for early diagnosis. In this review, general comparisons are made (cases, fatality rate, incubation period, clinical features, and reservoirs) and diag-nostic laboratory procedures (specimens, extraction methods, and positive rates by real-time PCR) are compared between SARS, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and SARS-2. In total, 8982 SARS-2 suspected patients specimen data were retrieved, in which 40.9% (n = 3678) were detected as positive by real-time PCR. The specimen-wise high detection rate was observed from bronchoalveolar lavage, followed by saliva, nasal swabs, and sputum. As the COVID-19 cases are persistently increasing, the selection of appropriate specimens and laboratory assay would help in rapid and timely diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Several studies have shown interactions between food allergy (FA) and asthma, but the influence of FA in asthma traits has been scarcely studied. Methods: A real-world retrospective observational study was conducted among patients between 3 and 18 years old referred to our Asthma Clinic from November 2014 to November 2017. Data were obtained from daily clinical practice. Only patients properly diagnosed with asthma and FA were included. Results: 815 patients were included: 483 asthmatics and 332 non-asthmatics and 180 FA and 635 no FA. Food allergy was statistically more prevalent among asthma patients (p = 0.014). In a high pollen exposure area, Madrid, among subjects with asthma (121 FA, 362 no-FA), sensitization to lipid transfer protein (LTP) (p = 0.016, OR: 3.064, RR: 2.512) and pollen (p = 0.016, OR: 3.064, RR: 2.512) are risk factors to have a concomitant FA diagnosis, whereas sensitization to profilin is not. Peripheral blood eosinophils were higher in subjects with asthma and FA (≥450 eos/µL) than in asthmatics without FA (≤300 eos/µL) (p = 0.031). Blood eosinophilia, using a cut-off &gt;300 eos/µL, was only present in the FA group. Therefore, this trait should be considered when phenotyping a patient as eosinophilic asthma. Sex had an impact on several variables: height, weight, BMI, blood eosinophils count, sensitization profile, and early-onset asthma. Conclusions: Asthma and FA are closely related and the presence of FA should be investigated in every asthma patient. This study shows an association between asthma with concomitant FA and sensitization to pollen and LTP, blood eosinophilia, and growth alterations. Differences between boys and girls were also described, so a sex-specific approach is recommended.",

The study objective was to describe factors associated with asthma, confirm ARFS score validity among Lebanese preschool children, and develop a risk score for asthma diagnosis in this age group (Pre-School Asthma Risk Factor Scale [PS-ARFS]). Methods: A cross-sectional study enrolled 515 preschool children (November 2018 and March 2019). The ARFS is a 15-item tool that assesses children’s environmental exposure, parental history of asthma, and dietary habits.Results: The percentage of asthmatic children was 8.2%. Higher odds of asthma in children were associated with living near a prairie sprayed with pesticides (odds ratio [OR] = 2.33), playing out-doors (OR = 2.89), having a heater in the bedroom (OR = 10.73), attending a nursery (OR = 2.91), having a mother who smokes cigarettes (OR = 3.35) or water pipe (OR = 2.46), a sister with a history of seasonal allergy (OR = 6.81), and a parental history (mother and father) of asthma (OR = 6.15 and OR = 9.83, respectively). Higher ARFS scores (OR = 1.144) were associated with higher odds of asthma. Accordingly, the PS-ARFS was created according to the following formula: ARFS score + (playing out-door × 2.4) + (heating system in the bedroom × 12.9) + (having attended a nursery × 2.5) (area under the curve = 0.908 [0.860–0.957]; P &lt; 0.001); at value: 14.20, Se = 84.3% and Sp = 90.9%.Conclusion: PS-ARFS is suggested for screening of asthma in preschool children in an epidemiological setting and in the absence of spirometry.",

    "abstract": "Background: Several markers that influence the clinical course of atopic dermatitis (AD) have been investigated so far. Thymus and activation regulated chemokine (TARC) – a Th2-related cytokine – increase in various atopic diseases. It has been shown that vitamin D affects Treg cells and immune responses. Zinc as an essential trace element for cell–cell interactions, cellular differentiation, and proliferation. However, the effect of these markers on infantile AD and disease severity are mostly unknown.Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between TARC, vitamin D, zinc levels, and the disease severity in infants with AD.Method: AD patients (n = 160) with age and sex that matched healthy controls (n = 79) were included in the study. The diagnosis of AD was made based on the Hanifin–Rajka criteria. The objective SCORAD index was used for the assessment of disease severity.Results: A total of 160 patients (male 71.9%) with AD were included in the study. The median age of onset of symptoms was 2 (1.0–3.5) months. The lesions initially started on face 76.9%, neck 6.9%, extremities 7.5%, and body 8.8%. Nearly 40% of the patients were found to be atopic. Food allergy was found in 39.4%. The median of objective SCORAD index was 27.5 (17.5–40) in the study group. The TARC levels of AD patients were higher than control group [1803 pg/ml (1006– 3123) vs 709 pg/ml (504–1147), p &lt; 0.001] There was a significant correlation between objective SCORAD scores and TARC values in subjects with AD (r = 0.363, p &lt; 0.001). As the severity of AD increased, vitamin D levels decreased (p for trend 0.015) and TARC values increased (p for trend &lt; 0.001). Serum zinc levels did not change with the severity of the disease. The presence of atopy did not have an influence on serum TARC, zinc, and vitamin D levels.Conclusion: In infants with AD, disease severity is positively related with TARC levels; and inversely proportional to vitamin D levels. TARC levels differ between patients and healthy controls. The presence of atopy has not been shown to affect these markers.",

Scientific evidence regarding a causal relation-ship between FC and cow’s milk allergy is controversial, as it is also reported by the latest European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition-North American Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN–NASPGHAN) rec-ommendations. In the case of FC, routine allergometric tests are not recommended and the cows’ milk-free diet is only proposed in the case of laxative-resistant constipation and only following the advice of an expert. Instead, after a careful review of the literature and in view of the many clinical cases encountered in our clinical practice, we believe that it is useful to propose cows’ milk-free diet as first line for the treatment of FC at least in pre-school children and in children with a personal or family history of atopy or with a previous diagnosis of cow’s milk protein allergy.",

    "abstract": "Background: Pollen-food allergy syndrome (PFAS) usually manifests as an itching sensation in the mouth and throat immediately after eating fresh fruits and vegetables. However, some patients with PFAS experience systemic symptoms including anaphylaxis. In Europe, cypress gibberellin-regulated protein (GRP) has been noted to cause allergenicity and exhibit cross-reactivity with peach GRP. Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica), classified in the cypress family, is the primary causative substance among all environmental allergens in Japan. However, studies on the prevalence of GRP sensitization in patients with cedar pollinosis are lacking. Objective: This study examined the prevalence of GRP sensitization in patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis. Methods: We enrolled 52 patients who had requested sublingual immunotherapy treatment with mild-to-severe rhinitis during spring, and had a JCP-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels of &gt;0.7 UA/mL. Peach GRP was purified using affinity chromatography with a monoclonal antibody column. Specific IgE levels to peach GRP were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Samples exhibiting absorbance at 450 nm of over mean plus three standard deviations of the negative control value were defined as positive. Sera from three patients with severe peach allergy were used as positive controls. Results: Eleven sera from 52 patients with JCP-induced allergic rhinitis were positive for peach GRP. Conclusion: Twenty percent of patients with cedar pollinosis were sensitized to peach GRP. Well-powered studies are needed to clarify whether these patients are at an increased risk for systemic symptoms or whether they primarily demonstrate only localized symptoms.",

The aim of this study is to evaluate the experiences and attitudes of parents of children with allergy to cow’s milk and other FA. Materials and methods: The parents of children with FA were asked to complete an 18-item questionnaire to evaluate the FA history and experiences during diagnosis, treatment, and follow up. Results: The data from 558 (91.2%) survey questionnaire that were filled completely were analyzed. The mean age of the parents was 33.4+4.9. It was found that most common food allergen was cow’s milk (85.3%). The mean time to diagnosis from the onset of symptoms was 10.9±18.4 months. Around 229 parents (41.6%) admitted to at least four different physicians and 68 (12.3%) parents admitted to at least five different physicians before diagnosis. The median time to diagnosis from the onset of symptoms was five (1-108) months in the patients admitted to four or more physicians, but it was one (1-48) month in the patients that admitted to less physicians (p˂0.001). The most common symptoms were dermatitis and mucus-bloody stool, the least common ones were cardiovascular symptoms. Only 21.1% of the patients were able to use hypoallergenic formulas (HAF) in accordance with the recommendation of the physician. Conclusions: Delayed diagnosis of FA is a major concern, and during this period the patients admit many physicians. A majority of the patients with CMPA experience difficulties while using HAFs, and only one-fifth of them is able to use formula regularly.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a heterogeneous and complex chronic airway disease with a high incidence rate, characterized by chronic airway inflammation. Although the anti-inflammatory effect of zeaxanthin has been demonstrated in various disease models, its explicit role in allergic asthma remains elusive.An allergic asthma model was established by ovalbumin (OVA) stimulation in BALB/c nude mice. The pathological examination, collagen deposition and expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in lung tissues were determined by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), MASSON and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. Besides, the effect of zeaxanthin on inflammation and oxidative stress was assessed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and spectrophotometry measure. Moreover, the underlying mechanism was analyzed by detecting the expression of phosphorylated p38 (p-p38), p38, β-catenin, p-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK) and JNK with western blot assays.The distinct infiltration of inflammatory cells was observed in the OVA-induced asthma mice model with significantly increased concentrations of immunoglobulin E (IgE), interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, IL-13 and eotaxin (p˂0.001), which were prominently reversed by zeaxanthin treatment (p˂0.001). In addition, zeaxanthin treatment decreased the OVA-induced collagen deposition and α-SMA expression. A similar inhibitory effect of zeaxanthin on the oxidative stress was also observed in the OVA-induced asthma mice model, as evidenced by the prominent decrease of malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration and the remarkable increase of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S transferase (GST) and Glutathione (GSH) concentrations (p˂0.001). Moreover, zeaxanthin introduction markedly reduced the relative expressions of p-p38/p38, β-catenin and p-JNK/JNK in the OVA-induced asthma mice model (p˂0.001), indicating that zeaxanthin suppressed the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK)/β-catenin signaling pathway in the OVA-induced asthma mice model.Zeaxanthin attenuated OVA-induced allergic asthma in mice via modulating the p38 MAPK/β-catenin signaling pathway.",

Orientin, a flavonoid compound, is closely related to diverse pathological processes. Nevertheless, the role of orientin in RA is still unknown. Methods: The cell viability was tested through cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) assay, and the number of cell colonies was calculated via colony formation assay. In addition, flow cytom-etry assay was employed to detect apoptosis rate in human RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLS). Besides, Transwell assay was introduced to determine cell migratory and invasive abilities. Moreover, the level of cytokines (IL-8, IL-1β, and IL-6) was estimated with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent serologic assay. Furthermore, western blotting analysis was used to test the protein levels of cleavedcaspase-3, Bax, BCL-2, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p-P38, and phospho-extracellular signal-related kinase. Results: Orientin inhibited cell viability, migration as well as invasion in a concentration-dependent manner in human RA-FLS. Additionally, treatment of orientin facilitated apoptosis and decreased the secretion of cytokines induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in human RA-FLS. Moreover, orientin inactivated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-related signaling pathway, notably in human RA-FLS. Conclusion: These findings confirmed that orientin inhibited human RA-FLS development and decreased TNF-α-induced inflammatory factors, at least partly, by modulating MAPK-signaling pathway, which implied that orientin might be an effective agent for treating RA.",

The aim of the present study is to describe super-responders to benralizumab in a series of 79 patients who completed at least 1 year of treatment, and to compare super-responders with non super-responders. Methods: This is a multicenter study of the Register of Severe Asthma of the Region of Murcia (RE-ASGRAMUR) Group performed in eight hospitals under the conditions of routine clinical practice. Patients with zero exacerbations and no oral corticosteroid therapy for asthma were considered super-responders. We analyzed clinical, functional, and inflammatory parameters of selected patients.Results: In all, 50 of the 79 patients (63%) met the super-responder criteria. In addition, 36% of the patients (26/71) were considered as complete responders to treatment (superresponder + Asthma Control Test [ACT] ≥ 20 + forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1] ≥ 80%). The super-responders were significantly older in age (P = 0.0029), had higher eosinophils count (P = 0.0423), higher proportion of nasal polyps (P = 0.036), and they had less severe disease at baseline. After 1 year of treatment, the super-responders had higher levels of ACT questionnaire (23 vs 19, P = 0.0007) and better percentage of FEV1 (83 vs 75, P = 0.0359). Conclusion: Almost two of the three patients treated with benralizumab were super-responders after 1 year of treatment and 36% had a complete response. Super-responders were associated with older age, higher eosinophils count, had nasal polyposis as comorbidity, and had less severe disease at baseline.

Clinical signs and symptoms were similar to other autoimmune diseases, having periods of remission and relapses. Other correlations between AD and autoimmune diseases have been described, and patients with AD can also present with a wide range of autoimmune comorbidities. Three major factors contribute to the pathogenesis of AD: damage of the skin barrier, disorders of the immune response, and imbalances of the skin microbiome-all based on genetic changes and influenced by environmental factors. Predominant activation of Th 2 cells, with the increase of Th 1, Th 17, and Th 22 subsets, promotes skin inflammation. All this evidence suggests that AD might be classified as an autoimmune disease, not just as an allergic reaction.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which mainly leads to diarrhea, fatigue, stool blood, abdominal pain, and cramping, is threatening public health. Tripartite motif-containing 52 (TRIM52) has been reported to play an important role in inflammatory responses via activating the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway. However, the causes of IBD need to be elucidated, and the function of TRIM52 in IBD remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that TRIM52 aggravated inflammation and pyroptosis in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced IBD by activating TLR4/NF-κBs pathway. Methods: The colitis model was established on mice through DSS induction. For the TRIM52 knockdown, the mice were infected with a recombinant adenoviral vector expressing sgRNAs targeting TRIM52. RT-qPCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry were performed to verify TRIM52 expression in DSS-induced IBD. The body weight, disease activity index, colon length, and H&amp;E staining were used to assess the IBD symptoms in mice with TRIM52 knockdown. The inflammatory responses were examined by RT-qPCR and ELISA measuring tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), inter-leukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 1β (IL-1β). Furthermore, the pyroptosis in colon tissue was detected by western blot. Finally, the TLR4/NF-κBs pathway activity was also examined by western blot. Results: TRIM52 expression was up-regulated in DSS-induced IBD, and knockdown of TRIM52 could alleviate the symptoms of IBD. TRIM52 knockdown retarded DSS-induced inflammatory response and inhibited DSS-induced pyroptosis in colon tissue. In addition, TRIM52 played a role in activating TLR4/NF-κBs pathway. Conclusion: Knockdown of TRIM52 alleviated inflammation and pyroptosis in IBD by regulating TLR4/NF-κBs pathway. TRIM52 is expected to be a novel diagnostic indicator for IBD and a target of therapeutic treatment.",

In this review, we will overview and discuss this new per-spective, focusing on the role of Ndfip1 in the proliferation, differentiation, and cell activity of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, mast cells, and eosinophils. This review provides an updated summary of Ndfip1, which will unveil novel therapeutic targets.

Galangin is a flavonoid isolated from Alpinia officinarum, exerts anti-obesity, antitumor, and anti-inflammation pharmacological effects. The roles of galangin in lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs were investigated.BMSCs were isolated from rat bone marrow and identified by flow cytometry. The isolated BMSCs were treated with 1 μg/mL lipopolysaccharides or cotreated with lipopolysaccharides and different concentrations of galangin. Cell viability and apoptosis were detected by MTT (tetrazolium component) and flow cytometry. ELISA was used to detect inflammation. Alizarin red staining was used to investigate osteogenic differentiation.The rat BMSCs showed negative rate of CD34, and positive rate of CD29 and CD44. Lipopolysaccharides treatment reduced cell viability of BMSCs, and promoted the cell apoptosis. Incubation with galangin enhanced cell viability of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BMSCs, and suppressed the cell apoptosis. Galangin decreased levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BMSCs through down-regulation of NF-κB phosphorylation (p-NF-κB). Galangin up-regulated expression of osteo-specific proteins, collagen type I alpha 1 (COL1A1), osteopontin (OPN), and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), to promote the osteogenic differentiation of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BMSCs.

Symptoms started earlier and positive results in SPTs with food allergens were more common in patients with SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis) >25 (p < 0.0001). Egg white (39%), egg yolk (31%), cow's milk (13%) and wheat flour (5%), were the most common allergens, respectively. The SCORAD scores were higher in multiple food sensitized patients' groups (p < 0.001). Although, food sensitizations were prevalent in patients who had higher SCORAD scores (p = 0.001), there was no significant difference in sensitization with aeroallergens. (p = 0.392).Sensitizations to both food and aeroallergens are common in patients with AD. In addition, sensitization to these allergens and SCORAD severity in patients with AD have positive correlation.",

Methods: The data of 88 children with moderate and severe allergic asthma, who were admitted to our hospital between July 2021 and July 2022, were included in the study. The patients were randomly assigned either to control group (n = 44; received budesonide formoterol inhalation therapy) or experimental group (n = 44; received omalizumab subcutaneous injection + budesonide formoterol inhalation therapy) using computer-generated randomization. The clinical efficacy, asthma control (measured using childhood Asthma-Control Test [C-ACT] score), pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s, forced vital capacity, and peak expiratory flow), immune function (cluster of differentiation 3 cells [CD3+ cells], cluster of differentiation 4 cells [CD4+ cells], immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin A, and immunoglobulin E), and adverse reactions were observed and compared between both groups. Results: After treatment, the experimental group had improved levels of pulmonary function and immune function indexes, higher C-ACT scores, and a higher overall response rate than the control group (P &lt; 0.05). In addition, the incidence of adverse reactions was not significantly different between both groups (P &gt; 0.05). Conclusion: The combination of omalizumab with budesonide formoterol for treating moderate and severe allergic asthma in children demonstrated promising clinical efficacy and improved their pulmonary and immune functions, leading to more rational asthma control. The combined regimen demonstrated satisfactory clinical safety and deserved clinical promotion.",

    "abstract": "Objective: This study conducts a bibliometric analysis of literature on the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to explore its research status, hotspots, and development trends, providing ideas and references for further research. Method: We screened literature for treating IBD with TCM from the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC), and used the VOSviewer software (1.6.18) to discover cooperation among countries, institutions, authors, and information on journals, keywords, etc. We use the CiteSpace software (6.2.R2) to analyze co-citation and burst discovery of references. Results: In all, 440 relevant literature papers were searched and screened from the WOSCC database. The results showed that the number of publications concerning treating IBD with TCM has shown a significant growth in the past decade. China is far ahead in terms of article output, occupying a dominant position. The institution with the most published articles is Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The authors who have published most of the articles are Dai Yancheng, Shi Rui, and Zhou Lian. The Journal of Ethnopharmacology published maximum articles in this field, while Gastroenterology was the most cited journal. Ungaro et al.’s article entitled “Ulcerative colitis” (https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(16)32126-2), published in The Lancet in 2017 was the most cited study. The high-frequency keywords mainly include ulcerative colitis, inflammation, NF-κB, expression, traditional Chinese medicine, gut microbiota, activation, mice, cells, etc. Conclusions: The research heat for treating IBD with TCM has risen over the past decade, with studies focusing on three main aspects: clinical studies of TCM, basic pharmacology, and animal experimental research. The research hotspot shifted from pathogenesis, clinical study of TCM, basic pharmacology, and complementary therapies to the study of network pharmacology and the mechanism of action of TCM related to gut microbiota. Network pharmacology and gut microbiota are at the frontiers of research and turning to be the future research trends to provide new insights and ideas for further research for treating IBD with TCM.",

Type 2 polarization may favor increased susceptibility to RIs and associated wheezing. Non-pharmacological remedies are garnering increasing interest as possible add-on therapies. The present preliminary study investigated the efficacy and safety of a new multi-component nasal spray in preschoolers with frequent RIs and associated wheezing. Methods: Some preschoolers with these characteristics randomly took this product, containing lactoferrin, dipotassium glycyrrhizinate, carboxymethyl-beta-glucan, and vitamins C and D3 (Saflovir), two sprays per nostril twice daily for 3 months. Other children were randomly treated only with standard therapy. Outcomes included the number of RIs and wheezing episodes, use of medications, and severity of clinical manifestations. Results: Preschoolers treated add-on with this multicomponent product experienced fewer RIs and used fewer beta-2 agonists than untreated children (P = 0.01 and 0.029, respectively). Conclusions: This preliminary study demonstrated that a multicomponent product, administered add-on as a nasal spray, could reduce the incidence of RIs and use of symptomatic drugs for relieving wheezing in children.",

Objective: To investigate the possible effects of Coptisine (Cop) on the growth, inflammation, as well as FMT of TNF-β1-induced HFL1 cells and uncover the mechanism. Material and Methods: Human fetal lung fibroblast 1 (HFL1) was induced using 6ng/mL TGF-β1 as a model of pulmonary fibrosis. CCK-8, Brdu, and transwell assays indicated the effects on cell growth as well as motility. qPCR and the corresponding kits indicted the effects on cell inflammation. Immunoblot showed the effects on FMT and further confirmed the mechanism. Results: Coptisine inhibits excessive growth as well as motility of TNF-β1-induced HFL1 cells. It further inhibits inflammation and ROS levels in TNF-β1-induced HFL1 cells. Coptisine inhibits the FMT process of TNF-β1-induced HFL1 cells. Mechanically, coptisine promotes the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Conclusion: Coptisine can inhibit the excessive growth, inflammation as well as FMT of lung fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. It could serve as a promising drug of PF.",

    "abstract": "Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a familiar disease, and owns high morbidity and mortality, which critically damages the health of patients. Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 8 (USP8) is a pivotal protein to join in the regulation of some diseases. In a previous report, it was determined that USP8 expression is down-regulated in LPS-treated BEAS-2B cells, and USP8 restrains inflammatory response and accelerates cell viability. However, the regulatory roles of USP8 on ferroptosis in COPD are rarely reported, and the associated molecular mechanisms keep vague. Objective: To investigate the regulatory functions of USP8 in COPD progression. Material and Methods: The lung functions were measured through the Buxco Fine Pointe Series Whole Body Plethysmography (WBP). The Fe level was tested through the Fe assay kit. The protein expressions were assessed through western blot. The levels of tumor necrosis -factor-α, interleukin 6, and interleukin 8 were evaluated through enzyme-linked immunosorbent serologic assay. Cell viability was tested through CCK-8 assay. Results: In this work, it was discovered that overexpression of USP8 improved lung function in COPD mice. In addition, overexpression of USP8 repressed ferroptosis by regulating glutathione peroxidase 4 and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family 4 expressions in COPD mice. Overexpression of USP8 suppressed inflammation in COPD mice. Furthermore, overexpression of USP8 suppressed ferroptosis in COPD cell model. At last, it was verified that overexpression of USP8 accelerated ubiquitin aldehyde-binding protein 1 (OTUB1)/solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) pathway. Conclusion: This study manifested that overexpression of USP8 restrained inflammation and ferroptosis in COPD by regulating the OTUB1/SLC7A11 signaling pathway. This discovery hinted that USP8 could be a potential target for COPD treatment.",

The poor, refugees, and migrant workers who live in feeble conditions are the most vulnerable. The pandemic has caused many people to remain indoors, especially at-risk individuals (e.g., the elderly, diabetics, obese, cardiac, and chronic lung disease patients). Home isolation may be an underlying factor to other health problems among these populations if the place where they are socially isolating is not adequately ventilated. Therefore, understanding the consequences of the relationship between IDP and the COVID-19 pandemic is essential.",

    "abstract": "Aqueous allergen injections, an effective and century-old technique, is considered a second-line approach in daily clinical practice. Inconveniences still surround conventional subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) administration, such as a need for frequent injections, prolonged up-dosing schedules, elevated costs, and the unlikely possibility of a systemic reaction. The intradermal immunotherapy route (IDR) might favorably impact many of the aforementioned issues (Table 1). House dust mite (HDM) allergens are the main perennial sensitizers in the tropics, and as such, are solely employed in immunotherapy treatments.We carried out a year-long real-life study in 25 perennial allergic rhinitis children, symptomatic on exposure to house dust, employing an intradermal low-dose allergen mix consisting of 50 ng of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus/Dermatophagoides farinae and 120 ng of Blomia tropicalis, under a unique cost-wise protocol. Basal symptoms/signs and face Visual Analog Scale (fVAS) scores were recorded for 2 weeks and later compared with those registered throughout the 1-year treatment. Serum-specific IgG4 and IL-10 levels were employed in the assessment of the immune responses.Symptoms/signs and fVAS scores were significantly reduced from days 42 and 49, respectively, and remained so until treatment completion. Increases in specific IgG4's and IL-10 levels reflected significant immune responses. Injections were well tolerated and families reported improved health status (quality of life, QoL).A unique cost-effective immunotherapy alternative for deprived allergic communities in tropical settings is depicted; further research is needed.",

This study aimed to investigate the effect of maternal anxiety and attitudes on adherence to ICS therapy in children with asthma.The patient group included the children with mild to moderate persistent asthma, aged 6-11 years. Healthy children in a similar age range were included as a control group. The patient group was divided into two categories (treatment adherent and non-adherent) according to the regularity of ICS use. All patients were assessed with Childhood-Asthma Control Test (C-ACT), and their mothers were assessed using Parent Attitude Research Instrument (PARI) and Beck's Anxiety Inventory (BAI).A total of 156 children (age: 7.4 ± 1.4 years, F/M: 71/85) with persistent asthma and 60 healthy children (age: 7.5 ± 1.3 years, F/M:25/35) were included in the study. The rate of adherence in children with asthma was 52.6%. Mothers of non-adherent patients had significantly higher BAI scores than those of the adherent patients and controls (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). The number of mothers who indicated that they did not have enough information about asthma and treatment was also higher in the non-adherent group. PARI subtest scores were not different between the adherent and non-adherent groups.In our study, it was found that mothers' anxiety levels and their knowledge about asthma and medications were associated with treatment adherence in children with asthma. Psychological and educational support to the families of children with asthma would improve their treatment adherence and efficacy.",

CRD assesses sensitivity to individual allergen molecules using purified native or recombinant allergens. The present paper reviews the role of CRD in diagnosing CMA, as well as the benefits and limitations of its use, especially in predicting allergy development or acquiring immunotolerance. It examines the possibility of replacing the current gold diagnostic standard with component tests directed against specific milk proteins. In addition, CRD could be helpful in the evaluation of prognosis. However, CRD allows for improvement in clinical management, particularly of polysensitized subjects, there is still no cogent evidence that it offers more efficient CMA diagnostics than existing tests.",

All subjects were under 18 years of age and they had been clinically diagnosed with allergic asthma. The treatment group used high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) purifiers for six consecutive months, and the control group did not use the air filters. Particulate matter (PM) data and dust samples (from bedding and a static point) were collected from the subjects' bedrooms before they started using the air purifiers and each month thereafter. Simultaneously, the subjects were asked to complete a questionnaire for the Asthma Control Test (ACT) or Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT). Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) tests were performed at the start and end of the study. The concentrations of Der p1 and Der f1 were measured in the dust samples.(1) After utilizing the air purifier, the concentrations of house dust mite (HDM) allergens (Der p1+ Der f1) in the dust samples decreased. In addition, the PMindoor/outdoor values significantly decreased. (2) The ACT and C-ACT scores in the treatment group maintained a steady significant upward trend. (3) At the end of the study, the FENO levels in both groups were lower, although the differences were not significant.It is witnessed that HEPA air purifiers can decrease indoor HDM allergen and PM levels and improve the quality of life for allergic asthma patients.",

The incidence of infectious diseases and recurrent bacterial complications shows a clinically relevant difference between both groups. The incidence of childhood asthma was greater and statistically significant in Group 2, with less adherence to breastfeeding.In these cohorts of breastfed patients with good adherence to TMD patterns, there was evidence of a low incidence of childhood asthma and the IRD, more pronounced in the highest adherence Group 1. Some non-TMD foods have been linked to the occurrence of childhood asthma and IRD, as their dietary limitations have contributed to decreasing morbidity.",

Objectives: The objectives of this systematic review were to identify original observational studies published on LAR in children and adolescents and to describe the prevalence and characteristics of this phenotype in the pediatric age group. Methods: A systematic search was performed in PubMed and EMBASE databases. The search was limited to publications on humans, written in English, published between January 1, 2000 and September 20, 2021. Participants had to be under 18 years old and with a diagnosis of LAR confirmed by nasal allergen provocation test (NAPT). Results: Ten articles were identified. Despite the wide variability of protocols, prevalence rates ranged from 3.7 to 83.3% among children previously diagnosed as having nonallergic rhinitis, being markedly lower in Eastern countries (3.7–16.6%) when compared to Western countries (22.3–83.3%). To date, no relevant clinical characteristics capable of differentiating LAR patients from other childhood rhinitis phenotypes have been identified. Conclusions: LAR is an allergic rhinitis phenotype also found in children. Population and regional differences and differences in NAPT protocols may explain the heterogeneity in LAR prevalence rates observed in different parts of the world. In addition to clarifying this large discrepancy, longitudinal studies are also needed to assess the clinical characteristics of the LAR phenotype in the pediatric age group, and its stability into adulthood must be confirmed.",

    "abstract": "Background: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common immune disease of the nasal mucosa characterized with immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic inflammation after exposure to allergens in susceptible population. Previous reports have demonstrated that the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) could reduce allergic inflammation. However, there is little knowledge about whether the culture supernatant of BMSCs (conditioned medium, CM) has similar anti- inflammatory potential in treating AR. Objective: The study aimed to evaluate the immunoregulatory effects of conditioned medium derived from BMSCs (BMSC-CM) on allergic inflammation in an AR mouse model. Material and Methods: The AR murine model was induced by repeated sensitization and challenges with ovalbumin (OVA). Subsequently the allergic symptoms of AR mice, cytokine levels, the histopathological features of the nasal mucosa and T helper 1 (Th1) : T helper 2 (Th2) cells ratio were evaluated. Results: Treatment with BMSC-CM was found as effective as BMSCs in reducing allergic symptoms and inhibiting eosinophilic infiltration in the nasal mucosa. After BMSC-CM or BMSCs administration, the OVA-specific IgE and interleukin 4 levels in serum decreased and interferon gamma level increased compared with AR mice treated with uncultured fresh medium. Flow cytometry analysis revealed a decrease in Th1:Th2 cells ratio after OVA-sensitization and the ratio was reversed by BMSC-CM and BMSCs treatments. Furthermore, the data revealed that BMSC-CM suppressed the production of signal transduction and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) at messenger RNA and protein levels in the nasal mucosa. Conclusion: BMSC-CM could ameliorate allergic inflammation and regulate the balance of Th cells, and the underlying mechanism was closely related to STAT6 signaling pathway. The immunoregulatory effects of BMSCs could be achieved through paracrine function, and nasal dripping of BMSC-CM might be a novel approach for the treatment of AR.",

Airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) with increased cell proliferation and migration abilities serve as important features in the progression of asthma. RAB11A has been shown to aggravate cancer progression and is closely associated with inflammation. Gene analysis discovered that RAB11A exhibited higher expression in asthmatic patients. However, the detailed regulatory function of RAB11A in asthma still needs further investigation.The mRNA and protein expressions of genes were examined through RT-qPCR and western blot. Cell proliferation was examined through MTT and BrdU assays. Cell apoptosis was tested through flow cytometry. The cell migration ability was detected through wound healing and transwell assays. The levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-8, and IL-6 were measured through ELISA.In this study, the mRNA and protein expressions of RAB11A were increased with PDGF-BB treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, the silencing of RAB11A suppressed the proliferation ability of PDGF-BB-mediated ASMCs. Moreover, it was uncovered that the knockdown of RAB11A inhibited the migration ability of PDGF-BB-stimulated ASMCs. Besides, suppression of RAB11A relieved the inflammatory response in PDGF-BB-stimulated ASMCs. Lastly, inhibition of RAB11A retarded the NF-κB and PI3K/AKT pathways.Our results revealed that RAB11A aggravated PDGF-BB-stimulated proliferation, migration, and inflammation of ASMCs through modulating NF-κB and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. This finding implied that the RAB11A may be deemed as a novel and prospective biomarker for asthma treatment.",

    "abstract": "The main goal of this investigation is to find out how solute carrier family 27 member 3 (SLC27A3) is expressed in the lung tissue of mice with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and how it relates to lung function. A model of COPD was established by exposing organisms to cigarette smoke, followed by investigating the role of SLC27A3 in COPD through experiments conducted both in living organisms and in laboratory settings. Knockout mice lacking SLC27A3 were produced through siRNA transfection to investigate lung function and inflammatory response, using methods such as hematoxylin-eosin staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Western blotting was carried out to analyze the expression of SLC27A3. Naïve CD4+ T-cells were stimulated with anti-CD3, anti-CD28, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, and/or interleukin (IL)-6, and their differentiation into Th17 or Treg cells was promoted, as assessed by flow cytometry. The pathway expression of JAK2/STAT3 was detected using Western blotting. Mice with COPD that had higher expression levels of SLC27A3 in their lung tissue display abnormalities in lung architecture and function, as well as an imbalance between Th17 and Tregs and an elevated inflammatory response. In COPD mice with SLC27A3 knockdown, the JAK2/STAT3 pathway was repressed, lung inflammation was decreased, Th17/Treg balance was improved, and lung functioning was improved. In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that downregulating SLC27A3 has the potential to attenuate the inflammatory response, mitigate COPD progression, and rebalance the Th17/Treg ratio by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. These results lay a foundation for utilizing SLC27A3 as a potential therapeutic target to modulate the JAK2/STAT3 pathway for the treatment of COPD, with the aim of enhancing lung function, reducing inflammation, and restoring Th17/Treg equilibrium in a clinical context.",

Objectives: To estimate the frequency and to determine the associated factors of self-reported asthma among children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was employed, and 175 subjects having type 1 diabetes for more than 1 year were included from the pediatrics endocrine clinic. Validated questionnaires from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) were used for data collection. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 23.0. Results: The study included 175 participants (48% boys, 52% girls) with a mean age of 10.9 ± 3.76 years. The majority were of high socioeconomic status, that is, with a monthly family income &gt;15,000 Saudi Riyal (SR) . Notably, 78 participants (44.6%) were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (2–5 years’ duration, and the average age at diagnosis was 7.4 ± 3.27 years). Hospital admissions due to diabetes in the past year were reported in 101 (57.7%) patients. Moreover, 143 (81.7%) participants reported hyperglycemic symptoms, while 125 (71.4%) experienced hypoglycemic symptoms. About 36 (20.6%) participants had self-reported asthma, with wheezing reported in 46 (26.3%) participants. Other sociodemographic and diabetes factors showed no significant associations. The prevalence of self-reported asthma was noted in 36 children with type 1 diabetes (20.6%). The presence of a family history of asthma was the only significant variable associated with self-reported asthma in children with type 1 diabetes (p&lt;0.001). The odds of developing asthma increased by almost 11 times among children with type 1 diabetes who had a positive family history of asthma (p=0.002).

Material and Methods: This observational, cross-sectional, descriptive study included patients with AD who were evaluated with a self-administered instrument, the ADCT. Pearson’s Chi square and Student’s t-tests were used for categorical variables. The association between continuous variables was analyzed with the Pearson and Spearman correlations. Results: A total of 55 patients with AD were included—42 women (76.4%) and 13 men (23.6%). The median age was 24 years (12–63). Regarding the degree of disease control, it was adequate in 23 (41.8%) patients and inadequate in 32 (58.2%). The patient’s sex, age, work activity, residence, and level of education were not statistically significant factors for the degree of control. The most prevalent comorbidity was allergic rhinitis with a higher percentage in those with adequate control (p = 0.049). Treatment with corticosteroids was associated with good disease control (p &lt;0.001). A high positive correlation (r = 0.770, p &lt; 0.001) was found between the SCORAD score and the ADCT score for symptom control. SCORAD and POEM scores showed a direct proportional relationship (r = 0.791; p &lt; 0.001) Conclusions: The ADCT allowed us to determine the degree of control of atopic dermatitis and develop treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Background: Egg allergy is among the most common food allergies in children, significantly affecting the dietary habits and quality of life of both the affected children and their families. This study aims to assess the clinical role of the Basophil Activation Test (BAT) in children with egg allergy and to evaluate its diagnostic accuracy in comparison to other tests. Methods: The study included 46 children with egg allergy. Patients were classified into three groups: IgE-mediated, non-IgE-mediated, and mixed-type allergies. Each patient underwent a Skin Prick Test, serum-specific IgE test, BAT, and Oral Food Challenge. The sensitivity and specificity of each diagnostic test were evaluated. Results: Egg SpIgE positivity was observed in all patients with IgE-mediated allergy (100%) and in 77.78% of those with mixed-type allergy, while only 47.1% of patients with non-IgE-mediated allergy were positive (p = 0.008). BAT positivity was significantly higher in IgE-mediated (72.7%) and mixed-type allergies (50.0%) compared to non-IgE-mediated allergies (17.6%) (p = 0.013). Compared to the oral provocation test, Egg SpIgE had a sensitivity of 0.73 and specificity of 0.33, BAT had a sensitivity of 0.46 and specificity of 0.67, and SPT had a sensitivity of 0.44 and specificity of 0.60. Although Egg SpIgE demonstrated the highest sensitivity, its low specificity makes it less reliable for accurately identifying non-allergic individuals. In contrast, BAT, with its highest specificity and moderate sensitivity, aligns more closely with the oral provocation test in accurately diagnosing egg allergy. Conclusion: When comparing the positivity rates of Egg SpIgE, BAT, and SPT according to allergy types, IgE-mediated allergies showed significantly higher positivity rates. BAT demonstrated high specificity and moderate sensitivity in both IgE-mediated and mixed-type allergies, making it the most compatible test with the oral provocation test for the accurate diagnosis of egg allergy. Given that this test is currently used only for research purposes in our country, it is recommended that BAT be more widely adopted in clinical practice in accordance with guideline recommendations.",

The current pre-birth cohort study aimed to examine the association between maternal anemia during pregnancy and the risk of atopic eczema in Japanese 2-year-olds. Methods: The study included 1354 Japanese mother–child pairs. Maternal anemia during pregnancy was determined based on self-reported iron treatment for anemia during pregnancy. Eczema was defined according to the criteria of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC). Physician-diagnosed atopic eczema was evaluated through a questionnaire completed by the mothers. Results: The prevalence of maternal anemia during pregnancy was 52.8%. The study found that maternal anemia during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of physician-diagnosed atopic eczema in children; with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.79 and a 95% confidence interval of 1.04–3.17. However, there was no observed association between maternal anemia during pregnancy and the risk of eczema as defined by the ISAAC criteria. Conclusions: Although the study relied on self-reported information, it suggested a potential positive association between maternal anemia during pregnancy and the risk of atopic eczema in children.",

This hypersensitivity reaction can occur at any age, including infancy. Recent data, although scarce, show that anaphylaxis is increasingly reported in infancy, with food identified as the leading cause of anaphylaxis cases in this age group. Infants constitute a unique subgroup with specific challenges regarding diagnosis of anaphylaxis due to a variety of factors, such as lack of age-specific diagnostic criteria, inability of infants to describe their symptoms, and the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations that may be mistaken as normal findings. Additionally, there are special issues in reference to the treatment of anaphylaxis during infancy, such as the limited availability of weight-appropriate epinephrine autoinjectors for infants weighing &lt;15 kg. In this study, we review the current literature regarding specific characteristics of anaphylaxis in infants as well as unique challenges in terms of diagnosis, acute treatment, and long-term management of this medical emergency in this vulnerable age group.",

    "abstract": "Background: Hymenoptera venom allergy is a potentially severe allergic reaction in the general population. The only preventative approach in these cases is venom immunotherapy (VIT), which follows different protocols. The recommended initial dose is 0.001–0.1 mcg of venom extract. However, few reports have declared the safety of 1 mcg venom as the starting dose. Methods: The study was conducted on Iranian patients with a history of anaphylaxis to venom. Skin tests confirmed hypersensitivity to honeybee, yellow jacket, and/or paper wasp from subfamily Polistes using Apis melifera, Vespula spp, and Polistes spp venom extracts, respectively. Subsequently, the patients were treated with the cluster protocol. Results: Twenty-two patients (17 males and 5 females, aged 28.3±11.8 years) were enrolled in the study. Skin prick tests and intradermal tests showed positive results for yellow jacket in 17 (77.3%) and 21 (95.4%) patients, honeybee in 14 (63.6%) and 17 (77.3%) patients, and wasp in 14 (63.6%) and 17 (77.3%) patients, respectively. Upon administering the initial dose of 1 mcg/mL, 40.9% (9 cases) of patients presented mild local reactions, including 7 with yellow jacket allergy, 5 with honeybee allergy, and 3 with wasp allergy. One patient with yellow jacket allergy had a mild systemic reaction. Patients with a positive skin test for wasp had significantly lower rate of reactions after the first dose of venom (p=0.026). Throughout the entire build-up phase, more than 90% (20 of 22) of patients experienced mild local reactions, followed by large local reactions (3 cases, 13.6%), mild systemic reactions (1 case at 1 mcg/mL dose), and moderate-to-severe systemic reactions (3 cases, 13.6%). Large local and moderate-to-severe systemic reactions were detected after injecting 50 mcg (each one case) and 100 mcg (each 2 cases) of venom extracts. Conclusion: This study recommends 1 mcg/mL of the venom extract as a safe starting dose for VIT. This accelerated protocol could successfully reduce the time and costs of therapy for patients undergoing out-patient cluster VIT.",

This study aimed to identify the association between the intranasal aerosol technique and symptom improvement. Methods: This is an analytical, prospective, and longitudinal study that included 36 patients diagnosed with AR. The Rhinitis Control Assessment Test (RCAT) questionnaire was administered to both an experimental population and a control group. The 11 steps of the intranasal aerosol technique were explained to the experimental group, and performance was graded using a pamphlet for patient follow-up in subsequent controls. Results: Of the participants, 63.9% were women and 36.1% were men, with a median age of 30 years (IQR 24-42) and an age range from 18 to 69 years. An average RCAT percentage of 55.6% was observed in both groups during the first consultation. On the second visit, a difference in disease control was noted. In the experimental group, 83.3% had controlled symptoms, whereas only 61.1% of the control group did. At the third visit, 76.5% of the experimental group had controlled symptoms, compared to 58.8% of the control group. In the experimental group, 52.9% of patients demonstrated good technique, while only 5.9% in the control group did (p=0.004).

However, factors that may impact treatment response remain to be explored. Objective: This study aimed to examine the factors affecting treatment response in CSU patients receiving omalizumab. Methods: This was a retrospective study that included 123 patients who received omalizumab treatment for CSU between January 2015 and April 2024. After administering omalizumab, we evaluated therapeutic efficacy with the urticaria control test (UCT). According to UCT, patients were classified as complete responders, partial responders, and nonresponders. Results: The median age of the patients was 42 (31–50) years, and there were 77 (62.9%) female patients. Sixty-four (52%) patients exhibited complete response, and 43 (35%) patients exhibited partial response to omalizumab treatment, whereas 16 (13%) patients were nonresponders. Autoimmune disease (AID) was present in 31 (25.2%) patients. The most common AID was thyroid autoimmunity, seen in 24 (77.4%) patients. AID was significantly higher in omalizumab treatment nonresponders than in partial and complete responders. The presence of an autoimmune thyroid disease was an independent risk factor for failure to respond to omalizumab treatment. Baseline IgE levels were significantly higher in omalizumab treatment responders with a complete response compared to those with a partial response and nonresponders. Conclusion: Response to omalizumab treatment was influenced by the presence of an AID and baseline serum total IgE level. A concurrent autoimmune thyroid disease was found to be an independent risk factor affecting failed treatment response. Factors that can predict response to omalizumab treatment can help guide patients to more effective treatment.",

Field stings indicate the effectiveness of immunotherapy.Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of venom-induced anaphylaxis, risk factors, and field sting reactions during or after the completion of VIT.Methods: In this study, the records of patients who underwent VIT between 2015 and 2023 at one of the largest referral hospitals in Turkey were retrospectively analysed. The protocol followed during the initiation of immunotherapy, adverse reactions, clinical characteristics of the patients (including demographic characteristics, allergic diseases, laboratory findings), and field sting reactions during and after completion of immunotherapy were analysed.Results: A total of 194,526 unique patient files evaluated in the Allergy Outpatient Clinic between 2015 and 2023 were analysed. Of these, 384 patients were admitted with an allergic complaint following a bee sting. Among them, 113 patients (29.4%) were eligible for VIT. A total of 79 patients were included (F/M: 41/38). VIT was performed with honeybee venom in 39 patients, vespid venom in 36 patients, and both venoms in 4 patients. 62.0% (n=49) of the patients had been stung by a bee in the head and neck region. 69.6% (n=55) of the patients had a stage 3 reaction before VIT. The cluster scheme was applied to 54.4% (n=43) of all patients. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of field stings or the use of adrenaline autoinjectors between the VIT groups (p&gt;0.05). Stage 3-4 reactions developed in 87.8% of patients stung in the head and neck region, compared to 53.3% of patients stung in other regions. During and after VIT, field stings were reviewed both from patient files and by follow-up inquiries during control visits. During VIT, field stings were observed in 19 patients. Systemic allergic reactions developed in 5 patients, and local allergic reactions developed in 6 patients; no allergic complaints were observed in 8 patients. After VIT was discontinued, 56 field sting reactions developed in 25 patients. Local allergic reactions developed in 9 patients, but no systemic allergic reactions were observed. Mastocytosis was diagnosed in a patient whose tryptase level was 42.4 and whose c-kit mutation was positive following haematological evaluation.Conclusions: This study confirms that the prevalence of venom-induced anaphylaxis was calculated to be 0.058%. Being stung in the head and neck region was identified as a risk factor for the development of stage 3-4 (severe allergic reactions).",

A Delphi study was performed using an online survey designed by a committee of pediatric AIT experts: 46 and 44 panelists participated in Rounds 1 and 2, respectively. In Round 1, 204 statements on 8 dimensions were evaluated (Diagnosis, Therapeutic management, and Pollens - Part I; Mites, molds, animals, hymenoptera venom, and mixtures - Part II).

Panel experts recommended molecular diagnosis for dust mite allergy diagnosis in polysensitized pediatrics and mixtures of nonhomologous mites (Dermatophagoides and Lepidoglyphus) for optimal AIT management. Subcutaneous AIT with mold extracts is recommended, but no agreement was reached on mixing different mold types. Panel experts agreed that Fel d 1 and Can f 1 sIgE are better predictors for animal dander allergy , but no agreement exists on the acceptance of AIT with dander mixtures. Panelists accepted that Api m 2 (hyaluronidase) sIgE indicates Vespid and Apis mellifera cross-reactivity in children; and Api m 4 (melittin) sIgE is a marker of risk for systemic reaction with AIT in Apis mellifera allergy. According to the consensus, SCIT is more suitable for allergen mixtures than SLIT. and agreement was reached for pollen allergens and Alternaria alternata mixtures if stability, safety, and efficacy have been demonstrated.

A Delphi study was performed using an online survey designed by a committee of pediatric AIT experts: 46 and 44 panelists participated in rounds 1 and 2, respectively. In round 1, 204 statements on 8 dimensions were evaluated (Diagnosis; Therapeutic management; Pollens - Part I; Mites; Moulds; Animals; Hymenoptera venom; and Mixtures - Part II). A total of 148 statements were finally accepted after round 2. Panel members rated their level of agreement with assessments on a 9-point Likert scale based on acceptance by ≥ 66.7% of them. According to the results, the polysensitization determination in allergic patients is confirmed by clinical history, skin prick test, total and specific IgE, and molecular diagnostics. Clinical assessments are recommended for the AIT effectiveness evaluation. Follow-ups should be performed 6 months after AIT initiation. According to experts, pollens are the most representative allergens in allergic rhinitis but AIT is more effective in bronchial asthma treatment. The IgE levels are positively related to the intensity of the symptomatology and the efficacy of Grass AIT. In pollen mixtures, a maximum mixture of three AIT allergens is established between Grass, Olive, and Cupressaceae. Mixing pollen from Platanus acerifolia and Parietaria is not recommended. This study provides, where evidence is lacking, current expert-based opinions on clinical decision-making for managing pollen AIT in polysensitized children.",

    "abstract": "Background: The aim of MASK-air® application is to enhance awareness of allergic rhinitis (AR) and its complications, thereby reducing the risk of developing asthma. Objective: The aims of this study were to evaluate the impact of MASK-air® on the quality of life (QoL) and symptomatology of AR patients undergoing allergen immunotherapy (AIT). The study also evaluated patient satisfaction with the application. Materials and Methods: A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted between August and November 2019 at a tertiary Allergy and Immunology center involving patients receiving AIT. Participants were instructed on accessing and utilizing MASK-air® daily through face-to-face interviews. Concurrently, the Score for Allergic Rhinitis (SFAR) and the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) were administered alongside MASK-air® Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores. After 6 months, RQLQ scores were reassessed and a satisfaction survey was conducted. Results: This study comprised 96 patients. Significant correlations were observed among SFAR, RQLQ, and VAS scores. After 6 months of MASK-air® usage, improvements in QoL and symptom reduction were evident. Notably, participants who consistently used MASK-air® demonstrated significant reductions in activity limitations and hay fever scores compared to irregular users (p = 0.05 and p = 0.02, respectively). Additionally, participants under 40 years of age and those with higher education levels exhibited a greater inclination toward online monitoring via the application. Overall, participants found MASK-air® practical, citing various advantages and disadvantages. Conclusion: MASK-air® serves as a valuable tool for physicians in managing treatment and is associated with validated, reliable scales. Its use was linked to enhanced QoL and symptom reduction among participants, irrespective of treatment duration.",

The leading clinical manifestations of NF-κB1 deficiency are recurrent infections and immune dysregulation disorders with autoinflammatory and lymphoproliferative disease. The reported patient initially presented with a neonatal sepsis-like illness with meningitis because of a parechovirus infection. The diagnosis of an inborn error of immunity, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), was established based on hypogammaglobulinemia, impaired antibody response to vaccines, IgG subclass deficiency, and low numbers of switched memory B cells. Molecular genetic testing using trio whole exome sequencing was done to define the background of the presenting phenotype, and it revealed a novel heterozygous variant of NFKB1. Viral meningitis and sepsis-like illness are unusual, previously unreported, infectious complications in NF-κB1 deficiency. The transcriptional NF-κB1 regulatory effect on different target gene repertoires and numerous processes including immune and inflammatory responses may indiacte the vulnerability of deficient patients to severe viral infections. This case report exemplifies the advancement of immunogenetics paving the way for the transition from the initial era of clinical recognition to the era of molecular diagnosis of the pediatric CVID.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Domestic cats are among the most common sources of indoor allergens. There was an increase in indoor allergen exposure, especially cats and house dust mites, as people spent more time at home during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. In this study, our aim was to examine the frequency of cat sensitization and ownership after the COVID-19 pandemic and its relationship with other indoor and pollen allergen sensitizations. Methods: The data of patients who applied to our clinic between 2018 and 2022, with a history of hypersensitivity reaction after contact with cats and diagnosed with cat allergy by positive skin test or specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) level, were examined retrospectively. Skin test was performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. sIgE levels against cat allergens were measured using The Phadia CAP System FEIA method. Results: There has been an increase in the rate of cat ownership (P &lt; 0.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence of cat allergy in 2020 and beyond (5.89%) was significantly higher than the pre-COVID period (4.53%; P &lt; 0.001). The prevalence of concomitant df (dermatophagoides farinae) (1.53–1.58%), dp (dermatophagoides pterynossinus) (1.53–1.48%), and pollen (3.47–3.62%) hypersensitivity before COVID-19 did not differ significantly after COVID, but the prevalence of “penicillium” hypersensitivity before COVID (= 8/5825) was found to be significantly lower (0.14–1.28%). Conclusion: During the pandemic period, both the increase in cat ownership and spending more time indoors seem to have led to an increase in cat allergy. No increase in indoor allergen sensitization other than penicillium accompanying cat allergy was detected.",

    "abstract": "Background: Dieckol (DEK), the main phlorotannin of brown algal, has been regarded as a powerful anti-inflammatory agent in various diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a typical inflammatory autoimmune disease affecting synovial joints. However, the pharmaceutical effect of DEK on RA is still waiting to be unveiled. Methods: A collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model was established and DEK was administered intraperitoneally for three weeks. Paw swelling and histologic analysis were performed to evaluate CIA progression. Inflammatory cytokine and oxidative biomarker expression were assessed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression in synovial joint was assessed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescent (IF) staining. TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining was used to evaluate chondrocyte apoptosis. Western blot assay was performed to determine the expression level of nuclear erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf2), chitinase 3-like protein 1(CHI3L1) and apoptosis-specific proteins. Finally, CHI3L1 overexpression was used to explore its essential role in the biological effect of DEK in vivo. Results: DEK treatment significantly ameliorates paw swelling, inflammatory cell infiltration, chondrocyte apoptosis and vascular pannus formation in CIA rats. Moreover, inflammatory cytokine and oxidative biomarker expression was also attenuated by DEK treatment. Notably, DEK treatment obviously promoted Nrf2 nuclear import and CHI3L1 expression in synovial joint. Overexpression of CHI3L1 by AVV-mediated transfection abrogated the pharmaceutical effect of DEK in vivo. Conclusion: This study provides a promising translational potential of DEK as an anti-rheumatic drug facilitating RA clinical treatment.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is one of the most common childhood diseases. Most children respond to low doses of corticosteroids and/or anti-leukotrienes. However, a small percentage remain symptomatic. They require high doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and anti-leukotrienes, sometimes with long-acting bronchodilators (LABA) and occasionally systemic corticosteroids (SC). However, we frequently observe that the only treatment they receive for exacerbations is short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) and oral corticosteroids (OC) without adding ICS as a maintenance treatment to prevent new episodes. This leads to frequent exacerbations, airflow limitation, and significant alterations in the quality of life. In addition, this results in high resource consumption, frequent emergency room visits, and school absenteeism, leading to absence from work for caregivers. A descriptive, retrospective, observational, and multicenter study was carried out on patients under 12 years of age, who attended pediatric allergy consultations for the first time. The main objective was to determine the consumption of SCs because of respiratory exacerbations in the year before the first consultation. Data were obtained from 144 children, 58.3% male, with a median age of 5 years. It was found that during the year before attending our clinic, 70% had perennial symptoms and were only prescribed with salbutamol on demand when they presented with respiratory symptoms. They had not been prescribed with ICS or anti-leukotrienes. They required attention in the emergency room of their nearest health center or hospital on an average of three times per year. During these exacerbations, almost 75% received SCs(prednisolone), with an average of 2.6 annual cycles (0–12) prescribed in more than half of the cases in the emergency room. In over 80% of the cases, the effects of SC abuse were not previously monitored. The overuse of SC in atopic children with respiratory symptoms was confirmed in our group, which requires considering behavioral changes.",

    "abstract": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a disease of the lung and/or extrapulmonary system characterized by acute, progressive breathing difficulty and refractory hypoxemia. After years of revision, the 2012 International Expert Conference developed a new diagnostic standard for ARDS, known as the Berlin definition, which provides good guidance on how to define and judge the disease in clinical practice. Despite the establishment of diagnostic standards and treatment improvements, ARDS mortality rate still remains high. The primary reason is that the pathophysiology has not been fully elucidated. In patients with ARDS, damage to the alveolar capillary membrane may occur, leading to increased vascular permeability and the occurrence of pulmonary edema. Therefore, exploring the pathogenesis of ARDS from the perspective of microvascular permeability and identification of effective targets may be key factors in the diagnosis and treatment of ARDS. This review presents the current literature regarding the role of miRNAs (micro ribonucleic acids) in early detection and prediction of ARDS outcome.",

    "abstract": "Background: Environmental exposures, climate change, and lifestyle factors are key contributors to respiratory allergies. Understanding the connection between allergen exposure and the development of allergic diseases in early life is essential for identifying sensitization patterns and optimizing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Objective: This study aims to characterize the allergic sensitization profile in a Mediterranean paediatric population using a component-resolved diagnosis (CRD) approach. Specifically, we analyse the prevalence and serodominance of aeroallergens, examine age-related sensitization patterns, and assess their implications for personalized allergen immunotherapy. Additionally, we highlight the need to incorporate the identified molecular allergens into standardized allergenic extracts to improve diagnostic accuracy and immunotherapy efficacy. Methods: We conducted an observational, cross-sectional study including paediatric patients (0–15 years) diagnosed with allergic rhinitis, with or without asthma. Patients were classified according to disease severity following international guidelines. Skin prick tests were performed using standardized extracts, and specific IgE levels were determined with the multiplex assay Allergy Explorer 2 (ALEX2-MADX). Results: A total of 47 patients were included (mean age: 7.5 years). Sensitization to house dust mites (HDM) was the most prevalent (74.5%), followed by pollen (57.4%) and animal epithelia (44.6%). The most frequently recognized allergens were Der p 23 (59.57%) for HDM, Ole e 1 (36.17%) for olive pollen, and Fel d 1 (27.7%) for cat epithelium. The highest IgE levels were observed in children aged 6–10 years. Polysensitization was present in 66% of patients, with frequent co-recognition of allergens from different sources. The findings emphasize the need to ensure that allergenic extracts used in diagnosis and immunotherapy contain relevant molecular components to enhance treatment precision. Conclusion: A detailed molecular characterization of allergic sensitization in paediatric patients provides valuable insights into aeroallergen exposure and its clinical implications. Our findings reinforce the importance of incorporating relevant molecular allergens into standardized diagnostic and therapeutic extracts to optimize patient management and improve the efficacy of allergen-specific immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Background: The nucleocapsid protein (N protein) in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is elevated in bodily fluids at the onset of infection and has recently been found to have a direct role in lung damage. However, the exact mode of action of the N protein in acute lung injury is still unknown. Method: Recombinant N protein was used to treat mice and A549 cells in vivo and in vitro. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and hematoxylin and eosin staining were used to detect the levels of inflammatory factors and lung damage in lung tissue. The total iron and Fe2+ contents and the expression of ferroptosis markers in mouse lung tissues and cells were detected. Co-immunoprecipitation detects the binding of N protein and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11). Replenishment experiments were conducted by activating SLC7A11 to study the effect of SLC7A11 on N protein–induced lung injury. Result: Recombinant N protein caused acute lung injury and lung inflammation, increased total iron and Fe2+ contents in vivo and in vitro, promoted the expression of ACSL4, inhibited the expression of GPX4 and FTH1, and triggered ferroptosis. Recombinant N protein can interact with SLC7A11, and activating SLC7A11 can reverse N protein–induced ferroptosis and acute lung injury. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 N protein can directly interact with SLC7A11 to cause ferroptosis, which produces a lot of inflammatory factors and results in lung injury in mice.",

    "abstract": "Egg allergy is one of the most common food allergies in the paediatric population. It significantly impacts the quality of life of patients and their families. Egg allergy is an adverse reaction mediated by an immune mechanism. There are different mechanisms involved. This review will refer to IgE-mediated egg allergy. The prevalence of egg sensitization and allergy is higher in children with cow's milk allergy and in those with atopic dermatitis. The prognosis for egg allergy in young children is generally good, although in some cases it tends to persist at adult age. The main allergens in egg white are ovomucoid and ovalbumin. Diagnosis is based on the suggestive clinical history and the study of specific positive egg allergy. Oral food Challenge test represents gold standard to confirming the diagnosis. Egg allergy, like other food allergies, is primarily managed with an avoidance diet and symptomatic treatment in case of an allergic reaction. The current approach emphasizes minimizing restrictive diets, if possible. Therefore, obtaining an accurate diagnosis through component-resolved diagnostics is essential and, when necessary, confirming tolerance through oral challenge tests. Food immunotherapy can be potentially curative and can be regarded as a therapeutic option for IgE-mediated egg allergy. It increases the amount of food tolerated and reduces the risk of a life-threatening anaphylactic reaction. There are different approaches: orally, sublingually, subcutaneously, or via epicutaneous. Among these, oral immunotherapy (OIT) is the most extensively studied and widely used in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Penicillin allergy is the most commonly reported drug allergy, often leading to unnecessary avoidance of beta-lactam antibiotics, increased use of alternative broad-spectrum antibiotics, and higher healthcare costs. However, studies indicate that over 90% of penicillin allergy labels are erroneous. This study presents real-world data from a penicillin allergy delabeling program conducted at the Special Hospital for Pulmonary Diseases in Zagreb, Croatia. A total of 132 adult patients with a reported beta-lactam allergy were evaluated with a stepwise diagnostic protocol, including medical history review, skin tests, specific IgE, and drug provocation tests. Five patients were delabeled directly, while 127 underwent diagnostic testing. Among 121 participants who completed the protocol, penicillin allergy was confirmed in 13 (10.74%) patients, and the label was retained in an additional 3 patients because of high-risk history, resulting in an overall confirmed allergy rate of 13.2%. The negative predictive values for STs were 99.07% and 94.39% for immediate and delayed reactions, respectively, while the NPV of sIgE for immediate reactions was 100%. No severe reactions occurred during the diagnostic process. Hundred and five out of one hundred and thirty two (79.5%) patients were safely delabeled. These findings confirm the safety and effectiveness of PAD programs in out-patient settings and highlight the potential for improving antibiotic stewardship by reducing unnecessary beta-lactam avoidance.",

Rho Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDP) beta (ARHGDIB) has been shown to exert protective effects against noxious stimuli in various disease models. Objective: In this study, we investigated whether ARHGDIB knockdown had a protective effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced injury in alveolar epithelial cells and elucidated its underlying molecular mechanisms. Material and Methods: Mouse alveolar epithelial cells that were isolated from the lung of a 5-month-old female mouse (MLE-12) were treated with LPS, followed by ARHGDIB knockdown and overexpression of protein kinase A (PKA)-activated catalytic subunit β (PRKACB). Oxidative stress and apoptosis were assessed, while inflammatory cytokine levels were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent serologic assays. Autophagy and PRKACB/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway activation was evaluated by Western blot analysis. Results: LPS upregulated ARHGDIB expression in alveolar epithelial cells. Silencing ARHGDIB significantly reduced oxidative stress inflammation, and promoted autophagy in LPS-treated MLE-12 cells. ARHGDIB knockdown modulated the PRKACB/NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby promoting autophagy and alleviating LPS-induced cellular injury. Conclusion: This regulatory mechanism significantly reduced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in alveolar epithelial cells, highlighting the protective role of ARHGDIB silencing in LPS-induced lung injury.",

It is well established that dihydrorhodamine (DHR) flow cytometry is the most commonly used screening assay; however, few pediatric immunology centers in Brazil perform this test. This study reports data from a routine diagnostic workup for CGD conducted at a Brazilian children's hospital. A three-year prospective study was performed, enrolling children with clinical features suggestive of immunodeficiency who were screened using DHR. Sanger sequencing of the NCF1 (neutrophil cytosolic factor 1) and CYBB (cytochrome b-245, beta chain) genes was conducted in children with two consecutive abnormal DHR results. A total of 255 patients-62% males-with a median age of 3.2 years (range: 1 month-17.8 years) were evaluated. Six patients (2.4%) had abnormal DHR tests, and four of them (1.6%) received a definitive diagnosis of CGD. Most children presented with pneumonia and/or abscesses during the first year of life as the clinical manifestation of CGD. Two of the four diagnosed patients were receiving continuous antibiotics and two underwent transplantation. Pathogenic variants were identified in NCF1 (three cases) and CYBB (one case). The hospital-based diagnostic workup for CGD identified approximately one new case per 60 tested patients, indicating a high frequency of the disease in the study population. This approach may represent a valuable strategy for identifying new pediatric CGD cases in resource-limited settings.",

The unpredictability of severe reactions is associated with increased anxiety, dietary restrictions, and reduced quality of life. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study including 77 mothers of children (0–12 years) with FA and 71 mothers of healthy children. Participants completed the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale (ZCBS), and European Health Impact Scale (EUROHIS-QOL). Statistical analyses compared anxiety, caregiver burden, and quality of life between groups and explored sociodemographic factors. Results: Mothers in the FA group had significantly higher state anxiety (STAI-S) (P &lt; 0.001) and ZCBS scores (P &lt; 0.001) compared to controls. However, trait anxiety (STAI-T) did not differ significantly between groups (P = 0.508). Additionally, mothers of children with FA reported lower EUROHIS-QOL scores (P = 0.009). Low maternal educational levels (P = 0.005) and middle-range income levels ($500–1000/month, P = 0.027) were significantly associated with higher anxiety and caregiver burden. Cow’s milk protein allergy (CMPA) specifically increased trait anxiety (P = 0.035) and reduced mothers’ quality of life (P = 0.003). No significant associations were found between anxiety or caregiver burden and anaphylaxis or other allergenic triggers. Conclusion: Food allergy significantly elevates maternal anxiety and caregiving burden, and reduces quality of life, especially in CMPA cases. Sociodemographic factors exacerbate these effects, highlighting the need for comprehensive, multidimensional interventions. Psychological support and broader public awareness initiatives may help alleviate adverse outcomes and improve caregiver well-being.",

Ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), a prevalent weed particularly in South America and Europe, is being investigated for its sensitization frequency in the Black Sea region of our country. This study aims to evaluate ragweed and other allergens associated with respiratory allergic diseases in this region and determine their disease frequency. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on patients diagnosed with allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma who attended the Immunology and Allergy out-patient clinic at Samsun Training and Research Hospital between 2017 and 2024. Data from 3,000 diagnosed patients were examined. Results: Of the 3,000 patients, 2,124 (70%) were female and 876 (30%) were male. All patients were diagnosed with allergic rhinitis, while conjunctivitis was observed in 2,300 patients (76%), and asthma was diagnosed in 1,382 patients (46.6%). The most frequently detected allergen was house dust mite (75%). Ragweed pollen was identified as the most common cause of seasonal allergic rhinitis (15%). Moreover, ragweed pollen was found to be the allergen associated with the highest risk of asthma development (p-value: 6.69 × 10−52). Conclusion: Ragweed pollen allergy is common in our region, and the allergenicity load ishigh. The sensitization rate may increase over time. If the prevalence is determined accurately, appropriate preventive measures and treatments can be developed.",

All patients suspected of allergy underwent skin testing: SPT (skin prick test) and IDT (intradermal test) using either an mRNA (ribonucleic messenger acid) vaccine (BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNTech) and/or an adenoviral vector vaccine (AZD1222, AstraZeneca). Subsequent immunization was administered under careful medical observation. Results: Among the 234 patients with a high-risk allergy profile, several potential risk factors were identified, including a history of multiple allergies, previous anaphylaxis, and/or drug allergies. In our cohort, food allergies were reported by 20 patients (8.5%) and multiple drug allergies were reported by 118 patients (50.4%). Due to the retrospective nature of the study, we cannot establish causality. Therefore, older age and receipt of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were found to be associated with increased allergic reactions after COVID-19 vaccination, while male gender was associated with decreased risk. Although previous allergic manifestations were common among those with reactions, they were not significantly associated with increased risk after adjustment for confounders. The absence of a control group consisting of vaccinated individuals without a high-risk allergy history limits the generalizability of our findings. Conclusions: Immediate allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines are rare but can be severe and reoccur. Findings suggest that gender and age-specific factors may influence the response to the vaccine. Nevertheless, COVID-19 vaccines remain a critical tool in preventing severe dis-ease and controlling the ongoing pandemic.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate HL levels in adult IEI patients using the Turkish Health Literacy Scale (TSOY-32) and to identify associated sociodemographic factors. This cross-sectional study included 27 adult IEI patients receiving regular immunoglobulin therapy at an allergy and immunology clinic. Participants completed the TSOY-32 via face-to-face interviews. The scale assessed HL across two dimensions-Treatment and Services (TS) and Disease Prevention/Health Promotion (DP/HP)-and four information processing stages. Sociodemographic data were also collected. According to the TSOY-32 general index, 44.4% of patients had inadequate or problematic HL. Significant associations were observed between HL levels (particularly in the DP/HP dimension) and age, gender, education, and marital status. Younger adults (18-34 years) showed higher HL than those aged 35 and older and married participants had lower HL than singles. Although HL improved with education, no significant link was found between educational level and overall HL. Economic status had a positive but nonsignificant relationship with HL. A significant proportion of IEI patients had limited HL, which may negatively impact treatment adherence. Tailored educational interventions that take into account patients' HL levels (e.g., simplified visual materials, brief in-clinic education, digital tools) could help enhance self-management. Larger studies are warranted to clarify the determinants of HL and improve care in this population.",

However, the skin pruritus improvement effect and mechanism of action of Peucedanum japonicum Thunberg root extract (PJRE) have not yet been reported. We investigated the effects of PJRE on the regulation of pruritus and inflammatory responses in compound 48/80 (C48/80)-treated mice, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/A23187-induced human skin mast cells, and LPS-stimulated mouse macrophages. PJRE administration significantly inhibited scratching behavior, skin inflammatory cells, and mast cell infiltration in mice increased by C48/80. PJRE treatment also reduced the PMA/A23187-activated secretion of histamine, inflammatory cytokines, and interleukins via NF-κB activation in HMC-1 cells. PJRE treatment reduced LPS-stimulated secretion of inflammatory cytokines and expression of iNOS and COX-2 through phosphorylation of NF-κB, Akt, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK in Raw 264.7 cells. PJRE treatment increases HO-1 expression in a concentration-dependent manner via NRF2 nuclear translocation. These results suggest that PJRE has therapeutic potential for alleviating atopic dermatitis-like skin symptoms, which is likely mediated by NF-κB as a transcription factor and Akt, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK as upstream signaling molecules.",

Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study used data from the 2017 National Household Health Survey (NHHS), which included 6053 individuals aged 15 years and older. The sociodemographic characteristics, behavioral risk factors, and comorbidities of the study participants were analyzed and Pearson chi-squared tests were used to assess statistical significance, and multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationships. Results: Of the 6053 participants, 518 had asthma; 40.4% were male and 59.6% were female, and 73.2% of the asthma patients and 58.3% of the non-asthmatic individuals were females (p &lt; 0.001). Patients with asthma had a higher prevalence of at least one comorbidity compared to non-asthmatic individuals (p &lt; 0.001). Disease-specific analyses in patients with asthma showed higher rates of hypertension (42.9% vs. 23.9%), hyperlipidemia (35.3% vs. 19.4%), diabetes (27.8% vs. 17.7%), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (29.7% vs. 2.6%), cardiovascular diseases (16.0% vs. 6.1%), and obesity (56.1% vs. 36.2%) (p &lt; 0.001). In the multiple logistic regression analysis, asthma was 14.6 times more likely in individuals with COPD, 1.6 times more likely in obese individuals, and 1.7 times more likely in those with hyperlipidemia. Conclusion: Patients with asthma have a higher prevalence of specific comorbidities with varying sociodemographic characteristics. Further research is needed to explore the causal relationships between asthma and these comorbidities to improve disease management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Saline nasal irrigation provides symptom relief in allergic rhinitis, but the optimal saline concentration remains uncertain. The comparative efficacy of 3% hypertonic saline nasal irrigation (HSNI) versus 0.9% isotonic saline is still debated. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate nasal symptom scores from studies comparing HSNI with control (isotonic saline or no saline) in patients with allergic rhinitis. A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central was performed for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 3% HSNI with control from inception to May 8, 2024. Primary outcomes were total nasal symptom scores and antihistamine use. We pooled mean differences (MD) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random-effects model and assessed heterogeneity with I². Nine RCTs involving 645 patients met the inclusion criteria. Follow-up ranged from 4 weeks to 2 months. The mean age was 35.49 years in adults and 9.3 years in children. HSNI significantly reduced nasal symptom scores compared with control in adults (MD = -2.09; 95% CI: -3.86 to -0.33; p = 0.02; I² = 97%) and children (MD = -0.97; 95% CI: -1.51 to -0.44; p = 0.0004; I² = 42%). Antihistamine use was also lower with HSNI than control (OR = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.21–0.70; p = 0.002; I² = 14%), but no significant difference was found between HSNI and isotonic saline alone (OR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.41–1.16; p = 0.16; I² = 0%). HSNI appears effective in reducing symptoms and medication use in allergic rhinitis across age groups.",

    "abstract": "Allergic asthma is an inflammatory airway disease influenced by genetic and environmental factors and orchestrated by imbalance between T helper 1 cell (Th1) and two immune responses. Inflammation contributes to pathological changes and remodeling in tissues such as the vascular, lung, heart, and beds. The purpose for this study was to evaluate the effects of allergic asthma on heart pathology and remodeling. In methodology, mice were allocated into two healthy and asthma groups, followed by the assessment of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), cell enumeration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), measurement of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-33, IL-5, interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and IL-13, total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, and analysis of remodeling factors. Also, gene expression analysis was performed for troponin, suppressor of mothers against decapentaplegic (SMAD)2, myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF-2), and SMAD3. Finally, histopathological study was conducted. The result revealed that asthma induction augmented AHR and elevated eosinophil percentage, elevated the levels of IL-13, IL-33, IL-5, IL-4, IgE, Helicobacter pylori (HP), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and the gene expression of SMAD3. Also, eosinophilic inflammation, goblet cell meta/hyperplasia, and mucus secretion were increased in asthmatic versus healthy mice. The level of IFN-γ was lower in the asthma compared to the control group; however, the expressions of troponin, SMAD2, and MEF-2 genes showed no significant differences. It was concluded that allergic asthma changed the balance between type 1 and 2 cytokines, which could possibly lead to profound effects on the cardiovascular system's structure and/or function.",

Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a fibroinflammatory disorder involving various organs. We present a 34-year-old male with WAS who developed cervical lymphadenopathy and parotid gland swelling. Initial biopsies were inconclusive and imaging suggested pleomorphic adenoma. Given the persistent cervical lymphadenopathy and the underlying immunodeficiency, lymphoma was also considered in the differential diagnosis. However, histopathological examination of excised salivary gland and lymph nodes revealed lymphoplasmacytic and eosinophilic infiltrates, numerous IgG4-positive plasma cells, storiform fibrosis, and obliterative phlebitis, consistent with IgG4-RD. The patient responded well to prednisone therapy. This case emphasizes the importance of considering IgG4-RD in the differential diagnosis of lymphoproliferative lesions in immunodeficient individuals and highlights the diagnostic value of histopathological evaluation in excisional tissue specimens. To our knowledge, this represents a rare coexistence of WAS and IgG4-RD not previously reported in the literature.",

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 449 patients hospitalized for antituberculosis drug–induced hypersensitivity between 2015 and 2024. A control group of 478 tuberculosis patients without hypersensitivity was included. Demographic features, comorbidities, hypersensitivity types, causative drugs, and treatment outcomes were compared. Results: The prevalence of hypersensitivity was 12.1%. Female gender, older age, Turkish nationality, and history of other drug allergies were significant risk factors. Type 1 reactions (77.7%) were more common and associated with shorter treatment interruption and higher cure rates. Pyrazinamide was the most frequently implicated drug. Desensitization was successful in the majority of patients. Conclusion: This large cohort study highlights key risk factors and clinical outcomes in tuberculosis drug hypersensitivity. Close monitoring of high-risk patients in the early treatment phase may reduce delays and improve outcomes.",

It is a common airborne mold recognized as a significant aeroallergen linked to pediatric allergic rhinitis and asthma. Although sensitization rates in children vary regionally, evidence suggests that A. alternata allergy significantly impacts pediatric respiratory health and as its exposure worsens, respiratory outcomes in susceptible pediatric populations Alternaria. Children are especially vulnerable due to their developing immune and respiratory systems and greater exposure to environmental allergens. This narrative review aims to summarize current knowledge on A. alternata as an allergenic source in children, including its biology, allergenic components (especially Alt a 1), interactions with immune system, airway epithelium interacting with other allergens, and clinical relevance. We also discuss the allergen-specific immunotherapy strategies with standardized extracts that are effective and safe in pediatric patients. Understanding the role of Alternaria in allergic disease is essential for early and accurate diagnosis (including component-resolved methods), effective intervention, and improving long-term outcomes in affected children. Future research should focus on novel vaccine technologies and standardized pediatric-specific treatment protocols.",

The data presented were very interesting concerning the changing rates of sensitization, but the authors neglected some important areas requiring further consideration. The study does not take into account whether or not enhanced sensitization had translated into more clinical allergic disease, thus putting restrictions on considering actual real-world implications. Lifestyle disruption and COVID-19 infection status have not been directly measured and analyzed as potential confounds. Also, the allergy clinic’s patient focus raises concerns about selection bias. Stating these issues may help shape future inquiries in building a more comprehensive picture of how the pandemic has affected allergy risks and outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether fluoroquinolone antibiotics, which are structurally distinct from penicillins, can be safely prescribed as alternatives for patients with a history of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) to penicillin in the absence of multidrug allergy and without the need for provocation testing. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the medical records of patients who presented to the Erciyes University Adult Immunology and Allergy Outpatient Clinic with a documented history of penicillin allergy between 2015 and 2024. Inclusion criteria for immediate hypersensitivity to penicillin included at least one of the following: (1) a history of at least two separate immediate HSRs to the same penicillin; or (2) positive results from penicillin G/V (Penicillin G and Penicillin V) serum-specific immunoglobulin E (SsIgE) and/or skin prick testing. Patients who met these criteria and subsequently underwent oral provocation testing with fluoroquinolone antibiotics were included in the study. Results: This study included 76 patients (72% female, mean age: 45.63 ± 11.76 years), 47.4% of whom had comorbid allergic diseases. The diagnosis was primarily based on clinical history (80%), while the remainder were confirmed by SsIgE testing, skin tests, or drug provocation. A history of urticaria-angioedema was reported in 59.2% of the patients, while 40.8% had a history of anaphylaxis. Following oral provocation testing with fluoroquinolones, only two patients (2.6%) developed mild, self-limited urticaria or angioedema, without systemic involvement. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates a low positive rate (2.6%) for fluoroquinolone oral provocation testing among patients with penicillin allergy. These findings suggest that fluoroquinolones may be a viable and safe alternative in patients with a confirmed penicillin hypersensitivity and no history of multidrug allergy, and may be considered without prior provocation testing in selected cases.",

    "abstract": "Background: Besides the well-known risk factors, Toxocara infection is thought to play a significant etiological role in the development of childhood asthma. To further explore this association, the prevalence of Toxocara infection in sera of asthmatic children and healthy controls in northern Iran was investigated. Methods: In this case-control study, cases were 145 physician-confirmed asthmatic children diagnosed according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines. Controls were 115 age–sex–residence-matched children who did not have physician-diagnosed asthma. The presence of anti-Toxocara immunoglobulin G (IgG) was tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used for case-control comparisons. Results: Seropositivity rate was 4.1% (95% CI, 3.4–4.7%) in asthmatic children and 0.86% (95% CI, 0.71–1.0%) in controls, suggesting a strong association (P-value &lt; 0.02). Moreover, Toxocara infection was not significantly more prevalent (P-value = 0.12) in children with moderate sustainable asthma (9.3%, 3/32) than in children with mild sustainable asthma (2.3%, 3/113). Mean total immunoglobulin E (IgE) level was significantly higher in Toxocara-infected children (222.3 ± 367.1) than in non-infected children (143.19 ± 218.05) in the case group (P-value &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: Our findings indicated that Toxocara infection can play an important role in childhood asthma. Further experimental and epidemiological studies are needed to clarify this hypothesis.",

Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) that promotes arginine methylation of histones is associated with inflammation of endothelial cell and is implicated in lung branching morphogenesis and progression of lung cancer. The mechanism of PRMT5 in inflammatory response of COPD was explored in this study.Human bronchial epithelial cells, 16HBE, were treated with cigarette smoke extract for 24 h to establish cell model of COPD. Cell viability was examined by MTT assay. Western blot and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays were used to explore expression of PRMT5. Expression of Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and IL-1β were investigated by enzyme-linked-ithe mmunosorbent serologic assay.Cigarette smoke extract treatment induced cytotoxity of 16HBE with reduced cell viability. PRMT5 was enhanced in cigarette smoke extract-induced 16HBE. Knockdown of PRMT5 increased cell viability of cigarette smoke extract-induced 16HBE, and attenuated cigarette smoke extract-induced increase of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-1β. Up-regulation of C-X-C Motif Chemokine 10 (CXCL10) in cigarette smoke extract-induced 16HBE was restored by knockdown of PRMT5. Over-expression of CXCL10 counteracted with the suppressive effect of PRMT5 silence on expression of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-1β. Moreover, PRMT5 silence-induced increase of cell viability in cigarette smoke extract-induced 16HBE was reversed by over-expression of CXCL10.Knockdown of PRMT5 promoted cell viability of cigarette smoke extract-induced 16HBE, and reduced inflammation through down-regulation of CXCL10.",

    "abstract": "Allergic asthma is a heterogeneous inflammatory disorder triggered by inhaled allergens, leading to airflow obstruction, bronchial inflammation, and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). T helper (Th) 2 cell-mediated immune response and airway inflammation are the key features of allergic asthma. Bruceine D (BD) is a bioactive compound extracted from the seeds of Brucea javanica. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of increased doses of BD on AHR, secretion of Th1-/Th2-associated cytokines, and inflammatory cell infiltration in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic asthma mice. The results showed that BD reduced OVA-induced inflammatory cell infiltration and bronchial hyperresponsiveness into the peribronchial tissues and perivascular areas. Mice treated with BD also showed significantly decreased expressions of Th2-associated cytokines (i.e., interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13) and elevated production of Th1-associated cytokines (i.e., interferon gamma and IL-2) following OVA stimulation. BD treatment dose-dependently inhibited OVA-induced accumulation of inflammatory cells in asthmatic mice. Further analysis revealed that OVA exposure upregulated pulmonary expressions of NOTCH signaling receptors, a group of transmembrane proteins that communicate signals upon binding to transmembrane ligands expressed on adjacent cells, while BD treatment significantly abolished OVA-induced activation of the NOTCH pathway. In conclusion, BD protected mice against OVA-induced allergic asthma by reducing AHR and restoring the Th1/Th2 balance through the NOTCH signaling pathway. Our findings highlighted the potential of BD as a therapeutic agent for allergic asthma.",

    "abstract": "Background: Itching is one of the major and mandatory signs of atopic dermatitis (AD) in children. Interleukin 31 (IL-31) is strongly involved in the genesis of pruritus. In our study, 68 patients aged 0–18 years with proven AD were followed clinically. The role of IL-31 in pruritus as clinical manifestation of AD is known but its etiopathogenetic mechanism is not well known. Methods: Serum was collected from 31 patients with moderate and severe forms of AD to determine IL-31 and its correlation with activity and severity of the disease. We also studied 30 healthy patients to compare the results of determinations. The IL-31 value was determined using the sandwich enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay (two antibodies assay). The IL-31 values were expressed as picograms per milliliter (pg/mL) and compared with activity and severity of the disease. Results: The IL-31 value was much higher in patients with AD compared to the control group. The mean value of findings was 1600 pg/mL compared to the control group with an average of 220 pg/mL. The IL-31 values were positively correlated with the severity and activity of the disease. Conclusions: The results of our pediatric study established the involvement of IL-31 in the pathophysiology of AD. IL-31 could be a marker of AD track.",

    "abstract": "The novel disease caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused an unprecedented global pandemic. Care providers of asthmatic children are increasingly con-cerned; as viral infections are one of the primary triggers of asthma flare-up. However, the effect of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the generated worldwide lockdown on asthmatic children is unknown.The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 in pediat-ric asthma control.A retrospective, open, transversal study was performed at five ter-tiary hospitals. Recruited patients were aged <18 years and had physician-diagnosed asthma. Information regarding the 2019 and 2020 seasons were provided.Data were collected from 107 children (age range: 3-18 years, mean age: 12 years). Well-controlled asthma was observed in 58 (54.2%) patients in 2020 versus 30 (28%) in 2019, and 15 (14%) patients had poorly controlled asthma in 2020 versus 28 (26.2%) in 2019. In 2020, a decrease in exacerbations caused by allergies to pollen, dust mites, molds, and through other causes not related to SARS-CoV-2 infection was observed. An increase in exacerbations was observed due to animal dander, stress, physical exercise, and SARSCoV-2 infection. Children had a reduced need for asthma-controlling medication, made fewer visits to healthcare providers and had lesser need of treatment with oral corticosteroids if compared with the same season of 2019.Pediatric asthma control improved, the need for controller medication declined, and fewer visits to healthcare providers were made during the pandemic if compared with the 2019 season.",

Data for the vespids were collected from the prescriptions of Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy (HVIT) at six Spanish hospitals in the years 2009 and 2019.Polistes dominula and Vespula germanica were the most widely distributed species. Vespa velutina was found to be present in a large part of northern Spain. During the 10 year period, the prescriptions of vespid VIT increased by 42.63%. The north of Spain saw a 3.61 fold greater predominance of prescriptions for Vespula (to some extent influenced by Vespa velutina allergy) whereas in central and southern Spain, there was a 3.97 fold greater predominance of prescriptions for Polistes.It is the first study that compares the vespid distribution maps with VIT prescription. A noteworthy finding is the wide presence of Polistes dominula and Vespula germanica in Spain and the appearance of Vespa velutina allergy in the northern part of the country. Data of HVIT prescriptions reflect inter-regional variability with the predominance of Vespula (due to Vespula and Vespa) in the north and that of Polistes in the center and south of Spain.",

    "abstract": "In the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, disease severity was found to be more related to the immune system hyper-response than the invasive or destructive capacity of the virus. Similarly, most common childhood diseases, which are generally recurrent and inflammatory, may be caused by a hyper-response or inability of the immune system. Individuals will react differently to causal noxa and outcomes will depend on the balance and maturity of their immune system. Conventionally, childhood diseases are symptomatically treated with little attention being devoted to balancing and stimulating the maturation of the immune system. Recently, there has been an increase in publications that consider lifestyle as an important factor in the maintenance of health. One controversial angle is an abandonment of the traditional diet and the inclusion of foods that are potentially less well-assimilated by the human species. An increasing number of studies are demonstrating the anti-inflammatory effects of the Mediterranean Diet while illustrating the pro-inflammatory effects of many other food types. We believe that the Traditional Mediterranean Diet consists of foods that support the establishment and maintenance of a healthy microbiota and a mature immune system that, in turn, can aid in the prevention of common inflammatory and recurrent diseases of childhood.",

    "abstract": "In the assessment of childhood asthma, identifying the risk factors associated with exacerbations and broadening this view to understand psychological stress and its repercussions on the inflammatory process of asthma allow a different perspective on this biopsychosocial disease. Psychological stress, as a risk factor for the onset and noncontrol of asthma, has been increasingly evaluated from the perspective of the repercussions on the body of the stimulus generated in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and adrenal glands, with cortisol release and immune system action. These processes trigger changes in T helper 2 cells, which polarize allergic processes, and dysfunctions in immune tolerance mechanisms, with a decrease in regulatory T cells. Genetic and epigenetic changes in β2-adrenergic and glucocorticoid receptors, with decreased response to these drugs, were also identified in studies, in addition to changes in respiratory function patterns, with worsening of obstruction and inflammation identified via decreased forced expiratory volume in one second and increased exhaled inflammatory gases in allergic asthma. Therefore, the present review sought to identify studies on the effect of personal and parental acute or chronic psychological stress, emphasizing the repercussions on genetics, epigenetics, and immune and pulmonary functional and inflammatory responses in the pediatric population.",

    "abstract": "Urticaria diagnosis may be challenging in children since it can be triggered or related to numerous conditions. In this paper, we reviewed the main aspects regarding the diagnosis of urticaria in the pediatric population. Acute urticaria is often due to viral infections. However, other culprits, including foods, insect stings, drugs, contrast media, vaccination, latex, and medical diseases, may account for acute patterns. Laboratory tests and confirmatory allergy tests should be individualized and guided by history. Chronic urticaria (CU) is defined when hives and/or angioedema last for more than 6 weeks. The most common type of chronic urticaria in children is chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). Chronic inducible urticaria (CindU) is less common but is important to diagnose in order to manage appropriately and reduce the risk of severe reactions. Inducible forms in children are often diagnosed with specific provocation tests similar to the tests used in adults. Given that chronic urticaria could rarely be a presentation of vasculitis, systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or auto-inflammatory syndromes, it is important to rule out these conditions. It is crucial to differentiate cases of chronic urticaria from mastocytosis and Bradykinin-mediated angioedema, given that treatment may differ. The management of chronic urticaria in children has improved over the last decade because of the development of both clear management guidelines and new effective drugs. It is crucial to increase awareness for appropriate diagnosis and new available treatment to improve the management of chronic urticaria in children.",

    "abstract": "Polyphyllin I is an active steroidal saponin isolated from Paris polyphylla with anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties. The present study investigates the role of polyphyllin I in acute lung injury. Firstly, the human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) and human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC) were stimulated with increasing concentrations of lipopolysaccharide at 2, 5, and 10 μg/mL. The treatment with lipopolysaccharide reduced the cell viabilities of BEAS-2B and HPAEC, downregulated superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH), and up-regulated myeloperoxidase (MPO) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Moreover, the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were also up-regulated in lipopolysaccharide-treated BEAS-2B/HPAEC cells. Secondly, the lipopolysaccharide-treated cells were then incubated with different concentrations of polyphyllin I. Incubation with polyphyllin I enhanced the cell viabilities of lipopolysaccharide--treated BEAS-2B/HPAEC, up-regulated levels of SOD and GSH, and reduced MPO and MDA. Moreover, polyphyllin I reduced TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in lipopolysaccharide-treated BEAS-2B/HPAEC cells. Thirdly, the up-regulation of GSDMD-N, pro-caspase-1, and cleaved caspase-1 proteins in lipopolysaccharide-treated BEAS-2B/HPAEC cells were decreased by polyphyllin I. Polyphyllin I increased the protein expression of GSDMD-D in the lipopolysaccharide-treated BEAS-2B/HPAEC cells, and inhibited the translocation of GSDMD from cytoplasm to plasma membrane. Lastly, polyphyllin I reduced the expression of p-p65 in lipopolysaccharide-treated BEAS-2B/HPAEC cells. The over-expression of p65 counteracted with the inhibitory effects of polyphyllin I on oxidative stress and inflammation in lipopolysaccharide-treated BEAS-2B. In conclusion, polyphyllin I repressed the lipopolysaccharide-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in BEAS-2B and HPAEC, and reduced pyroptosis through inhibition of NF-κB signaling.",

The morbidity and mortality of ALI and ARDS are very high. Objective: This study is aimed to explore the effect of Krüppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced type II alveolar epithelial cells in ALI by interacting with cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61). Material and Methods: ALI mice model and LPS-induced type II alveolar epithelial cells were conducted to simulate ALI in vivo and in vitro. The messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of KLF6 in lung tissues were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot analysis. Pathological changes in lung tissues were observed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining. The viability and KLF6 expression of A549 cells treated with different concentrations of LPS were detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, RT-qPCR, and Western blot analysis. After indicated treatment, the viability and apoptosis of A549 cells were analyzed by CCK-8 and TUNEL assays, and the inflammation factors of A549 cells were detected by Enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay, RT-qPCR, and Western blot analysis. The combination of KLF6 and CYR61 was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR and dual-luciferase reporter assay. Results: KLF6 expression was increased in lung tissues of ALI mice and LPS-induced A549 cells. Interference with KLF6 improved the viability, reduced the inflammatory damage, and promoted the apoptosis of LPS-induced A549 cells. In addition, KLF6 could bind to CYR61. Interference with KLF6 could decrease CYR61 expression in LPS-induced A549 cells. LPS also enhanced the TLR4/MYD88 signaling pathway, which was reversed by KLF6 interference. The above phenomena in LPS-induced A549 cells transfected with Si-KLF6 could be reversed by overexpression of CYR61. Conclusion: Inhibition of KLF6 promoted the viability and reduced the inflammation and apoptosis of LPS-induced A549 cells, which was reversed by CYR61.",

Participants completed a validated questionnaire on atopic disease status, dietary habits, and other sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. KIDMED score was used for the evaluation of adherence to the MedDiet. Discriminant analysis was applied to the hierarchy of foods and beverages consumed in relation to the presence of atopic diseases.Logistic regression analyses revealed that adolescents with moderate and good adherence to the MedDiet had 34 and 60% lower odds of having any asthma symptoms, respectively, and 20 and 41% lower odds of having any allergic rhinitis symptoms, respectively, adjusted for several confounders. The food group with the most important contribution to the MedDiet was cooked and raw vegetables, followed by fruits (Wilk's λ = 0.881 and λ = 0.957, respectively).Our study provided evidence for a strong and inverse association between the level of adherence to the MedDiet and the occurrence of asthma and allergic rhinitis symptoms and signified the importance of contribution of fruits and vegetable consumption in this association. Thus, the promotion of MedDiet could be an efficient lifestyle intervention that can contribute to the reduction of the burden of these atopic diseases in adolescents.",

    "abstract": "Background: About 10% of children are declared as allergic to antibiotics, with beta(β)-lactams being the most common perpetrators. However, few of these are confirmed by allergy tests. This characteristic of being allergic follows a child well into adulthood, leading to alternative, usually more expensive broad-spectrum antibiotics, contributing to antibiotic resistance and increasing healthcare expenses. Objective: This review presents a practical approach to managing pediatric patients with antibiotic hypersensitivity reactions. Material and methods: We updated the guidelines on antibiotic allergy in children by conducting systematic literature research using the best available evidence from PubMed search by entering the keywords “antibiotic allergy” and “children.” The search output yielded 5165 citations. Results: Management of antibiotic allergy depends on the culprit antibiotic, and it includes confirmation of the diagnosis and finding a safe alternative to the culprit antibiotic. In particular patients with a history indicative of penicillin allergy can be treated with cephalosporins as an alternative to penicillin, especially with third-generation cephalosporins, except for those with similar R1 side chains. In patients with a history of immediate-type reactions to cephalosporins who require treatment with cephalosporins or penicillin, skin tests with cephalosporin or penicillin with different side chains should be performed. If allergy to macrolides is suspected, challenge tests are currently the only reliable diagnostic tool. The best strategy for managing patients with sulfonamide hypersensitivity is an alternative antibiotic. The skin prick tests and intradermal tests are not recommended for diagnosis of quinolone allergy, as they can activate dermal mast cells leading to false-positive results. Quinolone challenge test is the most appropriate test for diagnosing quinolone hypersensitivity. Conclusion: Although adverse drug reactions to antibiotics are frequently documented, immunologically mediated hypersensitivity is unusual. In the event of an reaction, an appropriate diagnostic workup is required to identify the drug’s causal role. It is critical to avoid “labeling” a child as allergic without first conducting a proper diagnostic workup.",

    "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI), a prevalent complication of sepsis, causes substantial burden on patients' families as well as the society. More reliable markers are urgently required for the prevention and treatment of AKI. Pleckstrin homology-like domain, family A, member 1 (PHLDA1) was implicated in various diseases, but its involvement in sepsis-induced AKI remains to be explored. The JNK/ERK pathway has been revealed as being involved in progression of sepsis. One previous study demonstrated that PHLDA1 could activate the JNK/ERK pathway in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury. Nevertheless, involvement of PHLDA1 in sepsis-triggered AKI through the JNK/ERK pathway has not been probed.A cecal ligation and punctured (CLP) mice model of sepsis-induced AKI was established. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunofluorescence staining were applied to evaluate the expression of PHLDA1. Concentration of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr), inflammation markers, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α, as well as oxidative stress-associated proteins (catalase, malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione), in the kidney tissues of mice were evaluated by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay. Western blot analysis was applied for measuring protein expression levels.The BUN and SCr levels in mice were obviously elevated in the CLP group compared to the sham group. Moreover, the expression of PHLDA1 was also elevated in the CLP group in comparison to the sham group. Down-regulation of PHLDA1 alleviated renal injury, inflammation, and oxidative stress in AKI model. Mechanistic study showed that PHLDA1 knockdown suppressed the activation of c-JUN N-terminal kinase/p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (JNK/ERK) pathway.Down-regulation of PHLDA1 suppressed inflammation and oxidative stress through the modulation of JNK/ERK pathway in sepsis-induced AKI. The results could offer a novel insight into the treatment of patients with sepsis-induced AKI.",

Methods: We searched some representing databases. Some studies were included if the effects of statins were tested on MS and EAE. The methodological quality was evaluated by the Collaborative Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Data from Experimental Studies checklist. Results: Studies have confirmed that statins have immunomodulatory, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, and can be used in combination with immunomodulators of different mechanisms to treat MS and EAE. Statins have been shown to improve the following symptoms MS, reduce the number of attacks and the number of lesions, through immunomod-ulatory, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, and has a good safety profile. Conclusions: In short, statins represent an attractive new measure for treating MS. Some studies indicate that in addition to immunomodulatory effects, statins may have neuroprotective and neuro-repairing effects. The combination of statins with other immunosuppressive drugs has also produced encouraging results. This can be broadly prospects prospected to treat MS and EAE. It is hoped that in the near future, a combination of statins with less adverse reactions and high efficacy combined with other immunomodulators will bring exact results to patients with MS.",

Bone marrow cells were extracted and co-cultured with IL-2 and the cells were used via intra-tracheal administration in allergic asthma mice. Levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, Leukotriene B4 and C4, and remodeling factors were measured. At least, a histopathology test of lung tissue was done. Type2 cytokines, leukotrienes, remodeling factors, mucus secretion, goblet cell hyperplasia, peri-bronchial and peri-vascular inflammation were significantly (p˂0.05) decreased by treating with bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMDMCs) and IL-2-BMDMCs. Treatment with IL-2-BMDMCs could significantly decrease IL-13, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, HP levels, and mucus secretion (p˂0.05) compared to BMDMCs treatment. In this study, BMDMCs and IL-2-BMDMCs therapy could decrease inflammation, allergic, and remodeling factors in allergic asthma. Cell therapy with BMDMCs had a strong and notable effect on the control of allergic asthma pathophysiology when co-cultured and used with IL-2.",

    "abstract": "Background: Tracheobronchial stenosis due to tuberculosis (TSTB) seriously threatens the health of tuberculosis patients. The inflammation and autophagy of fibroblasts affect the development of TSTB. Triamcinolone acetonide (TA) can regulate the autophagy of fibroblasts. Nevertheless, the impact of TA on TSTB and underlying mechanism has remained unclear. Objective: To study the impact of TA on TSTB and underlying mechanism. Material and Methods: In order to simulate the TSTB-like model in vitro, WI-38 cells were exposed to Ag85B protein. In addition, the cell counting kit (CCK)-8 assay was applied to assess the function of TA in Ag85B-treated WI-38 cells. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was applied to detect the mRNA level of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and forkhead box O3 (FOXO3a), and autophagy-related proteins were evaluated by Western blot analysis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level was investigated by immunohistochemical staining. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent serologic assay was applied to detect the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, hematoxylin and eosin staining was applied to observe tissue injuries. Results: Ag85B affected WI-38 cell viability in a limited manner, while TA notably suppressed Ag85B-treated WI-38 cell viability. TA induced the apoptosis of Ag85B-treated WI-38 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, Ag85B-treated WI-38 cells demonstrated the upregulation of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and fibrotic proteins (transforming growth factor-beta [TGF-β] and vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]), which can be significantly destroyed by the TA. Meanwhile, TA reversed Ag85-induced inhibition of cell autophagy by mediation of p62, LC3, and Beclin1. Furthermore, silencing of SIRT1/FOXO3a pathway could reverse the effect of TA on the autophagy of Ag85B-treated cells. Conclusion: TA significantly induced the autophagy of fibroblasts in Ag85B-treated cells by mediation of SIRT1/FOXO3 pathway. This study established a new theoretical basis for exploring strategies against TSTB.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Dental caries is one of the most common chronic diseases affecting millions of people globally. Some studies revealed the presence of bidirectional relationship between allergic rhinitis (AR) and oral diseases, with each disease having a potential impact on the other. In this study we aimed to systematically review the literature and analyze the available evidence regarding whether AR contributes to the development of dental caries. Methods: Three authors, members of the YO-IFOS rhinology study group, independently analyzed the data sources (Pubmed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, SciELO) for papers assessing the relationship between rhinitis and caries, in adult and pediatric patients. Results: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria (87612 participants). Six studies were performed in children. A total of three studies found an association between AR and dental caries. Only two studies had adjusted the measure of effect for potentially confounding variables. Regarding the quality of the selected studies according to the NICE classification, the most observed methodological limitations detected were: (1) the cross-sectional design of the included studies which could have introduced a simultaneity bias, and (2) not clearly reporting the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Conclusion: This systematic review can neither confirm nor deny the presence of an association between AR and caries. Despite the evidence is very scarce to conclude a relationship between AR and caries, the option for examining patients with repetitive caries by an otolaryngologist and those with AR by odontologist should be considered, as these examinations do not possess any risk for the patient.",

Indeed, proper diagnosis of anaphylaxis is often missed, and the treatment is delayed. The underlying causes are still under investigation globally. Inflammation represents the cornerstone of pathophysiology of anaphylaxis. Food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA) is a rare clinical manifestation characterized by a chronological sequence in which food ingestion followed by physical exercise leads to anaphylaxis. Its mechanisms are yet to be fully explained. We report the case of a 14-year-old Chinese male who lost consciousness while undergoing physical activity at school. Several differential diagnoses were considered such as hypovolemic shock, septic shock, anaphylactic shock or neurological adverse event. Finally, the diagnosis of FDEIA was made. This case highlights the difficulties in diagnosing FDEIA and its management, especially when the clinical history is not complete and detailed.",

IL2RB expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was assessed by polymerase chain reaction. White blood cells of septic patients and healthy controls were collected from hospitals and linked with acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT) of septic patients using Pearson's correlation analysis. PBMC cells were transfected with IL2RB, and the effect of transfection was observed on cellular interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin (IL)-12, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17A.A total of 686 differential genes, comprising 446 upregulated and 240 down regulated genes, were identified. The enrichment of KEGG pathway revealed that the majority of differential genes were enriched in the T helper (Th1)/Th2 cell and Th17 cell differentiation pathways. In patients with sepsis, correlation analysis revealed a negative correlation between IL2RB and APACHE II score, SOFA score, CRP, and PCT. IFN-γ and IL-12 levels were elevated in PBMC of septic patients after IL2RB transfection, but IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17A levels were lowered.Sepsis-induced immunological dysfunction is improved by IL2RB, which also balances Th1/Th2 responses and prevents Th17 activation. © 2023 Codon Publications.

Humans can primarily be exposed to MPs and nanoplastics via oral and inhalation routes, but dermal contact cannot be overlooked, especially in young children. The possible toxic effects of plastic particles are due to their potential toxicity, often combined with that of leachable additives and adsorbed contaminants. Conclusions: Unless the plastic value chain is transformed over the next two decades, the risks to species, marine ecosystems, climate, health, economy, and communities will be unmanageable.

Methods: Murine Lung Epithelial 12 (MLE-12) cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to construct an in vitro pulmonary injury model to study the functioning of coptisine in sepsis-induced ALI. The viability of MLE-12 cells was assessed by the cell counting kit-8 assay. The cytokine release of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and IL-1β was measured by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay. The relative expression levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β mRNA were examined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The cell apoptosis of MLE-12 cells was determined by Annexin V/propidium iodide staining and analyzed by flow cytometry. The expressions of apoptosis-related proteins Bax and cleaved Caspase-3 were observed by Western blot analysis. The activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway was discovered by the determination of phospho-p65, p65, phospho-nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor alpha (IκBα), and IκBα through Western blot analysis. Results: Coptisine treatment could significantly restore decrease in MLE-12 cell viability caused by LPS stimulation. The release of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β was significantly inhibited by coptisine treatment. Coptisine treatment inhibited MLE-12 cell apoptosis induced by LPS, and also inhibited the expression levels of Bax and cleaved Caspase-3. Coptisine treatment along with LPS stimulation, significantly reduced the protein level of phospho-IκBα, increased the level of IκBα, and reduced phospho-p65–p65 ratio. Conclusion: These results indicated that coptisine attenuated sepsis lung injury by suppressing lung epithelial cell inflammation and apoptosis through NF-κB pathway. Therefore, coptisine may have potential to treat sepsis-induced ALI.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of food allergies has risen around the globe, and experts have been exploring methods of preventing such allergies in young children to ease the burden of disease and reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by anaphylaxis to food allergens. Such preventative measures can be categorised as primary, secondary and tertiary prevention, which are discussed in detail in this review. Primary prevention is defined as the prevention of becoming sensitised towards specific allergens. The evidence suggests that avoiding common allergenic foods during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not protective against food allergies, and guidelines recommend weaning from 4 to 6 months of age, with recent studies supporting the early introduction of peanuts at 4 months to prevent peanut allergy. Secondary prevention targets patients who are already sensitised and aims to halt the progression of sensitisation, with evidence for high rates of success and safety in trials of early introduction to milk and peanuts using oral immunotherapy in sensitised infants. Tertiary allergy prevention focuses on reducing the risk of a patient having anaphylaxis, with oral immunotherapy being the most common method of promoting tolerance in allergic children. Several studies have demonstrated successful reintroduction for milk, egg and peanut; however, no such guidelines are recommended for other foods. Finally, dietary advancement therapy in the form of milk and egg ladders has been employed as a method of primary, secondary and tertiary prevention of allergies, particularly in Ireland, the UK and Canada.",

    "abstract": "Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most common symptomatic and heterogeneous type of inborn errors of immunity (IEI). However, the pathogenesis process of this disease is often unknown. Epigenetic modifications may be involved in unresolved patients. MiR-142 and miR-155 were identified as immune system modulators and dysregulated in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. We assessed hsa-miR-142-3p and hsa-miR-155-5p expression in a selected cohort of unresolved CVID cases and identified experimentally validated targets of these miRNAs. We constructed a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network from the common targets of two miRNAs and determined the hub genes. The hub genes’ expression was investigated in GEO datasets. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis were done for target genes. Hsa-miR-142-3p and hsa-miR-155-5p expression were significantly reduced in CVID patients. Evaluation of the PPI network demonstrated some hub genes in which pathogenic mutations have been reported in IEI, and other hub genes directly contribute to immune responses and the pathophysiology of IEI. Expression analysis of hub genes showed that they were significantly dysregulated in validating the CVID cohort. The pathway enrichment analysis indicated the involvement of the FOXO-mediated signaling pathway, TGFβ receptor complex, and VEGFR2-mediated vascular permeability. Considering the dysregulation of hsa-miR-142-3p and hsa-miR-155-5p in CVID and the known role of their target genes in the immune system, their involvement in the pathogenesis of CVID can be suggested.",

    "abstract": "Background: Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction with increasing incidence in Europe. It is often caused by food, insect venom, and drugs. White, red, and green beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) are legumes of the Fabaceae family consumed worldwide. In Spain, beans are the third most consumed legume species after chickpeas and lentils. Allergy to different legumes is very frequent in children and represents the fifth cause of food allergy. Objective: Demonstrate a new phenotype in patients with green bean anaphylaxis. Material and Methods: We report a 20-year-old woman who experienced anaphylaxis after consuming cooked green beans and required emergency treatment. There were no associated cofactors such as medications, alcohol, or physical exercise. After the episode, she tolerated well nuts, garlic, chickpeas, peas, and soy. Prick-prick with raw and cooked green bean, ISAC, SDS-PAGE and IgE-Western blot were performed. Results: The prick+prick test with raw and cooked green beans was positive. The sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis–immunoglobulin E (SDS-PAGE/IgE)–western blot analysis with white and red beans as well as cooked and raw green beans showed identification of several proteins with a molecular weight of 25–75 kDa in the extract of raw beans. Only one protein with a molecular weight of approximately 10 kDa was recognized in cooked beans. Conclusion: We present a case of anaphylaxis induced by green beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) because of a 10-kDa protein and tolerance to other legumes, which suggests a new phenotype.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to characterize the profile of probable anaphylaxis cases treated at a private pediatric hospital emergency department in São Paulo. It investigated triggering factors, the presence of cofactors, treatments administered, and follow-up for these cases through interviews with the patients’ families. A single-center cross-sectional study analyzed medical records of children and adolescents treated between 2016 and 2020. Allergist physicians evaluated cases with symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis to identify probable cases, and the parents or legal guardians of these cases were interviewed to gather detailed information about the episodes. A total of 69 probable cases of anaphylaxis (PCA) were identified among 460,434 visits. Of the 51 PCAs evaluated, most presented with cutaneous and respiratory symptoms, with a male predominance (63%), and 27% were under 2 years old. Foods, particularly nuts and peanuts, were the primary triggers. Nearly one-third of the patients did not undergo investigation following the episode, and intramuscular adrenaline (37%) and auto-injectable adrenaline (4%) were underutilized as treatments. Eight cases exhibited recurrence of symptoms after initial improvement, suggesting a potential biphasic reaction. In conclusion, this study revealed that the majority of PCAs occurred in male children, with nuts and peanuts as the main triggers. The management of PCAs was suboptimal, characterized by the underutilization of intramuscular adrenaline as the first-line treatment and low rates of auto-injectable adrenaline prescriptions during follow-up. Increasing awareness and education about anaphylaxis in children, along with emphasizing the importance of proper treatment, are crucial to reducing the risk of morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable population.",

    "abstract": "Montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) approved for the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis, is widely used, though real-world data on its application in asthma management remain limited. This registry-based study evaluated the use of montelukast in adult asthma patients, examining demographic and disease characteristics, asthma control status, asthma phenotypes, presence of atopy, and treatment regimens. Among 2053 patients analyzed, 61.76% (n = 1268; mean age: 46.2 ± 14.3 years), predominantly females (~76%), received montelukast. Montelukast users showed higher rates of allergic rhinitis (P &lt; 0.001), hypersensitivity to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (P = 0.008), and chronic rhinosinusitis (P = 0.008). Montelukast group also had higher atopy and total IgE levels and tended to be more eosinophilic. Montelukast was commonly preferred in allergic, eosinophilic, NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease, and severe asthma phenotypes (P &lt; 0.001). Patients receiving Steps 4 and 5 treatments are more likely to be prescribed montelukast (P &lt; 0.001). Montelukast usage was higher among patients with uncontrolled asthma [ACT&lt; 20 (OR:1.29, 95%CI:1.052–1.582, P = 0.014)]. In addition, logistic regression analyses identified the main factors associated with increased montelukast use as; female gender (OR:1.33, 95%CI:1.041–1.713, P = 0.02), presence of atopy (OR:1.46, 95%CI:1.157–1.864, P = 0.002), comorbid allergic rhinitis (OR:2.12, 95%CI:1.679–2.293, P &lt; 0.001), and severe asthma (OR:2.18, 95%CI:1.712–2.784, P &lt; 0.001). These findings reveal that montelukast use is prevalent among asthma patients, particularly in females, middle-aged adults, and those with comorbid allergic rhinitis, uncontrolled asthma, or specific asthma phenotypes, underscoring the factors that influence its prescription in asthma management.",

    "abstract": "Egg allergy (EA), along with cow’s milk allergy (CMA) and atopic dermatitis (AD), is one of the most frequent allergies in children. Tolerance to food allergens seems to be related to the early and regular intake and the cooking method. The objective of this study is to prove that the introduction of baked eggs at 4–6 months of age and its daily maintenance for 6 months prevents EA. Controlled randomized clinical trial from February 2019 to November 2023 was done for all patients under 6 months of age, including those with CMA and/or AD without previous egg consumption. Skin prick test (SPT), specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE), basophil activation test (BAT), and oral food challenge (OFC) on baked eggs were performed at the beginning of the study (T0). Patients were classified into group A (nontolerant to baked egg) following an egg-free diet and group B (tolerant to baked egg). These were randomized into B1 who ate baked egg daily and B2 who avoided egg. Six months later, at time 1 (T1), an OFC to hard-boiled egg was performed. There were 27 patients in all. Those who ate baked egg daily for 6 months tolerated boiled eggs and only 47.4% of patients who followed an egg-free diet tolerated boiled eggs (P-value 0.012). All three tests—sIgE, SPT, and BAT—are considered good techniques to discriminate between tolerant versus not tolerant patients toward eggs. Patients under 6 months of age with CMA and/or AD who ate baked eggs daily for 6 months tolerated cooked eggs more frequently than patients who avoided eggs. Early introduction of baked eggs could prevent EA.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that echinocystic acid (EA) can reduce arthritis and skin damage, but the role of EA in psoriatic arthritis is unclear. This study aims to prove the role of EA in psoriatic arthritis, which was induced by intraperitoneal injection of mannan in C57BL/6J mice. The mice were divided into a control group, mannan group, mannan + EA (low-dose) group, and mannan + EA (high dose) group. Joint tissue damage was scored, and pathological changes in joint tissue and ear skin damage were examined by HE staining. Pathway enrichment of EA drug targets was performed through the target enrichment website, and the mRNA and protein expression levels of pathway-related proteins in joint tissues and ears were verified using the PCR and western blot. The results show that injection of mannan into mice resulted in joint inflammatory infiltration and tissue damage, hyperkeratosis, and acanthosis of the ear skin, while these symptoms were alleviated after high-dose EA treatment. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that the EA drug treatment target is concentrated on the PPAR pathway. The mRNA and protein results showed that the mRNA and protein expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) in the joint tissues and ears of mice with psoriatic arthritis decreased, and the expression of PPARγ was activated after high-dose EA treatment. In conclusion, EA increases PPARγ expression and reduces joint and skin damage in mice with psoriatic arthritis.",

PLOD1, as one of the genes related to glycolysis, can promote the glycolysis of cells. However, it is not clear whether upregulation of PLOD1 plays a causal role or is directly involved in psoriasis. Herein, we have examined the PLOD1 expression in patients with psoriasis and analyzed its effect on the progression of psoriasis. We found that PLOD1 is highly expressed in psoriasis. Also, the role of PLOD1 in promoting Th17 cell differentiation was further revealed, and PLOD1 promotes T cell glycolysis. Mechanically, PLOD1 activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and thereby affects the progression of psoriasis.

    "abstract": "Data on adult food allergies (FAs) remain limited compared to the pediatric population, and this study investigates the prevalence and clinical characteristics of FAs among adults. This retrospective study included adults aged 18-80 diagnosed with FAs at the Immunology and Allergy Diseases Clinic of Ankara Bilkent City Hospital, Turkey, between 2019 and 2024. During the study period, 10,505 patients were examined to diagnose and manage various allergic and immunologic conditions. Among these, 563 patients were suspected of having FAs, which was confirmed in 33 patients (mean age 34.74 ± 12.57 years; 60.6% female), yielding a frequency of 0.31%. The primary allergens identified included hen's egg (n = 6, 18.2%), fish and shellfish (n = 4, 12.1%), and various nuts such as peanuts (n = 2, 6.1%), hazelnut (n = 1, 3.0%), and almond (n = 1, 3.0%) as well as seeds like sesame (n = 2, 6.1%) and sweet corn (n = 2, 6.1%) and fruits such as banana (n = 4, 12.1%) and kiwi (n = 4, 12.1%). The median time interval between food consumption and allergic reactions was 10 minutes (2-120). Anaphylaxis was the most frequently observed clinical presentation (n = 24, 72.7%). Emergency treatments included antihistamines and steroids (n = 15, 65.2%), antihistamines, steroids, and epinephrine (n = 5, 21.7%), or epinephrine alone (n = 3, 13.0%). Egg allergy was the most prevalent allergen (n = 6, 18.2%), characterized by a rapid onset of allergic reactions (median of 5 minutes); two patients reacted regardless of cooking methods and four showed tolerance to thoroughly cooked eggs, with component-resolved diagnostics indicating sensitization to ovalbumin (Gal d2) but not ovomucoid (Gal d1). Our study demonstrates a low frequency of FAs in adults yet highlights the seriousness of reactions like anaphylaxis. Hen's egg allergy was notably prevalent, underscoring the need for increased awareness and improved diagnostic strategies to effectively manage FAs in the adult population.",

    "abstract": "Background: Walnut (Juglans regia) frequently triggers nut allergies in the United Kingdom and in the United States, with increasing cases in Japan. While oral food challenges (OFCs) are the definitive method for diagnosing these allergies, they pose the risk of symptom provocation, necessitating safer alternative tests. Our aim here was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of IgE (immunoglobulin E) crosslinking-induced luciferase expression (EXiLE) for walnut allergy compared with the walnut-specific IgE (sIgE) test, Jug r 1-sIgE test, and skin prick test (SPT). Methods: This retrospective study analyzed 55 patients tested for walnut allergy (WA) at Fujita Health University Bantane Hospital from January 2021 to December 2023. Among them, 38 had allergic reactions to walnuts based on history or OFCs and 17 did not. We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results: The EXiLE method (AUC = 0.938) exhibited superior diagnostic accuracy compared to the walnut-sIgE and comparable performance to Jug r 1-sIgE and SPT. The optimal cutoff value of 1.26-fold change demonstrated high sensitivity (0.92), specificity (0.88), positive predictive value (0.92), and negative predictive value (0.82). The EXiLE method yielded positive results in all three cases with negative Jug r 1-sIgE (&lt; 0.35 UA/mL). Conclusion: The EXiLE method showed high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing WA, indicating its potential clinical utility. Furthermore, the combination of Jug r 1-sIgE and EXiLE may enhance diagnostic accuracy. Future large-scale studies are warranted to confirm these findings and establish comprehensive diagnostic protocols.",

    "abstract": "Psoriasis is an immune-mediated inflammatory skin disorder and its pathological mechanism remains incompletely understood. Detailed exploration of this mechanism is crucial to identify key regulatory molecules influencing its progression. In previous studies, Annexin A3 (ANXA3), a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein from the annexin family, has been linked to psoriasis progression. However, its specific effects on the disease remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of ANXA3 in psoriasis progression. For this purpose, we employed an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced mouse model and in-vitro experiments to uncover the underlying cellular mechanisms. A mixture of five inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-17A, IL-22, and statin M) was used to stimulate HaCaT cells, mimicking the psoriasis microenvironment. Our findings demonstrate that ANXA3 is highly expressed in psoriatic skin, and its knockdown alleviates skin lesions in IMQ-induced mice. Further analysis revealed that ANXA3 knockdown reduces skin tissue hyperplasia and decreases the expression of inflammatory factors in IMQ mice. Mechanistically, ANXA3 knockdown inhibits the NF-κB/STAT3 pathway in skin tissue. Additionally, ANXA3 knockdown inhibits inflammation and hyperproliferation in HaCaT cells. Collectively, these results indicate that ANXA3 alleviates psoriasis progression both in-vivo and in-vitro by inhibiting the NF-κB/STAT3 pathway.",

The anti-inflammatory effects of DUOX1 were assessed using IL-1β (interleukin-1 beta)-stimulated synovial fibroblasts (MH7A). Cell viability and migration were evaluated using the Cell Counting Kit-8 and Transwell assays, respectively. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to measure cellular inflammatory factor levels, and immunofluorescence and specific kits were used to assess reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and redox indicators. Western blotting was performed to confirm the antiarthritic mechanism of DUOX1. The findings revealed that the stimulation if IL-1β downregulates DUOX1 expression in MH7A cells, leading to increased proliferation, migration, inflammatory responses, and oxidative stress. Conversely, DUOX1 overexpression increased the production of IL-1β inducing excessive proliferation, migration, inflammation, and oxidative stress in MH7A cells, and inhibited the activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) inflammatory pathway. DUOX1 significantly suppresses the proliferation, migration, inflammation, and oxidative stress of RA synovial cells through the inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway.",

This study investigates e-cigarette use with sleep patterns, stress levels, and physical activity behavior and compare it with nonsmokers. A standardized electronic questionnaire for sleep, stress, and physical activity assessment was used on 372 students enrolled in a large university. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23.0. The mean age of the study population was around 20 years, with e-cigarette use higher in males. The mean age of smoking initiation was 17 years. The intention to play sports and physical activity differed between smokers and nonsmokers. E-cigarette users practiced sports to remain fit while nonsmokers intended to play sports for enjoyment; however, no significant difference in the level of fitness was found. Sleep behavior and stress levels were similar across the two groups. No difference in lifestyle patterns between e-cigarette users and nonsmokers may be due to lesser smoking duration since initiation. Longitudinal studies with diverse populations and a longer duration of e-cigarette use are recommended to explore the effects of e-cigarette smoking on lifestyle behavior.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: The most common indoor allergens are house dust mites, molds, cockroaches, and pet allergens. Increasing exposure to these allergens increases the possibility of sensitization. This study examines changes in allergen sensitivity during the pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic periods. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 19,525 skin prick test results from patients visiting the allergy clinic between January 2017 and August 2024. Patients were categorized into pre-pandemic (January 2017–March 2020), pandemic (March 2020–December 2022), and post-pandemic (January 2023–August 2024) periods. Allergen sensitization rates were compared across these timeframes. Results: A linear increase was observed in cats—Dermatophagoides farinae, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, and Artemisia vulgaris allergen sensitization during and after the pandemic period compared to the pre-pandemic period (all p&lt;0.001). Cockroach and grass–pollen sensitivities increased during the pandemic and remained elevated post-pandemic (all p&lt;0.001). Dog allergen sensitivity peaked during the pandemic but declined post-pandemic (p&lt;0.001). Sensitivity to the tree–pollen mixture, weed-pollen mixture, and Chenopodium album increased during the pandemic, slightly decreased post-pandemic, but remained significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels (p&lt;0.001). In the test results studied since the pandemic period, Aspergillus fumigatus (p=0.007) and Cladosporium herbarum (p=0.005) allergen sensitivity was seen less in the post-pandemic period. Conclusion: The current study reveals that the COVID-19 pandemic has significant effects on allergen sensitivity profiles along with changes in living habits. In particular, the increase in sensitivity to indoor allergens may be associated with the increased time spent at home during the pandemic, emphasizing the importance of environmental factors in the development of allergic diseases.",

Hence, the aim of this study to investigate radiologic lung findings in adult patients with PIDs and evaluate the possible relationship between clinical and immunologic features and respiratory function in these patients. In this study, the demographic and clinical characteristics, serum immunoglobulins (Ig), lymphocyte subgroups, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) of 116 adult patients with PID were evaluated and those with and without abnormal HRCT were compared. The median age was 40 (28–48) years, and there were 51 (44%) females. Abnormal findings were detected in 55.2% of the HRCTs, but the most common findings were bronchiectasis (30.2%), bilateral involvement (73.5%), and lower lobe predominance. The median age and age of diagnosis were higher in those with HRCT findings. The obstructive pattern was the most common found in the PFTs. Forced vital capacity, maximal mid-expiratory flow at 25–75%, immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin M (IgM), cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ T cell, CD4+/CD8+ ratio, and class-switched memory B (cSMB) cell levels were significantly lower, whereas mortality was higher. Noninfectious pulmonary complications are among the important causes of morbidity and mortality in PID that could result in chronic lung disease despite adequate Ig therapy. Considering the extra radiation dose of HRCT, clinical findings and immunological and PFT parameters accompanying radiological features may be helpful in predicting the diagnosis; it may also be useful in determining additional treatment modalities and reducing mortality.",

Using existing case records, a retrospective analysis was conducted utilizing clinical data from 96 UC patients (damp-heat syndrome of the large intestine) treated at our hospital between June 2022 and June 2024. Based on the different treatment methods recorded, 50 patients were included in the observation group and 46 in the control group. The control group received conventional treatment (oral sustained-release mesalazine tablets), while the observation group received oral Qingchang Yuyang Decoction in addition to conventional treatment. The efficacy and effects on intestinal flora were compared between the two groups. The change in the modified Mayo score before and after treatment in the observation group was significantly greater than that in the control group (p &lt; 0.001). After treatment, scores for abdominal pain and diarrhea, mucus-pus-bloody stools, tenesmus, anal burning, and short and red urine were significantly lower in the observation group compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Post-treatment, the observation group showed significantly higher levels of IL-10 than the control group, while IL-8 and TNF-α levels were lower in the observation group (p &lt; 0.05). After treatment, Enterococcus and Enterobacter counts in the observation group were lower, while the observation group had higher levels of Bifidobacterium, Butyric Clostridium, and Lactobacillus compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.05). The complication rate was lower in the observation group (p &lt; 0.05). The combination of Qingchang Yuyang Decoction with sustained-release mesalazine tablets can improve the clinical efficacy in UC, significantly alleviate clinical symptoms, reduce the inflammatory response, adjust intestinal flora distribution, and promote recovery, making it worthy of clinical application.",

Objective: The aim was to evaluate urticaria images that are available on the internet in two different languages. Materials and methods: The terms “urticaria” and “ürtiker” were used as search terms on Google Images. One hundred images were saved for each term, and each image was opened via its link. Two specialists in immunology and allergy jointly assessed the uploader information, pixel resolution, characteristics of the urticarial lesions, and image quality of the photos. Results: A total of 178 images were included, with 87 from the “urticaria” search term and 91 from the “ürtiker” search term—71.3% images had isolated urticaria, 1.7% had isolated angioedema, 0.6% had both urticaria and angioedema, and 26.4% had neither urticaria nor angioedema; 131 photographs depicting urticaria and/or angioedema were analyzed. The majority of urticarial plaques were erythematous (84%), with extremities (32.1%) being the most commonly affected area. Images in the preview on Google Images appeared more blurred and of lower resolution than the images after opening the link (n:99 vs. n:26, p &lt; 0.001 and n:55 vs. n:10, p &lt; 0.001, respectively). The quality of the images was found to be better after opening the link compared to the preview (n:34 vs. n:107; p &lt; 0.001).

The rate of at least one positive patch test was 41.9%, and no positivity was observed in approximately half of the allergens included in the EBS. The rate of at least one positive test result was 37.3% in the 65–74 age group and 63.6% in the 75–84 age group (p = 0.177). The rate of at least one positive test result was 35.3% in women and 50% in men (p = 0.243). The most common allergen over the age of 65 was fragrance mix I (11.3%), followed by potassium dichromate (9.7%) and fragrance mix II (9.7%) in equal proportions.Conclusion: It is also very necessary to create an “elderly baseline series” by avoiding unnecessary allergens that are not detected as positive in patch tests. In addition, increasing the number of studies in geriatric patients will help in understanding trends in contact allergy.",

    "abstract": "Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) is a non-immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea. Since 2018, hen’s egg yolk has been the most common trigger for FPIES in Japan, whereas typical egg white (TEW) FPIES remains rare. Herein, we present two cases of acute TEW FPIES in young children. A 17-month-old girl experienced recurrent vomiting and lethargy following egg white ingestion, despite previously tolerating half an egg yolk and 5 g of egg white. Initial tests showed no sensitization markers (egg white-specific IgE &lt; 0.1 kUA/L; ovomucoid [OVM]-specific IgE &lt; 0.1 kUA/L; skin prick test [SPT] negative). Three oral food challenges (OFCs) at 6-month intervals at our hospital all triggered vomiting and lethargy. Procalcitonin and thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine levels remained elevated for 24 hours, and even after 31 months, the patient had not achieved egg white tolerance. A 14-month-old girl presented with vomiting and lethargy after egg white ingestion while on a strict egg yolk- and egg white-free diet. Blood tests again showed no sensitization markers (egg white-specific IgE &lt; 0.1 kUA/L; OVM-specific IgE &lt; 0.1 kUA/L; SPT negative). Two OFCs at 6-month intervals confirmed FPIES, and even after 2 years, the patient had not achieved egg white tolerance. These cases highlight that egg white can trigger FPIES. Thorough medical history taking and diagnostic evaluation, including OFCs, are essential to distinguish FPIES from immediate-type food allergies.",

Adherence to clinical guidelines, such as the World Allergy Organization/European Academy of Allergy &amp; Clinical Immunology (WAO/EAACI) guidelines, is crucial for effective management. With the increasing role of artificial intelligence in medicine, large language models (LLMs) offer potential for clinical decision support. This study evaluates the performance of ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and Copilot in provid-ing guideline-adherent responses for HAE management.Methods: Twenty-eight key recommendations from the WAO/EAACI HAE guidelines were reformulated into interrogative formats and posed to the selected LLMs. Two independent clinicians assessed responses based on accuracy, adequacy, clarity, and citation reliability using a five-point Likert scale. References were categorized as guideline-based, trustworthy, or untrustworthy. A reevaluation with explicit citation instructions was conducted, with discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer.Results: ChatGPT and Gemini outperformed Perplexity and Copilot, achieving median accuracy and adequacy scores of 5.0 versus 3.0, respectively. ChatGPT had the lowest rate of unreliable references, whereas Gemini showed inconsistency in citation behavior. Significant differences in response quality were observed among models (p &lt; 0.001). Providing explicit sourcing instructions improved performance consistency, particularly for Gemini.Conclusion: ChatGPT and Gemini demonstrated superior adherence to WAO/EAACI guidelines, suggesting that LLMs can support clinical decision-making in rare diseases.

This study aimed to determine whether the training given by a dietitian to mothers of children with IgE-mediated food allergies increased the habit of reading food labels. Methods: Mothers of children with IgE-mediated food allergies were trained on reading food labels by a dietitian. Then, the mothers’ food label reading habits were measured with a questionnaire form at 3-month intervals before and after the training. Results: The study included 56 children with IgE-mediated food allergies and their mothers. Thirty-four (60.7%) of the patients were males. The median age was 10 (min–max = 1–52) months. The most common food allergen was eggs, and this allergy was detected in 31 (55.3%) of the patients. The most common systemic involvement was skin, which was seen in all patients (100.0%). Fifty-six mothers of children with IgE-mediated food allergies participated in the study (Median age: 30 years, min–max = 20–45). There were statistically significant differences between the pre- and post-training groups in terms of the answers to the question “What are the things that affect you the most when buying food?” as “Label information on food packaging,” “Do you look at the product label when purchasing food?” as “yes,” “If your answer is “yes,” “Which food group do you look at?” as “milk and dairy products or eggs and products,” and “What do you pay attention to on food labels?” as “allergen information” (P = 0.001,0.001, 0.001,0.001, and 0.001, respectively). Conclusion: This study concluded that providing training by a dietitian on how to read food labels to mothers of children with IgE-mediated food allergies increases mothers’ awareness of reading the labels.",

    "abstract": "Skin prick testing (SPT) is a major diagnostic tool in patients with allergic symptoms. The testing process may involve pain, anxiety, and stress on children and parents.We aimed to measure the level of pain and anxiety before and after SPT in children and parents, and tried to identify predictive factors.The children underwent SPT and parents completed the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) S-Anxiety before and after SPT, T-Anxiety before SPT. The study nurse completed Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) scores (<5 years) or Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale (VAS), (≥5 years) after the SPT, in order to quantify pain.A total of 523 children (5.3 [2.8-9.1] [median, interquartile range] years old, 59.5% male) were evaluated. Parent gender was a predominant factor for anxiety, as mothers had a higher pre-test STAI (S-Anxiety) score, STAI (T-Anxiety), and post-test STAI (S-Anxiety) score than fathers (p < 0.001). Pre-test STAI (S-Anxiety) scores of parents decreased with increasing age (for 0-<5 years, 5-<12 years, and ≥12 years; [p for trend = 0.016]). The children tested on the back had higher VAS scores compared with the ones tested on the forearm [2[0-4] vs 2[0-2], [p = 0.005]). Risk factors determining higher general anxiety STAI (T-Anxiety) scores above the median were female sex for the parent (OR = 1.68; 95% CI [1.10-2.57]; p = 0.017), and parent's education level being greater than or equal to high school level (OR = 1.83; 95% CI [1.27-2.64]; p = 0.001).SPT may cause anxiety and pain in a subgroup of children particularly in younger age, and if performed on the back. Anxiety levels were higher in mothers, and in parents with high education levels.",

We aimed to determine the frequency of local anesthetic allergy in pediatric patients.The medical records of 73 patients who presented to our clinic with a history of suspected allergic reaction to local anesthetics and underwent diagnostic testing between 2012 and 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Diagnoses were based on case histories, skin tests, and subcutaneous challenge tests.A total of 75 test series were carried out on the 73 patients (43 boys; median [IQR] age 9.25 [7.26-14.25] years, range 3-17.8 years). The most commonly tested drugs were lidocaine (n = 38; 50.6%) and prilocaine (n = 15; 20%). Local anesthetic allergy was confirmed in one (1.3%) of the 73 patients by positive subcutaneous challenge test with mepivacaine.There are limited data in the current literature regarding local anesthetic allergies and diagnosis test results in pediatric patients. Proven local anesthetic allergy is less common than expected by society and physicians, and therefore diagnostic tests are needed for patients with no contra-indications such as severe or life-threatening reactions.",

Also, the study aims to estimate the frequency of anaphylaxis episodes in children in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship region.Methods: Retrospective analysis of medical records of 29 children aged 0–3 years that presented symptoms of food-induced anaphylaxis. Medical charts were reviewed using a collection of documents with the clinical data.Results: The frequency of anaphylaxis was determined to be 0.3% of all hospitalized children aged 0–3 years and 1.9% of children suspected of food allergy. The mean age of an anaphylactic reaction was 12±9 months. The most common symptom was mild-moderate urticaria. The respiratory symptoms were significantly more prevalent in toddlers than in infants (p = 0.148). Cardiac symptoms occurred only in the infant group, i.e., in two (11%) infants. As a possible cause of the symptoms, in 18 (62%) cases, parents most often indicated the consumption of milk or milk-rice porridge. Anaphylaxis as the first manifestation of food-allergy was significantly more prevalent in infants than in older children (p = 0.0002).Conclusions: The incidence of anaphylactic reactions rated at 0.3% of all children hospitalized at this age. The most common symptoms of anaphylactic reaction were skin lesions. The primary cause of allergic reactions was cow’s milk after the first exposure at home. Anaphylaxis has different patterns of symptoms depending on the age of the child.",

The molecules can induce expression of the innate immune-related molecules that are essential against the bacteria. Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) is a potential caries-associated pathogen, and innate immunity plays a key role in inhibiting its development and the progression of inflammatory responses. Recently, the roles played by TLRs against S. mutans and the induction of inflammatory responses were evaluated by several investigations. This review article discusses updated information regarding the roles played by TLRs and their potential therapeutic effects against S. mutans.",

    "abstract": "Background: The bronchial infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is increasing in prevalence and severity worldwide. Despite appropriate tuberculosis treatment, most patients still develop bronchial stenosis, which often leads to disability. Polyphyllin II (PP2) is a steroidal saponin extracted from Rhizoma Paridis. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of PP2 on the advancement of Mtb-induced bronchial infection. Method: The effects of PP2 on cell viability were measured by using MTT and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) kit. The mRNA and protein levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-8 were elucidated by RT-qPCR and ELISA, respectively. The expression of NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) related inflammasome (NLRP3, IL-1β, and cleaved-caspase-1) and the activated degree of protein kinase B (AKT)/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB; p-AKT and p-NF-κB) were detected by Western blotting. Results: PP2 at 0, 1, 5, and 10 μM had little cytotoxicity on 16HBE cells. PP2 inhibited Mtb-induced cell proliferation and decreased LDH levels. We further found that PP2 could suppress Mtb-induced inflammatory responses and activation of NLPR3 inflammasome. Additionally, the role of PP2 in Mtb is associated with the AKT/NF-kB signaling pathway. Conclusion: PP2 inhibited Mtb infection in bronchial epithelial cells, by inhibiting Mtb-induced inflammatory reactions and activation of NLPR3 inflammasome. These effects may be exerted by suppressing the AKT/NF-kB pathway, which will provide a prospective treatment.",

Purpose: The aim of the study was to evaluate management of anaphylaxis in Greek pediatric departments. Methods: We performed a questionnaire-based study of children aged less than 16 years presenting with anaphylaxis in 10 national pediatric hospitals over a period of 2 years. Management of anaphylaxis was assessed prior to and after an informative intervention. Results: In all, 127 cases of anaphylaxis were identified. Epinephrine was administered in almost half of all cases (51.2%), predominantly through intramuscular route (88.5%), while the majority of anaphylaxis patients were treated with antihistamines (92.9%) and corticosteroids (70.1%). Epinephrine was more likely administered by physicians if the elicitor was a drug (P &lt; 0.003). Regarding long-term management, an epinephrine auto-injector was prescribed in 66.9% of patients. Follow-up information was available for most of the patients (92.9%), the majority of whom (76.3%) were referred to an allergist. More than half of these patients (63.6%) had a documented allergy follow-up, which identified a causative allergen in 53.3% of cases. No statistically significant differences were recorded prior to and after the intervention regarding management of anaphylaxis. Conclusions: This nationwide study highlighted the necessity of further improvement in terms of anaphylaxis treatment and secondary prevention measures. This presupposes appropriate education and training of healthcare professionals, thus contributing to proper and comprehensive care of the pediatric population.",

Despite advances in myasthenia gravis treatment, current approaches remain unsatisfactory and many result in unexpected side effects. Traditional Chinese medicine has shown great potential in the treatment of myasthenia gravis, including relieving myasthenic symptoms, improving patients' quality of life, and reducing Western medicine side effects. This study investigates the protective effects and mechanism of BZYQD in mice with acquired myasthenia. BZYQD alleviates the reduced grip strength and increased expression of MAFbx and MuRF-1 in mice with acquired myasthenia. It also reduces levels of pro-inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the mouse serum. In addition, BZYQD reduces ROS accumulation and the mitochondrial ROS production rate, while increasing ATP levels and mitochondrial membrane potential in mice with acquired myasthenia. Moreover, BZYQD decreases the expression of p-JAK2, p-STAT3, and p-AKT in the skeletal muscle of mice with acquired myasthenia. In summary, BZYQD reduces inflammation, enhances mitochondrial function, and regulates the JAK2/STAT3/AKT signaling pathway to treat acquired myasthenia.",

The OVA-LPS-induced asthmatic mice were treated with thymol. Methacholine challenge test, eosinophil count, and levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-33 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, total and OVA-specific IgE levels in serum, remodeling factors, gene expression of TGF-β, Smad2, Smad3, and lung histopathology were done. Treatment with thymol could control AHR, eosinophil percentage levels of Th2 cytokines and Igs, remodeling factors, expression of TGF-β, Smad2 and Smad3 genes, inflammation, goblet cell hyperplasia, and mucus production in asthmatic mice. Thymol can control asthma pathogens and related remodeling and fibrosis bio-factors and can be a potential treatment of asthma.",

Cigarette smoke and cigarette extracts were used to create in vitro and in vivo models of COPD. ELISA was used to measure the levels of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β) in mouse lung tissue and alveolar macrophages. Flow cytometry assessed the phagocytic capacity of alveolar macrophage. Western blotting was used to analyze the expression of RhoA, PPARγ, IκBα, p-IκBα, P65, and p-P65 in alveolar. The results show that SMP reversed the increased levels of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β) in mouse lung tissue and alveolar macrophages induced by cigarette smoke and cigarette extract. SMP also restored the decreased fluorescence intensity and RhoA levels in alveolar macrophages caused by cigarette extract. Additionally, SMP increased PPARγ expression and decreased IκBα and P65 phosphorylation in alveolar macrophages exposed to cigarette extract. Also, the effects of SMP were reversed by PPARγ inhibitors. The study concluded that SMP regulates alveolar macrophage phagocytic function through the PPAR-γ/NF-κB pathway, thereby improving the chronic inflammatory state of COPD.",

Data regarding D-dimer levels in acute urticaria in children are limited.To assess potential associations between duration of glucocorticosteroid (GCS) therapy and D-dimer concentrations in children with acute urticaria.Hospital records of 106 children (59 females), aged 5.57 ± 4.91 years, hospitalized in 2014-2018 were analyzed retrospectively. The study group consisted of pediatric patients admitted to the hospital due to severe acute urticaria resistant to antihistaminic treatment that was ordered in the ambulatory care (out-patient clinic). Patients were divided into subgroups: no GCS treatment, short-duration treatment (up to 5 days) and long-duration treatment (6 and more days) GCS treatment. Simultaneously, patients received antihistaminic drugs. D-dimer level and other inflammatory factors such as white blood cell (WBC) count, platelet (PLT) count, and C-reactive protein (CRP) in each group were analyzed.The D-dimer level was elevated in 51% of cases. In the subgroup with longer GCS treatment, D-dimer concentration was significantly higher in comparison to patients with a shorter GCS course. There were no differences in the distribution of CRP, PLT, and WBC concentrations between these subgroups.In the studied group of children, there was a tendency for higher D-dimer levels in patients, who required a longer GCS treatment. This finding is hypothesis-generating and requires further investigation to confirm if D-dimers can be used as a prognostic factor in acute urticaria in children.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosis of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated egg allergy is often based on both a compatible clinical history and either elevated IgE levels or a positive skin prick test. However, the gold standard is the oral food challenge (OFC). Previous studies have pointed to a correlation between IgE levels and OFC outcomes.This study aimed to determine the relationship between IgE levels and the outcome of OFC, seeking to establish cut-off OFC values that indicate a high likelihood of positive OFC results.A total of 198 patients who underwent OFC (and a serological IgE antibody assay within the three preceding months) were reviewed and divided by OFC type (i.e., baked, cooked, or raw egg). IgE-specific levels were assessed against the challenge outcome as well as cut-offs proposed by other authors.Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis yielded a potentially useful ovomucoid IgE-specific cutoff used in OFC with cooked egg and several egg white and ovalbumin IgE-specific cut-offs for OFC with raw egg. We found no significant relationship between other specific IgE concentrations and the challenge threshold level with baked eggs.IgE-specific concentrations are useful as predictors of OFC outcome and should be considered when selecting patients challenge testing with boiled or raw egg. However, patients should undergo OFC with baked egg regardless of IgE levels.",

    "abstract": "Background: Papular urticaria is a hypersensitivity reaction characterized by chronic and recurrent papular erythema. It occurs as a result of the bites of mosquitoes, fleas, bed bugs, and other insects; and it is generally seen in children. This study examines the prevalence of atopic diseases in patients with papular urticaria. Methods: The medical records of 130 pediatric patients with the diagnosis of papular urticaria between August 2017 and August 2019, whose disease progression was followed in two ter-tiary care centers, were reviewed retrospectively. The patients were divided into two groups: under 5 and above 5 years old. The prevalence of the atopic disease in children with papular urticaria was compared with those in age-matched controls without papular urticaria. Results: The study included 130 patients who were diagnosed with papular urticaria (64 males, 66 females, median age: 60 months). The prevalences of atopic disease, recurrent wheezing, and atopic dermatitis were higher in the group under 5 years old with papular urticaria than in the same-age control group (p = 0.001, 0.002, and 0.001, respectively). The prevalences of atopic disease, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis were higher in the group above 5 years old with papular urticaria than in the same-age control group (p = 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, and 0.007, respectively). Conclusions: Many children with papular urticaria are atopic children. These patients should be assessed not only in terms of papular urticaria but also in terms of comorbid atopic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) are a group of more than 400 disorders representing aberrant functioning or development of immune system. Hypopigmentation syndromes also characterize a distinguished cluster of diseases. However, hypopigmentation may also signify a feature of genetic diseases associated with immunodeficiency, such as Chediak–Higashi syndrome, Griscelli syndrome type 2, Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome type 2 and type 10, Vici syndrome, and P14/LAMTOR2 deficiency, all of which are linked with dysfunction in vesicular/endosomal trafficking. Regarding the highly overlapping features, these disorders need a comprehensive examination for prompt diagnosis and effective management. As an aid to clinician, distinguishing the pathophysiology, clinical phenotype, and diagnosis as well as treatment options of the six mentioned PID disorders associated with hypopigmentation are described and discussed in this review.",

    "abstract": "The frequency of allergic diseases in tropical Latin American populations is poorly understood, and certain particularities can impact their natural history and risk factors.The study aimed to determine the frequency of self-reported allergies (allergic diseases, drug, and food allergies) in patients who attended the Hospital Universitario Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá, Colombia.A retrospective study was conducted to assess the frequency of self- reported allergies reported by all the patients who attended an allergy referral center between June and December 2019.A total of 60978 patients were included. Allergic rhinitis was reported by 1.51% (n = 921), asthma by 1.28% (n = 782), and atopic dermatitis by 0.41% (n = 250) of the study population. A higher frequency of self-reported allergic diseases (rhinitis, asthma, and dermatitis) was found in the younger populations, while drug allergies were more frequently reported in adults. The most frequently self-reported drug allergies were penicillin allergy (4.07%, n = 2479), and non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) allergy (1.85%, n = 1116). The most commonly reported food allergens included shellfish (0.58%), fruits (0.54%), cow's milk protein (0.37%), and eggs (0.21%).The distribution of food allergens showed a higher frequency of shrimp and fruit allergies compared to previous studies on African, Asian, and Arabic tropical populations that describe a higher predominance of egg and milk allergies. Patients reporting allergic diseases should always be referred to the allergology department for confirmatory testing.",

Atopy (35.1% vs. 11.6%, p < 0.001) and grass pollen sensitization (28.7% vs. 8.1%, p < 0.001) were significantly more frequent in children with mosquito allergy. Skin prick test with mosquito allergen was positive in only 6 children (6,4%). Grass pollen sensitization was most common in children (28.7%) followed by sensitization to house dust mite (9.6%). 30 children (31.9%) had an accompanying atopic disease such as allergic rhinitis, asthma or atopic dermatitis. Bullae were significantly more frequent in children with asthma (41.7% vs.15.9, p = 0.034). The median duration of symptoms after onset were significantly longer in patients with ecchymosis, with immediate wheals and in children whose symptoms start in 20 min to 4 hours after mosquito bites.There is an association between unusual, large local or exaggerated reactions after mosquito bites and allergic diseases in children. The severity of reactions increases with age and particularly in children with atopic background.",

The random-effects residual maximum likelihood model was performed, and effect sizes were estimated using the Hedge’s g statistic. All data analysis was performed using STATA 16.0 (StataCorp LP, TX, USA). Results: Fourteen studies reporting on 794 participants were included in this study. House dust mite was associated with eliciting a stronger immune response mediated by both IL-4 and IL-5 when compared to pollen. Whereas a mixture of house dust mite and pollen was associated with IL-4-weighted inflammation. Comparisons of IL-4 and IL-5 levels amongst the allergens showed significant differences. The treatment with anti-corticosteroids or allergen-specific immunotherapy was effective in normalising the TH2 responses and alleviating allergy symptoms.Conclusion: TH2-mediated inflammation in allergic reactions is allergen-dependent. Therefore, the type of allergen should be considered when using cytokine-targeting biologics in allergic reactions.",

    "abstract": "Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most frequent autoinflammatory disorder characterized by short, repeated, and self-limiting crises of fever and serositis. The disease was described as autosomal recessive hereditary transmission secondary to variants of the MEFV (MEditerranean FeVer) gene, even though a variable proportion of patients only present a heterozygous variant. FMF is very common in certain ethnic groups (Turkish, Armenian, Arab, and Jewish), even though it has been described throughout the Mediterranean and elsewhere in the world. The clinical manifestations are variable, with secondary amyloidosis being the most serious complication of the disorder. Treatment and prophylaxis are mainly based on the administration of colchicine, which prevents the crises and avoids complications in most cases. This study reviews the course of seven pediatric patients diagnosed with FMF during the period 2010-2018 at a district hospital. Most of the patients were of Caucasian origin, with onset at an early age in the form of fever as the main symptom, and some patients moreover presented less frequent manifestations (pericardial effusion, sensorineural hearing loss). Two cases presented plasmatic amyloid A protein elevation that subsided with the treatment. All the patients initially received colchicine, and one of them required prescription of anakinra, which was replaced by canakinumab due to a serious adverse reaction. There were no cases of consanguinity, and all the patients were of Mediterranean origin. The subjects showed a favorable course over the years, which was attributed to the early diagnosis and treatment provided.",

    "abstract": "Background: Respiratory infections (RI) significantly burden society, mainly when there are recurrent respiratory infections (RRI). Thus, there is a need to prevent RI in clinical practice. In this regard, the modulation of the immune system and resolution of the inflammatory cascade could represent an ideal way to prevent RI. Stimunex® gocce, a multicomponent food supplement, contains Sambucus nigra extract, β-glucan, Zinc, and Vitamin D3. This study investigated its ability to prevent RRI in children using a real-world setting: the pediatric primary care. Materials and methods: Two hundred and ninety-eight children with RRI were enrolled in the current study. The food supplement was randomly prescribed to 160 children with RRI daily for 4 months (Active group); the remaining 138 children with RRI were treated only with standard therapy for RI (Control group). The number and duration of RI, parental perception of symptom severity and treatment efficacy, use of medications, and school and working absence were evaluated. Results: Children treated with Stimunex® gocce had significantly less RI than the Control group, both concerning upper and lower RI (p˂0.001 and 0.003, respectively) during the follow-up period. Moreover, children in the Active group experienced shorter RI duration during the treatment and follow-up phases (p˂0.001 for both). In addition, parents of treated children perceived less severe symptoms and better treatment efficacy during the first and follow-up phases (p˂0.001 for all). The food supplement was well tolerated and there was no adverse event. Conclusions: The current real-world study demonstrated that Stimunex® gocce supplementation in children with RRI might safely prevent RI episodes and reduce RI duration. These outcomes should be highlighted as obtained during the COVID-19 pandemic era, characterized by a dramatic reduction of RI.",

    "abstract": "Although early diagnosis, antibiotic therapies, corticosteroid application, and health care services are conventional managements for pneumonia, antibiotic resistance and adverse reactions remain as limitations for pneumonia treatment.The study attempted to evaluate the potential role of EPSTI1 against pneumonia and reveal its underlying mechanism.Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (5, 10, and 20 μg/mL) was applied in WI-38 cells to establish the in vitro pneumonia model. Knockdown of epithelial-stromal interaction 1 (EPSTI1) was performed by transfection with EPSTI1 siRNA (siEPSTI1) into LPS-treated cells. Cell Counting Kit-8 assays were implemented to measure cell viability, and apoptotic cells were detected using flow cytometry. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunoblotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were conducted to quantify EPSTI1 expression, and proteins related to nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell (NF-κB) signaling, including p-p65, p65, p-IκBα, and IκBα.EPSTI1 was highly expressed in LPS-treated WI-38 cells. Cell apoptosis was promoted, and cell viability was inhibited after being exposed to LPS. Besides, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were dramatically upregulated. Knockdown of EPSTI1 restored cell viability, inhibited cell apoptosis, and attenuated expressions of proinflammatory factors. Additionally, knockdown of EPSTI1 visibly decreased the increased ratios of p-p65/p65 and p-IκBα/IκBα induced by LPS. Knockdown of EPSTI1 alleviated inflammatory injury through the inactivation of the NF-κB pathway.These results provided promising management in preventing pneumonia in patients.",

Materials and methods: All patients underwent dermatological examinations, including assessment of Scoring Atopic dermatitis (SCORAD) index and Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) scores, TNF-α, IFN-γ, Il-2, Il-4, Il-5, Il-6, Il-8, Il-12, I-17A, Il-18, Il-22, Il-33, and T. There were 39 patients with a diagnosis of ADPS, 45 patients with PS, 47 patients with AD, and 42 healthy controls. Results: Patients with ADPS were mainly men with a proportional distribution of skin lesion areas. Significant differences were observed in the concentration of Il-17A between patients with ADPS and those with AD or PS and controls, which were as follows: 16.1 ± 5.4, 5.8 ± 2.1, 5.0 ± 3.1, and 3.3 ± 1.8 pg/mL, respectively.

    "abstract": "Sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) is a syndrome associated with inflammation. Cornus iridoid glycoside (CIG), a bioactive component isolated from Corni Fructus, exhibits anti-inflammatory activities. However, the function and underlying mechanisms of CIG in mice with sepsis-induced ALI remain elusive.The sepsis-elicited ALI model of mice was established by the induction of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The wet/dry (W/D) ratio of lung tissues was examined, and the pathological alterations were determined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions and serum levels of Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent serologic assay, respectively. The concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were assessed by biochemical kits. In addition, the relative protein levels of p-p65, p65, phosphorylated- nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, alpha (p-IκBα), IκBα, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene were analyzed by Western blotting analysis.CLP enhanced W/D ratio and aggravated pathological changes and scores in mice, which were obviously alleviated by the two concentrations of CIG treatment. CIG treatment notably decreased the CLP-induced mRNA expressions and serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and MDA, but enhanced the decreased concentrations (caused by CLP) of SOD and GSH-Px. Moreover, CIG treatment significantly decreased the ratios of p65/p-p65 and IκBα/p-IκBα caused by CLP, but aggravated the CLP-induced relative protein levels of Nrf2 and HO-1.CIG obviously ameliorated the sepsis-induced ALI in mice by suppressing inflammation and oxidative stress, which was closely associated with nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and Nrf2-HO-1 signaling pathways.",

Ectodysplasin A (EDA) binds to ectodysplasin A2 receptor (EDA2R) and is essential for normal prenatal development. The functioning of EDA2R in bronchopulmonary dysplasia is investigated in this study.Murine lung epithelial cells (MLE-12) were exposed to hyperoxia to induce cell injury. Cell viability and apoptosis were detected, respectively, by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) assay and flow cytometry. Inflammation and oxidative stress were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent serologic assay.Hyperoxia decreased cell viability and promoted cell apoptosis of MLE-12. EDA2R was elevated in hyperoxia-induced MLE-12. Silencing of EDA2R enhanced cell viability and reduced cell apoptosis of hyperoxia-induced MLE-12. Hyperoxia-induced up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), Interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-18 as well as MLE-12 was suppressed by knockdown of EDA2R. Inhibition of EDA2R down-regulated the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), up-regulated superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione (GSH) in hyperoxia-induced MLE-12. Interference of EDA2R attenuated hyperoxia-induced increase in p-p65 in MLE-12.Knockdown of EDA2R exerted anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects against hyperoxia-induced injury in lung epithelial cells through inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to describe the serum vitamin D concentrations of children and adolescents with food allergy (FA) and to verify the association between the number of food allergens involved, length of sun exposure, and nutritional status. Through a cross-sectional study, 79 patients with FA, from ages 2 to 15 years, were assessed and followed up in a reference out-patient clinic, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Clinical and biochemical data were collected for analysis of 25(OH)D, calcium, phosphorus, phosphatase, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). The cut-off point used for vitamin D deficiency was 25(OH)D ≤ 20 ng/mL. Vitamin D deficiency was detected in 45.6% of patients with a median age of 6.9 years (Interquartile range [IQR] 4.7; 10.2). The median serum 25(OH)D concentration was 21.1 ng/ mL (IQR 17.8; 26.0). Multivariate linear regression was performed considering serum vitamin D level as a dependent variable. Allergy to multiple foods (inverse) and length of sun exposure (direct), but not nutritional status, were independently associated with serum 25(OH)D levels (P = 0.034 and P = 0.014, respectively). Patients with cow’s milk allergy also showed lower vitamin D concentrations in comparison with other FA (19.1 ng/mL [IQR 16.6; 24.4] vs 22.2 ng/mL [IQR 18.1; 27.1] [P = 0.056]). Vitamin D deficiency affected about half of individuals with FA. Multiple food allergy was associated with lower vitamin D concentrations, reinforcing the importance of monitoring vitamin D status in patients with FA.",

However, not all children with AR benefit from SCIT.To evaluate the efficacy of SCIT in dust-mites-induced AR children and explore correlative factors predicting treatment response to SCIT.225 children aged 4-17 years old with AR were recruited from January 2016 to September 2019, and monitored at baseline, 4, 12, and 24 months after the start of SCIT treatment. The visual-analogue-score (VAS) was used to assess the clinical symptoms. Multivariate binary logistic regression analyses and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to explore correlative factors in predicting the efficacy of SCIT.The significant declines in VAS started after 4 months of SCIT and continued to improve throughout the study compared with baseline. An increase in children's age (OR=0.688, 95%CI: 0.479-0.988) and those with allergic history (OR=0.097, 95%CI: 0.009-1.095) were negatively associated with the risk of poor efficacy. Polysensitized children were more likely to suffer poor efficacy (OR=15.511 95%CI: 1.319-182.355). The clinical response at month 4 (r=0.707) and month 12 (r=0.925) was related to that at month 24. The area under the curve (AUC) for improvement at month 4 and month 12 was 0.746 and 0.860, respectively.Our study confirmed the clinical efficacy of SCIT in AR children. Children with younger age, negative allergic history, and multiple allergens may predict a worse efficacy. The onset of action and the clinical response to SCIT in the second year can be predicted as early as by month 4.",

    "abstract": "Food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) is characterized by bloody stools in well-appearing infants. Zinc is a micronutrient that plays a crucial role in immune modulation and is essential for cellular function during immune response. Although there are studies on the assessment of intracellular zinc levels in allergic diseases, no data is available on erythrocyte zinc levels of patients with FPIAP.This study aimed to assess the erythrocyte zinc levels of children with allergic proctocolitis and compare zinc levels with clinical and demographic characteristics.This was a case-control study that prospectively compared 50 patients with FPIAP and 50 healthy children without malnutrition. The erythrocyte zinc levels of children were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry.Fifty patients with FPIAP, including 28 (51%) girls, with median age of 7.1 ± 2.9 (3-14) months and 50 healthy children, including 26 (53.1%) girls, with median age of 7.7 ± 2.8 (3-13) months were included in the study. Seventy percent (n = 35) of the patients with FPIAP started to have symptoms while they were exclusively breastfeeding. Offending allergen foods were cow's milk (78%), egg (40%), sesame (10%), hazelnut (8%), almond (6%), beef (6%), and peanuts (6%, n = 3). Intracellular (erythrocyte) zinc levels in patients with FPIAP were lower than in the healthy control group (495.5 ± 134 µg/dL, 567.3 ± 154.4 µg/dL, respectively, P = 0.01). Patients with FPIAP aged younger than 6 months had lower intracellular zinc levels compared with those aged above 6 months (457 ± 137 µg/dL; 548 ± 112 µg/dL, respectively, P = 0.01). There was no relationship between zinc levels and time of symptom onset, presence of concomitant disease, being allergic to multiple foods, and family history of atopy (P > 0.05).FPIAP is a food allergy with limited information on its pathogenesis. Considering the beneficial effects on gastrointestinal system epithelia, zinc may be involved in the pathogenesis of FPIAP. Future comprehensive prospective research on this subject is of importance.",

The number of relevant publications has been continuously increasing over the past 20 years, with many of the publications coming from Germany and the United States of America. In terms of institutions, the ALK Company in Denmark, Imperial College London in United Kingdom, and Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin in Germany published the most articles on immunotherapy for ARC. Meanwhile, Allergy and Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology published the most number of studies, and Oliver Pfaar from Germany authored the most number of articles. \"Subcutaneous immunotherapy,\" \"international consensus,\" \"allergen immunotherapy,\" and \"recommendation\" were the most popular subjects. Thus, directions in research can be predicted as studies regarding mechanisms of ARC, clinical trials, and extracts have reported high-quality results.Over the past 20 years, the overall quality of research on immunotherapy for ARC has gradually improved, allowing the introduction of specific and targeted treatment. Currently, the main focus of ARC research is the novel routes of drug delivery and combined treatment with biological agents.",

    "abstract": "Background: Tropics have some particularities that can impact the natural history and fac-tors associated with allergic diseases. However, few studies described the characteristics of patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and combined AR and asthma syndrome (CARAS) in Latin American tropical countries. Objective: This study aimed to determine the medical, social, and environmental factors associated with AR and CARAS in children aged 5–18 years treated with immunotherapy in two allergy referral centers in Bogotá (Colombia).Material and methods: An observational, cross-sectional study was conducted between January 2018 and January 2019. International Study Asthma Allergies Childhood-III and socio-demographic questionnaires were applied to adolescents and parents of children undergoing immunotherapy at the allergy consult in the Hospital Universitario Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá and UNIMEQ-ORL. Results: Among 830 children aged 5–18 years, 38.1% (n = 316) were women. Up to 63.25% of the population had a positive skin prick test for house dust mites: 63.25% for Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, 61.81% for Dermatophagoides farinae, and 31.57% for Blomia tropicalis. The fac-tors associated with AR were male sex (PR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.08–1.57), antibiotic consumption during the first year of life (PR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.63–0.99), and exposure to dogs (PR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.06–2.66). The factors associated with CARAS were older age (PR=0.95; 95% CI: 0.95–0.99), acetaminophen consumption over four times a year (PR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.03–1.55), and antibiotic consumption during the first year of life (PR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.06–1.34). Conclusion: A high prevalence of B. tropicalis was found in this study. The factors associated with AR and CARAS are like those described in high-income tropical countries. Further studies are needed in low- or middle-income tropical countries to identify modifiable factors associ-ated with allergic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Airway remodeling, which contributes to the clinical course of childhood asthma, occurs due to airway inflammation and is featured by anomalous biological behaviors of airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs). microRNA (miRNA) plays an essential role in the etiopathogenesis of asthma.This research was aimed to characterize miR-506 in asthma and uncover potential regulatory machinery.The asthmatic cell model was established by treating ASMCs with transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) and assessed by the levels of interleukin (IL)-1β and interferon gamma (IFN-γ). Using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, mRNA expression of miR-506 and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) was measured. Cell counting kit-8 and Transwell migration tests were used for estimating the capacity of ASMCs to proliferate and migrate. Luciferase reporter assay was used to corroborate whether miR-506 was directly bound to PTBP1. Expression of PTBP1, collagen I and III, and essential proteins of the wingless-related integration (Wnt)/β-catenin pathway (β-catenin, c-MYC and cyclin D1) was accomplished by Western blot analysis. The involvement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in asthma was confirmed by Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor (IWR-1).miR-506 was poorly expressed in asthmatic tissues and cell model. Functionally, overexpression of miR-506 reduced aberrant proliferation, migration, inflammation and collagen deposition of ASMCs triggered by TGF-β1. Mechanically, miR-506 directly targeted the 3' untranslated region (3-UTR) of PTBP1 and had a negative regulation on PTBP1 expression. Moreover, overexpression of miR-506 suppressed the induction of Wnt/β-catenin pathway. The administration of IWR-1 further validated negative correlation between miR-506 and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in asthma.Our data indicated that targeting miR-506/PTBP1/Wnt/β-catenin axis might point in a helpful direction for treating asthma in children.",

    "abstract": "Excessively active pulmonary inflammation is a hallmark of sepsis-induced lung damage. A synthetic retinoid drug called tamibarotene reduces inflammation in a variety of conditions, including acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), renal fibrosis, and neuroinflammation. Its effect on sepsis-related lung injury, however, has not been explained.The purpose of the study was to investigate how tamibarotene affected lung damage induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) procedure.A CLP sepsis mouse model was developed, and tamibarotene was pretreated to determine whether it improved lung injury and survival. The degree of lung injury was evaluated using the Hematoxylin and eosin staining and lung injury score. In order to determine pulmonary vascular permeability, measurements were taken for total protein and cell content of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), wet/dry ratio of the lung, and Evans blue stain. The BALF inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, and IL-17A were discovered by enzyme-linked immunosorbent serologic assay (ELISA). Then, the levels of heparin-binding protein (HBP), and phospho-nuclear factor kappa-B (p-NF-κB) P65, and NF-κB P65 were determined using ELISA and Western blot analysis, respectively.Tamibarotene considerably increases survival and lessens lung damage stimulated by sepsis. Specifically, tamibarotene significantly relieves pulmonary vascular permeability and inhibits inflammation response in sepsis. Moreover, we further confirmed that these ameliorating effects of tamibarotene on sepsis may be exerted by targeting HBP and regulating the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway.These findings demonstrated that tamibarotene lessens sepsis-induced lung injury, and the effect could be exerted by targeting HBP and thereby deregulating the NF-κB signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Pneumonia is an acute respiratory infection with increasing global incidences. Children are more susceptible to pneumonia than adults, and its incidences grow extremely high during peak seasons. Thus, it is necessary to investigate the pathogenesis and molecular mechanism of childhood pneumonia.This study examined the role of tumor necrosis factor alpha-inducible protein 1 (TNFAIP1) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pneumonia mice. After LPS exposure, lung function, TNFAIP1 activation, infarction volume, oxidative stress, lung tissue apoptosis ratio, and inflammatory response were assessed by immunohistochemistry staining, hematoxylin and eosin staning, Western blot analysis, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling assay, and enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay, respectively. The mechanism of TNFAIP1 regulating phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt)-nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway was analyzed by Western blot analysis.TNFAIP1 expression was enhanced in the LPS-induced pneumonia mice but was negatively correlated with the LPS-induced lung injury. Silencing TNFAIP1 alleviated inflammatory response, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cellular apoptosis in LPS-induced pneumonia. Moreover, PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathways were predominantly involved in the TNFAIP1-mediated lung injury, which also played a role in the process of LPS-induced pneumonia.This study suggested that TNFAIP1 acted as a negative regulator of acute pneumonia by attenuating inflammatory response, production of ROS, and cellular apoptosis via PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway. The findings suggested that TNFAIP1 is a potential candidate for pneumonia therapy.",

Cardiac arrhythmia is one of the cardiac complications, and it was observed in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, arrhythmia and cardiac arrest are common in COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit. The occurrence of cardiac arrhythmia in COVID-19 patients is associated with hypoxia, cytokine storm, myocardial ischemia and inflammatory disease such as congestive heart failure. It is necessary to know the occurrence and mechanisms of tachyarrhythmia and bradyarrhythmia in patients with COVID-19 infection for their proper management. This review provides an overview of the association between COVID-19 and arrhythmias by detailing possible pathophysiological mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Background: Asthma is a common lung disease with increasing incidence and prevalence globally, thereby imposing a substantial global health and economic burden. Recently, studies have shown that Mitsugumin 53 (MG53) exhibits multiple biological functions and plays a protective role in a variety of diseases. However, the role of MG53 in asthma remained unknown; hence, in the present study we aimed to explore the functioning of MG53 in asthma. Methods: Using ovalbumin and aluminum hydroxide adjuvant, an OVA-induced asthmatic animal model was constructed and administered with MG53. After establishing mice model, inflammatory cell counts and the levels of type 2 inflammatory cytokines were examined and histological staining of lung tissues were performed. The levels of key factors associated with the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway were detected. Results: Asthmatic mice displayed a remarkable accumulation of white blood cells, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, compared to control mice. MG53 treatment lowered the number of these inflammatory cells in asthmatic mice. The level of type 2 cytokines in asthmatic mice was higher than that in control mice, and was lessened by MG53 intervention. In asthmatic mice, airway resistance was elevated, which was reduced by MG53 treatment. In addition, inflammatory cell infiltration and mucus secretion were aggravated in the lung tissues of asthmatic mice, and both were attenuated by MG53 intervention. The levels of phosphorylated p65 and phosphorylated inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase were elevated in asthmatic mice, but were downregulated by MG53 supplement. Conclusion: The aggravated airway inflammation was observed in asthmatic mice; however, MG53 treatment suppressed airway inflammation by targeting the NF-κB pathway.",

These prevalences of rhinoconjunctivitis and nasal allergy in adolescents were higher than those described in the ISAAC (16.3% and 13%) and similar in schoolchildren to the ISAAC (9% and 9.4%).There has been a stabilisation of rhinitis, rhinoconjunctivitis and nasal allergy in schoolchildren that slows the previous upward trend of ISAAC; and a slight non-significant increase in rhinoconjunctivitis and nasal allergy in adolescents. The variability found in adolescents would require local research to be better understood.",

    "abstract": "Background: The Global Asthma Network (GAN) builds on the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC). Objective: To compare asthma prevalence time trends in primary and secondary school children in four Mexican centers participating in ISAAC and GAN. Methods: GAN is a cross-sectional, multicenter, epidemiological methodology carried out in groups of primary school children aged 6–7 and adolescents aged 13–14 following the ISAAC Phase Three protocol, with additional questions on risk factors and asthma management. Results: Overall, the prevalence of asthma symptoms and diagnosis in primary school children was higher in males than in females both in ISAAC (p &lt; 0.05) and in GAN (p &lt; 0.01), while adolescent females had a higher prevalence, also both in ISAAC (p &lt; 0.001) and in GAN (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: The prevalence of asthma and its symptoms has increased from ISAAC Phase Three since 2003 to GAN Phase I in Mexico in 2019. These findings are in line with the increases observed in the centers with low asthma baseline prevalence in ISAAC Phase One in comparison with ISAAC Phase Three.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence shows that circular RNAs (circRNAs) participate in the pathogenesis of multiple immune diseases. However, few studies have focused on the mechanisms of circRNAs involved in allergic rhinitis (AR).This study performed an RNA sequence (RNA-seq) profiling to identify the expression of circRNAs in nasal mucosa from ovalbumin-induced AR murine models and normal controls. Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was then conducted to validate the differential expression of circRNAs. Bioinformatics analysis was applied to demonstrate the biological functions of the dysregulated circRNAs.A total of 86 distinct circRNA candidates were sequenced, of which 51 were upregulated and 35 were downregulated. The T cell receptor, B cell receptor, and calcium signaling pathways may be involved in the pathology of AR. Furthermore, a circRNA-miRNA interaction network was constructed via miRNA response elements analysis. Some circRNAs were correlated with miRNAs that are involved in T cell polarization and activation, thereby highlighting their potential role in the pathogenesis of AR.This study demonstrates a number of aberrantly expressed circRNAs related to AR, and offers a novel perspective into AR pathogenesis and future therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Introduction and objectives: It was urgent to explain the role of egg yolk allergen sensitization to the egg allergic population and we would evaluate the diagnostic value of allergen components in whole eggs, including egg white and egg yolk.Materials and methods: Firstly, we collected 99 positive and 21 negative sera against egg allergy. Then we used modified enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to survey specific IgE (sIgE) to all-proven and single component in eggs, Ovomucoid (Gal d 1), Ovalbumin (Gal d 2), Ovotransferrin (Gal d 3), Lysozyme C (Gal d 4), Serum Albumin (Gal d 5), and YGP42(Gal d 6) in allergic and non-allergic populations. Last but not least, we studied the sIgE reactivities to egg allergen components by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.Results: Among egg-allergic individuals, nearly 10% were sensitized to five of six egg allergen components, and the cross-reaction frequency between two egg yolk allergens with Gal d 1 was about 30% in the groups diagnosed with egg allergy or non-allergy. The best component-combination diagnosis in egg allergy of Gal d 1+ Gal d 6 demonstrated the largest area under curve (AUC) of 0.994.Conclusions: Our results suggested that there were individual differences in allergenicity of different egg allergen components, especially in the samples negative to egg allergy diagnosed but sensitive to egg yolk components. It was indicated that component resolved diagnosis of egg yolk improved the value for egg allergy management indispensably.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Allergic diseases could play a role of a predisposing factor for coronavirus dis-ease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this study was to investigate allergic comorbidity and its association in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Demographic data, clinical manifestations, laboratory reports, and radiologic findings, together with underlying comorbidity of patients, were studies. Allergic diseases were identified by using the standard GA2LEN questionnaire. The severity of COVID-19 was assessed by a visual analog scale (VAS) and an intensive care unit (ICU) report. Results: Out of 400 COVID-19 patients admitted in the hospital, 158 (39.5%) presented with different allergic diseases, and a reverse association was observed between having allergic comorbidity and severity of COVID-19 infection (P = 0.005, relative risk = 0.96; 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI): 0.77–1.19). The respective frequency of asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR), chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), atopic dermatitis, chronic urticaria, and food or drug allergy was 7.3%, 16%, 1.8%, 5%, 10% and 13.3%. Significantly, only AR was reversely associated with the severity of COVID-19 (P = 0.02, relative risk = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.77–1.19). Additionally, 43% of the patients presented hypoxemia, and 93.5% had chest CT scan involvement. Interestingly, patients with allergic diseases had significantly lower hypoxemia and chest CT involvement as compared with non-allergic patients (P = 0.002 and 0.003, respectively). Conclusion: The results of this study established that allergic diseases were not determined to be a predisposing factor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Significantly, AR patients developed mild clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and admitted to ICU as compared to non-AR patients.",

Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 1 overlapping transcript 1 (KCNQ1OT1) was implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including cancer, sepsis, diabetic cardiomyopathy, and atherosclerosis. In this study, the influence of KCNQ1OT1 on the proliferation and migration of psoriatic keratinocytes was explained.Cultured human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) was incubated with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Cell viability and migration were assessed by MTT assay and wound healing, respectively. Target miRNA of KCNQ1OT1 was identified by luciferase activity and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays.KCNQ1OT1 was up-regulated in TNF-α-treated HaCaT cell line, and knockdown of KCNQ1OT1 reduced viability and suppressed the migration of TNF-α-treated HaCaT cell line. KCNQ1OT1 was bound to microRNA-183-3p (miR-183-3p) and negatively regulated its expression. Over-expression of growth factor receptor binding 2-associated binding protein 1 (GAB1) counteracted with the suppressive effects of KCNQ1OT1-induced silence on the viability and migration of TNF-α-treated HaCaT cells.KCNQ1OT1 silence suppressed the proliferation and migration of TNF-α-treated HaCaT cells through regulation of miR-183-3p/GAB1.",

    "abstract": "Fish allergy is generally thought to be persistent, and approximately 80% of patients with fish allergies do not develop tolerance even 10 years after diagnosis. There have been no reports of rapid tolerance development in patients with severe fish allergies. We report the development of tolerance 16 months after the diagnosis of fish allergies. A 13-month-old boy was diagnosed with rosefish allergy (Sebastes matsubarae) and Japanese jack mackerel allergy (Trachurus japonicus). To find out which species of fish he could consume safely, he underwent several oral food challenge (OFC) tests. It was determined that he could consume tuna, salmon, cod, sardine, chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus), and Japanese amberjack (Seriola quinqueradiata) without eliciting signs of allergy. He continued to eat the fish that did not produce allergic reactions three to four times a week. The titer of serum allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) to fish had decreased in a subsequent ImmunoCAP®-specific IgE blood test performed 16 months after the diagnosis of the rosefish allergy. Following this test result, he underwent OFCs with rosefish and Japanese jack mackerel, both of which turned out to be negative, and it was determined that he had developed tolerance to fish. In this case, the repeated OFCs were useful in identifying fish species that were safe for consumption. In addition, the decrease in allergen-specific IgE was useful in predicting the development of tolerance. We hypothesize that proactive consumption of available fish species may lead to this rapid induction of tolerance to fish allergens.",

    "abstract": "Background: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most prevalent micronutrient deficiency in preschool children in developing countries including India. IDA is associated with immune perturbation, which is reflected in greater frequency of infections in these children. Recent research has shown three distinct monocyte subsets with distinct functions linked to infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases. These subsets have not been studied in chil-dren with IDA. Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the percentage of monocyte population and the three subset populations in children with IDA and to compare the data with age-matched healthy controls. Methods: Venous blood samples (5 mL) from 40 IDA children and 20 controls were collected after taking informed consent. Monocyte subpopulations were compared across the two groups. The outcome variables were calculated using Students Independent t-test or Mann– Whitney U test. P value of &lt;0.05 was taken as significant. Results: No significant difference was found in the absolute numbers as well as percentages of total monocytes between the control and case (study) group. Children in the IDA group showed a significant (p = 0.03) decrease in the nonclassical subset population when compared to the control group. Conclusion: This is the first study done on monocyte subsets in iron-deficient children. Decrease in nonclassical monocytes observed may be associated with a pro-inflammatory state and increased risk of inflammatory and auto immune diseases. Follow-up studies are needed to confirm these findings.",

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of curcumol on the progression of asthma.Curcumol was administrated to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-stimulated airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs). The proliferation of ASMCs was assessed by MTT and EdU incorporation assays. The apoptosis of ASMCs was measured by flow cytometry and Western blotting. The migration of ASMCs was evaluated by Transwell migration assay and Western blotting. The regulatory effects of curcumol on extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)/cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) pathway was evaluated by Western blotting.The proliferation and migration of ASMCs induced by PDGF-BB was suppressed, and the apoptosis of ASMCs was elevated by curcumol in a dose-dependent manner. The activation of ERK/CREB pathway induced by PDGF-BB was suppressed by curcumol.Curcumol could suppress ERK/CREB pathway to inhibit proliferation and migration and promote apoptosis of PDGF-BB-stimulated ASMCs. These findings suggest that curcumol may act as a potential drug for asthma treatment.",

Check Behavior Checklist (CBCL) for ages 1.5-5 scores for the asthma and controls were compared. The asthma group was divided into two subgroups based on prophylactic therapy received, ICS and montelukast, and these groups' CBCL scores were also compared.The asthma group consisted of 95 children (ICS subgroup 45, montelukast subgroup 50) and the healthy control group of 60 cases. The mean total CBCL score was higher in the asthma group than in the control group (42 vs 32, respectively, P = 0.001).

No significant difference was determined in terms of CBCL scores between the ICS and montelukast groups (P = 0.3). Montelukast was discontinued in one asthmatic child due to hallucination.This study determined a higher rate of behavioral problems in preschool children with asthma compared to healthy children. In contrast to other studies in the literature, we determined no difference in terms of total CBCL, and internalization and externalization scores of children with asthma who received ICS and montelukast. Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that montelukast may cause serious neuropsychiatric events such as hallucination.",

In this study, the relationship between the severity of AD and the quality of life (QoL) of patients and their families were evaluated; also, the factors that predict the severity of AD and the QoL index were determined. Methods: Infants with AD were enrolled in the study. Pruritus, sleep disturbance, and dermatitis severity scores were obtained. The QoL of infants was assessed using the Infants’ Dermatitis Quality of Life Index (IDQOL), while the Family Dermatology Life Quality Index (FDLQI) was used to assess the impact of disease on the QoL of parents. Results: 122 patients diagnosed with AD were enrolled in the study. The correlation analysis of score showed a positive correlation between IDQOL and FDLQI (r = 0.444, p &lt; 0.0001). Positive correlations between the pruritus, sleep disturbance, Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), and dermatitis severity scores and the QoL indexes were found. While pruritus, sleep disturbance scores, and EASI were the most significant parameters for predicting a severe SCORAD score, IDOQL, FDLQI, and SCORAD were the most significant parameters for predicting severe EASI. In the analysis of QoL indexes, sleep disturbance and FDLQI were the most significant parameters for predicting severe IDQOL index, while IDQOL was the most significant parameter for predicting severe FDLQI scores.

Material and Methods: The viability and apoptosis of NCM460 cells treated with DEX with or without DSS were detected by CCK-8 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. The level of inflammatory factors and expression of inflammation-related proteins, tight junction proteins and Ras homolog gene family, member A/Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (RhoA/ROCK) signaling-related proteins in NCM460 cells treated with DEX and/or U46619 (RhoA/ROCK agonist) and/or DSS were detected by the respective enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits and Western blot analysis. The permeability of NCM460 monolayers was examined with transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) assay. Results: DEX had no effect on NCM460 cell viability. However, DEX improved the viability and barrier damage and suppressed the apoptosis and inflammation of DSS-induced NCM460 cells. Correspondingly, the expression of inflammation-related proteins was reduced and the expression of tight junction proteins was increased in DSS-induced NCM460 cells after treatment with DEX. In addition, RhoA/ROCK signaling was activated in NCM460 cells induced by DSS, which was suppressed by DEX. The protective effects of DEX on DSS-indued NCM460 cells were reversed by U46619. Conclusion: DEX improved viability and barrier damage while suppressed apoptosis and inflammation in DSS-indued NCM460 cells by inhibiting RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Background: Pneumonia, a severe infectious respiratory disease, is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in children. Cbp/P300 interacting transactivator with Glu/Asp-rich carboxy-terminal domain 2 (CITED2) functions as a transcription cofactor, and plays critical roles in the development of embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues, including fetal lung maturation. The present study investigates the role of CITED2 in infantile pneumonia. Methods: The human fetal lung fibroblasts (MRC-5 and WI-38) were treated with lipopolysaccharides to induce cytotoxicity, and the cell viability was detected by MTT. Inflammation was evaluated by ELISA, and western blot was used to investigate the pyroptosis. Results: CITED2 was down-regulated in lipopolysaccharide-treated MRC-5/WI-38 cells. The over-expression of CITED2 protected MRC-5 and WI-38 cells from lipopolysaccharide--induced cytotoxicity by increasing the cell viability and decreasing LDH expression. CITED2 reduced the expression of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β in lipopolysaccharide-treated MRC-5/WI-38 cells. Lipopolysaccharide stimulated pyroptosis in MRC-5 and WI-38 cells through the up-regulation of NL+RP3, GSDMD-N, caspase-1, IL-1β and IL-18. However, CITED2 down-regulated the expression of NLRP3, GSDMD-N, caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18 protein in lipopolysaccharide-treated MRC-5/WI-38 cells. CITED2 also down-regulated the protein expression of p-p65 in lipopolysaccharide--treated MRC-5/WI-38 cells. Conclusion: CITED2 exhibited anti-inflammatory effect on lipopolysaccharide-treated human lung fibroblasts and reduced pyroptosis through inactivation of NF-κB pathway.",

The present study is aimed to verify the CVID diagnostic criteria as established by the European Society for Immunodeficiencies in 42 CVID patients from our outpatient clinic.Information was collected from their medical records and when needed, lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood (PB) were performed by flow cytometry.All the patients fulfilled the clinical working definition for CVID and showed decreased serum IgG and IgA at diagnosis. Over two-thirds of the patients had decreased memory B cell percentages. However, the remaining patients exhibited other quantitative B cell defects in PB. Evaluation of vaccination responses was only found in 13 records and 69% were not responsive. None of the patients were subjected to vaccination studies to both, T-cell dependent and independent antigens. The two required tests to evaluate T cell responses were performed in 84.2% of the patients and reported normal. Without the support of third-party payers, only 34.2% of our patients would have completed the required evaluations.Further efforts are needed to speed up CVID diagnosis in low-resourced settings, increasing the availability of the required resources and optimizing the healthcare supply chain.",

    "abstract": "Background: CXCL3 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 3) is a member of chemokines family, which binds to the receptor to recruit neutrophils to lungs, thus participating in the pathogenesis of asthmatic lung. The role of CXCL3 in sepsis-induced acute lung injury is investigated here. Methods: Human lung epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) and human pulmonary artery endothelial cell line (HPAEC) were treated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). MTT and flow cytometry were performed to detect cell viability and apoptosis, respectively. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were used to assess the levels of inflammatory factors. Results: Treatment with LPS resulted in the decrease of cell viability in BEAS-2B and HPAEC. CXCL3 was particularly upregulated in LPS-treated BEAS-2B and HPAE cells. Knockdown of CXCL3 enhanced viability and suppressed apoptosis i006E LPS-treated BEAS-2B and HPAE cells. Knockdown of CXCL3 also upregulated TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-18 in LPS-treated BEAS-2B and HPAE cells. Moreover, knockdown of CXCL3 suppressed the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling in LPS-treated BEAS-2B and HPAE cells through downregulation of p-ERK1/2, p-p38, and p-JNK. On the other hand, overexpression of CXCL3 caused completely opposite results in LPS-treated BEAS-2B and HPAE cells. Conclusion: Knockdown of CXCL3 exerted antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects against LPS-treated BEAS-2B and HPAE cells, at least partially, through inactivation of MAPKs signaling, suggesting a potential strategy for the intervention of sepsis-induced acute lung injury.",

    "abstract": "Seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) is a common disease of childhood and is characterized by type 2 inflammation, bothersome symptoms, and impaired quality of life (QoL). Intranasal corticosteroids are effective medications in managing SAR. In addition, mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) is a well-known therapeutic option. However, the literature provided no data about the effects of MFNS in European children with SAR. Thus, this study addressed this unmet requirement.MFNS was compared to isotonic saline. Both treatments were prescribed: one drop of spray per nostril, twice a day, for 3 weeks. Nasal cytology, total symptom score (TSS), visual analogic scale concerning the parental perception of severity of symptoms, and the Pediatric Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (PRQLQ) were assessed at baseline, after 7 and 21 days, and 1 month after discontinuation.MFNS significantly reduced eosinophil and mast cell counts, improved QoL, and relieved symptoms, as assessed by doctors and perceived by parents. These effects persisted over time, even after discontinuation. Both treatments were safe and well-tolerated.The present study documented that a 3-week MFNS treatment was able to significantly dampen type 2 inflammation, improve QoL, and reduce severity of symptoms in Italian children with SAR, and was safe.",

Methods: It is a case-control study. A group of CSU patients (n = 100) was compared with healthy individuals as a control group (n = 100). VDR polymorphisms were genotyped by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Taqman® probes. Allelic, genotypic, and haplotype associations were estimated. Serum vitamin D levels were measured using enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay.Compared to the control group, the presence of G allele in TaqI and A allele in FokI SNPs of VDR gene was found to be a risk factor for CSU (odds ratio (OR) estimated using logistic regression adjusted by gender: 2.08 and 1.61, respectively, all P values < 0.05). The individuals who carry GCCA haplotype showed decrease in vitamin D levels (11.34 ng/mL; P = 0.002) with the G allele of TaqI and A allele of FokI gene SNPs.We reported for the first time the association of TaqI [rs731236] and FokI [rs2228570] VDR gene SNPs showing as a risk factor for CSU in a sample of multiethnic patients from the Colombian Caribbean population.",

A subgroup of patients with NSAIDs-exacerbated respiratory disease (NERD) develop urticaria/angioedema type reactions in response to NSAIDs. The Kalyoncu classification might be a novel option to classify patients with NSAID hypersensitivity (NH). In this study, we compare the ENDA and the Kalyoncu classifications.This study enrolled a total of 196 patients. NH reaction types were categorized as asthma, rhinitis, urticaria/angioedema and anaphylaxis. Based on the reaction history and oral provocation test findings, patients were grouped according to ENDA and Kalyoncu classifications.The mean age of the 196 patients was 40.32±13.28 years, and 130 (66.3%) of them were female. Under the ENDA and Kalyoncu classifications, the most common NH subgroups were NERD (32%), and isolated NH (34.2%), the least prevalent NH subgroups were single NSAID-induced delayed reactions (SNIDR) (1.5%), and pseudo Samter's syndrome (11.7%).Our research revealed that the Kalyoncu classification is more descriptive of patients with NERD exhibiting urticaria/angioedema-type reactions. It also provides future risk assessment for development of NERD. For controversial cases, the Kalyoncu classification can be utilized as a new complimentary option alone or in conjunction with ENDA classification.",

Congenital cardiac anomalies were the most common pathology associated with the syndrome (90.9%). Hypocalcemic symptoms were observed in 13 patients (40%). Twenty-two of the 33 (66.6%) patients were diagnosed before two years of age. Autoimmune diseases, dysmorphic facial findings, recurrent infections, growth retardation, and speech impairment were other clues for diagnosis in older patients. Clinical spectrum and immunological abnormalities of this syndrome are quite variable. All T-cell subset counts were less than 5th percentile below median by age in one patient (3%) and 10 patients had normal all T-cell subset counts (30.3%). Overall, 69.6% of the patients had normal IgG, IgA, and IgM levels and two patients had panhypogammaglobulinemia. Recurrent infections were revealed in 75.7% of the patients during follow-up.Presence of cardiac anomaly is more helpful in the diagnosis, especially under two years of age. Patients with immunologically high or standard risk did not show any difference in terms of numbers and severity of infections and autoimmunity.",

Patients who developed and did not develop reactions during OFC with baked milk were compared considering clinical and laboratory parameters.Results: Eighty patients with CM allergy comprised 48 male and 32 female infants with an average age of 7.25 ± 2.45 (3–13) months. We found that 62.5% of them showed tolerance to baked milk in the OFC test performed with cakes containing 2.6-g milk protein. When the patients who tolerated and could not tolerate baked-milk products were compared for test results, we detected a statistically significant intergroup difference regarding diameter of wheal in skin prick test (SPT) performed with muffin slurry, levels of specific Immunoglobulin E (sIgE) in CM, sheep’s milk (SM), goat’s milk (GM), casein, and the amount of unheated milk consumed until a reaction developed in the OFC test performed with unheated milk (P &lt; 0.05).Conclusion: We defined novel decision points based on CM, SM, GM, casein sIgE levels, wheal diameter in SPT with muffin slurry, and the amount of milk ingested during OFC performed with unheated milk that may be useful in predicting outcomes of baked-milk ingestion.",

Asthma is a disease of chronic inflammation of the airways, with clinical symptoms of wheezing, breathlessness, cough, and chest tightness manifested as chronic fixed or variable airflow obstruction and airway hyperresponsiveness that predispose the airway epithelium to repeated injury, repair, and regeneration. In recent years, innate lymphoid cells (ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3) have been discovered. The predominant ILC type found in the lung tissue is group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). Upon damage to the airway epithelium mediating the release of epithelial cytokines (TSLP, IL-33, and IL-25) ensued the activation of ILC2 in an antigen-independent manner. Activated ILC2 produces a significant amount of type 2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13), altogether contributing to type 2 inflammation in the airways. ILC2s are mediators of type 2 immunity for many type 2 inflammatory diseases such as asthma, since ILC2s were reported to play an important role in asthma pathogenesis. Here we discuss the role of ILC2 in the development of asthma and ILC2 effector cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) contributing to airway epithelial structural changes.",

To elucidate the mechanism involved, we investigated the effect of tamarixetin on the phosphorylation of signal molecules. Tamarixetin inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream signal molecules including IKK and nuclear factor κB. In addition, tamarixetin downregulated the phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.Taken together, this study suggests that tamarixetin inhibits degranulation and eicosanoid generation through the PLCγ1 as well as Akt pathways in BMMCs, which would be potential for the prevention of allergic inflammatory diseases.",

    "abstract": "It has recently been argued that asthma does not increase the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. If so, the prevalence of asthma in subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 should be lower than in the general population.To determine the prevalence of asthma in Mexican children and adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection.A public database of the Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Disease in Mexico was analyzed. Those who underwent the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-SARS-CoV-2 (rtRT-PCR-SARS-CoV-2) test from February 27 to June 21, 2020, were included. In addition to the prevalence of asthma, some factors associated with it were investigated.Data from 417,366 subjects were analyzed. Asthma prevalence in children, adults, and global were 3.7%, 3.3%, and 3.3%, respectively. Although the asthma prevalence was lower in SARS-CoV-2 positive over negative patients, significant differences were only found in adults (2.8% vs. 3.7% respectively; odds ratio (OR) = 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.71-0.77); but not in children (3.5% vs. 3.8%, respectively; OR = 0.91; 95%CI: 0.76-1.10). Multivariate analysis showed in younger than 18 years that girls and immunosuppression were factors associated with a decrease in the odds to develop asthma. In adults, asthma was positively associated with females, obesity, smoking, immunosuppression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arterial hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.The prevalence of asthma in child and adult were lower than those previously reported. Our study seems to support the hypothesis that asthma patients have a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are required to demonstrate the consistency of our findings.",

    "abstract": "The authors conducted two cross-sectional studies 8 years apart with the aim of assessing temporal trends in the prevalence of asthma and atopic diseases in Međimurje County, Northwestern Croatia.Studies were conducted in children aged 12 years 0 months to 14 years 11 months in 2005 and in 2013; additionally, in adolescents aged 18 years in 2013 according to the international study on asthma and allergies protocol.In the age group 12-14 years, a significant increase in the prevalence of asthma (5.1% vs 8.31%), allergic rhinitis (10.86% vs 16.24%), allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (7.14% vs 10.95%) and atopic dermatitis (5.34% vs 8.12%) was observed. When the age group 12-14 years in 2005 was compared with the age group 18 years in 2013, a significant increase in symptoms of asthma (5.1% vs 11.5%), allergic rhinitis (10.86% vs 19.59%), allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (7.14% vs 14.25%), and atopic dermatitis (5.34% vs 7.69%) was observed.This study shows an increasing trend in Međimurje County in the prevalence of all symptoms associated with atopic diseases: Asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and atopic dermatitis.",

    "abstract": "Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a malignant and fatal parasitic disease caused by the larvae of Echinococcus multilocularis (E. multilocularis), which inhibits the activity and proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells. In this study, the functional alteration of hepatic NK cells and their related molecules were studied. The AE-infected patient's tissue was fixed with formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained with Masson's trichrome or hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Single cells from AE-infected patient or E. multilocularis-infected mice were blocked with Fc-receptor (FcR), and stained with monoclonal antibodies, including CD16, CD56, CD3, KIR2DL1, granzyme B, perforin, Interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) or isotype control, to measure molecules and cytokines of NK cells and analyzed by flow cytometry. The Sirius red staining was used to quantitate hepatic fibrosis by calculating quantitative collagen deposition. AE can adjust both the number of hepatic CD56+ NK cells and its KIR2DL1 expression processes. Moreover, the overexpression of KIR2DL1 in NK cells could downregulate the functioning of immune cells in the liver area close to parasitic lesions. The number and dysfunction of NK cells in E. multilocularis infection could be related to the molecule dynamics of cell surface inhibitory receptor Ly49A, leading to hepatic damage and progression of fibrosis. This study illustrated significant increase in hepatic fibrogenesis and apparent upregulation of hepatic CD56+ NK cell population and its KIR2DL1 expression in AE-infected patients. This opposite variation might be related to the impaired NK cells functioning, such as granzyme B, IFN-γ, and TNF-α secretion. In addition, the cell surface inhibitory receptor Ly49A was related to the intracellular cytokine secretion functions of NK cells.",

    "abstract": "This work is aimed to compare the effectiveness of parenteral and inhalation bronchial asthma treatment in combination with glucocorticosteroids and bronchodilators. The study was conducted in 2020 in Botkin City Clinical Hospital (Moscow, the Russian Federation). Case histories of 106 patients diagnosed with bronchial asthma exacerbation of moderate severity were analyzed. Patients were divided into two equal groups based on the therapy method: (1) Group 1 received systemic glucocorticosteroids parenterally in combination with inhalation glucocorticosteroids; (2) Group 2 received systemic glucocorticosteroids parenterally, but inhalation therapy was performed with a nebulizer. Clinical manifestations of bronchial asthma have been recorded. During hospital admission, the breath rate was 22.0 for Group 1 and 21.5 for Group 2, P ≥ 0.05, and heart rates were 93.0 and 92.5, respectively (P ≥ 0.05). All indices (blood saturation, breath rate, peak output rate) in Group 1 remained unchanged 4 h after the start of the therapy, while in Group 2, peak flow rate changed to 53.5% with a median increase of 72.0 ml over 4 h, P ≤ 0.05. On Day 3, patients of Group 1 demonstrated a peak flow rate of 59.5%, P ≤ 0.05, and on Day 10, patients of Group 2 had a peak output rate of 53.0 and 59.5%, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). Systemic glucocorticoids were eliminated in 47 patients of Group 1 and in all patients of Group 2. The treatment tactics applied in Group 2 resulted in faster and more significant improvement in patients diagnosed with bronchial asthma exacerbation. Both treatment regimens showed high results.",

    "abstract": "Allergen component sensitisation testing is becoming increasingly important in the diagnosis of peanut allergy. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between sensitisation and symptoms of allergic disease in children by testing a large panel of inhalants, food allergens, and allergen components.For 287 children visiting our laboratory for allergy testing, symptoms of allergic disease were recorded by standardised validated questionnaires. Specific IgE to 11 whole allergens was assessed by ImmunoCAP, and to 112 allergen components by ISAC ImmunoCAP assay. We used latent class analysis (LCA) to distinguish clinical phenotypes.Inhalant and food allergen sensitisation was common, irrespective of the children's allergic symptom type. Less than 10% of the variance in symptom scores was explained by variations in the number of allergens (components) that the child was sensitised to. In LCA, 135 children (50.2%) had mild allergy, with few symptoms and sensitisation to no or few allergens, 74 children (27.5%) had more symptoms and sensitisation to inhalant allergens (respiratory allergy) and 60 children (22.3%) showed polysensitisation to a median of six allergens and had more severe symptoms of different organ systems. Adding allergen component test results to LCA failed to result in identifiable classes of allergic disease in children.In this group of children with allergic symptoms, referred for allergy testing by their physician, broad screening for allergen component sensitisation did not contribute to distinguishing phenotypes of allergic disease.",

    "abstract": "Background: Airway remodeling is implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma, and abnormal proliferation of airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) contribute to airway remodeling. Inflammatory mediator, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), stimulates the proliferation of ASMCs, and is associated with airway remodeling in asthma. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) has been widely used in the adjuvant therapy of acute asthma. Objective: The potential effects of DEX on extracellular matrix (ECM) production and proliferation of ASMCs were investigated in this study. Material and Methods: Human ASMCs were incubated with TGF-β1 for 48 hours, and then treated with different concentrations of DEX for another 24 hours. Cell proliferation was detected by MTT and BrdU (5’-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine) staining. Flow cytometry was used to assess cell apoptosis, and western blot was applied to identify the underlying mechanism. Results: TGF-β1 induced increase in cell viability and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) positive cells in ASMCs while repressed cell apoptosis. Second, TGF-β1-induced ASMCs were then treated with different concentrations of DEX. Cell viability of TGF-β1-induced ASMCs was decreased by incubation of DEX. The number of BrdU positive cells in TGF-β1-induced ASMCs was reduced by incubation of DEX. Moreover, incubation of DEX promoted cell apoptosis of TGF-β1-induced ASMCs. Third, incubation of DEX attenuated TGF-β1-induced increase in fibronectin, collagen I, MMP9, and versican in ASMCs. Lastly, the up-regulation of phosphorylated extracellular receptor kinase (p-ERK), phosphorylated Jun N-terminal Kinase (p-JNK), and p-p38 in TGF-β1-induced ASMCs was reversed by incubation of DEX. Conclusion: DEX suppressed TGF-β1-induced ECM production and proliferation of ASMCs through inactivation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, providing a potential strategy for prevention of asthma.",

However, overexpression of PTPRO aggravated lipopolysaccharide-induced cytotoxicity in HFL1. Overexpression of PTPRO upregulated protein expression of TLR4 and p-p65 in lipopolysaccharide-induced HFL1, while knockdown of PTPRO reduced the level of p-IκBα to downregulate levels of TLR4 and p-p65.PTPRO contributed to pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic effects on lipopolysaccharide-induced HFL1 through activation of TLR4/NF-κB signaling.",

This paper was intended to explore the underlying mechanism that DOCK2 might involve in the progression of acute lung injury (ALI). Following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induction in the purchased A549 cells, the expression level of DOCK2 was determined and its knockdown was performed by transfection. Subsequently, the viability, inflammation, oxidative stress barrier, and apoptosis of transfected A549 cells were measured to observe the alterations. Inflammation-related and apoptosis-related proteins were measured by western blot analysis. Finally, 8-Chlorophenylthio-cyclic monophosphate (8-CPT), ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (Rac) 1 agonist, was applied to treat cells for investigating the underlying mechanism regarding the role of DOCK2. According to the results, DOCK2 was upregulated in LPS-induced A549 cells. Following the knockdown of DOCK2, the release of inflammatory cytokines was alleviated, accompanied by attenuated oxidative stress, barrier injury, and apoptosis of LPS-induced A549 cells. Nonetheless, this trend was reversed by further treatment of 8-CPT. In summary, DOCK2 knockdown alleviates inflammation, oxidative stress, barrier injury, and apoptosis of LPS-induced A549 cells by associating with Rac1/Rac2. These findings highlighted the therapeutic potential of DOCK2 for the treatment of ALI.",

    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis is a globally common autoimmune inflammatory disease found especially in China. Acupuncture (AP), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment method, is commonly used for treating rheumatoid arthritis. Many studies have demonstrated that acupuncture alone or in combination with other treatments is beneficial to treat clinical situation of rheumatoid arthritis, thus improving function and quality of life. In this study, we found that centromere protein F (CENPF) is a key gene in rheumatoid arthritis with acupuncture treatment by using differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and random forest model analysis of GSE57983 and GSE77298. Acupuncture helps to up-regulate the expression of CENPF in tissues in rheumatoid arthritis. Functionally, overexpression of CENPF inhibits monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and Interleukin (IL)-6 expressions whereas deficiency of CENPF facilitates MCP-1, TNF-α, and IL-6 expressions in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model. Furthermore, knocked down CENPF with acupuncture treatment antagonizes the inhibition of MCP-1, TNF-α, and IL-6 expressions in a CIA rat model. CENPF could be a crucial biomarker in regulating function of acupuncture in treating rheumatoid arthritis. Objective: The objective of this study is to study the critical role of CENPF in regulation of rheumatoid arthritis with acupuncture treatment. Methods: PCA was used to analyze the different expression genes between AP treatment group and control group. Volcano plot and random forest model were used to analyze the decreased and increased expression genes. RT-qPCR and IF were used to measure the expression of CENPF in CIA model rat with or without AP treatment. The expression of MCP-1, TNF-α and IL-6 was measured by western blotting. The pathology character and arthritis index were used to analyze the severity of joint injury. Results: PCA data showed that the expression of genes was different between AP treatment group and control group from GEO datasets. Volcano plot and random forest model analysis indicated that CENPF is the most significantly increased expression gene after AP treatment. RT-qPCR and IF assay showed that CENPF is reduced expression in CIA model rat, while CENPF is upregulated expression in CIA model rat with AP treatment. Furthermore, overexpression of CENPF reduced the increasing of MCP-1, TNF-α and IL-6 in CIA model rat. On the contrary, CENPF deficiency induced the expression of MCP-1, TNF-α and IL-6 in CIA model rat. Additionally, the expression of MCP-1, TNF-α and IL-6 in CIA model rat was suppressed, whereas knockdown of CENPF antagonized the decrease of MCP-1, TNF-α and IL-6 in CIA model rat with AP treatment. Conclusions: CENPF may be a key gene in regulation of the therapeutic effects of acupuncture in rheumatoid arthritis.",

The diagnosis was based on the PID criteria of the International Union of Immunological Societies.The five main PID sub-types were identified. Predominantly, antibody deficiencies were the most common (61.7%) group. The average delay in diagnosis was 34.6 months, and the positive family history rate was 24.7%, while the consanguineous marriage rate was 45.7%. Around thirty-five (43%) patients were found to have mutated PID-related genes. While lower respiratory tract infections were the most common symptom, a fever of unknown origin was another remarkable diagnosis. Eight (9.9%) patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.Clinicians should consider a PID diagnosis, especially in the cases of recurrent, severe, or atypical infections.

The roles of different concentrations of CSE (0, 1, 2.5, 5, or 10%) in cell viability and ANGPTL4 levels were evaluated. Following ANGPTL4 being knocked down, the effects of ANGPTL4 knockdown on oxidative stress and apoptosis were determined. Moreover, the level of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) was upregulated to assess the mediated role of NOX in the regulation of ANGPTL4, along with JNK/p38 MAPK signaling. CSE treatment elevated the level of ANGPTL4, and ANGPTL4 knockdown reduced CSE-induced oxidative stress, apoptosis, and NOX level in BEAS-2B cells. The greatest degree of alteration was found in NOX2, and additional NOX2 overexpression broke the inhibitory influences of ANGPTL4 knockdown on oxidative stress and apoptosis. Otherwise, ANGPTL4 knockdown hindered the activation of JNK/p38 MAPK signaling, whereas NOX2 overexpression activated this signaling pathway. Together, ANGPTL4 knockdown attenuated CSE-induced oxidative stress, apoptosis, and activation of JNK/MAPK signaling by inhibiting NOX.",

Fifteen children tolerated the drug in the second DPT: 88.2% of those reevaluated and 57.5% of the whole study group.The positive predictive value of DPT may be lower than expected.

However, its pathogenesis remains unclear, and the existing treatments, including cytokine therapy, stem cell therapy, and hormone therapy, are not completely effective in treating this disease. Dimethyl itaconate (DMI) is a surfactant with important anti-inflammatory effects.The present study used alveolar type II (AT II) and bronchial epithelial cells as models to determine the role of DMI in lung injury.First, the effects of DMI were established on the survival, inflammatory release, and apoptosis in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced AT II and bronchial epithelial cells. The association between DMI and Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) was assessed using molecular docking. Next, by constructing interference plasmids to inhibit surfactant protein (SP)-A and SP-D expressions, the effect of DMI was observed on inflammatory release and apoptosis.The results revealed that DMI increased the survival rate and expression levels of SP-A, SP-D, and SIRT1, and inhibited inflammatory factors as well as apoptosis in LPS-induced cells. Furthermore, DMI could bind to SIRT1 to regulate SP-A and SP-D expressions. After SP-A and SP-D expressions were inhibited, the inhibitory effect of DMI was reversed on inflammatory release and apoptosis.The findings of the present study revealed that DMI inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory release and apoptosis in cells by targeting SIRT1 and then activating SP-A and SP-D. This novel insight into the pharmacological mechanism of DMI lays the foundation for its later use for alleviating lung injury.",

Specifically, in exacerbated asthma children: lncRNA THRIL is related to increased eosinophil count (P=0.013), immunoglobulin E (P=0.020), tumor necrosis factor-α (P=0.002), interleukin-1β (P=0.004), interleukin-6 (P=0.012), interleukin-17 (P=0.004) and exacerbated severity (P=0.030); Meanwhile, miR-34a and miR-125b linked with decreased levels of most of the above indexes (most P<0.05).LncRNA THRIL negatively relates to miR-34a and miR-125b, correlate with inflammatory cytokines, and exacerbated the risk and severity of childhood asthma, indicating their potential as biomarkers for childhood asthma management.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease that causes damage to and exfoliation of the airway epithelium. The continuous damage to the airway epithelium in asthma cannot be repaired quickly and generates irreversible damage, repeated attacks, and aggravation. Vitamin A (VA) has multifarious biological functions that include maintaining membrane stability and integrity of the structure and function of epithelial cells. Our research explored the role of VA in repairing the airway epithelium and provided a novel treatment strategy for asthma.A mouse asthma model was established by house dust mite (HDM) and treated with VA by gavage. Human bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells were treated with HDM and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in vitro. We analyzed the mRNA and protein expression of characteristic markers, such as acetyl-α-tubulin (Ac-TUB) and FOXJ1 in ciliated cells and MUC5AC in secretory cells, mucus secretion, airway inflammation, the morphology of cilia, and the integrity of the airway epithelium.Findings showed destruction of airway epithelial integrity, damaged cilia, high mucus secretion, increased MUC5AC expression, and decreased Ac-TUB and FOXJ1 expression in asthmatic mice. The VA intervention reversed the effect on Ac-TUB and FOXJ1 and promoted ciliated cells to repair the damage and maintain airway epithelial integrity. In 16HBE cells, we could confirm that ATRA promoted the expression of Ac-TUB and FOXJ1.These results demonstrated that VA-regulated ciliated cells to repair the damaged airway epithelium caused by asthma and maintain airway epithelial integrity. VA intervention is a potential adjunct to conventional treatment for asthma.",

Multidisciplinary teams have been proved beneficial in treating such complexities.We conducted a retrospective observational study at a tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain, which is a pediatric immunology and onco-hematology referral center. We included all patients of multidisciplinary outpatient consultation, comprising a working group of pediatric oncohematologists and immunologists, between April 2016 and December 2019. Epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected. We analyzed these data and established a relationship between age and findings of final diagnosis as well as variance on diagnoses prior to their multidisciplinary assessment and number of visits to the consultation.In all, 93 children and adolescents were included in this study. Laboratory abnormalities were the most frequent reason for being referred to our unit (87.2%); 78% of children had a previously diagnosed comorbidity. Before starting follow-up in the multidisciplinary consultation, 14% of patients were diagnosed, and after the study by the multidisciplinary team, the final diagnosis was reached in 58.1% of patients. No correlation was discovered between final diagnosis and gender (P = 0.29), age (biserial correlation coefficient, r = 0.036, P = 0.70), and number of visits (P = 0.07).A multidisciplinary approach to immunologic, hematologic, and oncologic pediatric diseases is feasible. It can be a powerful and useful tool for diagnosis and treatment, especially in complex pediatric patients.",

The correlation between BCL6 and Th1/Th2 cells and the effects of BCL6 expression on patients' QOL were assessed by Pearson analysis and Mini-RQLQ questionnaire.BCL6 was downregulated in patients with AR, serum BCL6 level < 0.8450 had certain auxiliary diagnostic values for AR, and serum BCL6 level < 0.5400 could assist the diagnosis of AR severity. Th1 cell proportion in CD4+ T cells was decreased, whereas Th2 cell proportion was increased with AR severity. BCL6 was positively-linked with Th1 cells but inversely-correlated with Th2 cells in patients with AR. Patients with AR with low BCL6 expression had a poorer QOL compared with high BCL6 expression. The domains most affected by BCL6 expression were practical problems, nasal symptoms, and lacrimation.Serum BCL6 is downregulated and low BCL6 expression greatly deteriorates QOL in patients with AR.",

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) ATPase plasma membrane Ca2+ transporting 1 antisense RNA 1 (ATP2B1-AS1) is dysregulated and is involved in the progression of various diseases. Nevertheless, the role of ATP2B1-AS1 in sepsis remains unclear.A human monocytic cell line, THP-1 cells, was stimulated to induce a model of sepsis in vitro. The levels of ATP2B1-AS1, miR-23a-3p, and TLR4 were assessed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The role of ATP2B1-AS1 in cell apoptosis and inflammation was explored by flow cytometry, Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent serologic assay. The binding sites between ATP2B1-AS1 and miR-23a-3p, and between miR-23a-3p and TLR4 were predicted by BiBiServ and the Encyclopedia of RNA Interactomes (ENCORI) online sites, respectively, and confirmed by the luciferase assay.The level of ATP2B1-AS1 was increased in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated THP-1 cells. LPS increased apoptosis ratio, relative protein expressions of pro-apoptotic factors, and relative messenger RNA (mRNA) level and concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but decreased the relative expression of anti-apoptosis protein and relative mRNA level and concentrations of anti-inflammatory factor. All these alterations were reversed with transfection of shATP2B1-AS1 into THP-1 cells. Moreover, ATP2B1-AS1 directly bound miR-23a-3p and negatively modulated the level of miR-23a-3p.

    "abstract": "Although platin desensitization is a safe and effective alternative for patients with hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), sometimes breakthrough reactions (BTRs) can be encountered. However, data about the risk factors for BTRs are limited. The aim of this study is to define the outcomes of desensitization, the characteristics of BTRs, and to identify the risk factors for BTRs with platins in thoracic malignancies. This is a retrospective report of patients with thoracic malignancies who underwent platin desensitization. Patients' demographics, initial HSR characteristics, skin test results, desensitization outcomes, and BTR characteristics were recorded. Thirty-three lung cancer and 14 malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) patients were included in the study. The culprit drug was cisplatin in 29 and was carboplatin in 18 patients. Skin test positivity was 43.5% with cisplatin, 50% with carboplatin, and it was found to be higher if the interval between the initial HSR and skin testing (ST) was ˃20 days (p = 0.027). One hundred and five desensitization courses were performed. Twenty-two patients had 33 BTRs. Skin test positivity was higher in the BTR-positive group (p = 0.025). BTRs (18.2%; n = 6) were more severe than initial HSR. In the case of epinephrine administration during initial HSR, epinephrine administration during the first BTR was found to be more (p = 0.036). The target dose was achieved in 92.4% of desensitization courses. The number of previous platin infusions ≥10 was found to be an independent risk factor for BTR development (p = 0.036 OR:17.641, 95% CI: 1.211-256.971). Identification of risk factors for BTR will guide appropriate management and desensitization approaches for platin HSRs.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose is to confirm whether long noncoding RNA HOXA-AS2 relieves chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH)-induced lung inflammation. Methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats were used to establisha CIH rat model. Hematoxylin and Eosin staining was used on the lung tissue injury to determine the successful construction of CIH animal model. Arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and carbon dioxide (PaCO2) were measured. HOXA-AS2 was overexpressed to evaluate its role in the progression and development of CIH. T cell differentiation and cytokine production were determined using flow cytometry. Cell apoptosis was determined using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling assay kit. The target of HOXA-AS2 and miR-17-5p was predicted by the Encyclopedia of RNA Interactomes (ENCORI) and confirmed using luciferase assay. Results: HOXA-AS2 was downregulated in CIH rat models. Lung tissue injury was observed in CIH rats, and the injury was attenuated by the overexpression of HOXA-AS2. PaO2 was reduced and PaCO2 was induced in CIH rats, which was reversed by the overexpression of HOXA-AS2. The overexpression of HOXA-AS2 inhibited CIH-induced cell apoptosis. It also reversed alterations in the levels of interferon gamma (IFNγ), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-β1) in rats caused by CIH. The overexpression of HOXA-AS2 prevented the induction in CD4+ IFN-γ+ T cells and reduction in CD4+TGF-β1+ T cells. The overexpression of HOXA-AS2 upregulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein 8-like 2 (tipe2) key regulator through directly targeting miR-17-5p. Further experiments proved that tipe2 was the direct target of miR-17-5p. Conclusion: This study manifested that HOXA-AS2 acted as an anti-inflammatory regulator and protected lung tissue injury from CIH in the rat model; this was mediated by upregulation of tipe2 through directly targeting miR-17-5p. HOXA-AS2 upregulated the expression of tipe2, providing new understanding and therapeutic target for CIH.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the role of neferine in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma, and to reveal the possible mechanism.In OVA-induced asthmatic mice, enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay was performed to evaluate the level of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-6, IL-1β, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Eosinophil, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts in BALF were calculated to assess inflammation. The pulmonary function was measured by airway resistance, peak expiratory flow (PEF) and forced expiratory volume/forced vital capacity (FEV0.4/FVC) ratio, and respiratory rate. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and Masson staining were used to evaluate lung injury. Further, Western blot analysis was conducted to detect phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.Neferine, 20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg, could significantly decrease the levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IgE in OVA-induced serum, and that of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and MCP-1 in OVA-induced BALF. Moreover, neferine could significantly decline eosinophil, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts in BALF. Neferine contributed to improve OVA-induced airway resistance, promoted the value of PEF and FEV0.4/FVC ratio, and recovered the respiratory rate. It also reduced mucus secretion, distribution of inflammatory and goblet cells around bronchi, and attenuated collagen deposition in lung tissues. Furthermore, neferine reduced the phosphorylation of p38, JNK, and ERK to inhibit MAPK signaling pathways.Neferine relieves asthma-induced inflammatory reaction, airway resistance, and lung injury by inhibiting MAPK signaling pathways. This could serve neferine as a novel therapeutic candidate for treating asthma.",

The wheal size of allergens in performed SPTs during and prior to the pandemic were compared. Detected changes in allergen sensitivities via SPT results were compared with changes in the disease severity parameters (AR severity, asthma severity, and the number of asthma exacerbations per year), frequency of upper respiratory tract infections and antibiotic use, laboratory parameters, demographic characteristics, and visual analogue scores (VAS).House dust mites (HDMs), cat, pollen, Artemisia, and Cupressus sensitization increased in AR patients during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. HDM, mold, and pollen wheal diameters increased in SPTs. Proportion of polysensitization increased during the pandemic, compared to pre-pandemic period (9.1% vs 3%; P < 0.001), and number of non-sensitized patients decreased during the pandemic period compared to the pre-pandemic period (7.9% vs 22.6%; P < 0.001). An increase in HDM sensitivity in SPTs was correlated with VAS for nasal blockage, and an increase in cat sensitivity was correlated with VAS for all nasal symptoms.We believe that inhalant allergen sensitization might have been affected by the lifestyle changes of patients during the pandemic. Hence, it is important to evaluate patients for allergen sensitization, especially patients with moderate/severe AR, to revise disease control measurements.",

    "abstract": "Food allergy (FA), hence the incidence of food anaphylaxis, is a public health problem that has increased in recent years. There are still no biomarkers for patients with FA to predict severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis.There is limited information on whether regulatory T (Treg) cell levels are a biomarker that predicts clinical severity in cases presenting with FA, and which patients are at a greater risk for anaphylaxis.A total of 70 children were included in the study: 25 who had IgE-mediated cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) and presented with non-anaphylactic symptoms (FA/A-), 16 who had IgE-mediated CMPA and presented with anaphylaxis (FA/A+) (a total of 41 FA cases), and a control group consisting of 29 children without FA. The study was conducted by performing CD4+CD25+CD127loFOXP3+ cell flow cytometric analysis during resting at least 2 weeks after the elimination diet to FA subjects.When the FA group was compared with healthy control subjects, CD4+CD25+CD127loFOXP3+ cell rates were found to be significantly lower in the FA group (p < 0.001). When the FA/A- and FA/A+ groups and the control group were compared in terms of CD4+CD25+CD127loFOXP3+ cell ratios, they were significantly lower in the FA/A- and FA/A+ groups compared to the control group (p < 0.001).Although there was no significant difference between the FA/A+ group and the FA/A- group in terms of CD4+CD25+CD127loFOXP3+ cells, our study is important, as it is the first pediatric study we know to investigate whether CD4+CD25+CD127loFOXP3+ cells in FA predict anaphylaxis.",

Patients' clinical efficacy, pulmonary function, fractioned exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), immune function, endothelial function, serum lipid peroxidation injury indexes, adverse reactions, and quality of life scores were compared.Prior to treatment, no significant differences were observed in various pulmonary function indicators, FeNO, immune function, endothelial function, and lipid peroxidation injury indexes between the two groups (P > 0.05). However, after treatment, all observation indexes in both groups improved to different levels, with the experimental group -demonstrating -significantly superior improvement, compared to the conventional group (P < 0.05). We also observed that adverse reactions in the experimental group were significantly lower than in the conventional group (P < 0.05).The combination of budesonide formoterol to tiotropium bromide in treating asthma-COPD overlap syndrome may significantly improve pulmonary function, endothelial function, and immune status of patients and encourage the recovery of serum lipid peroxidation injury; therefore, this may deserve widespread adoption and application.",

This study aimed to investigate the effect of ECH on asthma.A mouse model of asthma was established by ovalbumin (OVA) induction, and the effect of ECH on airway remodeling in mice was evaluated using the Periodic Acid-Schiff stain and enzyme-linked immunosorbent serologic assay (ELISA). Additionally, the effect of ECH on collagen deposition in asthmatic mice was assessed using Western blotting (WB) analysis, and response to airway inflammation was evaluated by ELISA. The signaling pathway regulated by ECH was also investigated using WB.Our findings demonstrated that ECH restored OVA-induced increase in mucin, -immunoglobulin E, and respiratory resistance. ECH also alleviated OVA-induced collagen -deposition, including collagen I, collagen III, alpha smooth muscle actin, and epithelial (E)-cadherin. Moreover, ECH restored the elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-13, IL-17, and the increased -number of macrophages, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and neutrophills induced by OVA. ECH mainly exerted its regulatory effects by modulating the silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (Sirtuin 1/SIRT1)-nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway in the mouse models of asthma.This study highlights the therapeutic potential of ECH for attenuating airway remodeling and inflammation in an OVA-induced neonatal mouse model of asthma through the modulation of SIRT1/NF-κB pathway.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a severe chronic respiratory disease affecting all age groups with increasing prevalence. Anti-inflammatory strategies are promising options for the treatment of asthma. Although the inhibitory effect of aloin on inflammation has been demonstrated in various diseases, its effect on asthma remains unknown.A mice asthma model was established by treating with ovalbumin (OVA). The effects and mechanism of aloin on the OVA-treated mice were determined by enzyme-linked--immunosorbent serologic assay, biochemical examination, hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's staining, and Western blot assay.OVA treatment in mice significantly increased the number of total cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, and macrophages and the concentration of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which were attenuated with the administration of aloin. The content of malondialdehyde was enhanced in OVA-treated mice, with the decreased levels of superoxide dismutase and glutathione, which were reversed with aloin treatment. Aloin treatment reduced the airway resistance of OVA-induced mice. The inflammatory cell infiltration around small airways was accompanied by the thickening and contraction of bronchial walls and pulmonary collagen deposition in OVA-treated mice; however, these conditions were ameliorated with aloin treatment. Mechanically, aloin upregulated the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) pathway but inhibited the level of transforming growth factor beta-SMAD2/3 genes (TGF-β/Smad2/3) axis in OVA-induced mice.Aloin treatment lessened airway hyperresponsiveness, airway remodeling, inflammation, and oxidative stress in OVA-treated mice, and was closely related to the activation of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and the weakening of TGF-β/Smad2/3 pathway.",

    "abstract": "Background: Hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a significant clinical issue. Several classifications have been proposed to categorize these reactions, including the current European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology/ European Network for Drug Allergy (EAACI/ENDA) classification. This study aimed to evaluate the applicability of this classification in a real-world clinical setting. Methods: We conducted a national multicenter study involving patients from nine hospitals in four major urban centers in Turkey. All patients had a suggestive clinical history of hypersen-sitivity reactions to NSAIDs. Researchers collected data using a structured form and classified reactions based on the EAACI/ENDA classification. Oral provocation tests with several NSAIDs were performed using a single-blind challenge per EAACI/ENDA guidelines. Results: Our retrospective study included 966 adult patients with a history of hypersensitivity to NSAIDs. The most common triggers were Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA), paracetamol, and metamizole. The most prevalent acute NSAID hypersensitivity group was NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema (NIUA) (34.3%). However, 17.3% of patients did not fit neatly into the current EAACI/ENDA classification. Notably, patients with underlying asthma or allergic rhinoconjunctivitis exhibited unusual reactions, such as urticaria and/or angioedema induced by multiple chemical groups of NSAIDs, blended mixed reactions, and isolated periorbital angioedema in response to multiple chemical groups of NSAIDs. Conclusions: While the EAACI/ENDA classification system stratifies NSAID-induced hypersensitivity reactions into five distinct endotypes or phenotypes, it may not fully capture the diversity of these reactions. Our findings suggest a need for further research to refine this classification system and better accommodate patients with atypical presentations.",

    "abstract": "Background: Food allergies are the most common cause of anaphylaxis in children, and their incidence is increasing globally. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors leading to food allergies in childhood. Methods: Children with food allergies and non-atopic healthy children were compared using a questionnaire that included prenatal, neonatal, and postnatal risk factors. Results: A total of 314 subjects, 155 patients and 159 healthy children for the control group, were enrolled in the study. The median age of patients with a food allergy at diagnosis was 6 months (1–156 months), and 71 patients (45.8%) were males. The median age of the control group was 12 months (1–61 months), and 67.0% were males. Older maternal age (P = 0.023), birth by caesarean section (P = 0.001), birth in the summer or autumn (P = 0.011), crowded housing (P = 0.001), damp houses (P = 0.001), being fed with breast milk and complementary food (P = 0.001), use of synthetic bedding (P = 0.024), and being the oldest child in the family (P = 0.001) were the considered risk factors for an immunoglobulin-E (IgE)-mediated food allergy. A low frequency of yoghurt consumption by mother (P = 0.001) and use of wool bedding (P = 0.018) were identified as risk factors for non-IgE-mediated food allergies. Low socioeconomic status (P = 0.001) played a protective role against both IgE- and non-IgE-mediated food allergies whereas breastfeeding played a protective role against IgE-mediated food allergies (P = 0.030). Conclusion: The most important aspect of this study was that it separately identified pre-natal, neonatal, and postnatal risk factors for IgE- and non-IgE-mediated food allergies.",

However, the risk of AR in IBD patients is unknown. Objective: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, patients with IBD are examined for their risk of AR. Methods: Several databases are accessible in both Chinese and English, including PubMed, BioRXiv, WanFang, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Web of Science, METSTR, and MedRxiv. Findings presented at allergy, rhinology, thoracic, and gastrointestinal conferences were analyzed. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, two evaluators independently retrieved data, read the literature, and evaluated bias risk. The data analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.4. Case-control and cohort studies were eligible study designs for this research. Results: There were 10 case-control studies and 1 cohort study included in the meta-analysis. The experimental group consisted of 65,687 IBD patients, of whom 5838 had AR. A total of 345,176 participants without IBD were included in the control group, of whom 24,625 developed AR. The outcomes demonstrated that IBD patients had a higher risk of developing AR (odds ratio [OR] = 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.12, 1.95], Z = 2.78, P = 0.005) than those without IBD. Conclusion: The risk of AR is higher in IBD patients. Further investigation is required to determine the mechanism behind the association between AR and IBD.",

Severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA), a subtype of asthma, can be refractory to standard therapy. Biologics such as benralizumab target interleukin-5 and have demonstrated effectiveness in managing SEA. There exists no real-world evidence on the effectiveness of benralizumab in Mexico. Therefore, this study presents data on the role of benralizumab in managing SEA in Mexican patients.The effectiveness of benralizumab on the quality of life (QoL), asthma control, lung function, symptoms of asthma, and benralizumab's safety profile were assessed.The study sample comprised 10 patients with SEA treated with a subcutaneous (SC) administration of benralizumab 30 mg once in 4 weeks for the first three doses followed by a dose every 8 weeks for 2 years. Laboratory tests, resting spirometry, and skin prick tests were conducted. Levels of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) were evaluated, when possible, with the intent to phenotype asthma, as T2 high or non-T2, before starting benralizumab therapy. The Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), and Asthma Control Test (ACT) were administered to evaluate the effectiveness of benralizumab on asthma control and QoL.All patients showed significant symptom control, QoL, and lung function over 2 years. Mild adverse effects, such as headache and arthralgia, were observed.Benralizumab appears to be a promising agent in controlling SEA. This study has focused on measuring tangible outcomes, such as a reduction in symptoms, a reduction in exacerbation, and an improvement in QoL. Thus, benralizumab may constitute an important addition to the arsenal of medications against SEA.",

    "abstract": "Background: Around 10% of people report a drug allergy and avoid some medications because of fear of allergic reactions. However, only after a proper diagnostic workup can some of these reactions be confirmed as allergic or nonallergic hypersensitivities. Beta-lactams (BLs) are the most common medication suspected of being involved in drug hypersensivity reactions (DHRs) in children. Recently, direct oral provocation tests (DPT) with BLs gained popularity within pediatric populations as a tool for delabeling children with suspected BL allergies. This study aimed to evaluate the safety of direct provocation tests in infants with mild cutaneous non-immediate reactions to BLs. Methods: The authors retrospectively analyzed the data of 151 infants between 2015 and 2022, referred for evaluating a suspected allergy to BLs that occurred before age 24 months. Results: The mean age of the children, including 55% male kids, at the suspected reaction was 15.9 months and the mean age at the time of the DPT was 39.6 months. In most cases, antibiotics were prescribed to treat common upper respiratory infections, such as acute otitis (54.3%) and acute tonsillitis (27.2%). Amoxicillin was considered the culprit drug in 62.9% of the cases, and the combination of amoxicillin–clavulanic acid in the case of 33.8% of children. The most frequent associated cutaneous clinical manifestations were maculopapular exanthema in 74.8% and delayed urticaria/angioedema in 25.2%. Of the 151 infants evaluated, parents of 149 infants agreed for a direct DPT, and only three had a positive test (2%). Symptoms resulting from the DPT were mild and easily treatable. Conclusions: A direct DPT without prior tests is a safe and effective procedure to delabel BL allergy, even in infants. The authors wish to emphasize the importance of properly validating BL allergy suspicions by promoting appropriate diagnostic procedures in infants as, in most cases, DHRs can be excluded and there is no need for further therapeutic restrictions.",

    "abstract": "Introduction and objectives: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is thought to be an auto-immune disease in a subpopulation of patients. Protein tyrosine phosphatase-22 (PTPN22) polymorphisms are considered to be one of the strongest contributing factors to autoimmune diseases. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential association of several PTPN22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with CSU in an Iranian population.Material and methods: A total of 93 CSU patients and 100 healthy individuals were included in this study. Five SNPs within the PTPN22 gene were analyzed using TaqMan genotyping assays. The frequency of alleles, genotypes, and haplotypes of PTPN22 SNPs (rs12760457, rs2476601, rs1310182, rs1217414, and rs33996649) was investigated.Results: A significantly higher prevalence of the rs1310182 T allele was observed among patients compared with controls [OR = 1.75 (95% CI: 1.17–2.63); P = 0.007]. In addition, the rs1310182 CC genotype and TT genotype were 0.47 and 2.06 times more common in patients, respectively (P = 0.03). Moreover, haplotype analysis demonstrated that CGCGC, CGTGC, and TGCGC (P &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with CSU. No significant differences were observed between the patients and controls in the other analyzed PTPN22 SNPs.Conclusions: Polymorphisms of the PTPN22 gene are associated with an increased susceptibility to CSU in the studied Iranian population.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between the mother’s use of over-the-counter (OTC) medications during pregnancy and asthma in Lebanese children. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on Lebanese students in both public and private schools, between January and September 2017, involving 1000 children aged between 4 and 17 years. Results: The intake of any medication as an independent variable throughout pregnancy reveals that being in a public school compared to a private one (Beta = 0.344) and breastfeed-ing (Beta = 0.51) were highly associated with lower odds of asthma, while having a positive family of allergic rhinitis (Beta = 2.129) and the intake of any medication during pregnancy (Beta = 7.052) were highly associated with higher odds of asthma.A second logistic regression, taking as the dependent variable asthmatic versus healthy children and taking each OTC drug as an independent variable, showed that taking paracetamol once per week during pregnancy (Beta = 4.66) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) once per month (Beta = 3.498) compared to no intake were significantly correlated with higher probability of asthma.Conclusion: Our findings showed that the intake of paracetamol, vitamin C, and PPIs during pregnancy is strongly correlated with asthma in the offspring. Since these factors are avoid-able, it is necessary to raise awareness among healthcare professionals to reduce the prevalence of asthma in children.",

We have assessed safety and effectiveness of subcutaneous AIT with a microcrystalline tyrosine (MCT)- associated mite allergoid, Acarovac Plus®, in children and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (AR), with and without asthma, in the real-world setting. This was a retrospective, multicenter study including children and adolescents aged 5 years to 17 years with AR, with andwithout asthma, and sensitized to mites, receiving AIT with Acarovac Plus® during ≥6 months. Primary and secondary objectives were safety and effectiveness, respectively. Effectiveness variables were assessed during 12 months before and after AIT and included unscheduled visits to the healthcare center and emergency room admissions, rhinitis and asthma symptoms according to ARIA and GEMA classifications, respectively, medication use, and patients’ and physicians’ disease perception graded on a visual analog scale (VAS). All 79 patients included had a mean (SD) age of 12.7 (3.3) years. Two patients experienced systemic adverse reactions (none severe). Unscheduled visits to the healthcare center and emergency room admissions decreased (mean (SD) 3.02 [2.48] and 0.63 [1.35] vs. 1.08 [1.38] and 0.09 [0.38], before and after treatment, p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). After AIT, rhinitis and asthma classification changed (p &lt; 0.0001 for all classifications), showing improvements in symptoms and a significant decrease in rhinitis and use of medication for asthma and VAS scores grading patients’ and physicians’ disease perception (p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, these results show that AIT with an MCT-associated mite allergoid appears safe and effective in children and adolescents with AR treated in the real-world setting.",

Increased pediatricians' awareness to recognize signs and symptoms of these diseases in affected children is of paramount importance.

    "abstract": "Food allergy is rising rapidly among children, and allergy to nuts is one of the most prevalent allergies among them. The category “nuts and seeds” include several plant foods from different botanical families, very different from each other. It is not uncommon to detect co-sensitization to different nuts. However, true co-allergy is less frequent. Up to 80% of patients with positive skin prick tests or specific IgE without true history of reaction who avoid certain nuts, might tolerate them in an Oral Food Challenge (OFC). Although molecular diagnostic techniques help to improve nut allergy diagnosis, OFC still remains the gold standard. For this reason, after reviewing the current bibliography and the recommendations of different allergy societies on standardization of open OFC, the Food Allergy Committee of the Spanish Society of Pediatric Allergy, Asthma and Clinical Immunology (SEICAP) food allergy working group proposed a unified protocol to undertake these OFC, which include preliminary recommendations, unification of total dose, number of doses and interval between doses. Additionally, this group offers an interactive table to facilitate calculation of doses specific to each nut under study.",

The involvement of the respiratory tract is one of the most common presentations in IEIs.Overall, 117 patients with diagnosed IEIs were followed-up within 8 years at the National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (NRITLD). Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected in a questionnaire. Pulmonary function test (PFT), chest X-ray (CXR), and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans were obtained where applicable.Our study population consisted of 48 (41%) patients with predominantly antibody deficiencies (PADs), 39 (32%) patients with congenital defects of phagocytes, 14 (11.9%) patients with combined immunodeficiency (CID), and 16 (14%) patients with Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD). . Recurrent pneumonia was the most common manifestation, while productive cough appeared to be the most common symptom in almost all diseases. PFT showed an obstructive pattern in patients with PAD, a restrictive pattern in patients with CID, and a mixed pattern in patients with CGD. HRCT findings were consistent with bronchiectasis in most PAD patients, whereas consolidation and mediastinal lesions were more common in the other groups.Pulmonary manifestations vary among different groups of IEIs. The screening for lung complications should be performed regularly to reveal respiratory pathologies in early stages and follow-up on already existing abnormalities.",

Our aim was to validate a Spanish translation of the Food Allergy Independent Measure (FAIM) and the EuroPrevall Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire—Child Form (FAQLQ-CF) for children aged 8–12 years.Methods: Sixty children with a diagnosis of IgE-mediated allergy to food completed the questionnaires. The internal consistency was evaluated with Cronbach’s alpha. The correlation of FAQLQ-CF with FAIM was assessed to test construct validity. We compared both values with the diagnosis of anaphylaxis to evaluate discriminant validity.Results: Cronbach’s alpha was in the range of 0.654–0.863 for the four domains of FAQLQ-CF and 0.779 for FAIM. There were no criteria to remove questions from the questionnaires. Significant correlations could be found between FAQLQ-CF and the number of offending foods and the impact on social life (all r &gt; 0.33, P &lt; 0.01), and between FAIM and anaphylaxis.Conclusions: The Spanish translation of FAQLQ-CF showed acceptable internal consistency, good construct validity, and capacity to discriminate patients depending on the number of foods to avoid and the impact on social life. FAIM showed good discriminant capacity for anaphylaxis.",

MCHA administration significantly improved airway and lung inflammation, demonstrated by decreased total and inflammatory cells in BAL, lower levels of IL-5 and IL-13 in lung homogenate, and fewer inflammatory cells in lung tissue. Additionally, MCHA significantly diminished goblet cells in lung tissue.Administration of a hydroethanolic extract of M. charantia leaves was effective in treating OVA-induced asthma in an animal model.",

Participants were monitored for 4 weeks after each immunization for adverse reactions and completed questionnaires regarding local and systemic reactions at 7 and 28 days after each vaccination. For those who had received the COVID-19 vaccine prior to enrollment, adverse event data were obtained retrospectively. Results: Local and systemic adverse events occurred at similar rates in the WDEIA group and the control group. In both groups, injection-site pain and fatigue were the most common local and systemic reactions, respectively. Compared with healthy controls, more allergic events were reported in the WDEIA group (after dose 1, 0.5% vs. 4.2%, p=0.019; after dose 2, 0% vs. 1.4%, p=0.089). Allergic reactions mainly manifested as rash, urticaria, and edema, which were mild and controllable. No serious allergic events were reported. Conclusions: The adverse event profile of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine did not differ between WDEIA patients and healthy controls. The risk of allergic reactions in patients with WDEIA seems higher, but no anaphylaxis was reported, and the allergic reactions were controllable. Inactivated COVID-19 vaccines appear to be well-tolerated in WDEIA patients, but patients with potential allergy risks should be cautious.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, there has been a growing increase in the diagnosis of patients with inborn errors of the immune system, formerly known as primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs). Timely diagnosis remains a challenge due to low clinical suspicion and poor education on the subject. It is estimated that between 70% and 90% of these pathologies remain underdiagnosed in our environment.The objective of this study is to characterize the demographic and clinical presentation of pediatric group patients with inborn errors of the immune system in a Colombian tertiary hospital.Retrospective descriptive study of 306 patients with a diagnosis of innate errors of the immune system who consulted the PID clinic between 2011 and 2018 in a high-complexity institution in Cali, Colombia.Three-hundred and six patients were included. The median age was 4 years (IQR 2.3-7.7 years), and 59.5% of the patients were male. According to the International Union of Immunological Societies Expert Committee for Primary Immunodeficiency classification for inborn errors of the immune system, the most common group was antibody deficiency in 74.8% (n˂229), especially in the age group between 1 and 5 years. The least frequent in our population was complement deficiency. Of the warning signs stipulated for these pathologies, the most frequent were the (1) need for intravenous antibiotics (32%), (2) difficulty growing (15.7%), (3) four or more episodes of ear infection (10.8%), and (4) abscesses in organs or cutaneous abscesses (12.7%). No patient reported two or more episodes of pneumonia or sinusitis, and only 5.8% of the patients received a bone marrow transplant.Innate errors of the immune system require an early diagnosis with follow-up from an early age to ensure adequate management and follow-up in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. It is imperative to sensitize the medical population about the existence of these pathologies so that early intervention can be carried out, which improves the quality of life of patients and their families.",

The purpose of this study is to examine decisions made by mothers of infants having cow milk protein allergy, and physicians concerning the palatability of unflavored extensively hydrolyzed formulas and amino acid-based formulas. We conducted a multi-center, randomized, single-blinded, observational taste study involving 149 pediatricians from gastroenterology and allergy subspecialties at 14 tertiary healthcare units from different regions of Turkey and involving 94 mothers of infants with cow milk protein allergy. Blinding was performed for seven formulas available in the market, which were the most commonly prescribed for feeding: four AAFs (Neocate-Numil®, Aptamil Pregomin AS-Numil®, Alfamino-Nestle®, Comidagen-Mamma®), one AAF specifically designed to address the growing nutritional and lifestyle needs of children >1 year (Neocate Junior-Numil®), 2 eHFs (Bebelac Pepti Junior-Numil®, Similac Alimentum-Abott®). Considering all three formula characteristics, Neocate junior-Numil® ranked as the number 1 product among seven products by mothers (63.8%) and physicians (69.8%). The ratings of mothers were significantly higher than the physicians (8.1 points and 6.1 points, respectively; p < 0.001). No difference was found in terms of taste, smell, and appearance for Neocate junior-Numil® between the mothers' and physicians' ratings. Since caregivers have responsibility for careful selection of replacement products for infants with cow milk protein allergy, it is noteworthy that increased awareness and confidence in the palatability characteristics of these products should motivate mothers and physicians to comply with replacement treatment in the long term.",

Cinnamtannin D1 (CTD1), extracted from Cinnamomum tamala, has been found to exert good immunosuppressive activity. However, the role of CTD1 in IBD is unclear.The colitis mice model was established by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) treatment. Protein levels (p-STAT3/STAT3, ROR-γt, p-STAT5/STAT5, FOXP3, p-AMPK/AMPK, and p-mTOR/mTOR) were examined using Western blotting analysis. Changes in histopathology were detected through hematoxylin and eosin staining. The proportion of T helper 17 (Th17) cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells was measured by flow cytometry analysis.CTD1 improved body weight and colon length, and alleviated inflammation and histological damage in DSS-induced colitis mice model. DSS treatment also demonstrated a negative effect on Th17-Treg cells balance whereas CTD1 restored the balance of Th17- Treg cells in DSS-induced colitis mice model. Regulatory factors (such as STAT3, ROR-γt, STAT5, and FOXP3) that closely related to the balance of Th17-Treg cells were regulated by CTD1. In addition, AMPK phosphorylation was increased and mTOR phosphorylation was inhibited by CTD1 in DSS-induced colitis mice model.These findings established that CTD1 improved DSS-induced colitis by suppressing Th17-Treg cells balance by activating the AMPK/mTOR pathway. This study provided a new strategy for developing novel treatments for patients with IBD.",

    "abstract": "Sepsis induces multiple organ dysfunction syndromes, such as acute kidney, liver, or lung injury. Septic lung injury is associated with excessive apoptosis and inflammatory responses in hepatocytes. Deoxyelephantopin is a sesquiterpene lactone found in Elephantopus scaber L, and has immunomodulatory, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antifungal properties. The role of deoxyelephantopin in sepsis-associated lung injury was investigated. First, human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) and human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC) were treated with lipopolysaccharide to induce cytotoxicity. Treatment with lipopolysaccharide reduced cell viability of BEAS-2B and HPAEC, and promoted cell apoptosis through down-regulation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and up-regulation of cleaved PARP and B-cell lymphoma-associated X protein (Bax). Second, lipopolysaccharide-treated BEAS-2B and HPAEC were incubated with increasing concentrations of deoxyelephantopin, that is, 1, 5, or 10 μM. Deoxyelephantopin enhanced cell viability and reduced cell apoptosis of lipopolysaccharide-treated BEAS-2B and HPAEC. Third, deoxyelephantopin attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced decrease of superoxide dismutase and glutathione, and increase of malondialdehyde and myeloperoxidase in BEAS-2B and HPAEC. Moreover, deoxyelephantopin also weakened lipopolysaccharide-induced increase of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6. Finally, deoxyelephantopin decreased protein expression of p-p65 and p-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in lipopolysaccharide-treated BEAS-2B and HPAEC. In conclusion, deoxyelephantopin exhibited anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects against lipopolysaccharide-treated BEAS-2B and HPAEC through inactivation of nuclear factor kappa B/STAT3 signaling.",

    "abstract": "Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have traditionally been approached as separate entities that must be researched and treated separately. There is growing recognition, however, that a substantial proportion of patients with obstructive lung disease have characteristics of both asthma and COPD (termed the asthma–COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS)). Lung disease experts have difficulty defining ACOS, and many still resist accepting the possibility that asthma and COPD may be linked. It is likely that practicing clinicians may be equally confused about how to identify and treat ACOS. This narrative review aims to clarify concepts of ACOS definition, argues that the best way to understand ACOS is to view the chronic lung disease process longitudinally rather than cross-sectionally, and presents evidence that ACOS can be the end result of the natural history of severe asthma. The review also points out the serious gaps in knowledge regarding therapy for ACOS and presents emerging data supporting the intracellular respiratory pathogen Chlamydia pneumoniae as a possible common etiologic agent in severe asthma and ACOS.",

C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein-6 (CTRP6) is a paralog of adiponectin and exerts anti- inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The role of CTRP6 in sepsis-associated inflammatory lung injury was investigated in this study.Mice were injected with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) intraperitoneally to establish the mouse sepsis model. They were first tail-vein injected with adenovirus-mediated overexpression CTRP6 (Ad-CTRP6) and then subjected to the LPS injection. Pathological changes in lungs were detected by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Inflammation cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were assessed by qRT-PCR and ELISA. Flow cytometry was used to detect the number of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and immunofluorescence was performed to assess neutrophil extracellular traps.Lipopolysaccharides induced pulmonary congestion, interstitial edema, and alveolar wall thickening in the lungs, as well as upregulated lung histology score and wet/dry weight ratio. CTRP6 was reduced in lung tissues of septic mice. Injection with Ad-CTRP6 ameliorated extensive histopathological changes in LPS-induced mice and decreased lung histology score and wet/dry weight ratio. Overexpression of CTRP6 reduced the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β in septic mice. Injection with Ad-CTRP6 also decreased the number of neutrophils and downregulated Cit-H3 and myeloperoxidase polymers in septic mice. Protein expression of p-ERK in septic mice was reduced by overexpression of CTRP6.CTRP6 attenuated septic lung injury, exerted anti-inflammatory effect, and suppressed neutrophil extracellular traps formation against sepsis through inactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling.",

This study aims to examine egg allergy in pediatric patients and analyze the value of serum-specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) levels as predictive biomarkers for oral food challenge (OFC) outcomes. Methods: Retrospective study, involving pediatric patients with suspected IgE-mediated egg allergy, conducted at a tertiary hospital. Results: Data from 176 pediatric patients were analyzed, revealing a higher male prevalence (59.1%). Most cases (40.3%) presented symptoms in the first year of life, predominantly mucocutaneous symptoms (46%). OFC results varied across various forms of egg presentation, with cooked egg being the most frequently tested food. Positive OFCs were observed in 14.6% (n = 36) of cases. The study identified specific egg protein biomarkers for positive OFC, with ovalbumin for raw egg (sIgE &gt; 1.28 KUA/L; area under the curve [AUC] = 0.917; sensitivity [S] 100%; and specificity [Sp] 92%), ovomucoid for cooked egg (sIgE &gt; 0.99 KUA/L; AUC = 0.788, 95%; S: 79%; and Sp: 74%), and ovomucoid for baked egg (sIgE&gt; 4.63 KUA/L; AUC = 0.870; S: 80%; and Sp: 85%) showing predictive capacities. Conclusions: The findings underscore the importance of considering various forms of egg presentation in the diagnosis and management of egg allergy. The findings highlight the valuable discriminatory capacity and provided reliable biomarkers, such as ovalbumin for raw egg and ovomucoid for cooked and baked egg in risk assessment, aiding in predicting OFC outcomes and helping clinicians to make informed decisions in diagnosing and managing egg allergies, thus improving patient care and quality of life.",

Ultra-rush immunotherapy (URIT) rapidly desensitizes patients to aeroallergens. Objective: We aimed to develop a modified URIT protocol in 3 days to achieve the target dose while observing whether it could improve this situation and decrease the time to achieve the maintenance dose. Methods: The URIT was exercised in 21 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis. Premeditations were given to the patients 3 days prior to the immunotherapy and during the 3 days injections immunotherapy: pred nisolone, ranitidine, and Airokast/montelukast. Finally, the T cell population frequencies of patients prior to and after immunotherapy, including T helper 1, T helper 2, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and regulatory T cells, were studied using flow cytometry. During the URIT protocol, 21 patients received 291 injections. Result: Six patients (28.6%) showed systemic reactions in our study. All systemic reactions occurred on the third day by the 1:1 dilution of the maintenance dose. These systemic reactions occurred in three patients after 13 injections, and the three remaining patients showed systemic reactions following the last injection. No systemic reaction was observed on the first and second day of the therapy, and the risk of systemic reaction with every injection was about 2%. Among the T cell populations, CD3+ and CD8+ cells decreased significantly. Conclusion: The findings emphasized that URIT, alongside premedication with a high dose of antihistamine, helped to achieve the maintenance dose and control clinical manifestations.",

Jolkinolide B (JB) is one diterpenoid component separated from the dried roots of Euphorbia fischeriana Steud (Euphorbiaceae), and has anti--inflammatory, antioxidative, and antitumor properties. However, the detailed regulatory role and associated regulatory mechanism in the progression of asthma remain elusive. In this work, it was demonstrated that the extensive infiltration of bronchial inflammatory cells and the thickening of airway wall were observed in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced mice, but these impacts were reversed by JB (10 mg/kg) treatment, indicating that JB relieved the provocative symptoms in OVA-induced asthma mice. In addition, JB can control OVA-triggered lung function and pulmonary resistance. Moreover, JB attenuated OVA-evoked inflammation by lowering the levels of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Besides, the activated nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and transforming growth factor-beta-mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (TGFβ/smad3) pathways in OVA-induced mice are rescued by JB treatment. In conclusion, it was disclosed that JB reduced allergic airway inflammation and airway remodeling in asthmatic mice by modulating the NF-κB and TGFβ/smad3 pathways. This work could offer new opinions on JB for lessening progression of asthma.",

The most frequently implicated food was peach, producing symptoms in 70% of patients, followed by walnut in 55%, peanut in 45%, hazelnut in 44%, and apple in 38% patients. Regarding the food that provoked anaphylaxis, walnut was the most frequent instigator, along with peach, peanut, hazelnut, almond, sunflower seed, and apple. According to the severity of LPT reaction, we did not discover significant differences in gender, age, food group involved, and serologic parameters. We found differences in the presence of cofactors, with 48.84% of cofactors in patients with anaphylaxis, compared to 27.1% in patients without anaphylaxis and in family allergy background (P &lt; 0.0001). Conclusion: In our series of patients, 54% presented anaphylaxis, and the foods that most frequently produced symptoms were peaches, apples, and nuts. Cofactors and family allergy backgrounds were associated with the severity of LPT reaction.",

This study investigates the therapeutic effects of cimifugin on BV-2 cells under sepsis-induced stress conditions. Methods: We utilized a BV-2 microglial cell model treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic sepsis. Assessments included cellular vitality, inflammatory cytokine quantification (6 interleukin [6IL]-1β, interleukin 6 [IL-6], and tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α]) via enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay, and analysis of mRNA expression using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial function were also evaluated to understand the cellular effects of cimifugin. Results: Cimifugin significantly attenuated LPS-induced inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. It enhanced cell viability and modulated the secretion and gene expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. Notably, cimifugin activated the deacetylase sirtuin 1–nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 pathway, contributing to its protective effects against mitochondrial damage. Conclusion: Cimifugin demonstrates the potential of being an effective treatment for sepsis--induced neuroinflammation, warranting further investigation.",

Gypenosides (Gyp) exhibits anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects on different diseases. However, its functioning and mechanism of Gyp on psoriasis remains unknown. Objective: To explore the effect and mechanism of Gyp on psoriasis. Material and Methods: The impact and mechanism of Gyp on psoriasis in vitro and in vivo were probed through cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, hematoxylin and eosin staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent serologic assay, immunofluorescence, and Western Blotting assays. Results: Gyp inhibited cell proliferation and the release of inflammatory cytokinesin interleukin (IL-22)-induced spontaneously transformed human aneuploid immortal keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT). In addition, Gyp demonstrated enhancement in erythema and scaling as well as reductions in the thickness of epidermal layers, release of inflammatory factors, and Ki-67 (a nuclear protein) level in imiquimod (IMQ)-induced mice. Mechanistically, Gyp upregulated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) expression and diminished the level of p-p65/p65 and p-STAT3/STAT3 in skin tissues from IMQ-induced mice and IL-22-induced HaCaT cells, which were reversed with the application of ML385, an inhibitor of Nrf2. In addition, the administration of ML385 reversed decrease in cell viability and reduced the expressions of IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in IL-22-induced HaCaT cells caused by Gyp. Conclusion: In summary, Gyp reduced excessive cell growth and inflammation in psoriasis by suppressing nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) through activation of Nrf2.",

Objective: We aim to describe a case series of children with hypersensitivity to chlorhexidine and to compare the results of different diagnostic tests. Patients: Nine children with hypersensitivity to chlorhexidine were included. Only six of these children and their parents consented to a comprehensive allergy assessment, which included the prick test, intradermal test, patch test, and repeated open application test (ROAT). Results: Seven children (78%) presented symptoms of chlorhexidine hypersensitivity within the first 5 years of life; two of them before the age of 1 year. In four children, the dermatitis lesions were suggestive of wound superinfection. All six children who participated in the comprehensive diagnostic evaluation had negative results on the prick test. The immediate-reading intradermal test was positive in one case and uncertain in two cases. The patch test was positive in five cases, and the ROAT was positive in all six cases when using 2% chlorhexidine alcohol solution. Conclusion: ACD to chlorhexidine in children appears to be rare and can be difficult to detect. Clinicians should consider this diagnosis when wounds worsen with chlorhexidine. Although the patch test is the most standardized method for detecting ACD, the ROAT with 2% chlorhexidine alcohol solution was the most sensitive test in our patients.",

    "abstract": "Background: The epidemiology of atopic eczema in adolescents in Kosovo is virtually unknown, and the risk factors for the condition in very low-prevalence areas (as it was the case) are not well studied. The objective of the present study was to better know those factors and whether the presence of comorbid wheezing symptoms modifies the factors. Methods: The cross-sectional survey, Global Asthma Network-validated questionnaire, which includes questions on eczema symptoms and environmental factors (such as smoking, pet ownership, paracetamol usage, truck traffic, siblings, time spent using screens or watching television, and physical exercise), was administered to adolescents in the following main cities of Kosovo: Ferizaj, Gjakova, Gjilan, Peja, Prishtina, and Prizren. Additionally, height and weight were measured at school. Results: Prevalence of eczema symptoms ranged from 2.2% in Ferizaj to 5.5% in Gjakova. Severe symptoms were &lt;1% in all cities. Eczema ever ranged from 3.0% in Ferizaj to 6.4% in Prizren. Factors significantly associated with the prevalence of current eczema symptoms in the meta-analysis were males (pooled adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.50, 95% Confidence Interval [95% CI] 0.37–0.66); physical exercise (pooled aOR 2.79, 95% CI 1.89–4.10); and paracetamol intake (pooled 1.86, 95% CI 1.32–2.64). The corresponding figures for eczema ever were as follows: pooled aOR: 0.68, 95% CI 0.44–1.06; pooled aOR 2.07, 95% CI 1.48–2.90; and pooled aOR 1.19, 95% CI 0.88–1.60. The associations tended to be higher in the subpopulation with eczema and wheezing comorbidity. Conclusions: The prevalence of atopic eczema is very low in Kosovo and is associated with females, physical exercise, and paracetamol intake. These associations are higher when eczema and wheezing are comorbid conditions.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory infections in children, ranging from mild to severe, are a leading cause of school absences and medical visits, creating significant socio-economic burdens for families. Recent interest has focused on resveratrol, a natural polyphenol known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties. When combined with carboxymethyl-β-glucan (CM-glucan), a modified polysaccharide with immunostimulatory effects, this formulation has shown potential benefits in managing respiratory diseases. Our research examines five randomized clinical trials investigating the efficacy of resveratrol and CM-glucan nasal solutions in children. The trials included children with recurrent respiratory infections (RRIs) and allergic rhinitis. The results demonstrate significant reductions in key respiratory symptoms, including nasal congestion, sneezing, coughing, and fever. In addition to symptomatic relief, the treatment was associated with fewer medical visits, decreased medication use, and reduced school absences. Importantly, the combination also showed efficacy in decreasing wheezing episodes in non-atopic children with RRIs and improving symptoms of allergic rhinitis. While these findings are promising, the studies are limited by small sample sizes and short-term follow-up periods, raising questions about the long-term efficacy and safety of the treatment. Mild and transient nasal irritation was the only reported side effect. Based on these concepts, the combination of resveratrol and carboxymethyl-β-glucan could be considered a valuable add-on strategy, complementing standard pharmacological treatments for pediatric respiratory infections and allergic conditions.",

Accordingly, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and perceived satisfaction of a 3-year course of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) in a paediatric population with allergic rhinitis and/or asthma. Methods: A pilot, monocentre, retrospective cohort study was performed. One hundred fifty-three children who fulfilled the criteria for allergic rhinitis and asthma and were either mono- or poly-sensitized were enrolled. A standardized questionnaire assessing perceived efficacy, use of rescue medication, disease control, number of exacerbations, quality of life, and perceived satisfaction was administered to each patient. Results: Seventy patients (49 males, 21 females; mean age, 14.3±1.9 years) were included in the final analysis. All 70 patients received SLIT for up to 3 years, with 100% adherence to the treatment throughout the study. Significant improvements in symptoms and quality of life were reported (p&lt;0.01). There was also a significant decrease in disease severity, use of rescue medication, and sleep disturbances (p&lt;0.01). Additionally, a significant improvement in school performance was also recorded (p&lt;0.01). Of the enrolled patients, 60 out of 70 (85.7%) reported being very satisfied, 6 out of 70 (8.57%) were much satisfied, and 4 out of 60 (5.71%) were satisfied. Conclusions: We were the first to demonstrate the efficacy and perceived satisfaction of a 3-year SLIT in a paediatric population, with 100% treatment adherence throughout the study.",

Objective: The aim was to compare respiratory symptoms in nursing home residents and patients with uncontrolled asthma, who are considered vulnerable to COVID-19. Methods: We studied 134 nursing home residents and 139 patients with uncontrolled asthma, groups vulnerable to COVID-19. Demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations, outcomes, key laboratory results, and radiological images were collected from medical records. COVID-19 infection was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: Thirteen (9.3%) patients with uncontrolled asthma, all receiving inhaled corticosteroids were infected by COVID-19. Eighty (60%) nursing home residents were infected; only 28, all of whom had received inhaled corticosteroids, had a good prognosis. Conclusions: Early treatment with inhaled corticosteroids may be helpful in COVID-19 infection. Persons with an allergy might have some protective mechanisms against coronavirus.",

This study aims to investigate the changes caused by rocuronium in the lung and the effect of sugammadex on these changes with biochemical, light microscopic and immunohistochemical parameters on a rat model.For the study, 28-male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided, seven of each, into four groups. Group C (control) received only 0. 9 % NaCl without any drug. Group R received rocuronium alone 1mg/kg. Group S received sugammadex alone 96 mg/kg. Group RS received rocuronium 1mg/kg and sugammadex 96 mg/kg. After 24 h later, the animals were sacrificed and their tissues were removed. Biochemical (IgE/CRP), light microscopic and immunohistochemical findings were recorded.Immunoglobulin E and CRP levels, peribronchial, alveolar septal lymphocytic infiltration, thickening of the alveolar membranes and bleeding sites in Group R were significantly higher than all the other groups. In Group RS, while these parameters were significantly lower than that of Group R and Group S, it was significantly higher than that of Group C. Total mast cells and tryptase-positive mast cells counts were significantly higher in Group R than in all other groups. In Group RS, these parameters were statistically lower than that of Group R and Group S, but higher than that of Group C.This study shows that allergic inflammatory changes due to rocuronium in the lungs of rats are reduced with sugammadex. These results support cases of anaphylaxis due to rocuronium which improved with sugammadex.",

Mothers were given a questionnaire that had a series of questions to evaluate demographic information, maternal allergic status, and environmental exposures during pregnancy. Neonatal cord blood samples were taken at the same time for IgE assay.By univariate analysis, we found statistically significant correlations between CB-IgE levels and gender (P = 0.000) and delivery mode (P = 0.017). By multivariate analysis, gender was found to have a significant association with CB-IgE levels (P = 0.001). No significant difference was found between CB-IgE levels and antenatal complications, the season of birth, birth weight, gestational age, and household income (P > 0.050).In this study, newborn gender was found to be a strong predictor of elevated CB-IgE. The delivery mode was a probable predictor.",

It would be necessary to separate the admin-istration of drug from food intake.Since OIT is a new form of treatment, long-term adverse events arising from PPI treatment and other possible triggers are still uncertain. Consequently, monitoring of patient must be prolonged over time. Additional investigations on the influence of different drugs in OIT main-tenance phase are required.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis is the most common chronic osteoarthrosis disease. There are complex factors that lead to osteoarthritis. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the molecular mechanism of osteoarthritis, especially the mechanism of articular cartilage degeneration. In this study, the mechanism of FPR1 (formyl peptide receptor 1) in LPS (lipopolysaccharide) induced chondrogenic cell ATDC5 was investigated.We employed real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot assay to analyze the expression level of FPR1 in ATDC5 cell lines induced by LPS at 0, 2.5, 5, and 10 μg/mL concentrations. Then we constructed the FPR1 knockdown plasmid to transfect the LPS-ATDC5. MTT assay was used to test cell viability in control, LPS, LPS+shNC and LPS+shFPR1 groups. ELISA and RT-qPCR assay were employed to examine the TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α)ͿIL-6 and IL-1β expression level. Flow cytometry and western blot assay were employed to analyze the apoptosis of LPS-ATDC5. Finally, we utilized the western blot assay to text related protein expression level of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway.In this study, we found the expression level of FPR1 was increased in LPS-ATDC5, downregulation of FPR1 improves the survival rate and alleviates inflammatory response of LPS-ATDC5. Meanwhile, downregulation of FPR1 alleviates apoptosis of LPS-ATDC5. Finally, downregulation of FPR1 inhibits the MAPK signal pathway.Present study revealed that FPR1 was highly expressed in LPS-induced chondrocytes ATDC5, and the downregulation of FPR1 abated the inflammatory response and apoptosis of LPS-ATDC5 cells by regulating the MAPK signaling pathway.",

Clinical data of the infants were prospectively collected from the database of ambulatory medical records (ABUCASIS) of the Valencia health system.Smoking during pregnancy was recorded in 164 (25.3%) mothers. During the first year of life, asthma was diagnosed in 101 infants, with an incidence of 15.7%. The diagnoses of asthma (25.6% vs. 12.3%; P < 0.0001) and bronchiolitis (44.5% vs. 28.6%; P = 0.0002) during the first year of life were more common among infants in the smoking group. The probability of developing asthma during the first year of life was two-fold higher for the male gender and 2.5 times higher when mothers smoked while pregnant. Up to 52% of asthma cases could have been avoided in infants born to smoking mothers if they did not smoke during pregnancy. Infants in the smoking group showed a lower weight and length at birth than infants in the nonsmoking group differences almost disappeared at 6 months and 12 months.Asthma during the first year of life showed a clear relationship with maternal smoking in pregnancy. Pregnant women should be advised of the significant perinatal risk for respiratory diseases associated with tobacco use.",

However, the latest data on its prevalence in Spain are from Phase III of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC), 2004. The objective of our study was to assess the prevalence of asthma symptoms, severity and diagnosis in the paediatric population aged between 13 and 14 years in the province of Salamanca. Material and methods: Cross-sectional multicentre study carried out in 2017–2018 in 13- and 14-year-old school children in the province of Salamanca as a centre participating in of the Global Asthma Network(GAN) Phase I. The standardised validated written questionnaire and that directed by a video was administered; it was self-completed by the pupils. Results: A total of 3485 questionnaires were completed, and the pupils’ participation rate was 95.01%. Among the total, 25.7% indicated having had wheeze ever (20.7% in the video questionnaire); 14.7% indicated having had wheeze in the past 12 months (11.3% in the video questionnaire). The prevalence of current wheeze that limited speech was 3.9% (7.5% in the video questionnaire) and the current prevalence of severe wheeze was 6.5%. Regarding asthma diagnosis, 19.7% of the sample answered that they had had asthma ever, whilst 14.0% referred to having physician-diagnosed asthma. The agreement between the written questionnaire and that directed by video was acceptable for the questions of wheeze ever (Cohen Kappa index [k] = 0.53) and current wheeze (k = 0.42). Conclusions: The prevalence of current asthma (wheeze in the past 12 months) in the population aged 13 and 14 years in the province of Salamanca is higher compared with that presented in 2004 in Spain, but similar to that described at the world level (low-moderate level), according to the ISAAC Phase III studies.",

    "abstract": "Background: Aeropalynology is a branch of palynology that studies the content of atmospheric pollen grains and spores. The amount, concentration, and distribution of these aerospora are influenced by the seasonal flowering of parent plants and variations in climatic conditions as well as local and regional variabilities. Atmospheric pollen grains and spores are diverse and have been identified as major biological particles that trigger immune cells to release inflammatory chemical mediators, inducing respiratory-linked and allergic conditions, such as polli-nosis, among susceptible individuals. Objective: The burden of these allergic conditions on patients, families, healthcare systems, and governments has risen globally, thereby affecting developing countries, including Nigeria, wherein the financial and infrastructural institutions are not effective enough to mitigate these challenges. Avoidance of allergenic aerospora is an effective mode of addressing pollinosis with its associated conditions. However, there is a need to ascertain the atmospheric quantity, diversity, and pattern of occurrence of allergenic pollen/spores. Results: In this paper, we reviewed published articles on aeropalynology in Nigeria with atten-tion to the design and duration of the study and the used equipment. We further investigated whether identification and quantification of allergy-causing palynomorphs was part of published articles’ foci. Conclusion: The availability of such data/information is crucial for reducing epidemiological uncertainties, enhancing the diagnosis of allergic conditions, and securing a robust set of mitigation strategies and/or effective treatment of these conditions in Nigeria.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Asthma is a heterogeneous disease. Severity of asthma and sensitivity to medications vary across asthma subtypes. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G has a wide range of functions in normal and pathological physiology. Due to its powerful immune function, HLA-G participates in the pathogenesis of different asthma phenotypes by regulating the activity and function of various immune cells. The mechanism of HLA-G in asthma is not fully clear, and there is no consensus on its mechanism in asthma. Further studies are needed to explore the role of HLA-G in different phenotypes of human asthma. Methods: Observational study. Results: HLA-G is an important immunomodulatory factor in asthma. Studies have found different levels of HLA-G in patients with different asthma subtypes and healthy controls, but other studies have come to the opposite conclusion. Conclusion: We speculate that further study on the mechanism of HLA-G in asthma pheno-types may explain some of the contradictions in current studies. Findings should provide information regarding the potential of HLA-G as a novel target for asthma diagnosis and treatment.",

This study aimed to compare the accuracy of the Buddhasothorn Asthma Severity Score (BASS) with the Wood-Downes-Ferrés Scale (WDFS) to recognize the severity level of acute asthma.A cross-sectional study was conducted comprising Thai children aged 2-15 years with acute asthma. The BASS and WFDS were rated once in the emergency department. The degree of severity was determined by frequency and type of nebulized bronchodilator administrations at the time of initial treatment. The optimum cutoff points for the area under the curve (AUC) were established to predict severe asthma exacerbations.All 73 episodes of asthma exacerbations (EAEs) in 35 participants were analyzed. Fifty-nine (80.8%) EAEs were classified as severe. Both scales had good significance to recognize the selection of nebulized bronchodilator treatments by AUC of 0.815 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.680-0.950) in case of BASS, and AUC of 0.822 (95% CI: 0.70-0.944) in case of WDFS. Cutoff points of BASS ≥ 8 had sensitivity 72.9%, specificity 64.3%, positive predictive value (PPV) 89.6%, negative predictive value (NPV) 36.0% at an AUC of 0.718 (95% CI: 0.563-0.873) for severe exacerbations. These results were consistent for cutoff points of WDFS ≥ 5 with sensitivity 78.0%, specificity 50.0%, PPV 86.8%, NPV 35.0% at an AUC of 0.768 (95% CI: 0.650-0.886) for predicting severe exacerbations. There was no significant difference between the AUCs of both scales.Both the BASS and WDFS were good and accurate scales and effective screening tools for predicting severe asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients by optimal cutoff points.",

Previous reports on the loss of penicillin-specific IgE sensitisation were based on non-anaphylaxis cases and, although uncommon, persistent sensitisation may still be possible in the minority of cases.This case highlights that irrespective of the elapsed duration since the index reaction, it is important to remain vigilant when approaching patients with a history of severe reactions.We described a case of persistent IgE sensitisation almost two decades following ampicillin anaphylaxis.A 78-year-old male with a history of perioperative penicillin anaphylaxis in 2003 was referred for allergy workup in 2022 before his knee joint replacement surgery. The patient had strictly avoided all beta-lactams since the index reaction. However, his penicillin-specific sensitisation persisted, evidenced by positive skin tests (with generalised urticaria after intradermal testing) and basophil activation tests.To our knowledge, this was the first case of positive BAT tested around two decades following the index reaction. This case illustrates that a cautious approach may still be warranted in patients with a history of severe reaction to penicillin regardless of the duration since the reported index reaction.",

The two main viral agents causing bronchiolitis, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV), have distinct cytopathic, immune response, and clinical characteristics. Different approaches have been suggested for subtyping bronchiolitis based on viral etiology, atopic status, transcriptome profiles in blood, airway metabolome, lipidomic data, and airway microbiota. The highest risk of asthma at school age has been in a subgroup of bronchiolitis characterized by older age, high prevalence of RV infection, previous breathing problems, and/or eczema. Regarding solely viral etiology, RV-bronchiolitis in infancy has been linked to a nearly three times higher risk of developing asthma than RSV-bronchiolitis. Although treatment with betamimetics and systemic corticosteroids has been found ineffective in bronchiolitis overall, it can be beneficial for infants with severe RV bronchiolitis. Thus, there is a need to develop a more individualized therapeutic approach for bronchiolitis and follow-up strategies for infants at higher risk of asthma in the future perspective.",

Since 2013, a specific treatment, called sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), with peach extract (SLIT-peach®) has been used, but with no long-term effectiveness studies. The main objective of the present study was to assess the long-term effectiveness of SLIT-peach® and to relate the clinical evolution of patients. This was an ambispective study conducted for 3 years. A total of 25 patients with LTP syndrome were selected and treated with SLIT-peach®. They underwent a provocation test in the first year with reintroduced foods that had produced symptoms in the past. Analytical determination of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) to peach (Pru p 3) was performed at the beginning of treatment, at the first year of initiation, and at the end of treatment. These data were compared with the control group comprising 14 patients with LTP syndrome without treatment. A statistically significant decrease in specific IgE to Pru p 3 at the end of the treatment and an increase in specific IgG4 to Pru p 3 1 year after treatment initiation were observed in the active group in relation to tolerance to foods with LTPs. These results indicate that food tolerance begins after the first year and is maintained after the end of 3 years of treatment. In conclusion, treatment with SLIT-peach® for 3 years is effective for patients with LTP syndrome, preventing the evolution of the disease, allowing patients to restart a diet with plant foods, and improving their quality of life.",

Material and Methods: Observational, cross-sectional study conducted between January 2018 and January 2019. ISAAC-III and sociodemographic questionnaires were applied to determine the factors associated with AR and CARAS in adults treated with immunotherapy who attended the allergy consult at the Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá and Unimeq-Orl. Results: Among 416 adults aged 18–68 years, 71.4% (n = 297) were women. Regarding the sensitization results obtained by skin prick test, the most frequent allergens were house dust mites (64.18%): 49.03% were positive for both Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farinae, while 28.61% were positive for Blomia tropicalis. Excluding house dust mites, the most frequent allergens were dog hair (31.01%), cat hair (15.1%), grasses (15.9%), and food (15.9%). The main factor associated with exclusive AR was regular acetaminophen use more than four times a year: Prevalence ratio (PR) = 1.77 (95% CI: 1.12–2.25). The main factor associated with CARAS was cesarean delivery PR: 1.44 (95% CI: 1.09–1.78). Conclusion: The main factor associated with AR was regular acetaminophen use, while that associated with CARAS was cesarean delivery.

YFV is seldom administered to egg-allergic patients (EAP) since it is cultivated in embryonated chicken eggs and may contain residual egg proteins, being a problem for egg-allergic residents and travelers of endemic countries. Objective: Describe the frequency of allergic reactions after YFV administration in confirmed EAP from an allergy outpatient center in Bogotá, Colombia. Methods: An observational, retrospective, cross-sectional, and descriptive study was conducted from January 2017 to December 2019. EAP whose allergy was confirmed with a positive Skin Prick Test (SPT) and/or egg protein–specific IgE levels who hadn’t received the YFV were included. Every patient had an SPT, severe EAP, and an additional Intradermal Test (IDT) done with the vaccine. If the vaccine SPT and IDT were negative, the YFV was administered as a single dose; if either were positive, the YFV was administered in graded doses. Statistical analysis was done in Stata16MP. Results: Seventy one patients were included, 24 (33.8%) of those had a history of egg anaphylaxis. All patients had negative YFV SPTs, and two of the five YVF IDTs were positive. Two patients, with previous egg-anaphylaxis, presented allergic reactions to the vaccine. Conclusions: YFV did not trigger allergic reactions in EAP without history of egg-anaphylaxis. With further research, safe single-dose vaccination to this population could be considered; however, patients with previous egg-anaphylaxis should be evaluated by an allergist before vaccination.",

    "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes is one of the chronic autoimmune diseases. Its features include the immune-triggered pancreatic beta-cells destruction. Ubiquitin ligases RNF20 and RNF40 have been discovered to participate into beta cells gene expression, insulin secretion, and expression of vitamin D receptors (VDRs). However, no reports about the role of RNF20/RNF40 in type 1 diabetes are known till now. The aim of this study was to clarify the role of RNF20/RNF40 in type 1 diabetes and explore the mechanism.In this study, streptozotocin (STZ)-induced mice type 1 diabetes model was used. The protein expressions of genes were examined through Western blot analysis. Fasting blood glucose was detected through glucose meter. The plasma insulin was tested through the commercial kit. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was utilized to observe pathological changes of pancreatic tissues. Immunofluorescence assay was performed to evaluate the level of insulin. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum were assessed by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay. The cell apoptosis was measured through terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling assay.STZ was used to stimulate mice model for type 1 diabetes. At first, both RNF20 and RNF40 expressions were down-regulated in STZ-mediated type 1 diabetes. Additionally, RNF20/RNF40 improved hyperglycemia in STZ-stimulated mice. Moreover, RNF20/RNF40 relieved pancreatic tissue injury in STZ-induced mice. Further experiments found that RNF20/RNF40 rescued the strengthened inflammation mediated by STZ treatment. The cell apoptosis was enhanced in the pancreatic tissues of STZ-triggered mice, but this effect was weakened by overexpression of RNF20/RNF40. Besides, the VDR expression was positively regulated by RNF20/RNF40. Finally, VDR knockdown reversed improved hyperglycemia, inflammation, and cell apoptosis stimulated by overexpression of RNF20/RNF40.Our findings proved that RNF20/RNF40 activated VDR to relieve type 1 diabetes. This work might highlight the functioning of RNF20/RNF40 in the treatment of type 1 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Background: Studies on the prevalence of atopic dermatitis (AD) for the adolescent cohort in general-based large populations are scarce worldwide. We performed a retrospective population--based observational cohort study of 76,665 adolescent patients diagnosed with AD in Catalonia (Spain). We studied the prevalence of AD by age, gender, disease severity, comorbidities, serum total immunoglobulin E (tIgE) and appropriate medical treatment (AMT) for the Catalan population. Methods: Adolescent individuals (12–17 years) diagnosed with AD by medical records at different health care levels (primary, hospital, emergency) from the Catalan Health System (CHS) were included. Statistical analyses evaluated sociodemographic characteristics, prevalence, comorbidities, serum tIgE and AMT. Results: The overall diagnosed AD prevalence in the adolescent Catalan population (76,665) was 16.9%, being higher for the non-severe (16.7%) than for the severe (0.2%) populations. Topical corticosteroids were the most prescribed drug (49.5%), and the use of all prescribed treatments was higher in severe AD patients, especially systemic corticosteroids (49.7%) and immunosuppressants (45.4%). AD patients had, on average, a serum tIgE of 163.6 KU/L, which was higher for severe than non-severe disease (155.5 KU/L vs 101.9 KU/L, respectively). Allergic rhinitis (15.0%) and asthma (13.5%) were among the most frequent comorbid respiratory and allergy diseases. Conclusions: This is the first Spanish study reporting the overall diagnosed prevalence for a large-scale adolescent cohort (12–17 years old) from Catalonia. It provides new and robust evidence of AD’s prevalence and related characteristics in this region.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a common illness with chronic airway inflammation. C1q/tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related protein 3 (CTRP3) plays a vital role ininflammatory response, but its effect on asthma is imprecise. Herein, we analyzed the functions of CTRP3 in asthma.The BALB/c mice were randomized into four groups: control, ovalbumin (OVA), OVA+vector, and OVA+CTRP3. The asthmatic mice model was established by OVA stimulation. Overexpression of CTRP3 was implemented by the transfection of corresponding adeno-associated virus 6 (AAV6). The contents of CTRP3, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, smooth muscle alpha-actin (α-SMA), phosphorylated (p)-p65/p65, transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGFβ1), and p-Smad3/Smad3 were determined by Western blot analysis. The quantity of total cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was assessed by using a hemocytometer. The contents of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β in BALF were examined by enzyme-linked immunesorbent serologic assay. The lung function indicators and airway resistance (AWR) were measured. The bronchial and alveolar structures were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining and sirius red staining.The CTRP3 was downregulated in mice of OVA groups; however, AAV6-CTRP3 treatment markedly upregulated the expression of CTRP3. Upregulation of CTRP3 diminished asthmatic airway inflammation by decreasing the number of inflammatory cells and the contents of proinflammatory factors. CTRP3 markedly lessened AWR and improved lung function in OVA-stimulated mice. Histological analysis found that CTRP3 alleviated OVA-induced airway remodeling in mice. Moreover, CTRP3 modulated NF-κB and TGFβ1/Smad3 pathways in OVA-stimulated mice.CTRP3 alleviated airway inflammation and remodeling in OVA-induced asthmatic mice via regulating NF-κB and TGFβ1/Smad3 pathways.",

This study aimed to determine the plasma levels of plasma PTX-3 as an inflammation marker in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and whether the PTX3 levels correlate with disease activity and other clinical parameters, including acute phase reactants and biomarkers.The study included 70 CSU patients and 30 healthy controls. Plasma PTX3 levels were measured by ELISA. CSU disease activity was evaluated with the urticaria activity score summed over 7 days. Complete blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), transaminases, total IgE, antinuclear antibody, anti-thyroid peroxidase, anti-thyroglobulin, and D-dimer levels were recorded.Of the 70 patients, 52 (74.3%) were female, with a mean age of 37.51 ± 11.80 years. Disease activity was severe in 43, moderate in 15, and mild in 12 patients. Mean PTX3 levels were elevated in CSU patients compared to healthy controls (0.81 vs. 0.55 ng/mL, p = 0.031). The mean CRP levels were higher in patients than in the controls (4.26 vs. 1.57 mg/L, p = 0.023). Patients also had higher D-dimer levels than the controls (5.96 vs. 0.59 mg/L, p < 0.001). A significant positive correlation was found between PTX3 and CRP levels (r = 0.508, p < 0.001) and between D-dimer levels and UAS7 (r = 0.338, p = 0.004) and CRP (r = 0.213, p = 0.034) levels. A multivariable stepwise regression analysis showed that the one-unit increase in the CRP level increased to 38.19 units in the PTX3 level (95% confidence interval [17.40-58.98], p < 0.001).Circulating levels of CRP and PTX3, two members of the pentraxin family, are significantly correlated and elevated in CSU patients with increasing disease activity, indicating their utility as inflammatory markers in CSU.",

Of these, 23 (12.5%) had a history of contact urticaria to cow's milk and underwent a total of 30 OFC. Baked cow's milk OFC were excluded, and 21 children were included in the study. All data from clinical history and allergy tests (serum-specific IgE dosages and skin prick test [SPT] with reconstituted cow's milk formula) were recorded on standardized forms. The challenge was conducted with reconstituted cow's milk formula in increasing volumes every 15-20 min.24 OFC were performed; 13/24 (54.2%) for diagnostic purpose and 11/24 (45.8%) to evaluate cow's milk tolerance. Allergy tests were positive in 14 patients (87.5%). Positive oral challenge outcomes were identified in 7/24. One patient had a late flare of atopic dermatitis and five children presented with immediate urticaria (two generalized urticaria and three perioral urticaria). The median papule diameter was 6.5 mm in patients with a positive OFC and 3.75 mm in the negative group (P = 0.02).The occurrence of contact urticaria might be the only manifestation among infants sensitized to cow's milk with tolerance to oral ingestion. Reactions due to oral challenge were related to a larger wheal diameter on the SPT.",

    "abstract": "One of the common adverse reactions in patients with pressure ulcers (PU) is sepsis, which is mainly related to microbial infections caused by pathogenic organisms. The activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) frequently occurs in conjunction with pathogenic microbial infections. Proline-serine-threonine-phosphatase-interacting protein 2 (PSTPIP2) is closely related to inflammatory disorders. The role and mechanism of PSTPIP2 in sepsis because of pressure ulcers is unclear. In this study, we discovered that PSTPIP2 was lowly expressed in peripheral blood of patients with sepsis induced by pressure ulcers.Peripheral blood was collected from 20 patients with sepsis due to pressure ulcers and 10 healthy controls, and the expression of PSTPIP2 in peripheral blood was discovered by polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Information on the clinical characteristics of patients was summarized, and the expression data of PSTPIP2 were correlated with the patients' acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) scores by Spearman's correlation analysis. One of the main mediators of Gram-negative sepsis is lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In order to establish an in vitro sepsis model, THP-1 cells were treated with LPS, and the cells were transfected with PSTPIP2. Contents of interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in each group of cells were detected by enzyme-linked--immunosorbent serologic assay, and NF-κB-related proteins were detected by Western blot analysis.When compared to healthy controls, the peripheral blood of patients with pressure sepsis had lower PSTPIP2 expression, which had a negative correlation with the APACHE II, SOFA, CRP, and PCT scores. LPS-induced THP-1 cells expressed less PSTPIP2 than the untreated control cells, and PSTPIP2 transfection decreased IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α levels and inhibited the activation of NF-κB pathway.PSTPIP2 is associated with disease severity in patients with pressure ulcer sepsis and has anti-inflammatory effects.",

Methods: The study included 174 individuals living in rural areas and in a small town. Standardized questions from the International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood and The European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) questionnaires were used to define asthma. Atopic status was verified by skin prick tests. Rural exposure including contact with livestock was verified by adequate questionnaire. Total serum IgE, IL-13, and IL-33 levels were assessed by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) tests. Results: Participants with atopy and bronchial asthma were characterized by high level of immunoglobulin E. Tendency to lower serum IgE level was observed among people reporting present contact with farm animals. Also, among those having contact with livestock in their first year of life, the analogous tendency was noticed. No difference in serum IL-13 levels in participants with asthma and atopy, and controls was observed, and there was no effect of exposure on farm animals on the concentration of IL-13. The highest IL-33 level was found in the atopic group, and the lowest in the control group. Participants currently exposed to farm animals were predisposed to have lower IL-33 serum level. Conclusion: Exposure of farm animals currently and in first year of life may result in a lower level of total IgE. Correlation between IL-13 and IL-33 serum levels and contact with livestock was not confirmed.",

Inflammation implicates a cascade of bothersome symptoms, including fever, pain (headache, myalgia, and arthralgia), malaise, and respiratory complaints. As a result, anti-inflammatory medications could be beneficial as they act on different pathogenetic pathways. The ketoprofen lysine salt (KLS) has a potent anti-inflammatory activity associated with effective analgesic and antipyretic effects and has a valuable safety profile. However, adolescents present peculiar psychological characteristics that determine their difficulty to be managed. In this regard, an adolescent with a respiratory infection requires a prompt and adequate cure. KLS, thanks to its pharmacologic profile, could be favorably used in this regard. A recent primary-care experience outlined its effectiveness in this issue.",

    "abstract": "Background: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by acute organ dysfunction, which frequently leads to acute lung injury (ALI) in approximately 40% of cases. Isoegomaketone (IK) is a constituent of essential oil found in P. frutescens, known for its diverse biological properties, including anti-inflammatory and antitumor effects. However, the regulatory impact of IK on ALI in the context of sepsis remains poorly understood. Methods: Pathological alterations in lung tissues were assessed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Enumeration of total leukocytes and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was performed using a hematocytometer, while the levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-17 in BALF were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent serological assay. In addition, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione (GSH) in lung tissues were assessed using respective commercial kits; cell apoptosis was evaluated using the terminal deoxynucleotide transferase--mediated dUTP nick end-labeling assay, and protein expressions were determined through Western blot analysis. Results: Our findings revealed that cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) treatment in mice induced severe lung injury, characterized by increased lung injury scores, significant bleeding, neutrophil infiltration, and alveolar edema. However, treatment with IK at a dose of 10 mg/kg ameliorated CLP-induced lung injury, while IK dose of 5 mg/kg showed no significant effect. Additionally, IK treatment at 10 mg/kg reduced CLP-induced inflammation by decreasing levels of IL-6, IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-17. Furthermore, IK at 10 mg/kg attenuated CLP-induced oxidative stress by modulating levels of MDA, MPO, SOD, and GSH. Moreover, IK treatment with a dose of 10 mg/kg activated the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2–heme oxygenase-1 (Nrf2–HO-1) pathway by enhancing the protein expressions of Nrf2 and HO-1. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that IK could mitigate the inflammatory response and oxidative stress associated with sepsis-induced ALI, supporting IK as a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of sepsis-associated ALI.",

    "abstract": "Background: The relationship between behavioral problems and asthma is bidirectional; while the presence of a chronic disease such as asthma might predispose the person to stress, anxiety, and other behavioral issues, behavioral problems might in turn cause uncontrolled asthma through nonadherence to asthma management strategies. In Lebanon, behavioral problems and uncontrolled asthma could be of significant concern for adolescents. Consequently, we found it necessary to evaluate association between behavioral problems and uncontrolled asthma in a sample of Lebanese adolescents. Methods: Data for this cross-sectional study were collected using the snowball sampling technique in July 2023. The questionnaire was developed with Google Forms and distributed to participants via social media platforms and messaging applications. The Asthma Control Test (ACT) was used to check for uncontrolled asthma, and the Youth Self-Report (YSR) scale was used to assess behavioral problems. It yields nine subscales (anxious–depressed, withdrawn–depressed, somatic complaints, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, rule-breaking behavior, aggressive behavior, and other problems) and a total score. Results: When taking each behavior score as an independent variable, older age was associated with lower ACT scores (more controlled asthma); F(15, 186) = 3.66, P = 0.014, and 95% Confidence Interval (CI) [-0.85, -0.10]. Living in a rural area, compared to urban was associated with higher ACT scores, P = 0.018, and 95% Confidence Interval (CI) [0.28, 2.94]. The intake of the COVID-19 vaccine, P = 0.003 and 95% CI [0.73, 3.55]; waterpipe smoking, P = 0.017 and 95% CI [0.38, 3.85]; and having more somatic complaints, P = 0.005 and 95% CI [0.04, 0.25], also were significantly associated with higher ACT scores (more uncontrolled asthma). When taking the total behavior score as an independent variable, higher YSR scores were associated with higher ACT scores (more uncontrolled asthma), F(10, 191) = 4.30, P = 0.038, and 95% CI [0.003, 0.10]. Conclusion: Our findings support the inclusion of mental health treatments for better asthma control and point to a link between behavioral issues and uncontrolled asthma. In a developing nation without a clear established strategy for asthma prevention, the findings of this study could help develop potentially beneficial public health treatments.",

    "abstract": "Background: Propionate inborn errors of metabolism (PIEM), including propionic (PA) and methylmalonic (MMA) acidemias, are inherited metabolic diseases characterized by toxic accumulation of propionic, 3-hydroxypropionic, methylcitric, and methylmalonic organic acids in biological fluids, causing recurrent acute metabolic acidosis events and encephalopathy, which can lead to fatal outcomes if managed inadequately. PIEM patients can develop hematological abnormalities and immunodeficiency, either as part of the initial clinical presentation or as chronic complications. The origin and characteristics of these abnormalities have been studied poorly. Thus, the aim of the present work was to evaluate and describe lymphoid, myeloid, and erythroid cell population profiles in a group of clinically stable PIEM patients. Methods: This was a retrospective study of 11 nonrelated Mexican PIEM patients. Clinical, biochemical, nutritional, hematological, and lymphocyte subsets were analyzed. Results: Despite being considered clinically stable, 91% of patients had hematological or immunological abnormalities. The absolute lymphocyte subset counts were low in all patients but one, with CD4+ T-cell lymphopenia, being the most common one. Furthermore, of the 11 studied subjects, nine presented with a low CD4/CD8 ratio. Among the observed hematological alterations, bicytopenia was the most common (82%) one, followed by anemia (27%). Conclusion: Our results contribute to the landscape of immunological abnormalities observed previously in PIEM patients; these abnormalities can become a life-threatening chronic com-plications because of the increased risk of opportunistic diseases. These findings allow us to propose the inclusion of monitoring immune biomarkers, such as subsets of lymphocytes in the follow up of PIEM patients.",

Just before their launch, physicians' knowledge was explored relating to key issues of the guidelines.The aim of this study was to investigate the opinion of medical specialists concerning urticaria management.A SurveyMonkey® survey was sent out to board-certified physicians of three medical specialties treating urticaria. Replies were analyzed per specialty against the evidence-based recommendations.Sixty-five allergists (ALLERG), 24 dermatologists (DERM), and 120 pediatricians (PED) sent their replies. As for diagnosis: ALERG 42% and PED 76% believe cutaneous mastocytosis, urticarial vasculitis, and hereditary angioedema are forms of urticaria, versus DERM 29% (P < 0.005). Most of the specialties find that the clinical history and physical examination are enough to diagnose acute urticaria, except DERM 45% (P < 0.01). DERM 45% believe laboratory-tests are necessary, as opposed to <15% ALLERG-PED (P < 0.005). However, PED 69% did not know that the most frequent cause of acute urticaria in children is infections, versus ALLERG-DERM 30% (P < 0.005). Many erroneously do laboratory testing in physical urticaria and ALLERG 51%, DERM 59%, and PED 37% do extensive laboratory testing in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU); many more PED 59% take Immunoglobulin G (IgG) against foods (P < 0.005). More than half of non-allergists do not know about autologous serum testing nor autoimmunity (P < 0.05). As for treatment, there were a few major gaps: when CSU was controlled, >75% prescribed antihistamines pro re nata, and >85% gave first-generation antiH1 for insomnia. Finally, >40% of DERM did not know that cyclosporine A, omalizumab, or other immunosuppressants could be used in recalcitrant cases.Specialty-specific continuous medical education might enhance urticaria management.",

Materials and methods: In this cross-sectional study, 83 children aged 2–7 with AD and their families were enrolled as the study group, and 83 age-matched healthy children were included as controls. All patients in the AD and control groups were sorted into two age-based groups: (1) 2–4 and (2) 5–7 years of age. The parents of all children completed the Turkish version of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL).The Family Impact Scale for Dermatological Diseases (FIS-DD) was administered to the study group. Disease severity was evaluated with the Patient-Oriented Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (PO-SCORAD) scale. Results: In both age groups, a negative correlation between the PedsQL and the FIS-DD scores (p &lt; 0.001) was found. A positive correlation was found between the PO-SCORAD and FIS- DD scores among the second age group (p = 0.011). In the first age group, AD patients with comorbid allergic diseases had higher FIS-DD scores than those without any other allergic problems (p = 0.007). Conclusions: We suggest that considering family QoL may positively contribute to the treatment of pre-school age AD children.",

Parameters of bronchiolitis severity were compared between rapid (change in weight z-score from birth >0.67, n = 65) and normal weight gain groups (n = 125). We assessed for correlations between bronchiolitis severity and weight gain. Linear regression was performed to predict for bronchiolitis severity based on weight gain, controlling for covariates. SPSS was used for statistical analyses.The rapid weight gain group had longer mean durations of tachypnea (2.3±2.0 vs. 1.7±1.8 days, P = 0.027), wheezing (3.2±2.5 vs. 1.6±1.8 days, P < 0.001), and chest retractions (1.5±2.2 vs. 0.6±1.3 days, P = 0.007). Correlations of weight gain with tachypnea (r = 0.146), wheezing (r = 0.279), and chest retractions (r = 0.179) were statistically significant. Weight gain predicted for tachypnea (B = 0.485, P = 0.013) and wheezing (B = 0.846, P = 0.001) durations after adjusting for covariates of severity (age, sex, current weight, RSV type, coinfection, recurrent bronchiolitis, hospital stay, fever, oxygen supplementation, maximal respiratory and heart rates, and laboratory indices).Our findings suggest an association between weight gain and severity of RSV bronchiolitis in young children. Weight gain was significantly associated with the durations of tachypnea and wheezing. The trajectory of weight gain in early life may play a significant role in the clinical course of RSV bronchiolitis.",

The purpose of this study is to compare physical fitness and anaerobic capacity in asthmatic children (AC) and non-asthmatic children (NC).A total of 47 children participated in the study; 25 individuals with mild to moderate asthma and 22 healthy children were assessed. The assessed variables consist pulmonary function and peripheral muscle strength (PMS). Additionally, physical fitness was evaluated by using fitnessgram test battery, which includes body composition, modified shuttle walk test (MSWT), curl-up test, push-up test, and sit and reach test variables. Anaerobic capacity was measured with wingate anaerobic capacity test (WAnT) and counter-movement jump (CMJ) using a tri-axial accelerometer.FEV1/FVC ratio (p = 0.01), MSWT (p = 0.001), push-up test (p = 0.01), and WAnT peak power (p = 0.05) were measured significantly to be found reduced in AC compared with that of NC. Between the two groups, PMS, curl-up test, sit and reach test, and CMJ were not significantly different (p = 0.05). High to moderate positive correlation was found among WAnT, CMJ parameters and FEV1, fat-free body mass (FFM), dominant handgrip, and quadriceps strengths (p = 0.05).Physical fitness level and anaerobic capacity were lower in AC compared with that of NC. Physical fitness parameters and anaerobic exercise capacity should be evaluated on the physiotherapy and rehabilitation program in AC.",

Descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression were employed for analysis.The prevalence of admission for wheezing was 29.7% (95% CI 27.7-31.6) and was significantly associated to severe wheezing episodes (OR: 3.89; 95% CI: 2.93-5.18, p < 0.001), physician-diagnosed asthma (OR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.33-2.41, p < 0.0001), use of inhaled corticosteroids (OR: 1.78; 95%CI: 1.38-2.29, p < 0.0001), maternal tobacco smoking during pregnancy (OR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.19-2.39, p = 0.003) and onset of wheezing in the first trimester of life (OR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.02-1.66, p = 0.038).

We investigated the clinical, immunological, and environmental characteristics of pediatric patients sensitized to a dog to evaluate the cross-antigenicity of canine lipocalin Can f 1 with feline lipocalin Fel d 1 and Syrian hamsterextract.Materials and methods: The protein fractions of the processed and commercial Syrian hamster extracts were compared using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) inhibition test was performed on Can f 1, Fel d 1, and processed Syrian hamster extract, and the antigen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE)-binding capacity for each antigen was analyzed using serum samples from patients.Results: Twelve of 19 patients with a median age of 40.5 months were symptomatic when exposed to dogs. Eleven (91.7%) patients showed a positive IgE response to Can f 1. Two patients were positive for Fel d 1-specific IgE antibody, and one was positive for hamster-specific IgE antibody. SDS-PAGE confirmed the presence of different patterns of protein bandsbetween the commercial and processed hamster extracts. There was no cross-antigenicity among Can f 1, Fel d 1, and processed Syrian hamster extract.Conclusions: Since the standard commercial hamster extract did not contain Syrian hamster antigens that were diverse enough, caution should be taken when using it. In children allergic to cats and dogs, sensitization to isolated Can f 1 or Fel d 1 is unlikely to cause cross-reactivity to Syrian hamster hair and epithelium.",

This zoonotic-enveloped virus is primarily transmitted through inhalation. Infected people are commonly asymptomatic or manifest mild symptoms, including fever, cough, diarrhea, and fatigue. However, it may lead to severe patterns associated with multiple organ failure in individuals with an impaired immune system. Objective: Here we report a 7-year-old girl with hyper-immunoglobulin M (IgM) (HIgM) phenotype, admitted to the hospital emergency department with fever, cough, and pneumonia symptoms because of the COVID-19 infection. Coronavirus infection was confirmed by a positive real-time polymerase chain reaction test. Surprisingly, serum levels of both IgG and IgA of the patient were transiently normalized during the COVID-19 infection when tested prior to the monthly injection of intravenous immunoglobulin. After she recovered from the COVID infection, her immunoglobulin levels returned to the primary stage and she demonstrated HIgM phenotype. Conclusion: Since this transient increase in the levels of immunoglobulins was solely observed during the COVID-19 infection, and no other infectious episodes were diagnosed in the patient, clarifying the exact cause would help to understand in a better manner the implications and specification of humoral immunity in patients with primary antibody deficiencies.",

    "abstract": "In pediatric patients, severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) frequently occur in the course of acute illnesses, mostly infections, which are usually treated with antibiotics or analgesics. The drug provocation test (DPT) is contraindicated in such situations, due to the risk of triggering a new severe reaction. As a consequence, lifelong avoidance is recommended. However, causation is uncertain in most cases. The dilemma arises when avoiding the drug is not harmless for the patient. We have attended three patients who were referred to our pediatric allergy unit with a history of SCAR related in time to simultaneous use of paracetamol and ibuprofen. Medical records and images of the patients were reviewed with the assistance of a dermatologist, and alternative diagnoses were considered in both cases. The ALDEN score for implicated drugs was calculated. After considering a high probability of ibuprofen tolerance and obtaining informed consent from the patients, we performed a sequential allergy workup including in vitro tests, skin tests, and finally DPT in two of the patients, confirming ibuprofen tolerance. In conclusion, although generally contraindicated, DPT may be considered for some useful drugs after careful evaluation of the risk-benefit balance, preceded by a sequential study including in vitro and skin tests.",

There is evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic could have altered the administration of AIT in patients in some countries, as the pandemic caused major limitations to healthcare access and delivery. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the disruption imposed by the pandemic on the perceptions and administration of AIT therapies in Italy. An online survey was carried out among Italian allergists between 22 February 2021 and 12 April 2021. The results show that Italian physicians (N=66) did not consider that the COVID-19 pandemic presented an added risk to patients with allergic asthma or rhinitis receiving AIT. Although most treatments continued, there were reduced rates of AIT therapy initiations and sublingual AIT was favored over subcutaneous AIT.",

    "abstract": "Psoriasis is considered as an inflammatory skin disease accompanied by dyslipidemia comorbidity. B-cell leukemia-3 (Bcl-3) belongs to IκB (inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B [NF-κB]) family, and regulates inflammatory response through associating with NF-κB. The role of Bcl-3 in psoriasis was investigated in this study.Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-deficient mice were treated with imiquimod to induce psoriasis and dyslipidemia. Mice were injected intradermally in the back with lentiviral particles encoding Bcl-3 small hairpin RNA (shRNA). Hematoxylin and eosin were used to detect pathological characteristics. The blood lipid levels were determined by automatic biochemical analyzer, and inflammation was assessed by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.Bcl-3 was elevated in imiquimod-induced ApoE-deficient mice. Injection with lentiviral particles encoding Bcl-3 shRNA reduced Psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score in ApoE-deficient psoriatic mice. Knockdown of Bcl-3 also ameliorated imiquimod-induced psoriasiform skin lesions in ApoE-deficient mice. Moreover, loss of Bcl-3 enhanced expression of loricrin, an epidermal barrier protein, reduced expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and lectin-like oxidized LDL (oxLDL) receptor-1 (LOX-1) in imiquimod-induced ApoE-deficient mice. The enhanced levels of blood lipid in ApoE-deficient mice were attenuated by silencing of Bcl-3 with increase of high-density lipoprotein, and reduction of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Knockdown of Bcl-3 attenuated imiquimod-induced decrease of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and increase of Interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-23, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in ApoE-deficient mice. Protein expression of phospho-Akt (p-Akt) and p-GSK3β in ApoE-deficient psoriatic mice was decreased by silencing of Bcl-3.Loss of Bcl-3 exerted anti-inflammatory effect on psoriasis and dyslipidemia comorbidity through inactivation of Akt/GSK3β pathway.",

    "abstract": "Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury is a general critical complication having high relevance to kidney inflammation. In spite of advances in clinical and critical care, the specific and effective therapies for acute kidney injury are still insufficient. The present study aimed to investigate the protective effect of Iroquois homeobox genes (IRX) on sepsis-induced kidney dysfunction in mice.In order to gain insight into sepsis-related actions in acute kidney injury, the cecal puncture-induced kidney injury animal model was established. The hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to measure the pathology of kidney tissues. The kidney function-related biomarkers, including neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, creatinine, kidney injury molecule-1, blood urea nitrogen, and inflammatory cytokines, which included tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1, were detected by automated biochemical analyzer or their corresponding test kits. The protein expression was measured using Western blot analysis, and the apoptotic rate of kidney tissue was measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay.The present study revealed the protective ability of IRX1 in sepsis-induced acute kidney injury. This study also determined the potential mechanism of IRX1 on sepsis-induced inflammatory response and cell apoptosis. Finally, it highlighted that IRX1 exerted a protective influence on CLP-induced acute kidney injury by suppressing the activation of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 14 (CXCL14).To conclude, the results suggest that overexpression of IRX1 could promote survival rate and suppress the CLP-induced apoptosis, inflammatory response, and kidney dysfunction through the activation of CXCL14. IRX1 and CXCL14 are essential to elucidate the mechanism of acute kidney injury. These findings may help to identify the promising targets for clinical sepsis therapy.",

    "abstract": "Introduction and objectives: Suspected hypersensitivity reactions (HRs) associated with vaccines are frequently reported, but confirmed cases of vaccine-triggered HRs are rare. Suspected HRs should be distinguished from actual HRs. The aims of this study are to identify the rate of actual vaccine-triggered hypersensitivity in patients who were referred to the paediatric allergy clinic due to a suspected HR and to explore the rate of revaccination in a real clinical setting. Materials and methods: A retrospective study was performed with a group of preschool children who were evaluated by skin and/or provocation tests (PTs) for the suspected HRs following vaccination. Results: A total of 26 paediatric patients (61.5% male; median age 9 months) with a previous history of suspected vaccine-triggered HR were included. In this group, 69.2% and 38.5% of the patients had a pre-existing atopic disease and an immediate reaction (emerging &lt;1 hour after vaccine administration), respectively. Skin rash was the most frequent clinical presentation (96.1%). Vaccine-triggered anaphylaxis was reported in six patients (23.1%). Measles-mumps-rubella was the most frequently suspected vaccine causing HRs. The skin test positivity with the suspected vaccine was 4%, whereas PTs revealed no reaction after reimmunisation in 76.9% (20/26) of the study participants tested. Conclusions: Most incidents of skin rashes after immunisation are not suggestive of actual HRs. The results in the current study showed that the majority of the patients presenting with suspected HRs tolerated revaccination, including those with a previous history of suspected anaphylaxis. Revaccination of these patients is safe with adequate precautions. It is absolutely essential to be equipped for the management of anaphylaxis.",

Methods: This cross-sectional study, conducted between November 2018 and March 2019, enrolled 515 preschool children. Asthma and potential risk factors, including hygiene, were assessed using a standardized questionnaire. A specific hygiene hypothesis scale has been gen-erated and validated for this purpose. Results: The hygiene hypothesis scale items converged over a solution of nine factors that had an Eigenvalue over 1, explaining a total of 65.86% of the variance. An acceptable Cronbach’s alpha value was recorded for the hygiene hypothesis scale (0.696). Variables correlated with higher odds of asthma were male gender (ORa = 0.41 for females), living near a prairie sprayed with pesticides (ORa = 3.09), having a heating system in the bedroom compared to the sitting room (ORa = 9.97), attending kindergarten (ORa = 2.80), having a mother who smokes water-pipe compared to not smoking (ORa = 3.34), having a mother with a history of asthma (ORa = 5.50), and having respiratory infections (ORa = 14.72). However, the hygiene hypothesis score was not associated with higher odds of asthma (p = 0.881). Conclusions: The current results suggested that neither home cleaning nor personal cleanliness was correlated with asthma in preschool children. Larger prospective studies that measure the intensity and duration of exposure to each toxicant are suggested to better assess the hygiene hypothesis items and their association with asthma.",

    "abstract": "Introduction and objectives: X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), the first known primary immunodeficiency, is caused by rare mutations in Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) gene. Mutations in the BTK gene lead to a failure in the development and maturation of B-cell linage. A decreased number of B-cells results in agammaglobulinemia and increased susceptibility to a variety of infections. Therefore, patients with XLA usually manifest with repetitive bacterial infections, such as upper respiratory tract infections, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and urinary tract infections, since their infancy. Patients: We report a 17-year-old Iranian boy with XLA, referred to us with a history of severe and recurrent episodes of bacterial infections for a period of six years. Results: Genetic analysis using the whole Exome sequencing revealed a hemizygous missense mutation in the BTK gene (c.428 A &gt; T, p.His143Leu). Conclusion: To our knowledge, c.428 A &gt; T has not been reported in the BTK gene.",

Infections of lung, skin, lymph nodes, and liver are the hallmark of CGD and frequently the initial manifestation of the disease. The aim of the present paper is to describe the sites of infections and their causative agents in 38 pediatric patients with CGD.This retrospective, single-center cohort study included CGD patients followed at the allergy and immunology unit of a tertiary hospital in São Paulo, Brazil over the last 40 years. Sites of infections and their causative agents were described.Thirty-eight patients were included (36 males). The median age of onset of symptoms was 45 days (ranging from 7 days-7 years), and the median age at diagnosis was 23 months (ranging from 1 month-12 years). In all, 31.6% of the patients reported a family history of child deaths and 21% (eight cases) had another male family member with CGD. The most common infections were pneumonia (81.6%), skin infections (50.0%), adenitis (42.1%), and liver abscess (23.7%); 188 cultures were positive (85.6% bacteria; 14.4% fungi). The most prevalent bacterial agents were Staphylococcus sp. (12.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.2%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.3%). Aspergillus sp. and Candida sp. were 56% and 22.2% of the isolated fungi, respectively. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated in 5.6% and Mycobacterium bovis in one patient (0.9%).Staphylococcus sp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Aspergillus sp. were the most frequent agents found in this cohort. M. tuberculosis should be considered in endemic area. Detection of infectious agents drives to the adequate treatment and benefits the evolution of patients with CGD.",

A study was conducted regarding parent satisfaction following educational sessions in an Atopy School organized by a multidisciplinary team.E-mail surveys with variables scored by means of a Likert scale were administered among the parents participating in the workshops organized by the Atopy School. The educational program comprised four sessions with a duration of 4 hours.Ninety-five percent of the parents were satisfied after participating in the workshops, and were of the opinion that the therapeutic education received was useful for improving control of the illness of their children. Likewise, 85% were satisfied or very satisfied with the help received in the sessions for control of the disease during flare-ups, and 90% considered the data and advice received in the sessions to be of use in improving quality of life of both the children and the family as a whole.The Atopy School afforded caregiver empowerment, and the parents were satisfied and felt more secure in dealing with the disease of their children-thereby improving the prognosis and quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Background: Measles vaccinations have been suggested to provide immune protection and decreased measles incidence. However, there was a limited study evaluating how the measles vaccine elicits specific immune responses.Objective: This study aimed to evaluate both humoral and cellular immunity to first-dose measles vaccine Edmonston-Zagreb (EZ) in 9-month-old Indonesian infants.Methods: A cohort study was conducted on 9-month-old infants who got the first-dose of measles vaccine EZ. Measles-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody serum levels were measured using plaque-reduction microneutralization assay. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with a measles-specific peptide to identify a cellular immune response. Quantification of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells producing interferon-gamma (IFN-ɣ) and interleu-kin 17-A (IL-17A) were conducted by flow cytometry. Humoral and cellular immune response parameters were analyzed over time.Results: The prevalence of seropositivity rates was 85.8% at 1-month after vaccination and 16.67% at 6-months postvaccination. Measles-specific IgG antibodies increased significantly at 1-month after measles vaccination. However, they decreased significantly 6-months after vaccination. IFN-ɣ and IL-17A secreting T-cells increased significantly at 1-month after measles vaccination. Interestingly, a significant decrease of IFN-ɣ and IL-17A secreting CD4+ T cells was noticed 6-months postvaccination compared to IFN-ɣ and IL-17A secreting CD8+ T cells. Conclusion: Our study suggests that the first-dose measles vaccine on 9-months-old infants seems to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses that decline 6-months after vaccination.",

Consequently, the serum concentrations of adipokines such as retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) increase. No gold standard molecule for the prediction of non-allergic asthma among obese patients has been identified.To evaluate RBP4 and PAI-1 as prognostic biomarkers of non-allergic asthma caused by obesity.A cross-sectional study between four groups of adolescents: (1) healthy (n = 35), (2) allergic asthma without obesity (n = 28), (3) obesity without asthma (n = 33), and (4) non-allergic asthma with obesity (n = 18).RBP4 was higher in the non-allergic asthma with obesity group than in the obesity without asthma group (39.2 ng/mL [95% confidence interval (CI): 23.8-76.0] vs. 23.5 ng/mL [95% CI: 3.2-33.5], p < 0.01), and PAI-1 was higher in the non-allergic asthma with obesity group than in the obesity without asthma group (21.9 ng/mL [95% CI: 15.7-26.5] vs. 15.9 ng/mL [95% CI: 9.4-18.2], p < 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that the serum RBP4 cut-off value was >42.78 ng/mL, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.741 (95% CI: 0.599-0.853, p = 0.001), considered acceptable. The PAI-1 cut-off value was >12.0 ng/mL, with an AUC of 0.699 (95% CI: 0.554-0.819, p = 0.008), considered fair.RBP4 may be useful to predict non-allergic asthma among obese adolescents in clinical practice.",

We investigated the prognosis of asthma in former residents of temporary housing after allergen avoidance.Asthma was diagnosed in adults ≥ 15 years from 2014 to 2019 who had lived in temporary housing in Ishinomaki City for at least 1 year. The disease prognosis after the intervention of allergen avoidance in cases that were followed for more than 3 years during the 6-year study period was analyzed. We measured the Dermatophagoides farinae -specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in serum, and the amount of Dermatophagoides group 1 (Der 1) antigen on their futons or mattresses. We instructed residents in an allergen avoidance strategy that included 32 tasks, including using microfiber bedding covers.Of the 202 examinees who were followed for at least 3 years during the 6-year study period, 72(35.6%) were asthmatic during at least one examination. Of these 72 asthmatics, 55(76.4%) developed the disease after the earthquake, and more than half of the cases that we diagnosed at the examination were mild intermittent asthma. After the allergen-avoidance intervention, both the Der 1 level on the futons or mattresses of residents who were diagnosed with asthma but who were nonasthmatic at the final screening and their serum Der f-specific IgE levels significantly decreased (P < 0.01) at the final examination.Antigen avoidance ameliorated mild asthma that was prevalent among residents of temporary housing after the earthquake.",

Autoinflammation in all patients with inflammation was confirmed by genetic analysis after excluding infectious etiology.Clinical features of 433 PID patients were evaluated retrospectively with long-term follow-up. Autoimmune disorders were identified in 69 (15.9%) patients with PID; 31 (45%) patients had a history of autoimmune disease before diagnosis of PID. The frequency of autoimmunity in immune dysregulation subgroup (76.6%) was higher than other forms of PID.

Materials and methods: A prospective study of a cohort of babies recruited after their birth during July 2015–June 2017. Mothers were contacted using the WhatsApp messaging system for digital follow-up on their baby’s condition at 3-monthly intervals until they were 18 months old. Information on wheezing and its correlates were collected by digital follow-up and corroborated at an in-person interview and examination of their baby at 18 months of age. Recurrent wheezing was defined as more than three episodes of wheezing or its correlates during the follow-up period. Results: There were 338 males (41.5%) and 476 (58.5%) females. Overall, 31.1% (95% CI = 27.9%, 34.4%) had RW by 18 months and the same number had RW during their first year of life. Of the infants with RW, 121 (47.8%; 95% CI = 41.6, 54.2) had at least one or both of the major criteria and/or at least two minor criteria of the stringent Asthma Predictive Index (API). Of those with RW, 32.0% received antihistamine and 20% had received antibiotics on their last visit to a physician for wheezing or symptoms of cough, cold, and/or breathing difficulty. Conclusions: Nearly a third of infants and toddlers had RW and nearly half of the infants with RW had risk factors fulfilling the criteria of the stringent API.",

We collected responses from 464 children, and in 2016, measured the level of Dermatophagoides group 1 (Der 1) in the bedding of 202 of these children. The intervention group of children attended at least one allergen avoidance seminar. The levels of Der 1 in their bedding were measured, along with changes in allergic symptoms, in 17 children in 2017 and 14 children in 2018. The nonintervention group comprised children who did not attend an allergen avoidance seminar at any time.Of the 464 children who participated in the ISAAC, 50 (10.8%) reported having asthma, 179 (38.8%) allergic rhinitis, and 126 (27.3%) atopic dermatitis. The average level of Der 1 measured in the bedding of the 202 children in 2016 was 295.8 ng/m2. The levels of Der 1 in the intervention group-but not in the nonintervention group-significantly decreased in 2017 and 2018. The symptoms of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis in the children of intervention group and their families decreased after allergen avoidance practices.Allergen avoidance practices relieved allergic symptoms in school children after the Great East Japan Earthquake.",

Also, the level of PLCE1 was controlled by transfection of its plasmid and shRNA. The inflammatory response in response to PLCE1 overexpression or ablation was analyzed by quantitative PCR and ELISA assay. And the involvement of PKC and NF-κB signal pathway were detected by Immunoblot.In this study, we developed a LPS-induced ALI cell model. We found PLCE1 was upregulated in LPS-induced pneumonia cells and affected cell viability. Also, knockdown of PLCE1 reduced LPS-induced apoptosis of pneumonia cells. In addition, depletion of PLCE1 suppressed LPS-induced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in pneumonia cells. Mechanically, we found depletion of PLCE1 inhibited PKC and NF-κB signal pathway, and therefore alleviated LPS-induced ALI.We therefore thought PLCE1 could serve as a promising drug for ALI.",

    "abstract": "Drug hypersensitivity reaction (DHR) is a common reason for an allergology con- sultation, during which it is not only necessary to gather a thorough medical history, but also to propose and perform diagnostic tests.The aim of the study was to retrospectively assess the patients with a profile of preliminary drug hypersensitivity diagnosis, the usefulness of NSAID hypersensitivity classifica- tion in outpatient practice, and to analyze the results of skin, provocation, and drug tolerance tests performed in Immunology and Allergy Clinic patients.Around 501 medical records of patients referred to the academic allergy outpatient clinic from 2011 to 2019, and had a preliminary drug hypersensitivity diagnosis were analyzed. The diagnostic and drug tolerance tests results carried out in 269 patients of the Clinic from 2009 to 2019 were then evaluated.Among the patients referred due to suspected drug hypersensitivity, the majority (n=338, 67.5%) were believed to be hypersensitive to NSAIDs and antibiotics (n=272, 54.3%). In patients with hypersensitivity to NSAIDs, the mixed pattern was the most prevalent (n=73, 21.6%), followed by NECD (n=64, 18.9%) and NIUA (n=55, 16.3%). The second most common drug causing DHR were the antibiotics, mainly β-lactams (n=160, 58.8%), followed by macrolides (n=35, 12.9%). In hypersensitivity caused due to β-lactams, the delayed form was predominant (n=24, 15%) with manifested skin symptoms (n=74, 46.3%). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (n=21, 42.9%), followed by antibiotics (n=11, 22.5%) were the commonest causes of ana- phylaxis, as reported by 49 patients.The study shows that a majority of patients with suspected drug hypersensitivity can be classified under the hypersensitivity umbrella based on their medical history, which is the basis for further diagnostic process.",

    "abstract": "Background: Asthma is a lung disease that has influenced more than 350 million people worldwide. Airway smooth muscle (ASM) spasm leads to airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and bronchial obstruction, which are clinical manifestations of an asthma attack. Botulinum toxin (BTX) is a bacteria toxin that acts as muscle relaxant and may have therapeutic effects on AHR and asthma. Objective: In this study, the effect of BTX on AHR and related gene expressions was evaluated. Material and Methods: An asthma mice model was developed which was treated with BTX in two ways: intranasally (IN) and via nebulization (N) (0.01, 0.1, and 1 U/mL and 10 U/mL, respectively) on days 25, 27 and 29. AHR was evaluated on days 24, 26, 28, and 30, and gene expressions were evaluated for TrkA, TrkB, M1–M5, α7nAChR, TNF-α, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) proteins. For histopathology of the lungs, perivascular and peribronchial inflammation, production of mucus, and goblet cell hyperplasia were studied. Results: On day 24, treatment with BTX (for all doses) had no significant effect on AHR, but on days 26 and 28, AHR was decreased and this continued up to day 30 for all treated groups. Treatment with BTX had no significant effect on the gene expressions of TrkA, TrkB, M1–M5, α7nAChR, TNF-α, and ERK2 proteins, perivascular inflammation, peribronchial inflammation, hyperplasia of the goblet cell and production of mucus. Besides, mice administered with 10 mg/mL BTX perished. The BTX therapy controlled asthma attacks by decreasing AHR and relaxation of ASMs. Conclusion: However, BTX had no significant effect on airway inflammation and production of mucus. While using BTX, it is necessary to prescribe safe doses in order to prevent adverse reactions.",

    "abstract": "The increased proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) production of airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) are crucial factors in asthma progression. JNJ0966, one of the metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)-specific inhibitors, has been demonstrated to be involved in the progression and development of diversified diseases. Nevertheless, the function of JNJ0966 in ASMCs remains unclear. This study aimed at investigating the effects of JNJ0966 on asthma progression. In our study, the platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) was first utilized to stimulate the cell model for asthma. Results demonstrated that the cell viability of ASMCs was increased by PDGF-BB (0, 10, 20, and 30 ng/mL) in a dose-dependent manner. Further investigation revealed that JNJ0966 inhibited the cell activity and migration ability of PDGF-BB-induced ASMCs. In addition, JNJ0966 relieved ECM deposition in PDGF-BB-induced ASMCs. Finally, through rescue assays, the results showed that overexpression of MMP-9 reversed the inhibitory effects of JNJ0966 on cell viability and ECM deposition in ASMCs. In conclusion, our findings suggested that JNJ0966 inhibited PDGF-BB-induced ASMC proliferation and ECM production by modulating MMP-9. These findings might provide novel insight for the treatment of asthma.",

It is a cross-sectional study conducted with 24 patients with EoE and 17 control patients, from June 2015 to June 2018. The histological analyses were performed by a trained pathologist. The protein expression of E-cadherin and FLG in oesophageal biopsy fragments was determined using an immunohistochemical technique. The epidemiological data were retrieved from medical records. There were no statistical differences in age and sex between case-patients and control patients. Food allergy was significantly higher in patients with EoE, as was the number of eosinophils present in the oesophageal biopsy materials. The immunohistochemical studies did not indicate FLG expression in any patient from the two groups. E-cadherin showed significantly reduced expression in patients with EoE. We concluded that FLG did not seem to play an important role in the mucosal alteration in EoE and that E-cadherin under expression could be a promising marker of epithelial damage in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Wenyang Pingchuan Formula (WPCF) is an empirical formula for the treatment of acute childhood asthma. However, the \"time-effect\" relationship of this prescription is not clear. This paper explores the relationship between Janus activated kinase signal transducer and activator of transcriptions (JAK/STAT), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and microRNA (miR-19a), and also preliminarily determines the best time-effect relationship of WPCF in reducing the airway inflammation in asthmatic mice.80 BALB/c mice were randomly divided into four groups: control (CON) group, model (MDL) group, dexamethasone (DEX) group, and WPCF group. MDL group was established through intraperitoneal injection of 10% ovalbumin (OVA) and Al(OH)3 solution and the inhalation of aerosolized 5% OVA solution. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), real-time PCR and Western blot were conducted to determine the levels of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), contents of miR-19a mRNA and STAT6, phosphorylated signal transducers and activators of transcription 6 (p-STAT6), p65, phosphorylated p65 (p-p65), suppressors of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), and tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein-3 (Tnfaip3) proteins after 7 and 28 days of intervention respectively.Significant down-regulation of IL-4 and IL-13 expression (P<0.05) and up-regulation of IFN-γ expression (P<0.05) in BALF have been observed for WPCF group compared with the MDL group. The significant down-regulation of miR-19a mRNA and STAT6, p-STAT6, p65, p-p65 proteins (P<0.05) and up-regulation of SOCS1 and Tnfaip3 proteins (P<0.05) in BALF was also observed for WPCF group compared to the MDL group. During the experiment, the weight of the mice in DEX group significantly decreased (P<0.05) compared with the other groups.WPCF could restore Th1/Th2 balance. The longer the intervention time, the more effective the treatment. The down-regulation of miR-19a mRNA by activating JAK/STAT and NF-κB signal pathways may be a possible mechanism by which WPCF alleviates airway inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Chronic inflammation in the airway passage leads to the clinical syndrome of pediatric asthma. Allergic reactions caused by bacterial, viral, and fungal infection lead to the immune dis-balance which primes T helper cells (Th2), a specific cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) T cell differentiation. This favors the Th2-specific response by activating the inter-leukin 4/interleukin 13 (IL-4/IL-13) cytokine signaling and further activates the secretion of immunoglobulin E (IgE). IL-13 develops bronchial asthma by elevating bronchial hyperresponsiveness and enables production of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgE. The present study aims to target IL-13 signaling using molecular docking and understanding molecular dynamic simulation (MDS) to propose a compelling candidate to treat asthma. We developed a library of available allergic drugs (n=20) and checked the binding affinity against IL-13 protein (3BPN.pdb) through molecular docking and confirmed the best pose binding energy of -3.84 and -3.71 for epinephrine and guaifenesin, respectively. Studying the interaction of hydrogen bonds and Van der Walls, it is estimated that electrostatic energy is sufficient to interact with the active site of the IL-13 and has shown to inhibit inflammatory signaling. These computational results confirm epinephrine and guaifenesin as potential ligands showing potential inhibitory activity for IL-13 signaling. This study also suggests the designing of a new ligand and screening of a large cohort of drugs, in the future, to predict the exact mechanism to control the critical feature of asthma.",

In this study, we analyzed the potential regulatory role of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) on NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in human type II alveolar epithelial cells. In this study, A549 cells were transfected with Nrf2 siRNA and overexpression vectors for 6 h before being induced by TNF-α for 24 h. TNF-α upregulated the expression of NOX1 and Nrf2 in A549 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of Nrf2 could reduce TNF-α-induced NF-κB mRNA and protein expression after transfection with the Nrf2 siRNA vector, and the levels of IL-6, IL-8, ROS, and malondialdehyde (MDA) in TNF-α-induced A549 cells increased, while the level of total antioxidation capability (T-AOC) decreased. On the other hand, the overexpression of Nrf2 decreased the levels of IL-6, IL-8, ROS, and MDA, while increasing T-AOC. The mRNA and protein levels of NOX1 were dramatically increased by TNF-α, while those changes were notably suppressed by Nrf2 overexpression. Further studies demonstrated that Nrf2 suppressed NOX1 transcription by binding to the -1199 to -1189 bp (ATTACACAGCA) region of the NOX1 promoter in TNF-α-stimulated A549 cells. Our study suggests that Nrf2 may bind to and regulate NOX1 expression to antagonize TNF-α-induced inflammatory reaction and oxidative stress in A549 cells.",

The animals were divided into the following four groups: control group, DSS group, DSS+short hairpin (sh)-NC group, and DSS+sh-TRIM8 group. Changes in body weight and disease activity index (DAI) score of mice in all the groups were recorded for 7 days. The animals were executed at the end of the experiment, and the expression of TRIM8 in colon tissue was detected by polymerase chain reaction and Western blot assays. The length of colon was measured, and the histopathological changes in mice colon were examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The expression of pro-inflammatory factors in mice serum and colonic tissue homogenate was detected by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay. The expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway-related proteins in colonic tissues was detected by Western-blot analysis.TRIM8 was highly expressed in the colonic tissues of UC mice. Knockdown of TRIM8 improved DSS-induced weight loss, increased DAI score, shortened colon length, and alleviated colonic injury and inflammation in mice. Western-blot experiments showed that knockdown of TRIM8 inhibited DSS-induced phosphorylation of p65 and nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, alpha (IκBα) protein but increased IκBα expression.Knockdown of TRIM8 inhibits UC injury and inflammatory response caused by DSS. This could be related to the regulation of NF-κB signaling pathway by TRIM8 protein.",

    "abstract": "Background: Very limited information is available on the prevalence and risk factors of asthma in adolescents in Kosovo, and no study has previously addressed the role of Human Development Index (HDI) on asthma in the region. The present study addresses these two issues.Methods: Following the Global Asthma Network (GAN) methodology, a cross-sectional survey, through standardised self-completed questionnaires, was conducted in the following six centres of Kosovo: Ferizaj, Gjakova, Gjilan, Peja, Prishtina and Prizren. Current asthma symptoms (CAS) and severe current asthma symptoms (sCAS) were defined according to the GAN standards. Environmental questionnaire inquired about gender, exercise, screening time, siblings, truck traffic, use of paracetamol, pet ownership, and smoking habits. Height and weight were also measured. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed in each centre along with meta-analyses to summarise the overall effects of each factor in the centres as a whole. Meta-regression of the prevalence rates was calculated using HDI as a moderator.Results: Participation rate was high (80.0–99.9%). Prevalence of CAS ranged from 4.6% to 11.3%, and sCAS from 1.7% to 4.5%. Factors associated with CAS were exercise, computer time, paracetamol use and dog ownership. sCAS was associated with paracetamol use and physical exercise. HDI explained 46% and 80% of prevalence variability of CAS and sCAS between centres, respectively.Conclusions: Prevalence of CAS and sCAS in Kosovo varies highly between centres. This variability is explained partly by HDI. Individual risk factors are common, with some determined inother studies conducted in other regions.",

    "abstract": "Background: Asthma is the most common chronic lung disease among children. International guidelines recommend inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as the first-line daily controller therapy for children with asthma and leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) as the second alternative therapy. Adherence to treatment is the most significant component to optimize the benefits of therapy in asthma. Objective: This study aims to investigate the frequency of drug discontinuation due to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) that affect adherence to treatment in children with asthma or asthma and allergic rhinitis using LTRA or ICS as monotherapy. Methods: The subjects aged 4–18 years with asthma or asthma and allergic rhinitis and using montelukast or ICS as monotherapy were included in the study. They were evaluated in terms of ADRs affecting adherence to treatment in the first and third months of treatment. Results: A total of 468 cases, 356 of whom received montelukast monotherapy and 112 of whom received ICS treatment, with a mean age of 9.10 ± 3.08 (4–17) years, were included in the study. Males constituted 65.6% of the total cases (n = 307). In the first month of follow-up of the cases, it was observed that 4.8% (n = 17) of the patients in the montelukast group could not continue the treatment due to ADR. It was determined that the drug discontinuation rate in the montelukast group in the first month was significantly higher than in the ICS group (P = 0.016), and the risk of drug discontinuation due to ADR in the montelukast group was 1.333 (95% CI, 1.26–1.40) times higher. Conclusions: As a result, it was observed that the drug was discontinued due to ADR at a higher rate in children with asthma who received montelukast monotherapy compared to those who received ICS monotherapy.",

Humans are accidentally infected, and itchy dermatitis is induced when the mites are unable to use birds' blood. The diagnosis is difficult due to the very small size and rapid movement of the mites, which make them hard to spot.A 14-year-old male and his mother were referred to the allergy clinic complaining of a 2-week generalized itchy cutaneous papular lesion, unresponsive to antihista-mines, with the feeling of an insect moving on the surface of the skin. Due to the history of recently hatched pigeons nesting on their balcony and finding very small bugs, diagnosed as D. gallinae, they were instructed to clean the pigeon's nest as the source of these parasites, which successfully solved the problem.Bird mite infestation should be considered in the differential diagnosis of recurrent pruritus and urticaria, refractory to conventional treatments. Physicians should be aware of this mite infestation in approach to any patient with papular urticaria.",

    "abstract": "mRNA vaccines, particularly, have been associated with an increased risk of allergic reactions and rarely anaphylaxis. Although rare, vaccine reactions can cause significant anxiety and fear in the population, leading to indecision and vaccine refusal. This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the role of polyethylene glycol (PEG) sensitivity in vaccination decision-making in pediatric patients at high risk of allergy or with suspected allergic reactions to the first dose of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) vaccine. Seventeen enrolled patients were found to have decreased readiness to receive the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine after developing hypersensitivity to multiple and/or injectable drugs. Skin testing was performed. A basophil activation test with PEG-2000 and 4000 was performed on three patients who were ineligible for skin prick tests. Nine patients with negative tests received the vaccine without complications. One patient had urticarial angioedema despite negative tests. Three patients with positive tests did not agree to desensitization with the mRNA vaccine, and one of them was vaccinated with the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. Four patients recurred despite negative tests. The general recommendation for patients describing severe reactions to drugs, foods, and allergens, such as toxins that do not contain the adjuvants of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, is to be routinely vaccinated with safety precautions. Excipients such as PEG and polysorbate-80 used in COVID-19 vaccines could be potential allergens, but this hypothesis is unclear. The predictive values of these adjuvants for skin testing and in vitro testing are controversial. Further research is needed on the hypersensitivity reactions of adjuvants, the predictive values of skin tests, and etiopathogenesis.",

They were divided into two groups: those with liver dysfunction (n = 54) and without liver dysfunction (n = 276). Comparison analysis showed no significant between-group differences in body mass index and levels of white blood cells, neutrophils, platelets, albumin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, creatine kinase, procalcitonin, creatinine, and urea nitrogen. However, the levels of alanine aminotransferase (175.99 U/L vs 30.55 U/L) and aspartate transaminase (215.96 U/L vs 74.30 U/L) were significantly higher in patients with liver dysfunction compared to those without liver dysfunction. Further analysis showed that pediatric patients with liver dysfunction had a significantly lower percentage of natural killer (NK) cells (6.93% vs 8.71%) and higher mortality rate (22% vs 9%) than those without liver dysfunction.A decrease in serum NK cell levels in pediatric patients with severe adenovirus pneumonia could serve as a marker for monitoring the onset or progression of hepatic damage.",

Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics®, version 27.0.A total of 2254 episodes of urticaria were counted with 98.1% corresponding to acute urticaria (AU). A suspected trigger factor was identified in 51.6% of the episodes, namely infections (27.8%), drugs (9.9%) and food (7.6%). From these episodes, excluding infections, only 59.2% were referred to an Allergy Consultation for further study, with only 18.8% (drug) and 28.3% (food) confirmed as the AU trigger. Of the 43 episodes of chronic urticaria (CU), 79% were referred to consultation, with 23 being diagnosed with chronic spontaneous urticaria, 8 with inducible urticaria and 3 with both entities. Older age (p < 0.001), personal history of atopy (p = 0.019) and angioedema (p = 0.003) were factors associated with CU, while the presence of other accompanying symptoms (p = 0.007) was associated with AU. Older age (OR = 1.2; p < 0.001) and the presence of angioedema (OR = 2.7; p = 0.007) were identified as independent factors for CU.The majority of episodes corresponded to AU. Infections were the main suspected trigger, followed by drugs and food, with an overall confirmation rate ranging from 18 to 30%, highlighting the importance of an allergologic follow-up evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Background: Asthma imposes a heavy burden due to its high prevalence. Forkhead box O4 (FoxO4) proteins participate in the modulation of cell progression. However, the role and mechanism of FoxO4 in asthma remains uncharted. Methods: An allergic asthma model was constructed by the induction of ovalbumin and interleukin (IL)-4 in mice and monocyte/macrophage-like Raw264.7 cells, respectively. The role and mechanism of FoxO4 in asthma was determined by pathological staining, immunofluorescence assay, measurement of inflammatory cells in the blood, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), Western blot analysis, and flow cytometry. Results: Ovalbumin treatment triggered an obvious inflammatory cell infiltration with a prominent increase in F4/80+ cell numbers. The relative messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expressions of FoxO4 were increased in both ovalbumin-induced mice and interleukin-4 (IL-4)-induced Raw264.7 cells. Inhibition of FoxO4 via AS1842856 reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, the number of Periodic Acid Schiff+ (PAS+) goblet cells, the numbers of inflammatory cells in the blood, and the airway resistance in ovalbumin-induced mice. Besides, interference of FoxO4 decreased the number of F4/80+CD206+ cells, and the relative protein expressions of CD163 and Arg1 in vivo and in vitro. Mechanically, suppression of FoxO4 diminished the relative mRNA and protein expressions of LXA4R in both ovalbumin-induced mice and IL-4-induced Raw264.7 cells. Overexpression of LXA4R reversed the outcomes caused by repression of FoxO4, including airway resistance, the number of F4/80+ cells, the proportion of CD206+ cells in ovalbumin-induced mice, and the proportion of F4/80+CD206+ cells in IL-4-induced Raw264.7 cells. Conclusion: FoxO4/LXA4R axis mediated macrophage M2 polarization in allergic asthma.",

Her Urticaria Activity Score 7 was 23 out of 40.Specific immunoglobulin E responses to common food and inhalant allergens were negative. A food-specific IgG antibody test was conducted, and it was mainly elevated for chicken eggs, rye, sweet pepper, gluten, garlic, wheat, and pineapple. Avoiding these foods had a curative effect on the CSU over a 2-month period.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of symptoms of CSU that resolved after identifying and avoiding food items with IgG antibodies.

Methods: A total of 72 patients experiencing acute asthma (acute group), 66 stable asthma patients (stable group), and 60 healthy volunteers (control group) were included in this study. The levels of TIMP-1, COX-2, and Th1–Th2 in patients with acute asthma were measured following treatment with budesonide aerosol inhalation. In addition, the levels of MMP-9, TIMP-1, COX-2 and Th1–Th2 were compared in patients with different severity of acute asthma before and after treatment. Results: The serum levels of MMP-9, TIMP-1, and COX-2 showed an increasing trend in the control, stable, and acute groups, while levels of Th1–Th2 showed a sequential decreasing trend, and the differences were statistically significant. Comparison of lung function indexes among the three groups of patients established a negative correlation between serum MMP-9 and its forced vital capacity% predicted (FEV%pred), TIMP-1, and COX-2, and FEV%pred and forced expiratory volume in 1 s–forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) levels, but a positive correlation between Th1–Th2 and FEV1/FVC levels in the acute group. A significant difference was observed on comparing the levels of serum MMP-9, TIMP-1, COX-2, and Th1–Th2 in patients with different conditions in the acute group.

Omalizumab (OMZ) has been used in patients (10–20%) who have too severe/frequent allergic reactions (AR) to continue OIT, to reduce these reactions. In this study, it was aimed to compare two groups of patients who completed OIT with and without OMZ and to seek determinants predicting the need of this treatment. It was also aimed to share the clinical findings regarding the long-term use of OMZ and the withdrawal process. Forty-one patients were started OIT and 93% could be desensitized. Two groups were similar in means of demographic characteristics, and clinical and laboratory findings. The patients who needed OMZ during OIT had also lower reaction doses during oral challenge (p = 0.037). Higher AR rate in this group declined after starting OMZ (p &lt; 0.001). The injection intervals of OMZ were gradually extended. Most patients were able to discontinue OMZ (81%). There were no severe reactions during drug withdrawal attempts. The low reaction thresholds during oral food challenge may give a clue about OMZ requirement during OIT. It may be an option to start the treatment before OIT if reaction was seen in the first few steps of the oral food challenge. For the sake of safety, extension of injection intervals should be preferred instead of abruptly stopping OMZ.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To explore the role of Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX-1) in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated inflammation and oxidative stress of BEAS-2B cell line and clarify the underlying mechanism. Methods: LPS-stimulated BEAS-2B cells were used as a cell model of sepsis-stimulated acute lung injury (ALI). Immunoblot and quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were used to detect the expression of YBX-1 in LPS-stimulated BEAS-2B cells. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide, TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling, and immunoblot assays were conducted to determine the effects of YBX-1 on cell survival. JC-1 staining and adenosine triphosphate production were used to detect the effects of YBX-1 on mitochondrial function. Immunostaining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent serologic assay were performed to examine the effects of YBX-1 on the inflammation and oxidative stress of cells. Immunoblot assay was conducted to confirm the mechanism. Results: YBX-1 was lowly expressed in LPS-stimulated BEAS-2B cells and enhanced the survival of LPS-stimulated lung epithelial cells. In addition, YBX-1 improved mitochondrial function of LPS-stimulated BEAS-2B cells. YBX-1 inhibited the inflammation and oxidative stress of LPS-stimulated BEAS-2B cells. Mechanically, YBX-1 inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) axis, thereby alleviating sepsis-stimulated ALI. Conclusion: YBX-1 alleviated inflammation and oxidative stress of LPS-stimulated BEAS-2B cells via MAPK axis.",

    "abstract": "Background: Allergen-specific immunotherapy is a potentially disease-modifying therapy that is effective for the treatment of patients with allergic diseases. Although the pain caused by the administration of subcutaneous immunotherapy with allergens (SCITA) is considered to be minimal, no studies assessing that pain for the treatment of only pediatric patients have been reported. Objectives: This research aimed to evaluate the pain associated with SCITA for pediatric patients followed at our Immunoallergology Department. Methods: During four consecutive weeks, the nurse who administered the injection completed a questionnaire recording the child’s assessment of the pain associated with SCITA; these questionnaires were randomized before any analyses were done. Two different pain evaluation scales were used, with the choice of scale being determined based on the child’s age: the self-reporting faces scale (score: 0–10; 5 to 8 years old) and the numeric scale (score: 0–10; &gt;8 years old). Demographic and clinical data, as well as any adverse reactions, were documented. Results: We included 46 pediatric patients (mean age: 12.3 ± 2.6 years; 69.5% male), most of whom were suffering from rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis and undergoing subcutaneous immunotherapy with mites. Seven local adverse reactions were recorded, and all were mild. Ten patients did not mention any pain associated with SCITA. Of the 36 patients who mentioned some pain, 33 mentioned mild pain (scores between 1 and 3); only three mentioned moderate pain (scores between 4 and 6). For both scales, the median score obtained was 1. The maximum pain reported had a score of 6. No significant differences were observed between different groups of patients. Conclusions: In this study, SCITA was shown to be a mildly painful procedure that is associated with only a few local reactions. Therefore, SCITA should be considered as a safe option for the treatment of most pediatric patients suffering from allergies.",

The efficacy of an antibody response to infections and vaccines is underpinned by T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, activating an immunoglobulin class switch recombination, somatic hypermutations, and affinity maturation.To determine the formation of the Tfh cells in antibody deficient children and to define their importance as prognostic markers helpful in defining the severity of hypogammaglobulinemia.We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 200 children aged from 2 months to 10 years, in whom hypogammaglobulinemia was assessed, from January to December 2019. In all the children studied, a flow cytometric analysis of the Tfh cell compartment was performed.In young infants aged from 2 to 9 months, the mean relative frequency of the Tfh population was lower than in the control population. Concomitantly, the relative values of Tfh cells, corresponding with the 95th percentile, were below the reference values in all age groups.A deficiency of Tfh cells in young infants mirrors the immaturity of the humoral immune response, whereas in older children Tfh cells are proposed as a prognostic marker facilitating to distinguish between mild hypogammaglobulinemia and the developing common variable immunodeficiency.",

However, none of them have been validated by a prospective study. Such a study is not easy to carry out, because even the children who most of us would certainly believe to be suffering from acute FPIES, possibly serious, should be subject to oral food challenge (OFC). Moreover, the presence of different phenotypes of the acute FPIES may mean that some of them do not fit into any of the above criteria panels. Particularly, Vazquez-Ortiz et al. reported that milder cases (1/4 in their Southern European cohort) might not be captured by the 2017 Consensus diagnostic criteria, which are the most shared till date. Those authors, as well as all interested researchers, claim for accurate diagnostic bio-markers which, however, are not available at the moment.",

Chronic cough, that is, cough persisting for more than 4 weeks, has a proven negative impact on a child’s quality of life; it interferes with daily activities, sleep, and schooling and may involve frequent health care visits and long-lasting treatments. Currently, there is a plethora of algorithms in the literature aiming to assist in the assessment of chronic cough in children; however, referring to complex flowcharts may be impractical for the usually busy primary care physician. Herein, we provide a simplified tool for the assessment of children with chronic cough in the primary care setting, presenting a basic approach to the most common causes along with hints to avoid common pitfalls in everyday practice. Finally, the most common clinical scenarios are analyzed, aiming to assist primary care physicians in providing the appropriate care to these patients.",

Our objective was to study the evolution of wheezing in a cohort of children followed up to 9–10 years of age and its rela-tionship with different perinatal risk factors.Methods: A longitudinal study was made on the evolution of wheezing, over time, in 1164 chil-dren from Salamanca (Spain) included in the International Study of Wheezing in Infants, when the children were 12 months old. They were classified into three phenotypes: transient early wheezing (last episode before 3 years of age), early persistent wheezing (start before 3 years age and persisting thereafter), and late-onset wheezing (first episode after 3 years of age). Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to establish associations between the different phenotypes and perinatal factors.Results: Data were obtained corresponding to a total of 531 children. Of these, 169 (31.8%) had experienced transient early wheezing, 100 (18.8%) early persistent wheezing, 28 (5.3%) late-onset wheezing, and 234 (44.1%) had never experienced wheezing. Cesarean delivery, early exposure to infections, the presence of atopic eczema, and a smoking father were asso-ciated with transient early wheezing. Early persistent wheezing was associated with a family history of allergy, smoking, and obstetric diseases. Exclusive breastfeeding was identified as a protective factor in both transient and persistent early wheezing. Late-onset wheezing was associated with the male gender and with maternal history of rhinitis and eczema. Conclusions: Wheezing phenotypes were associated with different risk perinatal factors. Knowledge in the field is essential in order to influence the modifiable factors.",

Theexacerbation of these systems results in decreased circulating levels of kallikrein and conversionof bradykinin. In addition, thrombophilia is related to the deficiency of methylenetetrahydrofolatereductase (MTHFR) enzyme, causing an increase in homocysteine, accumulationof atheromatous plaques, and arterial and venous thrombosis. The association of these conditionsin related systems brings greater clinical risks to the patient. We report a female patient,aged 23 years, with HAE and homozygous MTHFR mutation, G2A1, carrier of HAE with crisessince early childhood. The first pregnancy terminated with abortion due to gestational sacdetachment. In the second pregnancy, at 5.1 weeks, she had bleeding and partial detachmentof gestational sac. Thrombophilia tests confirmed homozygosity for the MTHFR enzyme. At thebeginning of gestation, she had attacks of angioedema treated with fresh plasma, and at oneoccasion, she received treatment with a plasma-derived C1-INH esterase. During breastfeeding,she received prophylaxis with plasma-derived C1-INHdp. The course of HAE during pregnancyworsened. There are studies that discuss the occurrence of abortion due to attacks ofangioedema. The patient’s disease was associated with a homozygous MTHFR mutation, whichprobably caused the miscarriage. The control of both clinical situations is important for thesuccess of pregnancy, so a combined action plan between obstetricians and HAE treatmentspecialists is essential.",

This study aimed to evaluate the bioequivalence of fexofenadine and montelukast in a fixed-dose combination tablet versus the components administered simultaneously.Materials and Methods: An open, randomized, 2×2 crossover study was performed in 78 healthy volunteers. Fexofenadine–montelukast tablets containing 120 mg and 10 mg, respectively, were used as the test treatment, and 120 mg fexofenadine tablets and 10 mg montelukast tablets were used as the reference treatment. Concentrations of fexofenadine and montelukast in plasma were determined by protein precipitation and analysis by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.Results: The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) obtained for fexofenadine were 87.612–102.144 for area under the curve of the plasma concentration after administration to the last concentration (AUC0-t), 88.471–102.282 for the AUC of the plasma concentration extrapolated to infinity (AUC0–∞), and 91.413–108.544 for the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax). For montelukast, they were 96.418–108.416 for AUC0-t, 93.273–106.642 for AUC0-∞ and 94.749–110.178 for Cmax. The ratio and CIs of the values subjected to logarithmic transformation for each parameter were within the range of acceptability of 80%–125%, demonstrating the bioequivalence of the combined fixed-dose tablet to the components administered separately at the same doses. No adverse events were recorded during the study.Conclusions: This study has shown the bioequivalence of the combined fixed-dose tablet, which may be considered a new alternative for the treatment of allergic rhinitis.",

Mutations of the filaggrin gene (FLG) cause a loss of filaggrin protein. These mutations are seen in 50% of atopic dermatitis (AD). The aim of the study was to investigate the polymorphisms and mutations of the FLG in Iranian children with AD.This project was a case-controlled study with 25 children diagnosed with AD as the case group and 25 healthy children as the control group. Demographic data, clinical manifestations, and filaggrin single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and mutations were recorded. Blood samples were collected for the immunoglobulin E (IgE) assay and complete blood count tests.We found a significant association between the presence of polymorphism (rs66831674) and patients' age, and polymorphism (rs41267154) and early onset of AD. We found no significant differences between the FLG polymorphisms with respect to the severity of AD, ethnicity, concurrent allergic diseases, eosinophilia, and IgE serum levels.Interestingly, FLG variants (rs66831674 and rs41267154) were associated with age and early onset of AD. However, additional studies are required to confirm these results on a large scale of Iranian population. Moreover, establishing a cohort prospective study is suggested to assess the progression of other atopic disorders based on FLG polymorphisms.",

    "abstract": "Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a global health problem: its prevalence is 23% in Europe, although it is underestimated because as many as 45% of the cases remain undiagnosed. Globally, almost 500 million people suffer from AR, which shows its increasing incidences. The diagnostic course of AR is based on clinical history, supported by anterior rhinoscopy. This inspects the anterior part of the nasal cavity accompanied by allergic sensitivity tests (cutaneous allergic skin tests or specific immunoglobulin E levels). The availability of standardised diagnostic proceduresis able to provide objective evaluations of inflammatory situation, and the degree of nasal obstruction may give an advantage in reducing the risk of underestimating the diagnosis of AR. Diagnostic tests with a high level of accuracy are able to provide immediate results, which can sustain the doctor in diagnostic–therapeutic framework. The development of Point of Care Tests (POCTs) could be a useful tool. Considering that nasal obstruction is the mostcommon symptom in patients with AR, the rhinomanometry (RM) test is the most indicated objective evaluation for nasal obstruction. Several studies have also shown the practicability of such diagnostic techniques applied in children. So far, no study has evaluated whether all the applicable requirements are fulfilled by RM in order to be considered as a POCT. The purpose of this perspective was to assess whether all the POCT requirements are fulfilled by RM by conducting a narrative review of the existing literature in which RM has been used in the diagnosis and management of AR in children. A few but encouraging results of studies on children supported the potential use of RM in the area of POCT. However, costs of instruments and the training of personnel involved remain to be explored. The studies support the potential use of RM in POCTs.",

The test has not been evaluated outside Europe. This is a cross-sectional study conducted at 11 pediatric allergy centers to evaluate PhInf as an allergic disease screening method in Brazilian children. Children as controls and patients (aged 6 months–18 years) were grouped according to their primary disease and age group. PhInf and specific serum IgE (sIgE) screening was performed for Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (DP), cat and dog epithelia, a mix of grasses and pollens, eggs, cow’s milk, peanuts, and shrimp. Values ≥ 0.35 kUA/L (or PAU/L) were considered positive. A total of 470 children and adolescents, which included 385 patients and 85 controls, participated in the study (47.7% boys, average age: 6.3 years). In all, 72.6% of the participants had positive PhInf test (n = 341), with a higher proportion of those having food allergy (92.6%), atopic dermatitis (91.9%), and those aged &gt;13 years having allergy (95%). The PhInf and sIgE agreement between patients (Kappa = 0.94, P &lt; 0.001) and controls (Kappa = 0.84, P &lt; 0.001) was high. PhInf and DP agreement in patients aged &gt;13 years was excellent (Kappa = 0.936, P &lt; 0.001). Compared with sIgE dosage, PhInf had high sensitivity (97%) and specificity (93%). Positivity of PhInf test in this population was high and had an excellent correlation with the allergens comprising the panel. It is a useful method for screening children suspected of having allergic diseases in a non-European country.",

There is a need for the development of novel medications to treat this ailment. Isoorientin is a naturally occurring flavonoid that possesses antioxidant, anti--inflammatory, and various other advantageous characteristics. However, its potential effects on AR remain unclear. This study evaluates the therapeutic effects of isoorientin on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic rhinitis (AR) in mice and explores the underlying mechanism. Our study revealed that isoorientin administration effectively decreased the frequency of nose rubbing and sneezing in AR mice. The groups treated with isoorientin showed a significant decrease in serum levels of IgE and histamine, with reductions of 40% and 30%, respectively. Isoorientin ameliorated inflammation of the nasal mucosa and restored the Th1/Th2 balance. In addition, isoorientin inhibited the activation of the NF-κB pathway in nasal tissues. In summary, Isoorientin alleviates OVA-stimulated AR in mice by restoring Th1/Th2 balance and blocking the NF-κB pathway. Thus, isoorientin exhibits promise as a natural therapeutic agent for allergic rhinitis.",

    "abstract": "Background: Early home intervention for asthma exacerbation (AE) in children is associated with more favorable outcomes. Inhaled short-acting beta2 agonists (SABA) are the cornerstones of AE treatment. Objectives: We aimed to determine what proportion of parents administered salbutamol to their children to treat asthma exacerbation at home, and the factors affecting the decision to administer the medication. Additionally, we also aimed to examine the parents’ level of knowledge regarding salbutamol use. Methods: Asthma patients who were admitted to pediatric allergy outpatient clinics due to AE were included in the study. Parents’ knowledge related to home salbutamol use was evaluated using a questionnaire. Modified Pulmonary Index Score was used to evaluate AE severity. Results: The study included 177 children (64.4% males) with a median age of 6.16 years. Of these, 86 patients (48.6%) had not administered salbutamol before hospital admission, and parents of 69 (80%) patients stated that they knew salbutamol should be administered but they did not want to administer it without consulting a doctor. Of the 91 patients who had used salbutamol before hospital admission, 28 (30.7%) had administered the incorrect dose, 2 (2.2%) used the incorrect technique, and 9 (9.9%) had the incorrect dose and incorrect technique. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, history of hospitalizations (odds ratio [OR]: 6.35; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.07–13.9; P &lt; 0.001), history of more than five exacerbations (OR: 4.51, 95%CI: 1.94–10.48; P &lt; 0.001 ), and presence of sputum (OR: 2.54; 95%CI: 1.10–5.87; P = 0.028) were the main predictors of salbutamol use. Conclusion: Asthma patients and their parents should be better educated and actively encouraged on the use of SABA at home during an AE.",

    "abstract": "Background: Allergies to fungi, such as Alternaria alternata, are significant contributors to respiratory conditions like asthma and rhinitis. Immunotherapy with native A. alternata extracts often results in high rates of adverse reactions. This study evaluates the safety of immunotherapy using glutaraldehyde-polymerized A. alternata extracts in both pediatric and adult populations. Methods: This observational real-world study involved 738 patients (435 children and 303 adults) monosensitized to A. alternata or polysensitized together to other allergens. Patients received personalized immunotherapy containing polymerized A. alternata extract, either alone or in combination with other polymerized allergens. The concentration of each polymerized allergen in the therapeutic vaccine was 10,000 TU/mL. Side reactions were classified and recorded based on immediate and delayed onset, and their severity was graded according to the EAACI guidelines. Results: All side reactions were expected and related to the intrinsic properties of allergens. The number of injections administered was 7392, with 4137 to children and 3255 to adults. Thirteen relevant local reactions (0.24% in children, 0.09% in adults) and seven systemic reactions (0.09% overall) were observed. Systemic reactions included mild to moderate symptoms, such as mild bronchospasm and rhinitis. Severe reactions were not reported. Conclusion: Immunotherapy with glutaraldehyde-polymerized A. alternata, alone or in combination with other polymerized allergens, is safe and well-tolerated in both children and adults. The polymerized extracts allow for higher concentrations and faster administration schedules, providing an effective treatment option for patients with fungal allergies, including those polysensitized to multiple allergens.",

Microembolization can lead to obstruction of the coronary microvessels and result in the micro-infarction of the heart. The inflammation and elevated expression of the tumor necrosis factor in cardiomyocytes and the activation of extracellular ERK are involved in initiating the inflammatory response mechanism. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is the enriched pathway, and for controlling, inhibition of PI3K/Akt is necessary. Furthermore, the release of cytokines and the activation of inflammasomes contribute to the enhancement of vascular permeability, which results in edema within the myocardium. The immune response and inflammation represent the primary triggers in this process. The ability to control immune response and inflammation reactions may lead to the development of new therapies for microembolization.",

DDX3Y gene encodes an RNA helicase belonging to the DEAD-box protein family and is part of the DDX3 subfamily that affects the progression of multiple diseases. However, the specific role and mechanisms of DDX3Y in AR remain unclear. This study investigates the effects of DDX3Y knockdown on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced AR in mice. We found that DDX3Y is highly expressed in the nasal mucosa of AR mice. Knockdown of DDX3Y in OVA-induced AR mice significantly alleviated nasal manifestations, reduced immunoglobulin E and histamine levels, and improved nasal mucosal histopathology. Additionally, knockdown of DDX3Y suppressed secretion of inflammatory factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) phosphorylation, thereby mitigating local inflammatory responses. These findings suggested that targeting DDX3Y could offer a novel therapeutic strategy for managing AR by modulating the NF-κB pathway.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: We aimed to investigate the frequency and sociodemographic and clinical distinguishing features of asthmatic patients in whom long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) were added to maintenance therapy in our clinic. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, data on sociodemographic, phenotypic, and clinical characteristics of patients with asthma using Steps 4 and 5 medications, who were followed up in our center for at least 1 year, were obtained from file records. Whether the patients received add-on LAMA for at least 6 months was also noted. Results: A total of 279 patients with asthma using Steps 4 and 5 medications (female/male: 215/64) with a mean age of 50.84 ± 12.42 years were included in the study. Seventy-nine (28.3%) patients (female/male: 60/19) with a mean age of 52.45 ± 11.61 years used LAMA as an add-on treatment; 28 (37.8%) at Step 4 and 51 (24.8%) at Step 5. In Steps 4 and 5, there was no difference in terms of age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, being allergic or eosinophilic, phenotype, and asthma onset between patients with and without add-on LAMA. Asthma control in the previous year was better, and minimum forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) was lower in patients with LAMA than in those without in Step 4 (P = 0.001 and P = 0.030, respectively). In Step 5, the rate of being well-controlled was higher in those without add-on LAMA (P &lt; 0.001). The number of exacerbations in the previous year was higher, and minimum and maximum FEV1 were lower in patients with add-on LAMA (P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively). Conclusion: Our study showed that add-on LAMA treatment was effective in increasing asthma control in patients using Step 4 medication independent of baseline characteristics and asthma phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Bronchial asthma (BA) is a serious problem affecting the quality of life of patients. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in BA. This study set out to investigate expressions of PVT1/miR-423-5p in the serum of BA patients and its clinical value on BA diagnosis and evaluation. This study included the same number (N = 100) of patients with BA at remission (BA-R), BA at exacerbation (BA-E), and healthy controls. PVT1 level was increased in BA-R and BA-E patients, and PVT1 level was higher in BA-E patients than BA-R patients. miR-141-3p targeted PVT1. miR-423-5p was downregulated in the serum of BA patients and was negatively correlated with PVT1. Area under ROC curve of PVT1/miR-423-5p axis on BA-R patients was 0.837 with sensitivity 0.74, specificity 0.84, while that of BA-E was 0.974 with sensitivity 0.87 and specificity 0.95. PVT1/miR-423-5p axis was negatively correlated with FEV1/FVC, FEV1% pred, and IL-10, and positively correlated with IgE, TNF-α, and IL-6. PVT1 and PVT1/miR-423-5p axis were associated with increased severity while miR-423-5p axis was negatively associated with BA severity. In conclusion, increased levels of PVT1/miR-423-5p had higher diagnostic efficiency on BA patients, especially patients with acute exacerbation.",

    "abstract": "Background: No studies are comparing the impact of the add-on leukotriene-receptor antagonist (LTRA) with a step-up dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in partly controlled asthma patients with asthma control test (ACT) score ˂ 23. Objective: To study the effect of LTRA add-on therapy in comparison to a step-up to medium dose of ICS in partially controlled asthma. Methods: An open-labeled randomized controlled trial was conducted in asthma subjects with partly controlled asthma who had been in regular receipt of low dose ICS. All subjects were assessed for asthma using ACT, daytime and nighttime symptoms, rate of relievers used, spirometry, and impulse oscillometry (IOS) at 3 and 6 months. Subjects were randomized to receive daily oral LTRA 10 mg or step-up medium dose of ICS. Results: Between June 2020 and January 2021, 50 participants were enrolled, all patients completing the study. After treatment, mean ACT scores were increased to more than 23 indicating well-controlled asthma in both groups, control being sustained throughout the whole 6-month study period (P ˂ 0.001). Within each group, ACT scores were improved by a minimal clinical important difference (MCID) ≥ 3 points at 6 months, compared to baseline values. There were significant decreases in nighttime and daytime symptoms, and the numbers of rescue relievers used in 4 weeks in both groups compared to baseline (P ˂ 0.001). Conclusions: LTRA add-on therapy in partially controlled asthma patients is comparable with step-up to medium dose of ICS/LABA as regards asthma control.",

    "abstract": "Nonatopic asthmatic patients generally have more severe clinical manifestations, frequently accompanied by chronic sinusitis and nasal polyps, with more limited therapeutic options as compared to atopic asthmatic patients. This has led to a search for novel therapeutic approaches, including omalizumab, for nonatopic asthmatic patients who are not adequately controlled with current therapies.In this retrospective study undertaken between August 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021, at a tertiary allergy clinic, data from 61 patients with nonatopic asthma inadequately controlled with optimum therapy was examined.A total of 61 patients with severe asthma were included in the study [Female: 48 (78.7%), male: 13 (21.3%, mean age: 49 (18-71) years]. The mean duration of asthma was 60 (18-160) months. A statistically significant increase in Forced expiratory volume (FEV1per second), forced vital capacity (FVC), and asthma control test (ACT) scores were found after 1 year of omalizumab treatment (p ˂ 0.001, for all parameters). Omalizumab treatment was associated with a significant decrease in the number of asthma exacerbations, asthma-related hospitalizations, duration of hospitalizations, and several unplanned emergency room visits after 1 year (p ˂ 0.001, for all parameters). A 1-year treatment with omalizumab led to significant changes in eosinophil counts and serum IgE levels (p ˂ 0.001 and ˂ 0.001, respectively).In the severe atopic asthma patient group, omalizumab treatment provided similar clinical benefits to those observed in patients with severe atopic asthma, suggesting that it may be a useful therapeutic option in patients with nonatopic asthma who failed to benefit from treatments with steps 4 and 5.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a clinical syndrome characterized by IgE-mediated inflammation of the nasal mucosa. The present study investigates the quality of life (QoL) with AR among adults, using widely validated questionnaires, unlike in pediatric patients. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional descriptive observational study was conducted, analyzing the QoL of 102 children with AR aged between 10-15 years, belonging to two health centers (HC) in Zaragoza and two HC in Coruña. The comparison of means between the two groups is carried out using the Student's test or the Mann-Whitney test, considering a value of p˂0.05 to be significant. Results: Around 102 children were studied, with a majority (59.8%) being male and a mean age of 12 years. Around 76.5% have a family history of atopy. It was found that AR is more prevalent in Zaragoza (p ˂0.005), and asthmais highly prevalent in Coruña (p ˂0.001). The most important sensitizations are pollen in Zaragoza (p ˂0.05) and dust mites in A Coruña (p ˂0.001). More treatment needs and associated comorbidities (p˂0.05) were observed in A Coruña. The results of the ESPRINT-15 show that 63% of the patients have a good QoL, 27% fair, and 8.8%, poor. Those sensitized to mites have a worse score (p = 0.02). It was found that 52% of children experienced improvement during home confinement, with no notable differences between the two populations. The use of the mask favored QoL in patients from Zaragoza (p ˂0.001). Conclusion: It was concluded that AR influences the QoL in pediatric patients. Greater QoL involvement, need for treatment, and comorbidities are observed in patients sensitized to dust mites compared to those sensitized to pollens. It was also observed that masks improved the symptoms, stopping patients being sensitized to pollens.",

    "abstract": "It is as fact that dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) regulates the T cell activation, pro-allergic response, and inflammation to engage with the pathogenesis of asthma, but its clinical role in children with asthma is unclear. The present study aimed to explore the expression of DUSP1, its association with exacerbation risk, severity, and inflammatory cytokines in children with asthma.Around 52 children with asthma-exacerbation, 50 children in asthma-remission, and 50 healthy children were chosen for the study. The serum levels of DUSP1, as well as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-17 were detected by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The levels of DUSP1 was the highest in healthy children (median (IQR)=34.305 (25.892- 43.693) ng/mL), the second highest in children in asthma-remission (median (IQR)=21.471 (18.581-27.934) ng/mL), and the lowest in children with asthma-exacerbation (median (IQR)=13.982 (7.901-21.624) ng/mL) (P<0.001). At the same time, DUSP1 was also related to decreased asthma risk with area under curve (AUC) (95%CI) of 0.847 (0.780-0.914), and correlated with its lower exacerbation risk with AUC (95%CI) of 0.755 (0.661-0.849). Besides, DUSP1 was negatively linked with exacerbation severity (rs =-0.338, P=0.014), immunoglobulin E (rs =-0.277, P=0.047), TNF-α (rs =-0.423, P=0.002), IL-1β (rs =-0.389, P=0.004), and IL-17 (rs =-0.293, P=0.035), but not related with other disease features in children with asthma-exacerbation. Meanwhile, DUSP1 was only negatively associated with TNF-α (rs=-0.300, P=0.034) and IL-1β (rs =-0.309, P=0.029) in children in asthma-remission. However, no correlation was found in DUSP1 with inflammatory cytokines or other disease features in healthy children (all P>0.05).DUSP1 reflects the reduced exacerbation risk, and associates with lower exacerbation severity and inflammatory cytokines in children with asthma-exacerbation; it also associates with inflammatory cytokines in children in asthma-remission. These findings suggest that DUSP1 may help to improve the management of asthmatic children.",

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder that causes chronic airway disease. In addition to genetic factors, environmental factors may affect the clinical phenotype of CF. In this study, the presence of aeroallergen sensitivity in our patients with CF and its effects on clinical findings are evaluated.In this study, patients included were diagnosed with CF and followed in the Pediatric Respiratory and Allergy Clinic of the Faculty of Medicine, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey. Demographic characteristics, clinical and laboratory findings, skin prick test (SPT) results, and modified Shwachman-Kulczycki (MSK) scores of the patients were evaluated.We evaluated 51 patients with CF with a median age of 10 (6-18) years. The mean MSK score of the patients was 72.54±11.50, and the mean predictive value of forced expiratory volume (FEV1) in the initial (1st) second was 80.43±19.50. According to SPT, aeroallergen sensitivity was detected in 17 (33.3%) patients. The prevalence of bacterial colonization and bronchiectasis was higher, and MSK scores were lower in Aspergillus fumigatus (AF)-sensitive patients (P ≤ 0.01). However, no similar difference was found in other allergen sensitivities. MSK scores (P = 0.001) and predictive FEV1 values (P = 0.005) of 25 (49%) patients with bacterial colonization were significantly lower than those without colonization.Aeroallergen sensitivity was detected in approximately one-third of CF patients. Although it has been emphasized in studies that environmental factors may have an impact on lung functions and clinical conditions in CF, the effect of allergens other than AF sensitivity may be less important compared to other environmental factors, such as the presence of bacterial colonization.",

    "abstract": "For the first time 15 years ago, tablet allergen immunotherapy (T-AIT) formulations were approved by regulatory agencies for treating allergic rhinitis caused by grass pollen in adults and children aged &gt;5 years. Extensive evidences existed about effectiveness and safety of AIT. However, the safety profile is particularly compelling in children. Generally, T-AIT causes local reactions, mostly in the oral cavity, that are usually mild-to-moderate and often self-resolving. However, systemic allergic reactions are also observed with T-AIT, anaphylaxis representing the most fearsome adverse event, considering that it occurs in subjects treated for allergic rhinitis. Therefore, we conducted a literature search of patients reporting anaphylaxis because of T-AIT. Nine cases of anaphylactic reactions were reported in literature. Notably, no death was reported using T-AIT. This outcome was very important as it underscored the substantial safety of T-AIT. However, T-AIT deserves careful attention, mainly in the pediatric population. In this regard, after the first report of anaphylactic reaction at the first administration of T-AIT, manufacturers recommended that the first dose should be administered in a medical facility in the presence of staff with experience in managing anaphylaxis and the patient should be observed for at least 30 min. Interestingly, reported anaphylactic reactions were due to grass pollen extracts, with no report concerning other allergen extracts. However, it is relevant to note that anaphylactic reactions because of T-AIT are not reported in recent years.",

    "abstract": "Background: Chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disease characterized by a breakdown of immune tolerance; in ITP, the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys platelets. This study aims to investigate the role and underlying mechanisms of FOXP3 in chronic ITP. Methods: Flow cytometry was used to detect the proportion of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in CD4+CD25+ T lymphocytes from 20 patients with chronic ITP (CITP), 20 acute ITP (AITP) controls, and 20 healthy individuals. CD4+CD25+ Treg cells were isolated from peripheral blood of patients with CITP using magnetic beads and then treated with phosphate-buffered saline solution or decitabine (a methylation inhibitor) for 48 h. The levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-10, and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) in the plasma and CD4+CD25+ Treg cells were assessed by Enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). FOXP3 level was measured by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) was adopted to detect the status of FOXP3 methylation. Results: The number of Treg cells and the contents of IL-2, IL-10, and TGF-β1 decreased in patients with CITP, compared to the AITP control group and normal group. FOXP3 expression was reduced and FOXP3 methylation increased in patients with CITP, compared to the AITP control group and normal group. Hypermethylation of FOXP3 promoter led to decrease in FOXP3 level in Treg cells. Inhibition of FOXP3 promoter hypermethylation promoted the secretion of IL-2, IL-10, and TGF-β1 in Treg cells. Conclusion: The number of Treg cells in CITP patients decreased, and the hypermethylation of FOXP3 promoter led to reduction of its expression in Treg cells, thus affecting the immune functioning of Treg cells.",

Guanine nucleotide-binding -protein-like 3 (GNL3) mediates cell proliferation and apoptosis in several cancers, but its role in LUAD remains unclear. Objective: To explore the expression and function of Guanine nucleotide-binding protein-like 3 (GNL3) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and its potential mechanism in inhibiting the growth of LUAD cells. Methods: We evaluated the expression of GNL3 in LUAD tissues and its association with patient prognosis using databases and immunohistochemistry. Cell proliferation was assessed by CCK-8 assay as well as colony formation, while apoptosis was evaluated by FCM. The effect of GNL3 knockdown on the Wnt/β-catenin axis was investigated by Immunoblot analysis. Results: GNL3 is overexpressed in LUAD tissues and is correlated with poor prognosis. Knockdown of GNL3 significantly inhibited the growth as well as induced apoptosis in A549 as well as H1299 cells. Furthermore, we found that the inhibitory effect of GNL3 knockdown on LUAD cell growth is associated with the downregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin axis. Conclusion: GNL3 is key in the progression of LUAD by metiating Wnt/β-catenin axis. Targeting GNL3 may represent a novel therapeutic method for LUAD treatment.",

Systematic review and meta-analysis on the outcomes and risk of asthma for people with COVID-19 was done by searching electronic databases between 1 December 2019 and 31 July 2023. A total of 48 studies from 27 countries spread across all continents were included in the review. The prevalence of asthma among COVID-19 patients was 7.9%, and the analysis demonstrated a 16.5% reduction in the risk ratio for acquiring COVID-19 among subjects with asthma compared to those without asthma. There was no statistically significant difference in hospitalization risk, ICU admission risk, and death risk for COVID-19 patients with no asthma compared to those with asthma. The risk of death from COVID-19 was similar between nonasthmatics and asthmatics. The findings indicated that subjects with asthma may be at a lower risk of having infection with COVID-19 compared to those without asthma, but they have a similar risk of hospitalization and mortality.",

Euroglyphus maynei, belongs to the family Pyroglyphidae (subfamily: “Pyroglyphinae”) and its main allergenic protein is Eur m1, a source of sensitization. Sensitization to D. pteronyssinus and D. farinae is assessed through skin tests, while sensitization to E. maynei is assessed less frequently. Objective: This experimental work aims to analyze the prevalence of sensitization to E. maynei in patients with respiratory allergies treated at M. Albanesi Allergy and Immunology Unit in Bari, Italy, and the sequence homology of major allergenic proteins of E. maynei with D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus was analyzed. Methods: In this real-life study, 65 patients were enrolled. In particular, patients with respiratory allergy were subjected to skin prick tests for common respiratory allergens, including Euroglyphus maynei. The sequence homology analysis was performed between the major allergenic proteins of E. maynei and those of D. pteronyssinus and D. farinae. Results: Sensitization to E. maynei accounts for 41.5% of patients. All patients with E. maynei sensitization had concomitant sensitization to D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus. The analysis of sequence homology of Der p1 and Der f1 proteins with the sequence of Eur m1 protein demonstrated an identity of 84.4% and 86%, respectively. Conclusions: Nearly 50% of house dust mites-sensitized patients have a concomitant sensitization to E. maynei. The cross-sensitization could be due to Der f1, Der p1, and Eur m1 similarity.",

This was compared to the use of conventional diagnoses in pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients with rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis and/or allergic asthma, sensitized to three or more pollen allergens of different botanical species. Methods: A multicenter, prospective, observational study was conducted in patients aged 3–25 years who received care at the Allergology service of 14 hospitals in Catalonia from 2017 to 2020. Allergology diagnosis was established based on the patient’s clinical assessment and the results of the skin prick test and specific immunoglobulin E assays. Subsequently, molecular diagnosis was conducted using ImmunoCAPTM ISAC® 112 to recombinant and/or purified allergen components. Results: A total of 109 patients were included; 35 (32.1%) were pediatric patients and 74 (67.9%) were adolescents or young adults (mean age: 18 years), with 58.0% being females. A change of 51.0% was observed in SIT prescription following molecular etiological diagnosis by means of a multi-parameter microarray.

    "abstract": "Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response that can result in cardiac insufficiency or heart failure known as septic myocardial injury. A previous study identified OLFM4 as an important gene in sepsis through bioinformatics analysis. However, there is limited research on the regulatory functions of OLFM4 in sepsis-triggered myocardial injury, and the related molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, the protein expression of OLFM4 was found to be significantly elevated in LPS-stimulated H9C2 cells, and its suppression enhanced cell proliferation and reduced cell apoptosis in LPS-triggered H9C2 cells. The inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β were increased after LPS treatment, and these effects were mitigated after silencing OLFM4. Moreover, it was confirmed that inhibition of OLFM4 attenuated the NF-κB signaling pathway. In conclusion, the knockdown of OLFM4 protected cardiomyocytes from sepsis by inhibiting apoptosis and inflammatory responses via the NF-κB pathway. These findings provide important insights into the regulatory functions of OLFM4 in the progression of septic myocardial injury.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate systematically the association between TBX21 gene polymorphisms (rs17250932, rs2240017, and rs4794067) and the risk of autoimmune diseases in Asian populations. Methods: The Medline, Web of Science, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database were used to retrieve eligible studies that were published before July 2020. Pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated by using the dominant model, heterozygote contrast model, and allelic contrast model. Publication bias was evaluated using contour-enhanced funnel plots and Egger’s regression test. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the robustness of this meta-analysis.Results: A total of 12 eligible studies, including 3834 patients and 4824 healthy controls, were recruited in this meta-analysis. The pooled data demonstrated that TBX21 rs2240017 and rs4794067 polymorphisms were significantly associated with the risk of autoimmune diseases in Asian populations in allelic contrast model (OR: 1.456, 95% CI: 1.131–1.875, P = 0.004; OR: 0.766, 95% CI: 0.615–0.954, P = 0.017), heterozygote comparison model (OR: 1.647, 95% CI: 1.239–2.189, P = 0.001; OR: 0.796, 95% CI: 0.634–0.999, P = 0.049), and dominant model (OR: 1.572, 95% CI: 1.194–2.071, P = 0.004; OR: 0.767, 95% CI: 0.607–0.970, P = 0.027). The G allele of rs2240017 may be a risk factor for autoimmune diseases, and the T allele of rs4794067 may increase the risk of autoimmune diseases. However, we failed to find evidence of the association between TBX21 rs17250932 polymorphism and susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. No publication bias was established in this meta-analysis.Conclusion: This meta-analysis indicated that TBX21 rs2240017 and rs4794067 polymorphism confer susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, but not rs17250932.",

    "abstract": "Introduction and objectives: The relationship between allergic diseases and behavioural dis-orders is still unclear. The objective of this study was to describe and compare children’s behaviour (internalising and externalising) across a sample of children aged 6–11 years with and without allergic diseases. Materials and methods: This was a cross-sectional observational case-control study. A survey to 366 families (194 allergic cases and 172 controls), including a child behaviour checklist (CBCL) and a socio-demographic questionnaire with questions related to family, school education, health conditions and allergy symptoms, was administered. Results: Children with a diagnosis of allergy showed higher scores in the overall CBCL score (standardised mean differences [SMD] = 0.47; confidence intervals [CI]: 0.26–0.68) and in the internalising and externalising factors (SMD = 0.52 and SMD = 0.36, respectively) than non-allergic children. Odds ratio (OR) analyses showed a higher risk (OR = 2.76; 95% CI [1.61 to 4.72]) of developing a behavioural difficulty in children diagnosed with allergies. Age and level of asthma appear as modulatory variables. Conclusions: Children aged 6–11 years diagnosed with allergies showed larger behavioural problems than non-allergic children, especially in the case of internalising behaviours. These findings suggest the importance of attending to them and treating them in the early stages of diagnosis to avoid future psychological disorders.",

    "abstract": "The Preschool Asthma Risk Factor Scale (PS-ARFS) is a tool that enables clinicians to assess environmental exposure of preschool children, history of parental asthma, and dietary habits. The objective of this study was to evaluate the PS-ARFS ability to predict asthma diagnosis and respiratory symptoms 1 year after baseline assessment and improve the scale if necessary.A prospective cohort study conducted between November 2018 and March 2019 in three Lebanese schools (from three different Lebanese Governorates) enrolled 515 preschool children aged 3-5 years. Parents completed a detailed questionnaire sent with their children (Phase 1; T0). All parents who participated in Phase 1 were invited to take the same survey by telephone (Phase 2; T1), 1 year later. The interview was conducted by one study-independent person. Of the total sample, 141 (27.4%) children were lost to follow-up.Higher odds of asthma diagnosis at 1 year were significantly associated with playing outside (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.958) and having a heating system in the bedroom (aOR = 6.986) at baseline, but inversely associated with the female gender (aOR = 0.365). Based on those results, the improved PS-ARFS-I was generated. A higher PS-ARFS-I at T0 was significantly associated with higher odds of asthma at T1 (aOR = 1.08; p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.10); similar results were obtained with the longer PS-ARFS (aOR = 1.079; p < 0.001; 95% CI 1.050-1.109). Moreover, among non-asthmatic children at baseline, the PS-ARFS score predicted wheezing and cough at T1 but not bronchial secretions; the PS-ARFS-I score at baseline did not predict symptoms at T1.This study shows that the PS-ARFS-I and PS-ARFS could predict diagnosed asthma at 1-year follow-up. The PS-ARFS predicted respiratory symptoms (wheezing and cough) after 1 year among non-asthmatic children at baseline, suggesting that a score based on risk factors, measured early on, can predict better later symptoms and disease.",

Secondary objectives were Paediatric Asthma/Caregiver´s Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ/PACQLQ) Asthma Control Test (ACT), Visual Analogue Scale global assessment of allergic disease (VAS), use of resources and immunological response. All variables were compared during the pollen season (April-June) without (2015) and with (2016) immunotherapy.Forty patients were included in the study of which 29 patients were assigned to the perennial and 11 to the pre-co-seasonal schedule. During 2016 pollen season a significant improvement in the PRQLQ/AdolRQLQ, PAQLQ/AdolAQLQ, ACT and VAS score were observed both in perennial and pre-co-seasonal schedule group. No significant differences were seen between treatment schedules for PRQLQ/AdolRQLQ, PAQLQ/AdolAQLQ and ACT scores comparing both pollen seasons. A significant increase in sIgG4 and reduction in the number of rescue medications used and number of patients who needed visit to any specialist was observed in both treatment schedules during 2016 pollen season. No relevant differences were found in the safety profile of any treatment schedule.Treatment with undiluted mixture of a depigmented-polymerized Grass/Olea europaea allergen immunotherapy has proven to be effective both using a perennial and a pre-co-seasonal schedule and therefore suitable for polyallergic patients.",

    "abstract": "Introduction and objectives: Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a subset of primary immunodeficiency diseases caused by a hereditary deficiency of the adaptive immune system. Mutation in recombination activating gene (RAG) is known as the underlying genetic cause of SCID. RAG protein plays a pivotal role in V(D)J recombination which is the main process to assemble lymphocyte antigen receptors during T- and B-cell development. The patients are characterized by recurrent infections, failure to thrive, chronic diarrhea, and fever, in early infancy. Herein, we present a case of SCID with rare neurological manifestations affected by a mutation in RAG1.Patients and methods: The patient was a 15-month-old infant born to a consanguineous family. She was presented with neurological abnormalities including facial nerve palsy, seizure, and decreased consciousness. Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based primary immunodeficiency disease (PID)-gene panel screen and Sanger sequencing were performed to identify the genetic mutation.Results: We found a novel homozygous missense mutation in RAG1, c.1210C&gt;T,p.Arg404Trp, which was predicted to be deleterious (combined annotation dependent depletion, CADD score of 27.4). Both parents were heterozygous carriers for this mutation. According to her laboratory data, both T cell and B cell numbers were decreased and the patient was diagnosed as RAG1- SCID.Conclusions: SCID is a pediatric emergency with a variety of manifestations in infants. Therefore, accurate diagnosis importantly in the case of rare manifestations must be considered in these patients. Our findings point toward the importance of genetic assessment for early diagnosis and timely treatment of this disorder.",

Objective: This case report highlights the importance of having a high degree of suspicion to reach a correct diagnosis. Materials and methods: We report an unusual case of FPIES due to zucchini. During the follow-up. Two oral food challenges (OFC) were carried out to evaluate tolerance to the food involved. Results: The first OFC was positive and in the second the child tolerated the food without problems. Conclusions: In this case, the OFC was essential to identify the offending food and to verify that the child had overcome the disease.",

    "abstract": "Background: MicroRNA (miR)-185-5p participates in the pathology of asthma by regulating immune imbalance, inflammation, periostin synthesis, and smooth muscle contraction. This study intended to explore the dysregulation of miR-185p and its correlation with T-helper (Th)1, Th2 cells, and inflammatory cytokines in childhood asthma. Methods: In 150 childhood asthma patients and 30 healthy controls (HCs), miR-185-5p from peripheral blood mononuclear cells was detected using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Th cells from peripheral blood samples were detected using flow cytometry, inflammatory cytokines from serum samples were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: MiR-185-5p was increased in childhood asthma patients versus HCs [median (inter-quartile range (IQR)): 2.315 (1.770–3.855) versus 1.005 (0.655–1.520)] (P &lt; 0.001). Meanwhile, miR-185-5p was negatively associated with Th1 cells (P = 0.035) but positively correlated with Th2 cells (P = 0.006) and IL-4 (P = 0.003) in childhood asthma patients; however, miR-185-5p was not linked to Th1 cells, Th2 cells, IFN-γ, or IL-4 in HCs (all P &gt; 0.05). In addition, miR-185-5p was positively related to TNF-α (P &lt; 0.001), IL-1β (P = 0.015), and IL-6 (P = 0.008) in childhood asthma patients, miR-185-5p was only linked to TNF-α (P = 0.040) but not IL-1β or IL-6 (both P &gt; 0.05) in HCs. Moreover, miR-185-5p was increased in exacerbated childhood asthma patients versus remissive patients [median (IQR): 3.170 (2.070–4.905) versus 1.900 (1.525–2.615)] (P &lt; 0.001). Besides, miR-185-5p was highest in patients with severe exacerbation followed by patients with moderate exacerbation, and lowest in patients with mild exacerbation (P = 0.010). Conclusion: MiR-185-5p is associated with imbalanced Th1/Th2 cells, increased inflammatory cytokines along with elevated exacerbation risk, and severity in childhood asthma patients.",

This study aimed to investigate the relation of L-asp activity and anti-L-asp antibody with anaphylaxis risk and non-anaphylaxis adverse reaction risk in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who underwent PEG-asp contained therapy.In total, 170 childhood ALL patients underwent PEG-asp-contained treatment and their L-asp activity and anti-L-asp antibody were detected on the 7th day after treatment initiation.There were 27 (15.9%) patients who had PEG-asp-related adverse reaction: 17 (10.0%) patients experienced PEG-asp-related anaphylaxis and 14 (8.2%) patients experienced PEG- asp-related non-anaphylaxis adverse reaction. Moreover, L-asp activity was negatively related to anti-L-asp antibody in childhood ALL patients (P<0.001). Elevated L-asp activity was associated with the absence of PEG-asp-related anaphylaxis (P<0.001), PEG-asp-related non-anaphylaxis adverse reaction (P=0.004), and PEG-asp-related adverse reaction (P<0.001). However, the anti- L-asp antibody displayed opposite trend similar to L-asp activity. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses exhibited L-asp activity and anti-L-asp antibody exhibited superior predictive values in estimating PEG-asp-related anaphylaxis risk with area under curve (AUC) of 0.955 and 0.905, respectively compared to PEG-asp-related non-anaphylaxis adverse reaction risk with AUC of 0.730 and 0.675, respectively. Besides, patients with de novo disease, higher risk stratification, and allergic history showed trends linked with PEG-asp-related anaphylaxis risk.The monitoring of L-asp activity and anti-L-asp antibody maybe useful for early estimation and prevention of PEG-asp-related anaphylaxis in childhood ALL management.",

Immunohistochemical method (ICH) and flow cytometry method (FCM) were used to detect CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and explore the regulation effect of KS on the immune status of the organism. The expression status of eotaxin tissue was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), ICH, and western blotting method. The survival rates of HaCaT cell and Fibroblasts affected by KS were detected by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) method. The inhibitory effect of KS on eotaxin produced by HaCaT cell and FBs induced by TNF-α and interleukin (IL)-4 were evaluated using RT-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods. The inhibitory effect of KS on nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and Signal transducers and activators of transcription 6 (STAT6) activation induced by TNF-α and IL-4 was detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and western blotting methods.We confirmed that KS shows favorable therapeutic effect on CD, which can obviously inhibit eotaxin expression and Eosinophils recruitment in allergic skin of mouse, as well as regulate the immune status of the organism. Furthermore, KS and its main effective components can inhibit TNF-α and IL-4 induced upregulation of eotaxin via the two signal transduction pathways, NF-κB and STAT6.The great importance of traditional Chinese recipe KS is evidenced by its therapeutic effect and mechanism in ACD of mouse.",

They formed the groups: RAD (AR + asthma; clinical treatment, RME); RAC (AR + asthma; clinical treatment, no RME); and D (mouth breathers; RME only). RAD and RAC patients received topical nasal corticosteroid and/or systemic H1 antihistamine (continuous use) and environmental exposure control. All were evaluated before RME (T1) and 6 months after (T2) with the CARATkids score, acoustic rhinometry, and nasal cavity computed tomography (CT). Patients RAD and D underwent RME (Hyrax® orthopedic appliance).A significant reduction in the CARATkids score occurred in the RAD (-4.06; p < 0.05), similarly when patient and parent/guardian scores were evaluated (-3.28 and -3.16, respectively). Acoustic rhinometry (V5) showed increased nasal volume in all groups, significantly higher in RAD patients than in RAC and D (0.99 × 0.71 × 0.69 cm3, respectively). CT of the nasal cavity documented increased volume in all three groups, with no significant differences between them.In MB patients with AR, asthma, and maxillary atresia, RME increased nasal cavity volume and improved respiratory symptoms.

    "abstract": "Objective: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that can occur at any age. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of food allergy on disease severity as well as clinical/laboratory findings in children with AD. Methods: Clinical and laboratory data of AD patients evaluated for food allergy between January 2021 and December 2022 were examined retrospectively. Results: Of the 52 patients evaluated, 32 (61.5%) were males, with a median age of 6 months (2–118 months). Among them, 26 (50%) had food allergies (FA) and five (9.6%) had inhalant allergen sensitivity. No significant difference in AD severity was observed between patients with and without FA. However, the FA group showed higher serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (343.3 ± 81.5 U/L vs 297.7 ± 77.4 U/L; P = 0.011) and lower red cell distribution width (RDW). Inhalant allergen sensitivity was associated with higher AD severity. Conclusion: While guidelines recommend investigating food allergies in moderate to severe AD, this study found no significant difference in the relationship between AD severity and the presence of FA. However, inhalant allergen sensitivity was linked to increased AD severity. Therefore, a comprehensive patient history should include an evaluation of food allergies in children with AD, regardless of disease severity. Elimination and provocation tests related to suspected food items should be performed, and allergenic foods should be removed from the diet if they are found to contribute to the allergy.",

Clinically, its symptoms are similar to hereditary angioedema (HAE) with hereditary C1-INH deficiency. Both conditions have the potential to cause upper airway obstruction, which can be fatal in clinical practice and thus require intense attention. Here, we'd like to discuss the clinical presentation, diagnosis and follow up of a special case of AAE associated with monoclonal gammopathies of unknown significance (MGUS) with recurrent upper airway obstruction. The patient was regularly followed up after being discharged from our ward. Measurements of C3-C4 levels were carried out by a hematological test. Due to the rarity of such a disease, especially in Chinese people, relevant diagnosis methods are missing in this patient, so the patient was only diagnosed with AAE-C1-INH associated with MGUS clinically. The latest follow up showed that he still underwent recurrent upper airway obstruction; thus, he remained in a tracheostomy state due to a lack of proper medication prophylaxis and died eventually. This unusual case reminds emergency physicians to pay attention to such disease during clinical practice, and relevant diagnosis method should be improved.",

Methods: The back skin of C57BL/6 mice was smeared with IMquimod (IMQ) cream for 7 days to induce psoriasis. Immunoblot kit was used to detect the deacetylase activity of SIRT1 (member of sirtuin family). Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to assess the degree of psoriasis in mouse. Flow cytometry assays were performed to confirm effects on Th1/Th17 cell differentiation. Enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assays were used to detect the level of secreted cytokines. Results: LARP7 upregulated SIRT1 deacetylase activity. LARP7 alleviated psoriasis symptoms in mice by upregulating SIRT1 deacetylase activity. In addition, LARP7 regulated Th1/Th17 cell differentiation in psoriatic mice. We further found that LARP7 inhibited Th1/Th17 cytokine.

    "abstract": "Introduction: The frequency of visits to emergency department for asthma is a significant public health problem in pediatrics. This study aimed to identify the characteristics of children who visited the pediatric emergency department for asthma exacerbation and evaluated their therapeutic management prior to admission. Methods: A prospective study was conducted over a 6-month period in the pediatric emergency departments of five hospitals involving children aged 1–16 years admitted to the department with a clinical diagnosis of asthma exacerbation. Results: In all, 143 patients were enrolled in the study. Asthma episodes were moderate to severe in 69.2% of cases (n = 99). Initial treatment prior to admission to the emergency department was adequate in only 17.5% of cases (n = 25). Hospitalization for more than 24 h occurred in 18.2% (n = 26) patients. In children aged &lt;3 years, viral infection was present in 91.4% cases (n = 64) and exacerbations were more severe in younger patients (P = 0.002) and children belonging to low-income stratum (P = 0.025). Only 17.4% (n = 25) were positive for SARS–CoV-2 (antigen test or polymerase chain reaction test), suggesting that the involvement of traditional respiratory viruses in asthma exacerbation continued even during pandemic. Regarding the pre-hospital care, 70.6% (n = 101) had received prior treatment, but this treatment was inadequate in 53.1% cases (n = 76). Conclusion: This study showed that asthmatic children and their families had little knowledge about the disease and that physicians must be sufficiently aware of current recommendations for managing asthmatic children. Admission to the emergency department for asthma could be avoided partially by better diagnosis and therapeutic education.",

    "abstract": "Background: Little evidence is available about psychological stressors in Lebanese asthmatic adolescents, where health-risk behaviors are a serious threat to public health. In addition, the COVID-19 epidemic has had a substantial influence on adolescents’ mental health globally, especially in Lebanon, where the ongoing economic and political challenges have largely impacted their psychological well-being. This study aimed to explore the association of asthma and the COVID-19 infection with behaviors among Lebanese adolescents. Methods: Data were collected in July 2023, using the snowball sampling technique. Inclusion criteria for participation in the study included being of a resident and citizen of Lebanon and aged 12–18 years. Behavioral problems were assessed using the Youth Self-Report (YSR) scale, which yields nine subscales (anxious/depressed, withdrawn/depressed, somatic complaints, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, rule-breaking behavior, aggressive behavior, and other problems) and a total score. Results: Asthma was significantly associated with somatic complaints (Beta [β] = 2.98), attention problems (β = 0.01), and other behavioral problems (β = 0.68). Having contracted the COVID-19 infection, compared to healthy asymptomatic state (β = 1.55), was significantly associated with more anxious behaviors. In the case of stratifying the analysis in terms of gender, the results showed that the presence of asthma was significantly associated with more social behaviors (β = 3.31), thought problems (β = 2.91), attention problems (β = 0.02), other behavioral problems (β = 1.71), and total behavioral problems (β = 5.71) in males. In case stratifying the analysis as to school type, the presence of asthma was significantly associated with more somatic complaints (β = 2.77) in participants from private schools whereas it was significantly associated with more total behavioral problems (total YSR scores) (β = 5.05) in participants from public schools. Conclusion: It is confirmed that asthma and psychiatric disorders are interconnected, so it would be of great importance to include screening through a psychological intervention in treating asthmatic adolescents by means of (1) recognizing factors affecting patients’ mental health, and (2) regulating uncontrolled behaviors that can exacerbate symptoms in order to avoid the future morbidity.",

Fluorescence microscope was used to evaluate successful injection. The expression of HPV16-E7 protein was detected by Western blotting test. The levels of CD4+ and CD8+ were determined by flow cytometry, and the ratio was calculated. The proliferation of splenic lymphocytes was detected by MTT assay. Expression of Interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) messenger RNA (mRNA) in lymphocyte was determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).Fluorescence microscope determined the successful injection of HPV16-E7 lentivirus. Compared with model group, RFT treatment decreased HPV16-E7 protein, and increased CD4+/CD8+ ratio and the proliferation activity of splenic lymphocytes. Besides, RFT treatment increased the mRNA expression levels of IL-2 and IFN-γ compared to the model group. In particular, the proliferation activity of spleen lymphocytes and the expression levels of IL-2 mRNA and IFN-γ mRNA in RFT were higher at 12 days than at 6 days after treatment.RFT could eliminate HPV16-E7 lentivirus infection in the reproductive tract of mice, and the mechanism was related to the immune system.",

    "abstract": "Airborne pollen is a major contributor to allergic respiratory diseases. However, the literature on patterns and seasonality of specific pollen types mainly comes from northern hemisphere and developed regions, limiting our ability to extrapolate these findings to other geographical locations. With this research letter, our aim is to contribute to the current knowledge of aerobiology by analyzing the decade-long patterns of airborne tree pollen in the city of Bahia Blanca, Argentina. In general, we found late winter to early spring as the period with the highest Cupressaceae pollen counts. In 2020, the average pollen count during July through September was 78.81 (SD 79.70), the highest recorded during the last 10 years. These months had varying pollen concentrations from moderate (15-89 grains/m3 of air) to high (90-1499 grains/m3 of air). Regardless of such variation, August had consistently been the month with the highest peak concentrations from 2010 to 2020 (61.2, SD 57.3), followed by September (27.1, SD 20.3). We did not find any month with very high (˃1500 grains/m3 of air) peak concentration. Further studies need to be done to expand our knowledge on aerobiology to characterize specific pollen sub-types and determine the exact allergenic potential of airborne pollen in different regions.",

    "abstract": "Omenn syndrome (OS) is a very rare type of severe combined immunodeficiencies manifested with erythroderma, eosinophilia, hepatosplenomegaly, lymph-adenopathy, and elevated level of serum IgE. OS is inherited with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Germline mutations in the human RAG1 gene cause OS.In this study, we investigated a 2-month-old boy with cough, mild anaemia, pneumonia, immunodeficiency, repeated infection, feeding difficulties, hepatomegaly, growth retardation, and heart failure. Parents of the proband were phenotypically normal.Karyotype analysis and chromosomal microarray analysis found no chromosomal structural abnormalities (46, XY) and no pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs) in the proband. Whole-exome sequencing identified a novel homozygous single nucleotide deletion (c.2662delC) in exon 2 of the RAG1 gene in the proband. Sanger sequencing confirmed that both the proband parents were carrying this variant in a heterozygous state. This variant was not identified in two elder sisters and one elder brother of the proband and in the 100 ethnically matched normal healthy individuals. This novel homozygous deletion (c.2662delC) leads to the frameshift, which finally results in the formation of the truncated protein (p.Leu888Phefs*3) V(D)J recombination-activating protein 1 with 890 amino acids compared with the wildtype V(D)J recombination-activating protein 1 of 1043 amino acids. Hence, it is a loss-of-function variant.Our present study expands the mutational spectrum of the RAG1 gene associated with OS. We also strongly suggested the importance of whole-exome sequencing for the genetic screening of patients with OS.",

    "abstract": "Childhood asthma has become a serious public health problem. Obesity has been determined to be one of the risk factors of asthma.We aimed to determine the difference in body mass index (BMI) and sleep quality in pediatric asthmatic individuals compared to their peers.Thirty children aged 8-17 years were followed up in the Pediatric Outpatient Clinic for asthma along with 30 healthy children. The BMI percentile values of the children were recorded. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to assess sleep quality.Each group in our study had 10 girls and 20 boys. The mean age was found to be 11.76 ± 2.69 years in asthma group and 11.33 ± 2.29 years in the healthy group. The asthma group were found to be more obese than the healthy group (P = 0.033). There was a significant difference between groups interested in a sport (P = 0.028) and sleep quality (P = 0.007).It was observed that the asthma group had more obesity and poorer sleep quality than the healthy group. Further, it was determined that in the asthma group, the level of interest in any sport was less than that in the healthy group. We think that high obesity in the asthma group reduces the effect of corticosteroids, and the continuity of nighttime cough symptoms causes deterioration in sleep quality. We conclude that participation in sports activities should be encouraged to reduce the level of obesity in asthmatic children.",

The present study was conducted to investigate the possible presence of undiagnosed asthma in the general population of children living in a rural area of Japan.Methods: The participants comprised 120 fourth graders aged 9–10 years (boys/girls: 63/57) attending five elementary schools in Yawatahama, Ehime, Japan. All the children underwent respiratory function tests and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) measurements. Based on the results of a questionnaire, the children were also categorized into groups depending on their allergic diseases.The authors assessed the results of both the respiratory function tests and the FeNO measurements for children who were classified into the nonallergic group.Results: A total of 76 (63%) children, who completed the tests appropriately, were included in the analysis. According to the report, among the 24 children in the nonallergic group, six (25%) showed abnormalities in respiratory tests. One had an abnormal % forced vital capacity (%FVC; &lt;80%), three had abnormalities in both forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1)/FVC (&lt;80%) and % maximal mid-expiratory flow (&lt;65%), three had concave flow–volume curves, and one had a high FeNO measurement (41 ppb).Conclusion: A certain proportion of Japanese elementary school children, categorized as having no allergy, showed respiratory function test abnormalities. A follow-up study is needed to determine the prognosis and outcomes of the children with these abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "Background: Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare primary immunodeficiency. Infections of the lungs, skin, lymph nodes, and liver are the hallmark of CGD with frequent initial manifestations of the disease. The aim of the present study was to describe the sites of infections and their causative agents in 38 CGD pediatric patients.Methods: This was a retrospective single-center cohort study comprising CGD patients, and followed for over last 40 years at the Allergy and Immunology Unit of a tertiary hospital in São Paulo, Brazil. Sites of infections and their causative agents were described.Results: A total of 38 patients were included (36 males and 2 females). Median age at the onset of symptoms was 45 days (7 days–7 years) and that at the time of diagnosis was 23 months (1 month–12 years); 31.6% of the parents reported death of relatives during childhood and 21% (8 cases) had another male family member with CDG. The most common infections were pneumonia (81.6%), skin infections (50.0%), adenitis (42.1%), and liver abscess (23.7%). In all, 188 cultures were positive (85.6% for bacteria and 14.4% for fungi). The most prevalent bacterial agents were Staphylococcus sp. (12.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.2%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.3%). Aspergillus sp. and Candida sp. were 56% and 22.2% of the isolated fungi, respectively. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated in 5.6% and Mycobacterium bovis in 0.9% (only in 1 patient) of cultures. Conclusion: Staphylococcus sp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Aspergillus sp. were the most frequent agents in this cohort. M. tuberculosis should be considered in endemic areas. Detection of infectious agents drives to find adequate treatment and benefits the evolution of patients with CGD.",
